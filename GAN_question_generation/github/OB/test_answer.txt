E' l'ennesimo bug di SQL Developer. Risolto reinstallandolo.
Thanks for that Joacim.  I've now updated the UGS software.  (I had previously done a 'Check for Updates' which had come back empty).  One file attached.   [tree right final pass.nc.zip](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/files/2277572/tree.right.final.pass.nc.zip) 
IH, I send you de complete code, and the foto of the project, sorry my english is poor. I'm good in C language but i can make a mistake!  2014-03-31 10:03 GMT+01:00 Matthijs Kooijman notifications@github.com:  > How are LUGARES-contador and LUGARES declared?

@ntherning not sure if the message was directed at me or @ashleyj there, but I don't really know why the bug is happening. If the problem is that we're trying to add everything on the classpath to the `classes1.jar`, and that includes itself, you can take a look at the classpath and include only the files you're seeing right now I guess. Or take a look at the files and their sizes, and if any of them changes while creating the jar, bail out.  As an example, doing `zip test.zip . -r` doesn't show that behavior, so there are definitely things that can be done.  If the issue is some other thing, then I don't know :smile:   As I said, I don't think it's very concerning if this is the only case in which you get that behavior. 
 no
Hi Serge,  I just try and it fail in the same way using "SELECT SLEEP(100)". I launch the query and click cancel, then it wait 100 second and the query result appear. It seems that it's not cancelling the request.  Maybe you can try to reproduce it using a docker Vertica instance :   
This one was beside the bar on Mos Le'Harmless, but i assume it's the same for all of them 
Yes, they are read-only as you say.  I didn't check because deleting was not causing an error, the files were just re-appearing.  I'm getting an Access Denied error when trying to remove the Read Only attribute, as per attachment.  Can you merge this into the other bug thread or would you like me to comment there? ![cryptomator read-only file access denied](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19726706/48986552-cf353c00-f16a-11e8-8a96-a61c8d628c6c.jpg)
Hi,  Great. Thanks for taking this issue in account.  For the first crash, it is complicated because the Galaxy S5 is on LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2).   This is the only device with which I have this issue.
I've just uploaded another one - same thing. https://commons.wikimedia.org/?curid=52554328 
I ran it with a localhost http server, but you may try with http://www.wikipedia.org, GQuery falls into the same situation. 
Yes,I tried different theme.But this problem exist in all of those situations.In my view,you can change the text color to make it different from the drawer's background color. 
this test was with an creeper but skeleton, zombies and and and dont work too
Removed the playstore app and installed from apk. After the welcome message about alpha status it crashes without allowing to send report or view stack trace. Just says stopped unexpectedly. 
What do you mean, how did I obtain it? I crafted it in my Ars Magica 2 table. Ima going to try craft it on my Thaumcraft table and vanilla table. With and without shiftclicking.  I read somewhere, that sometimes NBT data gets kaput if you shiftclick craft something.  Edit: Confirmed. It's a shift+click crafting issue. I just crafted it "normal". Pulling it out of the finished product grid, and it works. 
Thanks!
umm well it kinda fixed it the first round.. ish. the player came back with no inventory, and then waits.  when the game ends the players ingame inventory get set properly but the one that left + came back was then put into creative mode. when the next game starts all players keep their inventory as well as get gm 1 for the game. when the game ends, all players lose their inventory. hope this helps,  
That would be one possible approach however given how the code is structured in `exec()` I am not sure this is the best way.
I followed pimotte's suggestion and tried to debug the issue, but once I built everything from master branch the issue was gone. Eventually I traced it to some jars in C:\Program Files (x86)\Syncany\lib left from the previous Syncany's installation. Clean install solved the problem completely. 
The version with the issue was 4.2.4.  I few minutes ago, i've build the driver with your commit and tested it in our application. Your bugfix has solved my issue. Thank you very much for your quick response. 
Sure, my personal server is w5castv5k4dhwexj.onion, however it's not open to registration at the moment.  It was a while ago I set it up so I can't remember if I made a root signed CACert for the hidden service, however I know I did so for the non-hidden service and would be surprised if I hadn't. I'll try to check later. 
Unfortunately, at least on my device (Nexus 6 running Android Nougat), I don't have that information. Here are some details, screenshots, and suggestions:  The AP list shows the primary channel and frequency. However, you're right that it shows 80 MHz next to the primary channel in the AP list. That being said, It would be more clear if it did state "CH 155 5775MHz" along with the primary channel. The width indicates the same thing, but unless you already know that an 80 MHz network using a primary channel between 149-161 is always centered on channel 155, then you'd be confused as to why the channel rating page shows all those channels as occupied.  With 40 MHz networks, it also shows the primary channels 5 and 11 (center is 3 and 9, respectively). In this case, even if it did show the center channel, you don't have enough information to know what frequencies are occupied. For example, if it stated "CH 3 2422MHz (40 MHz), you don't know if your primary channel is 1 or 5, since 2422 MHz is the center either way.  As I stated above, showing primary and center or primary and auxiliary is more useful. "CH 5(3)" would make the most sense. Showing auxiliary channels is probably unnecessary. You could have "CH 5+1" although with 5 GHz channels you'd have some monstrosity like "CH 149+153+157+161" for an AP with primary channel 149. "CH 149(155)" shows you the primary and center, which is enough to deduce the rest and it looks cleaner. You could also include a frequency range like "5735 MHz - 5815 MHz" or the center frequency "5775 MHz" along with the width. These are just some possibilities.  It is important to know your primary channel because you can reduce interference if your primary channels are farther apart and the auxiliary channels are overlapping, compared to the opposite situation (1(3) and 11(9) > 5(3) and 7(9)). There are many 20 MHz clients that will not utilize the auxiliary channel (most smartphones will only utilize 20 MHz on a 2.4 GHz network). For them, it's better that APs appear to be on channels 1 and 11 rather than channels 5 and 7.  ![screenshot_20160926-220810](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18857909/c15db250-8435-11e6-8270-da07ea36e5df.png) ![screenshot_20160926-223315](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858348/6965f04a-8439-11e6-90b9-b5740e6b0a3a.png)  The Channel Rating page should show the same number of APs on all 4 channels. Channel 149 should be equivalent to channel 161 because the nearby channel 161 AP is blasting across channel 149 as well. I don't know why channel 165 has a low rating since no AP is interfering with that channel.  The channel ratings for 40 MHz should show the most interference on channels 5-7 because the 5(3) AP blocks channels 1-7 and the 11(9) AP blocks channels 5-13. Channels 5-7 should be derated slightly relative to channels 1-4 because of the additive interference from the distant AP and channels 8 and 9 should be rated equally to 10 and 11 since the distant AP interferes equally on those channels.   ![screenshot_20160926-222427](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858187/1bb2015a-8438-11e6-9e69-e5e62c726f29.png) ![screenshot_20160926-223352](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858347/6964c864-8439-11e6-98ce-ce1936731090.png)  On the Channel Graph, all 5 GHz networks should completely overlap because they are all 80 MHz wide with the only difference being whether they're on channel 149(155) or channel 161(155) (ie. they all occupy the exact same frequencies so the bars should all be going across 149-161).  With 40 MHz networks, the graph appears to be more accurate. However, the bars should be centered over channels 3 and 9 in this case, because those are the center channels.   ![screenshot_20160926-220355](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18857849/3c31c2e2-8435-11e6-8334-5858f4874237.png) ![screenshot_20160926-223403](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858346/696389fe-8439-11e6-9d98-fe9281472e90.png)  I'm basing some of my expectations on wavemon. Wavemon has a lot of information, but obviously it is a CLI program intended for PCs. Maybe tapping on an AP or SSID in the AP List could provide increased details similar to wavemon output. There could also be some advanced display options in the settings menu.  ![screenshot_20160926_231230](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18859062/c5b39ae6-843e-11e6-8898-fa9699502fb5.png)  Hopefully, my suggestions are helpful. I know that some of the non-FOSS WiFi utilities are also lacking in regards to HT/VHT networks. Thanks for taking the time and looking into this. 
Did you try the above steps? The key is having both the system (latest) gcc/clang + conda clang. 
Please see the test case at https://gist.github.com/manderson23/bed77497cd556f24bf77d758ae781455  If fails with the error message I mentioned. If I remove the `//` to exclude `KafkaAutoConfiguration` the test runs.
I created [this](https://github.com/jpsgamboa/VisTest2) test project using `VisTextArea` directly. Again, works well with VisUI provided font files, but breaks using the font files i generate with the provided `default.hiero`.  It only breaks when it finds a `\n` though, but works fine with long strings. This is also true for my lml test.  The error message is a bit different now:    All the raw font files are placed in `assets/raw-font-files`  Note: to run the attached project one must change the working directory to `core/assets`. 
@bf8086     TPC-H(10T) on SparkSQL (4 node(64 vcore 512G MEM).      
This is working now, thank you.  
The latest.log there and the crash right above it.  Yes removing mouse tweaks stops the crash.  I think you will find updating to .22 will stop the issue.  1.14 has been problematic with crashes with forge because it never shows you the stacktrace for the actual mod causing the issue when they are not updated, so you have to get a stable base and add a mod and if it casues some other mod to crash you know that is the one with the problem(the one you added).  Try with my latest release of my pack and add your mod and load it.
It won't double it since TMaster only runs on 1 node, so it would add 1:1 with the number of topologies we run, which is insignificant.  We use a watch on statemanger for the packing plan for a couple of reasons: - The executors need the packing plan and doing RPC with them isn't practical due to their lifecycle. Following the same patter for the TMaster is consistent. - The initial deployment should be able to proceed without a requirement that the deploying user (where the scheduler-as-a-library might run) maintains a connection to the topology for the entire startup phase. So the client puts some state in statemanager and if that succeeds it launches the aurora containers and it's done. From then on the topology can initialize itself. We don't want the production topology to have a dep on the users client, which scheduler<->tmaster RPC would require.
@parrt See the attached file. Maybe I'm just missing out something very simple. It works before the update.  [SimplexLexer.g4.txt](https://github.com/antlr/intellij-plugin-v4/files/662030/SimplexLexer.g4.txt)  
Fixed in v2.2-HF4. Test: - Set autoRefreshScore to something low (i.e. 1 or 2) - Enable timings `/timings on` (Spigot only) - Play with more than 1 online in skyworld for several minutes, and notice whether any lag occurs. - Execute `/timings paste` - Analyze output from uSkyBlock - values in the red (30-40ms) is acceptable, as long as the Pct. is low, values above 100ms will (potentially) introduce server-lag. 
Windows 10 (not 10.1), and I have the latest updates IntelliJ Community 2017.3  It _runs_ just fine both in the command line and IntelliJ, but IntelliJ's debugger throws that error.
it was multiplayer, I havent been able to test it again after a server restart though
Thanks!

> @juliushaertl could you please clarify this? I had no idea there was a limit? What are the rules for label creation?  In my personal experience, if I am in the Deck app in the web environment and I create a new card, the card label will stop accepting input after a 100 characters but the card can be saved.  If I do the same in the Android Deck app, the field will keep accepting input after a 100 characters but this will create problems saving and/or syncing the card.
I edited the MAC address just on the log, didn't want to post the real one. No changes were made in your code.  I'm getting this error when trying to connect to a physical ELM 327 interface connected to an HW emulator. The older version (http://code.google.com/p/android-obd-reader/downloads/list) and other software (i.e. Torque) works fine in this configuration.  Notably, the current version works fine with OBDSim (SW emulator). 
solved the iisue by deleting   androidTest folder in all 
It does happen every time. You did change the behavior of the "Next" button, though, so that might have fixed it. I'll test again with the next beta (so leave the issue open for now — I'll close it if it's gone). 
hi Bartosz,  thanks for looking into that!  please find logs attached. I have enough space (128GB sd card). ![_20170119_174246 jpg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/952468/22128490/d938b26a-de6e-11e6-9943-f1a85fc1e298.jpeg) [currentLog.txt](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/files/717969/currentLog.txt)  Is there anything i can enable/do to trace the application (debug traces?)?  Great application btw, thanks for that!  Thanks.  /Ruslan. 
I will try in a few days (I am on vacation now), but if there really is an issue with setting an adapter without data, please address that as I do that quite a bit in my app. 
So I can not run 2 LT's in the same directory the same moment. Okay, I will stick to one. Slows down the process though.
Shit installing dev version delete weight history?
@ctron  Please read #586  for the different directories. 
Here is the list of plugins we use:  - The Tag Maker - Bitbucket Server Webhook to Jenkins - Pull Request Leaderboard - pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket - Bitbucket Look and Feel Plugin - Bitbucket Server - Auto Unapprove Pull Requests - branchDetails - Commit Graph - Jira Hooks for Stash - Slack notifications for pull request and push activities - Smart Commits for Bitbucket  I see the error only on a specific repository though.
that certainly looks like the skewing i get (tho i can't reproduce it at-will)  Also "glad"? to see it's not just a macOS-sans-GPU-rendering  issue
I think this issue *is* the opened bug.

Hi,  with just these mods there is no issue, so its another mod i guess.  
Aha, it was 'org/mortbay/jetty/mime' the only call using slashed instead of dot notation. The normal java classloader seems not to complain about this. 
Hi! Thank you for your quick reply. I changed the versions to Janus 2.1.0.0-SNAPSHOT in your repos, and it worked like magic. Thank you very much!  Here I attach a screenshot with the version for XText. 2.8.1, it seems. ![about-sarl-development-environment](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/774253/10727033/892c4ac4-7bb5-11e5-88f1-d3e64c6265de.png)  Final POM follows:   
Postgress; Windows 10 It's switching from Auto-Commit to Manual Commit after clicking on "copy to csv"
Then it works fine. 
Sorry, I wasn't quite clear in my original post. There are no exceptions thrown, but the file that should be ignored still triggers a build failure because of formatting issues.  Edit: This is where I'm looking for information: [link](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle#disabling-warnings-and-error-messages)
Well, after I wrote that report we figured out that there was a 'ghost' shell storage. We put down a shell storage and then broke it, got kicked again but the ghost block was gone and the treadmills attached fine. So far, we haven't been able to replicate it.  
If you mean an in-memory map, then that associated would disappear between Overture runs? If the test sequence was held in the results XML, then as long as the results were preserved on file, the individual tests would be re-runnable? Or we could just use a separate serialised file, as you say, but when would you save it? 
No problem.   Here is a test case to reproduce the issue : https://github.com/nboissel/mybatis-issues/commit/5de4a0d9bf089d9b4e597a730180f9cc4350435c  It works fine with 3.2.8 but throw a NPE using any 3.5.1 version.  Best regards,  Nicolas
> Do you have the stack trace for the other thread (tid=62)?  @sjudd   For this specific ANR report, thread 62 is not listed unfortunately, most of the traces stop around threads 30-50. I checked another report and found an very similar stack that did log a Glide thread.  Main thread says "held by thread 43", and here is 43 which is also blocked:    Unfortunately thread 14 is not logged, list goes from 13 and jumps to 15.

@mrtentje  Project: Benchmark (as usual) Mapping: presentation, domain, infrastructure layer -> to their physical counterparts Rules: presentation **is not allowed to use** infrastructure  To say you want to reproduce it... That's the big problem here right? Because I can't find a real cause of the problem. 
Yes, I do.
Hi, I tried it again (the newest version on BApp Store).  I can confirm, that if the reflection happens **only** in the header, no issue is raised = as expected.   When I scan request which has multiple reflection, the first and only highlighted occurrence is the one in the response Header. Is it possible, that this highlight would not be present, as it should be excluded? Also, since there is only a single highlight in such a case, I would automatically miss all the other reflections = other 3 reflections in the Body. Only when I manually search the value can I see there are 4 matches (1 header + 3 body). Is this something which could be fixed as well?
Thanks for the fast fix! Do you want me to test any specific snapshot build or shall I build it from the latest source?   
The name is edgware.  Maybe the problem is that when generating the pocket query I choose 'Run this query once then delete it'? So formally the query generated today morning is still available to download for a few days but has different status?  ![edgware](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3063282/2429125/0353a4e2-ac6d-11e3-8392-4c647e215fff.jpg) 
yes it does.  We have an upcoming 1.18.1 release on Weds which should fix this and a couple of others.
Here is the full query from Kibana.   
hey @rohanKanojia it's hard to reproduce it. Didn't able to capture the logs. I observed Its an issue with https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/blob/master/rt/src/test/java/io/fabric8/maven/rt/VertxHttpBoosterIT.java#L89, where it invoke application rest endpoint and it gets empty/error message response. Right now test wait for application pod to come up but it looks like time for creating route and service may vary. Even though test already has some [delay](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/blob/master/rt/src/test/java/io/fabric8/maven/rt/BaseBoosterIT.java#L386  ) to wait until all resources get prepared. 
@gregestren I checked again, and with version `1.2.0` everything seems to work just fine. Seems like i just missed the release of the newer version by a few hours when reporting 🙈  So i guess it is not relevant anymore as it works in the latest release.  (with using bazelisk) with `1.1.0` i get (as expected): 
I tried wiping the cache this afternoon but ran into the problem again twice already. I will attach new screenshots. 
Here is the BUILD file in my `bazel-website` branch where I am working on this: https://github.com/davidzchen/bazel-website/blob/third-party/BUILD.  I have added the convenience symlinks to the `exclude` list for the glob, but adding any file that begins with `bazel-` would still cause this error to occur.
@sobychacko Thanks, I'm on 1.2.2.RELEASE

Hi ritchieGitHub,   The FITS files are rather large, and I can't upload one, because I don't have push access.  So I uploaded two of the FITS files to my own server, you can download them here:  [http://www.bulapedia.nl/images/nom-tam-fits/](http://www.bulapedia.nl/images/nom-tam-fits/)  (Both files were created with images plus, data was gathered with different cameras)  Feel free to use these for further testing.  Kind regards, Mabula Haverkamp

Device: Samsung Galaxy S3  Description of nav-start:  Tap on "live-karte" in main screen. ( Map is set to OSM and is shown correct. Ich can see and tab my saved caches, i can scroll, everythin ok.... ) Now I choose a single cache (not importand whitch type...) Lets say a multi with several saved waypoints. Then I tab on "mehr Details" whitch opens the cachelisting. Here I open the menue and choose "Navigieren" and take "Karte" (map). After this the screen turns black for a few seconds and switches back to the live-map.  Its the same when I pick a cache from the live-map and start the navigation with the small button in the upper right corner in the listing-preview window.  (I selectet navigation per map as default.)  Does this help? 
It is 1.3.4-pre2 I tested with worldedit 7.0 snapshot. It works. But these scheme seems not working correctly with its probability.

That was fast, thank you. It does not crash any longer.
@slavus   If you does not use the JDNI feature, probably you can prevent this issue by disabled the Spring's JNDI feature. How to disabled, See https://github.com/mybatis/spring-boot-starter/issues/350#issuecomment-500480499.
It does not help, --launcher.GTK_version 2, --launcher.GTK_version 3, or remove it.
@TylerJewell right now ALL failed containers are not cleaned and swarm reserves RAM for them. 
I am on branch to check my static maps PR. That uses more memory because the maps have a bigger size. But if I store a cache for offline usage and go to static maps, all is shown in the new bigger size without problems. If I use refresh from StaticMapsActivity I get an OOM.  I will try with the current NB at home.  Which device do you use? Tab or smartphone? Resolution?

I haven't been able to pin it to a specific query.  I do have one query which usually takes several hours (4+) to run -- if it ever returns at all.  Whenever I run it I start singing 'Charlie and the MTA' to myself with "the man who never returns" replaced with "the query who never returns", wish I could feed it as sandwich as it went by.    It is the one I would suspect the most:     match (n)-[r]->() where not has(r.some_property) return count(r)

However, it does generate a global.cfg with some Inspirations-related options: https://pastebin.com/qdDKHrie  If I change the "global config" option in forge.cfg to false, the inspirations.cfg does generate, and here it is: https://pastebin.com/vZBhz9a9  Edit: I don't know what purpose the global config serves, I think I enabled it because I assumed it was related to the dimension unload delay. I shall disable it to fix the issue on my end.
Hi Radu,  I am so sorry for late answer.  I am still using Oxygen 17.1 and I am planning to move to you new one - version -19.00  I have been check the libraries in 17.1 and it is pointing to commons-io.2.4.jar. So we can close this ticket.  Once again thanks for hint.

Yes and no....I looked at the raw data for the article at crossref.org and it is somehow resolved incorrectly. For example the raw data has "issue":"6" but had no "number" field.

Here is my POM 
yes, sure I have. And it does work with https, but I it is not "clean" to write "http://" in the route configuration, because I also configure the SSL parameters for client-cert authentication on this endpoint.  If I have a "classic" webservice based on servlet with web.xml I can put <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>   Or if I use SWITCHYARD in FUSEonEAP,  I can ensure confidentiality like that <sca:service sy:security="default" name="LoanContractWS_WS_IN" requires="clientAuthentication propagatesTransaction confidentiality">   So what I want is to enforce https for a cxfConsumer endpoint (because a http endpoint makes no sense with client-certificate authentication)

Custom functions that have behaviour similar to 'if', for example if(expr1,value1,expr2,value2,....,defaultValue) where the first exprN to evaluate to true returns valueN else defaultValue. Early evaluation causes all args to be evaluated which could cause the whole evaluation to fail even though those args may never be relevant. An extreme example would be alwaysReturnTrue(argThatIsIgnored) where argThatIsIgnored is something like 'foo' + 1 (i think that should cause an error). The spec says says that args are evaluated early unless otherwise stated but this is in reference to the definitions of the builtin functions ('if' being one of the stated exceptions). 
That was also my thinking. But I tried it with only gc.com active and it still shows the same thing. I force stopped c:geo and restarted it and the log looks exactly like above. Then I activated ec.com (alone and in combination with gc.com) and can see the same behaviour also for ec.com (the requests are also send twice). 
No, it's exactly the same machine. I only switched from coap to coaps.
Yes, I try to update the document from the plugin. I create the documents by adding them on the admin console and it works fine.  By the way is there any way to only update some fields in a document? Based on my experience I have to specify every field when updating otherwise it will be removed. 
I guess I use the default camera from google, and the error is just after the intent is fired, but from the operating system. Something with `with revoked permission android.permission.CAMERA` 
"Do you actually find the RDD being evaluated twice?"  At this point, no, I have not staged a test of it.  I had first posed this question as to best practices for using the Es-Spark connector.

Confirmed, seeing this in 0.13.0. I'll try 0.14.0 shortly to confirm and close this out once I have.
Additional library folder ('project/.asciidoctor/lib') is currently opened 444 times. I have deleted it just a few minutes ago with all its content, but I see it still as opened (with deletion info). This could be former issue, or new one (deleting lib directory while idea running). I will try to get another too many open files error in next few days, but without .asciidoctor/lib folder. Can I do something more? EDIT: It is open directory, so perhaps listing ruby files can be cause...
That would be pretty nice, I did not expect that to be a constructor missing issue :-) Although if you start digging around it may be more clear (it is about copying things related to classes after all ..)

Thanks for merging it in. I have verified on my side that collections are no longer leaking in this scenario.  `SqlgGraph` is failing to open on `readonly` database when it is opened for the first time when it needs to create some schema and tables.

I observed the problem with the `ReferenceWrappingReducer` in [PlanReduceOperator](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/blob/master/stratosphere-java/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/api/java/operators/translation/PlanReduceOperator.java) but expect this to have the same effect in [ReduceFunction](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/blob/master/stratosphere-java/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/api/java/functions/ReduceFunction.java).  When looping over the iterator, the final hasNext() call in the wrapping `reduce(Iterator<Reference<T>> in, Collector<Reference<T>> out)` overwrites the curr object. I think the problem is that return values are not _safe_ when returned from the user function as in the other function which serialize output values or immediately forward them to the next function.  I am currently working on a fix that copies the result of the function call into another mutable object using a Serializer. 
I will test it again when i get a chance, but Minecraft has not high on my priorities lately, and do not see my self doing so for at least a few week weeks. 
I've added a zip file which follows the following: 1) Shows current view folder structure 2) Create a new root folder under "\Views"  3) Move the subfolder "\Data\OMS" which has subfolders and views to the newly created folder. 4) Shows new folder state 5) Pre Export 6) Export 7) After closing the model and trying to re-import, receives the import error regarding bad counts.

I do not have docker on my path (and I'm not sure I ever did).  I thought it worked last week, but I still have this breakage when I reset back to the beginning of last week.  I arbitrarily reset to 5d72d4ea54fdcb6e963cacb7181fda847e01bc50 (commit from late June) and retried, and ran into no issues.  Do we require that users download docker to contribute to bazel?

The launcher will properly load the custom_jar.jar file, and will load any mods installed directly into the .jar (Forge, Optifine, etc.). However the game then won't load any mods from the coremods/mods folders.

I agree with <kbd>bug</kbd>, even if it has never worked.
The pipeline works with single backslash. As commented elsewhere, I think it should be documented what flavour of regular expressions the component expects. I used the double backslash, since I was expecting regular expressions from SPARQL.
It would be a good idea to switch all of them eventually, at least for the ones that already have their own `toXContent`, unless we find a good reason to do otherwise (omitting sensitive data or something), but we can do one PR for each to split up the work, rather than having to do it all as a single chunk. Thanks for finding the other places where we duplicate this logic!  For the ones that don't already have a `toXContent`, it might be a good idea to add one and use it in ClusterState, just so that each class owns its own serialization logic, but I think that's a lower priority than the ones that have duplicated logic.
I tried with DITA-OT 2.1.2 as well.  The behaviour and result is exactly the same. 
Sure thing.

The regression test also passes in my case. The problem is that the test checks if functions with a certain suffix are present in the CG: reachable is also a suffix for also_reachable; the test finds the same CGNode for these suffixes.

The problem is not the compilation stage which invokes gcc, that can be handled with CROSSTOOL. It's invoking some intermediate binary compiled by gcc, which need proper LD_LIBRARY_PATH to work because of the mismatch of system level gcc and the gcc used to compile the binary. The only way I see is to add rpath during compilation which looks like a hack.

Aggregates were working with the build that is on the downloads page, so yes a new bug. It seems to break going from build #848 to #849 in Jenkins.

GriefPrevention and ModernLWC although I don't think there's a way to utilize LWC for this... I *might* be able to add things like the terracotta blocks to its config as items it can lock... but it would then be able to lock all terracotta blocks, not just those that were Gold Pans, for instance.

@xli Thanks for looking at this. The pipeline view is always displayed as the screenshot shows. We generate the pipeline via a Jenkins job which runs a Java jar using the GoCD SDK.   I've put logging in place and that shows the order in which the pipelines are created is Build, PAT, undeploy_PAT, PROD, undeploy_PROD. We do not change the order after creation.   Also, undeploy_PAT and undeploy_PROD are just created, they should not have a Build pipeline.  What I find particularly confusing is that when we specify an environment (e.g. AUPROD) that should have pipelines which run after the PROD pipelines they appear in the correct order. Not sure if this helps.  If you have any more queries please let me know.

The title, artist, and album do work, though I did block them as well.  What is not working is the album artwork (I used require, no errors in the logs generated), the play button here should be a pause (it simply continually sends the play trigger, isn't affected by state), and the bar (I think) should show the time and allow me to seek (as specified).  Note that because the same code works in iOS, I know that the JS in my code is correct for the most part.  Not quite sure what logs you want, as there is no output in the logs pertaining to react-native-music-control or anything related.  Thanks for any help

It just guess that onStreamAdded is not called. because as I can see only here objects are removed from maps. it is just guess again that promises and notifications are not cleaned by gc, because they are held in these maps (and probably elsewhere, but maps seems the best candidates). I only have class histograms when Full GC started to happen and finally application stuck in it,  and there are lot of HashMap$Node instances: 13:       1034896       33116672  java.util.HashMap$Node  Count of promises, notifications grows from Full GC to Full GC, although I see from logs, that count of currently sending pushes are below our limits (10k).

Thanks @TheBentoBox  I do like that idea of the command.  With Minecraft adding SEVERAL new blocks/items, not having the aliases easily accessible is going to make things quite tricky. AND I KNOW you guys are going to get 10,000 people asking you where they are ;) I mean, I KNOW where to find them, but not everyone does.   I think the other reason I like the idea of them being in the docs, is because everything else is there, so it just makes sense to throw them in there as well.

Hi My problem is solved. It was my fault: In my Android Settings -> accounts and sync ->  Background data was unchecked (I unchecked it to avoid the crashes of 3.1.4) and Autosync was unchecked too. When I activated those checkboxes, Kontalk began to work again. I'll close this issue because I think what @svrnwnsch reports is a different problem.  Thanks! 
Nevermind, the leak is actually on the tile-pool threads only. The Image Fetcher is an AWT thread, started for asynchronous fetching of images, that I noticed (in VisualVM) got instantiated every time a tile factory was set, but as of latest Java 7 it stops properly (I remember that it lingered there in the past, on an old jvm 6 version). The tile-pool leak bug has been here written on a sticky note on my desk for a long time, and it's been a while since I last checked it against the most recent Oracle JVM. With your fix we should be all set :) Thanks 
@rwinch Yes I'll try to do that tomorrow :)
here is an example:   
Create an internal message file will resolve this... 
Let me ask the admin of the server - my client didn't crash, it just booted me off the server. I'm playing SMP, sorry for not mentioning that sooner.   I can confirm that the crash does *not* occur in single player when using a *blank, cheated in* biome crystal. Trying to get a non-cheated one is proving a little challenging, so a single-player crash log might take a little longer...
OK, it's due to this code in the language module:   
I've just added it as a compileOnly and annotationProcessor.

I want to get a bit more info to check @tttppp's suspicion. I will also add a couple of other gifs. I suspect there may be a couple of actual rendering bugs but could be wrong 
Here is our matcher's workflow: MatcherKState state = new MatcherKState();  for each sample in a trace        Set<MatcherCandidate> vector = execute(state.vector(), state.sample(), sample);        state.update(vector, sample);  JSONObject stateGeoJSON = state.toGeoJSON();  So we set the parameters k and t to their default values. And we just export the state to GeoJSON format once when the processing is done.  Here is the json of the state exactly when the geojson export fails. {"sequence":[{"vector":[{"candid":"806f1ac6-9118-4e24-8168-a76260e6f81e","predid":""}],"sample":{"time":1513344663000,"id":"612","point":"POINT (2.32283935882367 48.8712888071769)"}}, .... // VECTOR IS EMPTY {"vector":[],"sample":{"time":1513365638000,"id":"1909","point":"POINT (2.7624680008765 49.6559869498477)"}}, {"vector":[],"sample":{"time":1513365639000,"id":"1910","point":"POINT (2.76280093007047 49.6566617349625)"}}, ....  {"vector":[],"sample":{"time":1513365778000,"id":"2047","point":"POINT (2.79032592661939 49.7525311355011)"}}, // VECTOR IS NO LONGER EMPTY {"vector":[{"candid":"5d89da2e-adc2-4066-be55-4cfc392828c2","predid":""}],"sample":{"time":1513365778000,"id":"2048","point":"POINT (2.79061669484041 49.753236388834)"}}, ...     {"candidate":{"seqprob":-3943.406958873673,"filtprob":1,"id":"817f5951-d015-47f1-aade-3774067bb767","transition":{"route":{"roads":[{"road":158277421,"heading":"forward"}],"source":{"road":158277421,"heading":"forward","frac":0.12037988199350792},"target":{"road":158277421,"heading":"forward","frac":0.15334785376597618}}},"point":{"road":158277421,"heading":"forward","frac":0.15334785376597618}},"count":1}],"t":-1,"k":-1}  We can see that sometimes, the vector in the state sequence could be empty. By looking at our logs, I can see the following pattern: MATCHING OK MATCHING OK ... MATCHING OK Filter: HMM break - no state transitions MATCHING OK ... MATCHING OK Filter: HMM break - no state transitions MATCHING OK ...  The HMM breaks correspond exactly to the samples with which the empty vectors start and end.   So I doubt that when the HMM breaks happened, somehow in the state update phase, all the existing candidates in the vectors were removed.   Hope that this will helps you to debug. Otherwise, let me know the informations you need. If there is still no clue, I'll try to fabricate a trace with which you can reproduce the error.   
As I use my own branch a test class will not be that easy... But I've got a wrong path while routing  from 48.829809,11.286628 to 48.833269,11.301112 and to 48.837295,11.292078 (I hope this will replecate without QueryPoints too)

All your guesses are correct. I reinstall Minecraft. Now, it works fine. My mistake. Thanks for the help.

Hmm, I just tested this thrice, twice with the attached volume settings, and once with the last audio setting (Media, video, etc) turned down, the ringer blared through on the first two tries. Only the final attempt resulted in the phone vibrating rather than ringing.  What phone and version of Android did you test on? I'm on a T-Mobile beanded LG V30 H932 running Android 8.0  On another phone I borrowed it appears the ringtone setting is respected, but it is a Moto Z2 Force running Android 8.1, specifically some sort of LineageOS 15.1 rom (of questionable sourcing). I'll test on another stock H932 this weekend and see if its an issue on more than just my device.
Yes, we could fix this so that if you had the environment variable set (or the download service enabled) it could pick those up. We'd still need to make the change to go down the CRAM path though. However, in the (common ?) case where neither of those is true, the downstream failures may not be obvious. So maybe we should have this check for a .cram extension, and throw only if neither of default reference or download are set.

I edited my first message, things went wrong with markdown.
I've tried previously to: * switching to another sms program and switching back * staying with qksms and hitting the resync button * restarting the phone  QKSMS must recognize the contact because it's displaying their contact photo, but just won't display their names. There is even the "add to contacts" button next to their phone number, but when I click on it, the phone pulls up their contact info.

@drakray Could you post your list of core mods you are using?  Mine are listed in the crash report in my original post.  I would like to compare and start eliminating a few before I start testing trying to isolate which core mod is causing the issue.

Yes, it's Storage Emphasis with: * Mining Filter Upgrade * Quick Deposit Upgrade * Void Filter Upgrade installed.
I have InGameInfo. I disabled it thinking that was causing it but that wasn't the case. I will disable ALL other mods and try again...
Yes forcing doesn't really change anything. Something odd going on... I eventually manage to open things and create a project to work on but sometimes it requires several attempts of closing the software and opening it again.. bit random. I've tried the same files on 0.2.0 m2 and m3. This happens only in m3.  Regarding the projects, would it not be possible for QuPath to create some sort of temporary project automatically when it requires it? which would be deleted if the image gets closed.

This happens every time in IDEA 12, I haven't tried it in 13. Since it's basically a concurrency issue it's entirely possible that it doesn't get triggered for some reason in 13, no-one seems quite sure why Cursive provokes this problem in the first place. But JetBrains have confirmed that holding that lock during initialisation is definitely wrong, so it could easily be randomly triggered by something else in the future, and I think the fix is pretty straightforward. 
It looks that all normal users (Stash User that gets read/write in Stash) can't create a branch. With extra permissions (Stash Admin) I don't get an error.  Unfortunately I don't have extra logging. I will ask IT for this information.

Ive migrated about 6 servers from pex to luckperms already. They all have the same issue, but its not always the same users that dont get migrated correctly. On a few servers I can run "lp user VoidAngel info" with no problem, but for a user that is online even at that moment I can type "/lp user exampleuser info" and it will tell me that the user cannot be found.  Given the fact that I have already done this many times I dont think the outcome will change xD But if you have something else in mind that I am not thinking of, I will try exporting and migrating again.

>  >  > You're setting the plot to a town that already exists right? >  > Do you have a plugin that alters a player's max health in any way?  Yeah, all of the land is already claimed and assigned to existing towns. When a player steps into the chunks that are already claimed / assigned it generates this error. It does not appear to do that for plots that were claimed using /town claim.   In the scenarios where this is occurring it was on previously Wilderness claimed plots specifically in the three instances I noticed. (Two being the default 'admin town' for protecting, then a town that was for a player had some manually claimed by an admin and it was doing it there as well.)  The only plugin I am aware of on the server that could modify max health would probably be this one: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldguard-extra-flags.4823/  I'm not 100% confident on that though, I can send you a list of plugins if that'd be helpful too. 
I couldn't get it to work.  Note that I used 'pattern' instead of 'package'  Here is my enunciate.xml

The crash is avoided but there is no solution to handle the situation correctly (i.e. continue with merging). 
They're not resolving as current implementation doesn't look up JDK classes and doesn't consider class hierarchy.  Yes, my next pull request is to ignore JDK classes
Ah, that should be it, I am still on the latest stable, 1.3.x. I'll test with 1.4.x.
I only used the following lines of code to set webLaF:  `WebLookAndFeel.install(); WebLookAndFeel.setDecorateAllWindows(true);`  in try-catch block before my showing the ui by-  `new TestMyUI().setVisible(this);`  Edit: After looking at the propertise from palette, I can see the opaque of my JFrame in UI is checked so it is set to `true`. You are pointing at that, right? 
Yes, I have SELinux enabled.   Tried with the new volume suggestion and by disabling SELinux but I still have issues when I try to re-open a workspace. Here is the full log (notice the [STDERR] rm: cannot remove '/home/user/che...)  
Hmm... to be honest: I have completion suggesters in my mapping, but not in the documents I was bulk indexing. The bulk indexing process should have been the only process that was running at the time of the exception. The bulk indexer is shuffling data over from one type to another in the same index: No deletions, no updates, just bulk index requests. Is it possible that it's caused by something that ES does in the background?  Unfortunately I don't have access to the mapping right now. But I can send it to you tomorrow if that helps. There's multiple completion suggesters for about 3 different types. We're in the process of updating an ES 1.x mapping to ES 5.x, so I'm not even sure if something's wrong on our side (I'm personally not a pro with suggesters tbh). 
I think the code right now is vulnerable to failure any time an update occurs.  My ideal behavior would be that the code is only vulnerable on the very first run on a new system.  After that, failure is easy to avoid on any successive run (since one successful run guarantees a data file).  Here's my ideas/suggestions:  1) Provide a way to specify the cache directory. Default to java.io.tmpdir, but allow the user to override.  The only downside to using java.io.tmpdir is that some systems will clean the directory on reboot, but it makes a good default.  2) Put the online updater into the core package.  I'm sure the majority of the user base wants to use online updates. Those users don't require a dependency on a package that's updated monthly.  As a bonus, it'll be easier to click through the code when viewing on github.  3) You could simplify the code by combining the updating and non-updating parser.  The updating parser can default to 1 day for the update interval.  The non-updating parser can use Long.MAX_VALUE as the update interval (292 millions years).  This makes the less common use scenario (i.e. no updates) a subcase of the common use case scenario.  (i.e. giving you less code to test and maintain with the primary code path being the one that is most used).  4) Consider the option of _not_ bundling any data files with UADetector. Do you really want to make a new release every month for many years to come?  That's a lot of work for a small number of users that don't want online updates.  You can include information on how manually download the data file.  If you do decide to bundle, the bundled package can copy it's data file into the caching directory to maximize the shared code. 
Sorry about that. There's no error message or crash, the potion effects and abilities simply don't work. I've tried the following in the test world I uploaded: Dont Work:    Resistance, Speed, Water Breathing, Slowness, Night Vision, Absorbtion, Saturation, Power Stare, Strength, Glowing, Levitation, Fire Resistance, Haste, Jump Boost, Wither, Poison, Regeneration, Invisibility, Bonemealer.  Does Work:   Flight, Magnetize, Step Assist.  So basically, all potion based abilities have stopped working either on the player or on mobs. Some of the ones on mobs are hard to test if they're working besides looking for potion effects, but the ones which should have an easily noticable effect don't seem to work. There's no potion indicator in the inventory, and the effect doesn't happen. Speed doesn't speed me up, jump boost doesn't change my jump height, etc. And no potion particles.  Again, if I start a whole new world everything seems to work fine, but in the world I uploaded, almost nothing does. So it's something in the level.dat that I uploaded Perhaps something is registered wrong somehow. Not sure how that happened unless some other mod did it, but if i don't know what's wrong I can't even try to fix it with an nbt editor. Also not sure why the ids or whatever would have changed in an existing world. The test world isn't important, the problem is it happened in my main world too.  Ok, I think I found something that seems to have fixed it in my test world, though it's rather dangerous I think. I regenerated the world, then copies that level.dat into my 'corrupted' world, and now everlasting abilities seems to work. Not sure if that might screw up something else, but I might try that with my main world(after backing up of course).

Just ran the latest 1.12.2 buildtools and i still have the same issue.
Sure, I'll post a snippet tomorrow.  For the other problem: Is this a recycling problem of the listview or how can I do a workaround? 
Of course! There's a good chance I'm just doing something wrong - see below:  ![screen shot 2017-10-26 at 11 07 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/450789/32047505-0b3a522c-ba3e-11e7-8797-75000333f0b8.png) ![screen shot 2017-10-26 at 11 07 59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/450789/32047510-0d3e514a-ba3e-11e7-94b2-428140140181.png) ![screen shot 2017-10-26 at 11 08 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/450789/32047517-14ec91a4-ba3e-11e7-80f3-4e5e8d3f45e1.png)   
I would like to run tensorflow on my mobile device.  It looks like `aarch64` architecture is supported (at least according to get_cpu_value in tools/cpp/lib_cc_configure.bzl).  Do you have any suggestions about workaround or fix this problem? Or may be a bazel aarch64 version is available to download?  Thank you!
@AbhilashG97 Are you able to resolve this issue?
Thanks for looking into this! While in fullscreen, with and without tmux, this is the result:   However, I cannot open another tmux pane in Termux right now, while in fullscreen on my 4k display without Termux force closing, so this isn't specific to just `htop`.
Hi cketti, that was a good thought. Just double checked Android setting for K-9 Mail....notifications are all set to on, yet not receiving email notifications. 
It was the current one. 
I tried two ways to run it, both resulted in core dumps:  1. emacs `shell-command`: which takes a command string from the minibuffer and execute it 2. `eshell` (emac's builtin 'terminal')
`col1` and `col2` are partition keys and a mix of `integer`, `text`, `col3` is the clustering key and is `text`. 
I'm not quite sure what it should be, but i feel like it should be atom only.  This is a part of my grammar:    There is a method call atom in UfqParser class, not anything like setAtom, exprAtom or phraseAtom.  Thanks 
we used Maven 3.3.9 and Java SE Development Kit 8u101. At first we used Windows 7 as OS, and we get the previous errors, then we switched to Gaffer 0.4.1, and get the same error, so we moved to Debian 8, and we get the following other errors: [gaffer.graph.GraphTest.txt](https://github.com/GovernmentCommunicationsHeadquarters/Gaffer/files/465350/gaffer.graph.GraphTest.txt) So, @unclassified02 solved commenting the function shouldConstructGraphFromSchemaFolderPath in the file Gaffer-gaffer2-0.4.1\gaffer-core\graph\src\test\java\gaffer\graph\GraphTest.java Now it seems to work properly (we are testing it with an Accumulo cluster and we are getting no errors nor warnings)

Hey Harald,  so far it fails for all splitting of .mgf files. I generate them with progenesis QI by exporting the ms/ms spectra from there. I do a filtering where I exclude all hits that are ranked in the ms/ms spectra 10 or higher to make searches faster and still not losing IDs.  Unfortunately I need to split those big .mgf files (this file here has a size of around 1.7 gb) because somehow our mascot search engine cannot handle .mfg files which are bigger than 1gb.  The .mgf files are made from high resolution mass spec .raw files with a long gradient (5h).  Best regards Andreas     __________________________   Andreas Hentschel, M. Sc.

To be honest we pretty much stay away from the mgf splitting as it can have a minor impact on the results (as each mgf file is processed separately by the search engines). Can I ask you where the mgf files comes from and why it's so big? And how big is it btw?  I've just tested the splitting though, and it still works fine on my side. Does it fail for all files on your side or just this particular one?  Best regards,  Harald  — You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

@RomanIakovlev  I fixed the build at the 2018d.6 version and now I'm searching for the conflict again. Let's see if I will find the bug this time.  Thanks
I mean with this that an error message appeared, without the error happening.

@nkorange i have fixed and pull a request ,tiltle is 'fix-1036'
I'd say yes. @TovaCohen I guess this should be included in doc. 
Thanks, now it works. By the way, is it OK, that I have to correct required Build Tools to currently available 22.0.1, as 22.0.0 is in no way available after ADT update? 
Yes, OR whether it is possible to add to the MI "Paired devices"?  When GadGet Bridge connects to the Mi Band - is added to the device in the "Paired devices". Mi band Notify v2 when pairing - not add to the "Paired devices" Therefore, Mi band Notify v2 - no problem And GadGetBridge the active compound with MI --- the sound is not transmitted in the car via bluetooth 
Yeah, sure. I would appreciate any help :) .  So I ran the GlobalKeyboardExample class (I did import the already compiled .jar on releases). My keyboard layout is portuguese (Brazil) and when I type the " ´ " I'm getting two of them " ´´ " therefore I canot type like "é" or "á" because whenever I type that I got two of them.  This is the output I got: 219 [down] 219 [up]  I was Reading the c code and I guess I should change the language at "MAKELANGID(LANG_NEUTRAL, SUBLANG_DEFAULT)". I'm installing cygwin for trying that today. 
Hello @icbaker and thanks for the help. I am upgrading from 2.10.4 -> 2.11.0. I did not have any issues creating signed APKs before, so those messages are new to me. I am only adding the ui and core to my project:  `implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-core:2.11.0'` `implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-ui:2.11.0'`  I have just tried enabling R8 instead of ProGuard, and I was able to create a signed APK without issues. Though, I favor ProGuard because it handles one aspect better. Note that I am only playing offline files on my app.  Does the demo app use R8 or ProGuard?
@tylerbenson The agent is actively breaking things. Because it runs the `TracingSession` it throws the `MethodNotFound` exception and therefore crashes our app. Meaning that if you have an external dependency using Guava 27+, you cannot use dd-agent in your project.
By that i meant we dont have respawnWithClass enabled  Thanks again! 
No. I see `2.3.3` You see 2.9.8 because it's in your Maven POM Is it possible that you deployed `6.0.1` instead of `6.0.2`?  And the issue is - I'm getting `java.lang.VerifyError: Cannot inherit from final class` when I want to use  the latest Jackson with `info.archinnov:achilles-core`
Hi,  The path, as displayed using   > echo $JAVA_HOME > /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_67-cloudera  The same path was then again set by editing the following   > vi /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch > JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_67-cloudera 
Disabling it does fix it, but I would rather not allow offhand. :/
> My goal is to remove all mobs and only allow a specified few  I'd like to make it so that only X mob can spawn in Y biome. This would require players to travel around and gather specific materials versus just staying in one static location.  The "bug" is that no mobs spawn at all. Except the ender dragon and bats.  Here's a small "mod pack" that has all the required. https://www.dropbox.com/s/8fi5ddbzm42yc1n/MobTest.tar.gz?dl=0
There's no more logs for the null pointer entry. There's a ton of logs for the headers and each of the 2K requests do you want me to post those? All of those responded with 200 OK though.
Yes, mesos is running with `--isolation=cgroups/cpu,cgroups/mem` and can confirm that memory limits are being enforced on other (non-docker) tasks running in mesos. 
I was using M5 then tried M6. It is same error.
I actually just finished creating a test app that reproduces part of the issues we are seeing. I found a race condition with the building of Instabug and updating the user info that I fixed in our code, but there is an issue when we first run the app, Instabug won't show. If we exit the app and then reopen the app, instabug seems to work normally. If we force close the app, and reopen the app, instabug won't show. We are initializing Instabug in the Application. I will post the sample code in a couple of hours.

Hi Michi, I tried to isolate the issue and found out that it is not because of multiple clients. Even when I run single ycsb client to load my Cassandra cluster I am facing the same issue.

The sample code in a new dataflow project is not indented per Google code style. It should be:    or something close to that.
Thank you yannici 
Yes but it will always return an ender IO bucket regardless of the inputted item. In this case its a wooden bucket but is returning an ender IO iron bucket full of fluid.

Thanks for the update. A similar issue was reported in Python Storage system test. It was fixed by making the test to be more generic and use values set in the environment variable (As mentioned in your comment). Would really appreciate if thats done. 
Hi, I used your example with no modifications, then modified it with the files I have and the above mentioned modifications I did made no difference to how the app reacted. It works when I first use it even with no modifications to your example code, but when I leave the screen to another screen in the app and come back and try to use it I get the error I wrote out. What I don't understand is how can it work if I have a .lite with 2 possible answers and the example has in one class a definition of numResults = 6 and in another numResults = 5, yet it still provides me a correct answer when using the app.   I could remake the .lite for the project but you could remake it really easy too. I can't unfortunately send you the original as it's proprietary and from a client I'm making this for, but it's a .lite with 2 possible answers as is the accompanying txt file which has the names of the options written out. As I said the example works great, I get a result meaning the file I'm using works and has worked on an Android version perfectly. However, here I keep getting this error after using it going to another screen in the app and then coming back.   Contact me if you need help with making a .lite file, I'll be happy to help you solve this...
I didn't see anything in the logs , I will wait until server not so busy tomorrow and upgrade 2o v2.3HF1a , is a the right one as its the only 1 I think I could see ? 
@mjpt777 Thanks for the quick response.  I can verify that the fix to the StatusMessageFlyweight has stopped it causing a JVM crash.  I did however hit one further alignment issue when starting the MediaDriver in the CncFileDescriptor which also causes a JVM crash.  It looks like the CLIENT_LIVENESS_TIMEOUT_FIELD_OFFSET needs a 4 byte pad, but this would break the CnC compatibility and would need to follow your version strategy I expect.     
Applying the `no-cache` tag to a target when building with   makes it fall back to `local` unsandboxed execution (is this expected?), which does not use remote caching. We would really like to continue sandboxed building of the targets we want to exclude from remote caching, so this wouldn't be a good workaround for us.

You are correct. The coordinates rely to the primary display. As i changed the primary display to the screen with the biggest height, the y coordinates starting on this screen at 0, on the other screens at +120.  Thank you for your help. I will now write a offset detection in the application code to work around this. Maybe this is a feature which should be done in the library directly because i think this will help others too.

Not an empty string, a null value. I'm not sure if a base64 encoded empty string works. I can test that later. Here is the null value property stack trace.

[SystemUI.zip](https://github.com/wasdennnoch/AndroidN-ify/files/496560/SystemUI.zip) 
@danielleberre Sorry for the confusion, let me explain a little bit more with an example.  Assume we have the following folder: <GOPATH> └── src     └── <test_project>         ├── a.go         ├── b.go         ├── coverage.xml         ├── report.xml         ├── sonar-project.properties         ├── sonar-scanner.properties         └── test.xml  And a.go is,  `package main  import ( 	"fmt" )  func main() { 	foo() 	fmt.Println("vim-go") }`  while b.go is  `package main  import ( 	"fmt" )  func foo() { 	fmt.Println("in foo") }`  After we generated the coverage.xml, report.xml and test.xml, and then run sonar-runner successfully, we will see the uncovered lines is unexpected.    | Coverage | Uncovered Lines | Uncovered Conditions -- | -- | -- | -- a.go | 0.0% | 10 | – b.go | 0.0% | 9 | –   As we can see, uncovered lines in a.go should be 2, and b.go should be 1.  So, when a certain package contains no test files, each lines of the packages will calculated as uncovered lines, and that is not corrected.
Actually the code I posted above is from 3.2.1.  I tried 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 snapshot with the same results before entering this bug.  I had to roll back to 3.1.1 for the time being. 
I can't seem to reproduce it all of a sudden after gathering code points at different commits. Close for now, I'll reopen if it happens again and I figure it out.

In fact, it seems that the refresh "solves" the issue.  When I write the file, and import it in a GAML model, I get the Exception. But when I refresh the model, the metadata are correct, and no more exception....
Going point, @vpavic, I'll make sure it gets backported. I'll also reclassify this as a bug.
Where can I find the log? 
In a Flatworld, try setting your longitude & latitude to the North Pole, and use gamerule doDaylightCyle false to freeze time. Then do /time add 24000 repeatedly to see the moon cycle around the sky until it comes into view. Then when you view it, you should be able to see the problem, most of the time. 
Thanks for your answer, that was really quick...   
I see the following:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17179966/49250691-129adf00-f3e5-11e8-9473-6ad2387915cf.png) 
I uninstalled, then re-installed.  This corrected the issue.  Closing this ticket.
I can reproduce it with the following steps:    Possibly related: `bazel build //external:all` always throws NPE, regardless if you have the `external` directory. 
We've got the latest version of hawtio running. The quartz (1.8.6) schedulers are running: - one is configured in spring (using xml) - the other one is running using the @EnabledScheduling   The first one is also used by camel-quartz for scheduling. 
No, the config was changed when I added the mod to my existing survival multiplayer server and before any of the tools were crafted. The only other custom settings are that I have disabled both the destruction tool and builders paste, The other active tools have durability working correctly (see below screen grab).  ![2018-11-11_01 15 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37810246/48317984-a1c38c80-e5c7-11e8-81ee-870a8cc9a6eb.png)  
1. Using latest commit on branch master. 2. Commit f2f6bdd3 says: "Full IN+OUT: Tank, Reservoir, XP Obelisk, Soul Binder". Since "IN" is not working, I think it's better to mention it regardless of the reservoir common usage. 3. The multiblock is formed correctly (hard to do it wrong since the visual changes when it's complete). I have tried all 3 possible setups: 2x2x1, 2x1x2, 1x2x2. Same issue on all. 
I figured it out. I was importing an image from an external drive (a phone) instead of copying the image to my D drive and then accessing it. 
@akiezun using the same command lines from #1414   I get different sorting with / without --sort_by_all_columns

Not sure why, the ticker's decimalFormat's fields(maxIntegerDigits, minIntegerDigits, maxFractionDigits, minFractionDigits) will have value changed after placing the order. So the hashcode will be changed and the listener unable to retrieved from the QuoteEngine causing no more quotes received. I have highlighted in the attachment.

When I wanted to inflate the layout that contains `com.h6ah4i.android.materialshadowninepatch.MaterialShadowContainerView` in my recyclerview :     Thank you 👍  
Agreed. seems likely.
I was outputting to .vcf.gz.    I reran the command to output to just. vcf and it runs without error:   This is the case for the file that I augmented with what the sed command was meant to do. Otherwise, the command errors. I think the tool should be able to take CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics whether run using Picard or GATK. I say this since folks may have these metrics from old runs before the as-of-yet-available Picard tools in the GATK jar.

I have attached the crash logs also.  
No JS Console errors. Happens on both Safari and Chrome. Not tested on Ff yet - can do later.
I don't recall the cursor flashing but then the actual dialog hadn't finished rendering when alt-tabbing away so no property field was active.  Note that being full screen isn't required for this to happen though I'm fairly sure the OP was running full screen.  Was only able to reproduce this with a large number of token properties and the Edit Token dialog took several seconds before it finished rendering the properties tab.
I referenced a test in the project i experienced the issue so that I don't upgrade to a version with this issue, using [System Rules](https://stefanbirkner.github.io/system-rules/#EnvironmentVariables). So it could be added a test similar to this, quite easy since it crashes on initialization of the client.

Hi @Himanshu507, did you try resolving this issue? Are you stuck somewhere? I can help.
Thanks for the hint! `grid.getDataProvider().refreshItem(order)` works in both cases.
i have downgraded thermal (v. 5.2.4.8), forge (v. 13.20.0.2345) and CodeChikenLib (v. 2.7.0.268)  and i removed draconic and now everything works again.  i think the problem is releated to CodeChikenLib 3.0.0.274. it's required by draconic and thermal.
the wrench that comes with maybe integrated tunnels ? shift_right click to easily remove the logic cables, importers, exporters and interfaces. May even work with batteries, variable stores etc but I have never tried ?

@davsclaus is there any place to get SMX 4.6 ?  
I just made a change to the documentation within an XML Schema and saved the schema from within oXygenXML.  oXygen is configured to communicate with eXist through XML RPC. 
Because i can't replicate the issue without applecore installed (hunger overhaul and spice of life are not installed) 
Should it? In https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome/documentation/development/bindings/xml-reference.html#xml-structure-for-configuration-descriptions, it says that the property name is "default"...

thx  and sorry for not giving log files / checking this myself I have been busy the last few days  but I am happy you found it 
Unfortunately, that is the full log as it appears in the console :\ Neither the server nor the console are crashing, it's just console spam. 
I'm able to run the stash plugin using docker, but it always fails using a mac (and we need it to run on a mac to build ios apps). Hopefully this helps :)  I'll have a look and see if I can find the plugin-stash.pr.log for this. 
Outstanding, we're all set - thanks a lot! 
When in crashed me, it was just sitting on a wooden planks block, it was near thaumcraft things, but not connected to anything whatsoever.  I saw the backpack, it was facing towards me, my game crashed, then i was unable to reconnect to the server because it would crash before it finished loading the world. https://pastebin.com/cFWdPsWA here's a pastebin of the full crash report if that helps at all. I DO have optifine installed and I'm wondering if it might be that.
Hi @mrniko here is the exception that occur during deserialization of an object from Tomcat session (using latest redisson snapshot):  The best thing for this was to be able to override readObject for CustomObjectInputStream but the method is declared as final, so for my test I end up changing 2 classes that uses currently CustomObjectInputStream - SeriazliationCodec and TasksRunnerService.  I'm attaching both classes that I have modified and are up to date with the latest in git so you could compare and see the difference  Probably the best thing is to make CustomObjectInputSteam private class and use helper method/class that will read the object out of the input stream and set the correct class loader and after that set it back to what it was  [redisson.zip](https://github.com/redisson/redisson/files/3233687/redisson.zip)   
@eivantsov Thanks for your try. I'll retry this within next weekend. 
I'm using QB Android SDK 3.5.0 To reproduce it just call qbAttachment.getContentType(), It will always return null.
As power source i was using two, first a solar panel tier 6 from environmental tech connected via Thermal Dynamics Cryoducts to the chunk destroyer (arround 1.7 million RF/t), which was later changed for overloaded's creative generator, which outputs 2.1 billion RF/t per side, directly placed next to the chunk destroyer.  i forgot to mention one thing, the chunk destroyer behaved normally in a 32x32 chunk square, but the one in the picture was way bigger, being (i think) 1024x1024 chunk square, 0.10.0 made that pattern, but 0.9.22 worked with those huge distances
Added a full log, it contains a bit other related stuff too but please have a look here: https://gist.github.com/drindt/9c7e40d5798b94fdf69e  If you need further information or i can do something please let me know. Thank you! 
Sure sorry, was in a rush getting off the train; Updated the above. Might be of note that we use `cucumber-jvm:4.2.0`, but that's working fine otherwise.
You need to credt a Mecha with an AI chip. This can be done in the vehicle crafting table. Make sure you have all of the parts for a Mecha and an AI chip in your inventory. 
Ops. Forget. https://pastebin.com/pjTECjPU
It only seems to do it when I break it with an item. It can be any item. I tried sever different items in my hand like leather, torches, crafting table, Dark Matter Pickaxes, and a Red Matter Sword. It breaks into a normal pipe when I use my hand. 
I had this save method (I have that code in a _companion object_ to make it static):  `fun saveData(data: Data) = myBoxStore.put(data)`  I used that in my `onCreate`:    Then I removed that code.   Now, whenever I uninstall and install the app, I always have those 2 entities in my adapter. Very strange indeed, and I can't get rid of them. 
The downloaded video works well without freezes. Navigating the time bar worked fine.  How could I possibly send you the logcat? Isn't it a bit too sensitive for public? Is it important to mention that I am using the official Nextcloud docker image on tag "apache" together with nginx as ssl reverse-proxy?
I am sorry, I will elaborate a bit more. For context: I am currently building a framework for fuzzing Libraries that Evaluate XPath expressions.  We found that jaxen behaved differently than the rest when evaluating `/nonexistent<=false()`.  In the framework we pass a sample file (not important in this case) and the XPath `/nonexistent<=false()` as args to the java program below. This then evaluates the XPath expression and return `false` in the aforementioned XPath expression, which is wrong.  Unfortunately, I currently do not have an example with a unit test.  
Currently it's "if the existing file is in the database and the file does not exist, delete it". I'm proposing "if the file from the database is not in the file list, delete it" 
Fixed! 
hi dilipkrish `Role` is just POJO class.     change the return type `Role[]` to `List<Role>`. then result json is correct. only array return type is allways missing model Role.

I would think making the default level to only log WARN and above be more appropriate. That may need us to add logback configuration for the UI code:  https://www.baeldung.com/logback open to see what others think.,.... ? @mandy-chessell 
My first assumption is that it can not access the gitlab repository in https://git.project-hobbit.eu:4567. But i still do not know why.  [Exception while bechmarking locally.txt](https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/files/1918744/Exception.while.bechmarking.locally.txt)  
We guarantee that only one thread at a time accesses a graph instance as in the test case I sent. But that thread may change. 
Just tested with match_all, works as expected.  Also works when just doing the `bool` query, without the `function_score`.  Seems to be the combination of the 2.  I'll build out a test case and post it.

The pattern looks like "cast({0} as number({1s}))"  The problem is fixed with latest snapshot.  Thanks! 
It seems that nothing is added to logcat when I try to login. Is it possible? Also, I can't check the version of Nextcloud News shipped by my provider. Maybe can this be caused by an old version of the server? Between 0.17 and 0.21 do you increase the minimum server version required? 
Why not both? 
I've not been able to duplicate this.  The "Play" button didn't appear before there was a stream to decode. I was monitoring the livestream table on the BE and it was 15 before the button showed up. 
I edited my post to include it, I'm using version 0.2 built on F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/io.homeassistant.android  If this has since been fixed feel free to ignore, just wanted to provide the info if it's helpful. I didn't see any entity that has a float in those fields.

Lining the numbers up in ascending order: 49584571934843771141903627621780519911929601359651799042 (a message at 14:03:31.027) 49584571934843771141903627621784146689388445315895394306 (final checkpoint value) 49584571934843771141903627621785355615208059945070100482 (the dropped message)  The first log item shows when 49584571934843771141903627621780519911929601359651799042 is received. The second is a log entry I added to record the result of replace(...) when it returns false. The third log item shows us skipping the records and the checkpoint value at that point.    This behaviour would be fine if my other instance subsequently picked up this message, but it also skips it with similar behaviour. I suspect what's happening is each instance has pulled batches of messages that overlap in their content but aren't the same. I'm still lining up the logs between instances. Maybe this issue could be mitigated by trying again until "this.checkpointer.filterRecords(recordsToProcess);" returns an empty list and we're sure we can skip the items.  I realise some changes were made to limit the number of duplicates, but application developers in this kind of environment need to develop idempotent consumers - Kinesis itself is 'at least once' delivery, so duplicates are always a possibility. Obviously we want to limit the number of dupes as much as possible, but not at the expense of dropping messages altogether.
YES,I follow your wiki like this . Download Material Theme.zip Open Preferences -> Plugins -> Install plugin from disk... and choose the zip. Go to Preferences -> Editor -> Colors & Fonts -> Scheme -> Choose between the 3 Material Theme's. 
hmmm... now I can't recreate this... it happened the other day (and had happened when we were in Alcala), but I;ve tried running the tests as both fresh and update installs on my physical device and AVD - but can;t get it to appear again.  I'll close for now, but can re-open if I see it happen again, and will attach the extra info
I did somewhat similar to what you suggested but without the annotations. The final design I came up with that I'm currently trying to implement is the following...  An entity view class hierarchy might have multiple usages. When a type of the hierarchy is used statically(attribute type), it becomes an _inheritanceBase_. The effect is, that every subtype of that _inheritanceBase_ class gets a specific class generated that is bound to that _inheritanceBase_. The next concept that is interesting is about _subtype configurations_. In JPA you only have a single subtype configuration i.e. every entity subtype of an inheritance enabled entity is part of that subtype configuration. In Blaze-Persistence Entity Views, we allow to have multiple subtype configurations by specifying the interesting subtypes at the use site(attribute declaration). At runtime, every subtype configuration needs an appropriate _factory_ method that is used to construct subtype instances uniformly. Previously, we tried to generate constructors for every configuration which doesn't work out. The new idea is, to construct an overall configuration that contains all subtypes for which only a single constructor is created. Every other subtype configuration has a mapping to that overall configuration. For each subtype configuration, we now generate a _static create_ method that maps the configuration specific attributes to the overall constructor. That way, we avoid clashing constructors when having multiple configurations. The _static create_ methods are suffixed with their subtype configuration index.

Hi Tomas,  Thanks. I have emailed it to you. Please have a look on it.  Jianbo 
Thanks for the fast reply. That was it actually, I had to bind it to the build phase manually. I just executed docker:build alone.
The more I have dug into testing Pulsar io-connectors/functions the more issues I have found. It appears that the ClassNotFoundException/NoClassDefFoundError is more common that I thought. I will make a PR for it. 
Sure, it is as follows:  
Yes, the same user id. The user is able to access the home directory.

Not too many other details.... I attacked with a Territorial Hammerskull. The opponent had two creatures, one with summoning sickness. I tried clicking on that creature to select it with the Hammerskull's effect. I tried multiple times at multiple different places on the card. I was unable to select it. I then clicked the second create (without summoning sickness) and the effect triggered immediately.  I will try to re-create it locally and see if I can get any other details that may be relevant.  Thank you.  On Wed, Sep 20, 2017 at 4:56 AM, theelk801 <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > I couldn't recreate this.

It doesn't. It still doesn't display the colors even if Chisel, JEI, and CTM are the only mods installed I think.
sorry, I meant POST instead of PUSH. The flag is also wrongly named "pushAlways" instead of "postAlways".  Until a couple of weeks ago there was only I "save" method on the resource repository. In the V2 version there is now a "create" and "save". So it becomes possible to distinguish "POST" and "PATCH". Before that it just did a POST. This thing now just needs to be enabled.  The general issue is a bit more complicated due to the flaws in the current serialization handling. I looked into all that and think I will have a solution tomorrow that does a first cleanup in this area by having a proper representation of a JSON API document and moving the logic out of the serializers.
> does this happen when you have app:errorEnabled="true" in your xml layout?  I had forgotten to add this, however it only seems to add extra padding to the `TextInputLayout` but the error text is still in the same place.  I'll see if I can reproduce in a stand-alone app.
docker4mac picks up the proxy info from the macos System Preferences. If you manually put in proxy values there (remember, I don't actually have proxy values that I want to use for HTTP and HTTPS proxies, so they would be blank), you goof up the internal docker4mac HTTP and HTTPS proxies.  Here's my `docker info`  
Hm, on my computer it reproduces in 100% of cases. It doesn't hang forever, it seems like mapdb is trying to read and analyse the whole mapdbfiles.p file, which is 10GB. After 5 minutes CPU is slightly busy (1-2%) the main job the application is busy with is file reading, and heap size is constantly growing (I've attached gc log file, so you can see it). I've made four thread dumps with several minutes interval. And in this run I waited a little longer, so map4 managed to load though it took 10 minutes. Windows 7 x64, Core i5, 8GB RAM, jdk1.7.0_25 64 bit. The first run, when application writes 8x3=24 million records takes 3 minutes, so I guess HDD throughput is ok.

[PeptideShaker 1.16.10 log.txt](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker/files/1066470/PeptideShaker.1.16.10.log.txt)  Does it have something to do with the modification I added? Here is how the modification I added looks like: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23078645/27011614-ddc91b16-4ec7-11e7-9fa2-1caae78a6cfd.png) 
Yes, add one more field please to mock :) That should trigger it.  As far as I understand, `AnnotationInjectFieldSearcher.findField` will return a field only if the target class has only one field with that specific annotation.  It's a bit weird that it +only+ looks for the annotation anyway. It should probably use the mock type too. Or, actually, just the mock type, as we already know that the mock metadata comes from a scanner that just scanned the target class and extracted that metadata from it.   
I haven't tested this but I think this bug appears in following code: ` IFE 0, 1   SET a, [SP + 100] ` In that case emulator is skipping and tick()->tick_skip()->getInstructionLength() will return wrong instruction length. I suppose it would next try to use 100 as instruction opcode and do something evil. 
I would like to generate a spec file automatically using the 'Spec Generator' feature in 2.4 by passing the PageDump json file as an input.  But i'm getting Null pointer exception while calling the method generateSpecSections in SpecGenerator.  Please help me here.

I've change the logging level of the `InstanceDiscoveryListener` and as far as I can see the  `Heartbeat` events are received (I see `Discovering new instances from DiscoveryClient` print repeatedly).  Moreover, what I have done to test it is to add a new java class in the project that autowires the EurekaDiscoveryClient and schedule a method that calls the `getServices()` and prints the result. I can clearly see that the discovery client is not receiving any new instance while on eureka they are correctly registered.  > May be this is linked: spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix#3708  I think I've never seen the error, but it could be related. This may explain why the first time the registry is fetched correctly. I will look into it and let you know.

We actually pulled down the latest from GitHub and built it manually since we don't have access to the jenkins.  The build was from about a day or so ago. 
@eivantsov  @riuvshin   Thank you for your reply!  `docker run --rm --net host eclipse/che-ip:nightly` returned `192.168.65.3`, and it work fine.  In my Docker for mac `Preferences> Advanced> Docker subnet` is set to` 192.168.65.0`. So it may can't to get correct IP by it.
@Cypher121,  Yeah, I'm aware of that... sadly. I was hoping you would have a clue because it was working on the last version flawlessly. To your questions: It crashes by **any** block and item this includes creative and recipe less Items, too. Any block or Item behavior is normal, this error is seemingly restricted on NEI and the recipe function.  I do not use Optifine or a specific Texture (resource pack), just some parts of Texture replacements for JABBA, Buildcraft, Gravel, Lava and a few others. But no texture-pack in for your mod and nothing larger than 64x64.  access_denied 
Hi,  Yes, I'm behind a proxy. I can access URL data if I start OpenRefine using "refine /i IPaddress" command. But still I cannot use RDF reconciliation services. When choosing any of them (dbpedia, freebase, ...) a pop-up window opens with the message 'Working' and stops there.

Yeah, just saw that link, will test the most recent version. Thanks for super fast response :+1:  
When I found the old issue, I had a setup with a Neromantic Prime and the chalice with lava was filled by ExU2 nodes from a Mekanism tank. When I decided I had enough sand I broke the eveshifting fountains support structure, which resulted in an odd value of starlight in the chalice. Which I think comes form the fountain extracting random values out of the chunk reservoir. The infinity from #440 is fixed, as the chalices now gets completely drained of their excess fluid although producing an interaction.  Now to test the fix I explicitly set up XNet to replicate the problematic values in the tanks.  Which I am sure can also be achieved with every other automation/control mod capable of fluid routing in explicit value.   If I read your code right: chalice interaction samples an interaction for the general liquid types,  then drain the tanks for maxDrain = interaction given drain  (ignoring the possibility that there might be less amount of fluid in the tanks as maxDrain, which is the implementation of IFluidhandler.doDrain(int max, bool simulate) )  then spawn the lightshow which will trigger the drop when the entities meet.  This should also results in the possibility to get a rock crystal drop with only 10mb starlight remaining which should only be sufficient for sand. This is possible with only astral sorcery. Highly random, but the chance is > 0. RNG.
Seems that this will be dependent on Camel consuming Kafka 0.9.0.0 or greater 
I tried with the -confFile and removed licensius and -getOntologyMetadata options. Now I get   `Error while generating the documentation null`  I m aware of only the dct:license property to specify license URL. How to specify name ?  I guess, when licensius is failing, your solution of showing the URI would do for now.   Thanks for responding diligently and suggesting options. 
Yeah. You found a better name for this thing. I'm talking about it.  I'm sure that this happens when this box is opened. I mean I type fast. This box is shown. And I use shortcut to save file. Than everything freezes.   About spaces: I think usually everything ok. At least I can't say that I'm 100% sure that somehow because of this such thing happens :/  Also I just have tried with JS file and no freezes. It seems somehow related PHP autocompletion and editorconfig (without editor config plug-in everything works fine). 
@laa yes, I reverted back to 2.2.21, and it works fine.
Nope it doesn't work even using the jar manually.  The problem is that when the **TaskManager** has the focus it doesn't work , but when it is unfocused then it works .  ---  Example code:  
HTC ONE, Android 5.0.2 It looks as if the last played list is pretty long, which causes the freezing? Possibly because it has to check the last played time? ( noticed this new red bar below thumbnail )
Teleporting while on my pet does nothing, I go nowhere, and still have a single pet. After walking through a portal I only get my original pet back.  After riding my pet through a portal in one world, leading to a portal in another, the result is.. two pets.  
will do, currently at uni so i will do so when i get home. 
I don't believe so, no. I was surprised too, but minetweakers name had a space in it, but even before that it was erroring. Additionally, minetweaker 3 when erroring should only skip the errored line, not stop functioning as a whole. 
It's "Array2D" from the Processing examples as it says above the first image. :) 
After my latest attempt to fix this problem, I have been unable to reproduce the problem on two different platforms. I am closing this issue. If anyone else experiences this problem after Release 0 Update 0 (and I expect some other platforms will experience something like it anyway), open a new issue. 
No, other keybindings 'stick' like normal. I just tried it in a new instance with only Dynamic Surroundings, and there it also happens. Something else I just notice;, is that the keybindings do not show up in the list (options > controls) when I am not in a world. So going to controls from the main menu does not allow me to set the keybindings, I can only do this with Esc inside a world. I also updated to latest forge (2479) but this didn't help either.
I am using JDK 1.8.0_60.  It appears the problem is triggered by the following configuration element that one of my developers added to the POM.  <pre>         &lt;finalName&gt;${artifactId}&lt;/finalName&gt; </pre>  When I change this to the following, the problem goes away.  <pre>         &lt;finalName&gt;${project.artifactId}&lt;/finalName&gt; </pre> 
@robertotru, I just tested with `Mustache`. No issue.
hmm i can't seem to replicate it Java. It was only an issue through quercus. I think it's not a bug in orientdb. sorry 
Hi Dipsy, Does it make sense that I'm getting this error message on start-up, before I've uploaded any Ontologies? The console output is appended below (I'm actually not sure where the associated error message is here), and zip of my karma home folder is attached.  Thanks! Megan  Starting Karma...

1. 48 nodes: 41 data, 4 http balancer, 3 master nodes 2. ICU: 2.3.0, all nodes 3. openjdk 7_u55, all nodes  I'm indexing a lot, but this message has, sadly, nothing to do with it. If I stop it persists. One easy way to trigger it sooner is to add more replicas to the index.  Other nodes dont really have anything interesting: Master nodes have last messages from the 4 days ago about adding a node to the cluster except for the actual elected master. HTTP nodes dont have anything, data nodes have GC message from some 8 hours ago 
Sure, i will put them later~  2016年7月26日 23:40，"Alen Siljak" notifications@github.com写道：  > Hi, it seems that attachments do not go through when replying from email. > Could you please attach the screenshots on GitHub? >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub > https://github.com/moneymanagerex/android-money-manager-ex/issues/895#issuecomment-235308855, > or mute the thread > https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOd5CLVxweVZuCe566SDdrXl9HW0Omuuks5qZiprgaJpZM4JOM1J > . 
My test application is the SpringBoot Petclinic with an embedded Tomcat and an embedded database with  OpenJDK11 on a CentOS7 system. I create load with JMeter on a seperate system. Prometheus an Zipkin are on another system. For JMeter I use a predefined test plan from SpringBoot and the predefined Ocelot Config Files from the Ocelot Demo. It starts 100 threads within 10 seconds. Before I start any tests, i reboot the system. First I tested with the agent version 0.5. The heap remains relatively constant at under 200 MB for about 1 hour. After one hour the memory increases very strongly and with peaks up to 700 MB. ![jvm-metrics-heap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1355054/74718525-b2cf6480-5232-11ea-86ae-9254808c3c1f.png)  With the agent version 1.0 this behaviour can be reconstructed. Here, too, the memory remains at 200 MB at the beginning, but increases strongly after one hour with peaks up to 700 MB. ![jvm-metrics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1355054/74718537-b95ddc00-5232-11ea-82a5-0dd7a0325fd3.png)  With Elastic APM or Pinpoint I have never reached these values. Of course I do not use the APM agents at the same time. ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1355054/74719063-9ed83280-5233-11ea-84ee-b81601d35f64.PNG)  
It does happen constantly. It didn't at first, and then started to appear. I don't know why,... but thought it might be worst reporting in case it had anything to do with QuPath. I might just try to re-install QuPath and see if it comes back.
Yeah, I've tried refreshing multiple times. Any way I can get more debug info for you?

> Hi Daniel, Thanks for working on this. I'm happy to help with testing. I downloaded the .jar file to test it. After double-clicking on it I received a pop-up window with the following error message: Java Virtual Machine LauncherCould not find the main class: com.github.beatngu13.pdfzoomwizard.Launcher. Program will exit. Thanks,Ilana  Hi @dogloveroc, thank you for the fast feedback. This may happen if you use a Java version prior to 1.8 or OpenJDK. Could you please try installing [this Java runtime](https://java.com/en/download/) and then launch the Wizard with it?
Resolved. 
@qparis Updated init, sufficient?
Removing the file worked, thank you!
> Did you write those envs in ~/.bashrc in the terminal after the workspace has started?  I added environmental variables in the image itself. The image was created without a dockerfile. It looked approximately as this. The first console 
Because of this in assemly.xml    the filename mismatch.  And this is also error prone, python discards the '-' from the name so we're stuck here to 1.1rc58.
They all pass  
Sure, I have here Android System Web view version 74.0.3729.186
Yes, when that player died, this error was in console. Also how do i reverse the stack on that player?
I've usualy just ran the jar file, i can try that later when i play a comp Tried it in a custom map and it appeared to work fine, it does detect the game closing but discord still shows as i'm in menu "CSGO not detected. Shutting down RPC."
Sure, here's an example of a cURL request which does the right thing:   
Huh OK, looks like it more subtle than I thought. I tried a fresh repo with a hand-built jar and it was able to extract it alright. There's also an interaction with sandboxing - if I pass `--genrule_strategy=standalone`, I don't get the permission error. Unfortunately this means I can't tell how much it's creating before it dies since I can't tell what happened in the sandbox after the fact. web.xml permissions are 644.  I trimmed my rules down a bit, here's what I have now:    File permissions before creating the backend war look ok according to ls, and the echoed paths look fine up until when ijar zipper is invoked. Again it works okay if I disable sandboxing, so maybe the root cause has something to do with that. If nothing jumps out at you from this I can keep trying to trim this down to a minimal repro that I can share, but it will take a bit more work. 
DITA-OT 1.8.5 and DITA-OT 2.1 have the same problem. 
The JDK is openj9-java8 compiled internally, which is different from the one compiled i adopt ci. I will add the check to the get.sh script.

Rombert,  Our project folder structure is little different. So even though I am able to add this as content project, I am not able to see changes getting reflected.   I also created Linked Folder (jcr_root) to point to webapp folder. That didnt work as well.   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14977933/13056000/8a432080-d3e0-11e5-8a42-d1b88c85c135.png) 
This is not the warning from the catch clauses inside GcmAvailableHelper that you had recently surrounded with "if (Build.Debug)".  It doesn't even get to that point because the GcmAvailableHelper  class cannot be loaded at all.
> what we do today  plus the type name of the exception? (both for http2Ex and cause) 
How is it possible to switch to MapDB, I thought that is no longer an option?
Easer finally updated to 0.5.4, so I can confirm it indeed happens on the latest version too.  For the notification permission, yeah, I am pretty sure I gave it permission to listen to notifications. [Here's a screenshot of it.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4731163/36385770-4bd17d9e-1572-11e8-87d3-0d890bd10dc6.png)  For the media control, yeah, I tried about 5 different players (Shuttle+, YouTube through YouTube Red, Phonograph and its fork, Vinyl and Vanilla Music) and they gave me the same result. [Here's a newer log.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ws7ldntyritokk/logs_0.csv?dl=0) I'll test it in another Oreo device later and try to test it in a Nougat or older too so we can check if it is a device/OS specific thing, as it seems to be receiving the input and it does work when I use another action such as turning wifi off.
> Can you show some exception? Here is the exception trace, but if i change to 4.0.0.RC1, it will execute normally. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9378228/64146969-6c877400-ce51-11e9-9323-3cde2f341cb1.png)  
It was on windows. I tried it on two different PCs.  Maven was 3.6.3.  JDK 13.0.2 on one PC and JDK 8 on the other PC.  I started it directly from the command line with „mvn package“ without an IDE.  When build with IntelliJ the error did not occur.  The issue is reproducible with different Java versions on different PCs. It occurs again when the build is rerun. 
OK, yeah I think it would be useful. I will try to fix at some point - probably not for a few days.
This bit worked:   
@abdurahmanadilovic, thanks for pointing the article. I've heard about such issue previously. But it looks like it's not the case because the issue happens on armv7 and armv8 devices too, for example here are some from top: Samsung SM-J200G (arm-v7) Samsung SM-J210F  (arm-v7) Samsung SM-G610F (arm-v8) Micromax Q402+ (arm-v7) Micromax Q409 Xiaomi MI MAX Xiaomi Redmi Note 4  And other phones from these manufacturers, Motorola, Lenovo...  Here is an updated screenshot with manufacturers: https://ibb.co/ngwk9f  @greenrobot-team, I've checked the release build, it contains all 4 variants that you've mentioned. We use Android App Bundles to ship the build, I'll recheck the config too.   However, not all the users on that phones have this problem. We have much more of them who don't crash. If the problem would be in the way how we configure a build, all of them should start crashing, shouldn't they?   And we have some test devices that are in the list of models experiencing crashes but we don't have that issue. As I remember, we got such logs from our tester only once, but reinstallation helped in that case, so we couldn't check what actually happened.  
I tried without proxies. When i access the URL on the browser, it shows me a black screen with a loading symbol but it's stuck there and doesn't complete loading.   The output of curl command is as follows,  [vagrant@localhost ~]$ curl -v http://192.168.28.200:8261/dashboard •About to connect() to 192.168.28.200 port 8261 (#0) • Trying 192.168.28.200... •Connected to 192.168.28.200 (192.168.28.200) port 8261 (#0) > GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1 > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0 > Host: 192.168.28.200:8261 > Accept: / > < HTTP/1.1 302 Found < Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 < Location: /dashboard/ < Transfer-Encoding: chunked < Date: Fri, 29 Jul 2016 12:21:07 GMT < •Connection #0 to host 192.168.28.200 left intact 
please add milestone!! 
The block was placed about a day before any issues were noticed, but probably closer to 20 hours before it would actually happen. The version was 1.7.0.72. Also there were 548,072 light entries in that tag, so 255 seems like a more, ah, reasonable number.  Thank you for the quick fix :)

Good point!  Chandra, Pyromaster's +0 ability (for example) is broken.  Also, I realised that lands get caught in the cardOnTop.getManaCost().isEmpty() clause and so can't be cast with Future Sight et al which is kind of unintended so have resubmitted a pull request. 
This phone is on Cyanogen Mod but I don't know if that is relevant. I'll try to get a logcat when I have the chance. Good to see that it doesn't happen in the emulator.  On this particular phone I could not export a file from Dropbox app onto SD card so it could be caused by something else.

Hi, Thanks for the reply.  I set DrawableParams in onFinalImageSet(). The top level drawable is a ForwardingDrawable so it will automatically forward the parameters down to ArrayDrawable, which will automatically forward it to mLayers (which are AnimatedDrawable).  Set a small Drawable into the target ImageView. It should be pixelated and not blurry when working.   
@omehegan can confirm it works with "regular" `pipeline` job (with the same Jenkinsfile on the same repo) but not multibranch pipeline (haven't tested with a freestyle job but i'd guess that works aswell)  this shows up in jenkins.log: 
Startup log: https://gist.github.com/ipr0james/4893cfaf4a5c96f24e8eb2cddcd814bc  To test this theory, I've installed zPermissions and given myself essentials.spawnerconvert.Creeper which is the mob type I have been testing with, this doesn't seem to have made a difference and I am also op.  I'm not sure if the method of obtaining spawners has changed with the 1.8 editions of the latest essentials. I am still using /give {player} Spawner:50 1 as I could not find documentation on how else to obtain it.   After doing some searching, then checking for perms with debug enabled it should log that I had the perm when I came to placing the spawner, after trying to place multiple types of spawners I still don't see the debug message being thrown as if it isn't making it to this check.
yes liteloader  is not detected  because authme send player on hub fast
Hi @avurro thanks for the fast response! I do get a Exception: **com.googlecode.jmapper.exceptions.JMapperException: com.googlecode.jmapper.exceptions.ConversionBodyIllegalCodeException: There is an error in the generated method. Additional information: [source error] invalid types for !=** 
@anki2189 I don't think it's related, we are not spawning any additional Thread in `MavenMetadataExpirationProxyCaseTest#expiredProxyRepositoryMetadataPathShouldBeRefetchedRegardlessOfChecksum`. Maybe I'm missing something , please correct me or show me your doubts :)  Thanks :)
When you say build nd4s, do you mean to add "org.nd4j" % "nd4s_2.11" % "0.4.0" into my build.sbt? 
We started update. I will respond when results become available. 
I'm trying to follow the instructions on the [get started developing wiki page](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Getting-Started-Developing#javase).  Basically I'm running the  command:     However, when I do the same for 3.2.1 it fails. 
Hi @milosmns   I've tried with the numbers you can see in the code, 2000 - 2016 with 2008 as selected. The value that I get is 4016, obviously it is rounding up to 1 with the percentage. Are you sure mMinValue should be added to mMaxValue * percent? I would say it should be a subtract ^_^  Didn't review the logic too much so maybe I'm completely being a fool. If I have time next weekend I will play a bit overriding the method.

Thanks @ManfredKarrer , I saw the 2-minute timeout constant in the source code, however this doesn't match my practical observations, where the timeout message occurs after 60 seconds only (12:16:38 -> 12:17:38 in my log). It might be a different timeout condition.   Agreed that a socket timeout of 2 minutes makes perfect sense, on the other hand, a *data transfer completion* timeout (which is what seems to be happening here) makes more sense to be a function of the data size.   I use release v0.9.5 in my tests.
Problem is I do not have steps. It happens from time to time. I did not be able to reproduce it by unittest. I assume that some other thread is doing on those verticies I am trying to remove.  
Seems to be only SMP issue, i am using Big reactors 0.4.0 RC8 and forge .1208 / .1217 
The same issue does not occur. Only when I try to place a item exporter onto a drawer controller Does it crash
I think we can close this
Trying 0.12.0. Will reopen if it still happens.
It works! Thanks!
@jmmv It's very hard to say. We upgraded the production fleet to macOS Catalina on 2020-01-29 (but on testing CI already much earlier, I think since the beta), and the test worked fine until yesterday. I remember seeing the same failure occasionally during a presubmit of my CL in the testing org, but that was a completely unrelated change, then it went away a few days later and I was able to submit it.  Maybe it's a bug in macOS Catalina, but it's not clear what triggers it :|
Hi @jaikiran, I tested with Java 11 and Java 8 and both are working well.  Here is all the generated files in target with Java 13  I hope this will help.
I deleted images in my sd card . 
@wilkinsona Correct. The pathingJar was used to avoid issues with the command line on Windows. It is a option that can be enabled since grails 3.1.2 and seems to be using the jar tasks.   Let me work on a sample project and will let you know shortly. 
@opticod  yes sure :) 
When I opened the project again, the columns were there. I'm using the last version available for windows and it just automatically opens IE.

It was occurred before but it was expected as we haven't  graceful stop, so I used workaround for it. Issue is https://github.com/codenvy/codenvy/issues/1708 It affected only 3 workspaces at that time, but it depends on how many active workspaces we have in time of stop.
Log is here https://gist.github.com/NDelt/956e81ebf7f9f83e5180d8eb0d53db5c
OK Since yesteday I made some progress and found that it is related to recent helm behaviour. I almost succeeded to upgrade my Che on Windows 10:  helm install  --namespace che1 --set isHostBased=false  -f ./values/multi-user.yaml .  from che\deploy\kubernetes\helm\che. But Chart.yaml itself points to the old Che release and my Che version makes no progress. Imaging my table is not so close to the Gui room, who must care about Chart versioning? The person which installs Che for productive use should be able to take all stuff from corresponding helm repository and not from github. Something is missed in delivery chain :(. 
Hi. I've used another framework but to help you figure out the problem, I was using the latest SDK 0.5.2. I was also using SmartTab layout library (https://github.com/ogaclejapan/SmartTabLayout ) And I believe that was having some problems (Just guessing because of sliding_tabs). 
Build 564. [Chants.zip](https://github.com/quelea-projection/Quelea/files/3665987/Chants.zip)   
The problem I see on Ubuntu 16.04 is that our `uic` executable actually ends up linking to the system ICU libraries, rather than the ones shipped with Qt:    So I think that we might want to ensure that we are setting the `RUNPATH` appropriately for these shared objects as well, to ensure that things work in the absence of an `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` being set.  Also worth noting that `patchelf --set-rpath` actually attempts to set the `RUNPATH`, not the `RPATH`. If you wanted to set the `RPATH`, you'd have to use `patchelf --set-rpath --force-rpath`. Totally intuitive, I know :)
This isn't a design change, it's possible to encounter issues due to resources not being delisted:  https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/blob/c3e13171e6b4042c2c43caaca7d4e0334771e8e2/dev/com.ibm.ws.jdbc_fat_v43/test-applications/app43/src/jdbc/fat/v43/web/JDBC43TestServlet.java#L2088  In that example, the same connection is used over the transaction boundary. To fix this correctly from the JCA side, we need to receive the TMSUSPEND/TMRESUME flags so we can properly switch to a new physical connection.
Sure, I will do it. 
I have one query subscribed. It occurs on DatabaseSource and SqlitexDatabaseSource.  I thought that you could be right about thread pool but when I use Schedulers.from(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()) for all queries it doesn't work too. When I debug it I noticed that observable query is called on pool-1-thread-1 but update query is called on pool-2-thread-1.  
hey i left the office right after opening this issue. if it is ok i'll check on monday on one of our other eclipse installations. 
1. here is how we transfer UUID to messageId, it works okay  3. this issue rarely happens, the previous one occurs about 1 week after the process started I have change log level from ERROR to INFO for package 'com.microsoft.azure.servicebus' and will keep monitor.  
Indeed it was. My development branch was not up-to-date -.- Closed as duplicate. 
Code: http://pastebin.com/d7MjxiFX  NPCController line 64 (from the error) is 'npc.spawn(location);'

Yes please 
which lua files no i don't know... i begin to download the downlord version and launch game using it. Then with another problem a moderator told me how to launch FAF offline. And at this moment i posted on discord the new problem that some lua files are missing. So i tried to launch a game with old FAF . And i get a update of my game with all lua files.
Thanks for your quick reply. There are errors, I took a screenshot from the log: ![screenshot_2015-07-26-00-23-52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4226042/8891515/6f27741c-332d-11e5-8dc9-62172cd2d055.png)  Otherwise I'm using a Fairphone with Android 4.2.2 Not sure what info I could provide else? 
Same with 1.0.0.CR1. (repo updated)
I'd already updated to Feed the Beast 8.1.1, and with it, updated TT to #963, so I'll watch for any new errors. 
As far as I'm aware there doesn't seem to come up anything special in console when it happens.

Right now it will only happen for unexpected errors, e.g., SAM is down or we can't connect to it at all for some other reason, like a firewall rule, or they make a breaking change to their API.  If you get an authorization error with SAM, e.g., because you are not registered with FC, we will return an empty list.  In other words, for unlikely/unexpected events, that still end up occasionally happening.

Hello Sergey,  I download the version that was build on cloudbees. Build #32  https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm-USSD-Gateway/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/  The USSD application that the GW connects to is a servlet very much in the same manner as the example HTTP servlet. See attached code.  I am running the USSD application in glashfish. I will have to have a look if I can see how many connection are open.  [ussd_application.txt](https://github.com/RestComm/ussdgateway/files/314057/ussd_application.txt) 
Thanks for the reply.  I modified the pom of the sample application as per the comment you referred to, and updated the application to directly create the `CommonsXsdSchemaCollection`:    without throwing an exception. I would've expected it to throw an exception?
@awalter17 The `return void` problem with the `Chunker` op was a legitimate bug. It's fixed now! Thanks @ctrueden!  The `FFTSize` actually is correct in returning a list, but we had to look in the `AbstractFFTSize` method to figure this out - it has [two ItemIO.BOTH](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imagej/ops/fft/size/AbstractFFTSize.java#L48-52) parameters, so it effectively has two return values. The framework was just automatically converting these into a `List` 
Unfortunately I don't have the environment or the data anymore so I'm not sure how many segments there were.  As for Nulls, I'm not sure, we don't really process the data, it's more of a load test.
I made a slimmed down project that demonstrates the same behavior: [link to repo](https://github.com/bpgray/spring-cloud-consul-test)  The application context runs on port 8080 and the management context runs on port 8081 - Both the application and management context are registered with consul on port 8081, rather than their respective ports. - The consul service ids for both services contain '8080' in their string, rather than their respective ports. - For the application health check, the url contains port 8081. I'd actually like this health check to be on port 8080, but understand this might be a bit atypcial and can address by overriding the healthCheckUrl with an application.yml entry.

@yegor256 sounds good, I assume the build is not unique across talks though? I think people would prefer simplicity, i.e. a simple build number from which in the best case they even can generate an URL to the rultor log. (CircleCI does this.)

The update task does nothing in my project. There is quite a difference between the code installed by ML 9.0-5 and the master branch in the github project. I am going to look at this again now to see if i can resolve.
I think resources should be included. When I add a framework in Xcode - for example FacebookSDK.framework - the only thing I have to do (according to their instructions) is to add the framework and other dependent frameworks (CoreGraphics.framework...). 
//TSV parser settings defined TsvParserSettings parserSettings = new TsvParserSettings(); parserSettings.setNullValue(""); ... ... TsvParser parser = new TsvParser(parserSettings);  //Model class for CSV @Parsed(field="A") private String a; @Parsed(field="B") private String b; @Parsed(field="C") private String c;  My CSV has feilds: A\tB  So here is my scenario: If I leave a column value (eg. A) empty then an empty string is set for that as the default null value. However if the field as defined in the model is not present in the CSV(i.e C), then the parser seems to completely ignore that and does not set the default null value as an empty string.

Hello, thank for your reply  I have upgraded to the version 3.5.7 and I have adjusted my timeout config     It's look a little bit better, I can't see anymore the "org.redisson.client.RedisException" but long time after the failover (15-20 minutes)  I still have many "org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException" with the message  > RedisConnection@2122101942 [redisClient=[addr=redis://57.190.12.72:6399], channel=[id: 0xa05ade45, L:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:53834 !

@JamesDrummond: unfortunately I cannot upgrade to 4.7.0. It would be great if you could try to reproduce the problem on 4.6.2. Thank you.  
No, the plane is completely gone. It's possible that I just couldnt find the entity because of how fast it is, but im pretty sure if you exit a plane it stop immediately, and yeah it logs it where the plane disappeared. 
@pekingme @leticiarossi I haven't had issues with this either since updating to v1.1.0, so maybe I should just close it? 
sorry for delay, see below:

Failure  ### Environment data  Android version: 4.4.2 Device model:  Samsung SM G900A Stock or customized system: Stock that came with the phone, though it is rooted. ownCloud app version: 1.6.2 ownCloud server version: 7.0.3  ### Logs  #### Web server error log    Please help me, I'll take a solution that will work for either the owncloud app or a webdav client. I just have to have owncloud access on my phone. Half of why I even use cloud drives is because they are great to transfer data to and from phones. Also, my owncloud is hosted on a Windows 7 PC running the Wamp server. Please don't say I need linux, I don't want to use linux. Thank you for any and all help.

Thanks for the fix. For completeness; I am using the PostgreSQL driver.
That's basically it. Empty lines are proprietary lines which I have removed.  
No, they are totally different (beside that they both are subclasses of Component of course).   It might be related to the usage of "HasParameter", but not sure, didn't had time to check that.

Possible -- this wdl worked a month or two ago, on cromwell 22 or 23, maybe 24.
Let me update the changelog (my achilles heel) ;-)
I tried with Edge, Chrome, and Firefox. It displayed incorrectly in all of them.
Tested it with only: animania-1.12.2-1.5.1.1 CraftStudio-1.0.0.93-mc1.12-alpha on Forge 14.23.4.2705 I found it while playing a private modpack of my own, but trimmed the issue to this with testing.
Yes, I am sure because I chose the same password that protected AndOtps start and which I used for months. I am still struggling to get a logcat (didn't root the phone by intention) and will upload it as soon as I have it
Hi @serge-rider , I already JNA installed in it. It's the same installation that I do with the workaround you send to me with the Orbit repository.  here is the log I have when I open a new editor:  
@macdonst thx a lot for the explanation!  I ran into problem conflicting with the `cordova-plugin-google-analytics` plugin, which doesn't look maintained anymore btw. 
That throws a...   > "Cannot find data type NUMBER."   ... error (at least on my MSSQL 2012 server). Guess you would have to add a new "else if" for the "MsSqlDialect" and then the SQL should be:  `ALTER TABLE jv_snapshot ADD version BIGINT` 
Sorry, I tried to use the 1.7.10 dual wielding system, but it not work in 1.12.2 version because the mod use the minecraft native dual wielding system.
Perhaps anvil damage would have been a better term, but I was referring to how using an anvil has a chance to turn it into a chipped anvil, then damaged anvil, then being completely destroyed.
@mbogoevici Oh, that might be it. I was following a tutorial in which they're all under a single SpringBootApplication main class. 
Sorry for that, I think it should be Forge, that's my fault and I have changed the title. I recorded a gif to explain this. ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17660052/61802061-6cfc1a80-ae62-11e9-8c62-c71e9a1b0be3.gif) This also happens in fire pit.

That bug seems to be how they were doing it. The user with no stacking privileges acquired a single item after shift-clicking a stack of items that were not normally able to stack, and that single item was an infinite item. 
I haven't used Tox but can certainly give it a go. How shall i find you on there?
Yes it still happens. I've noticed it usually occurs if you minimize rsbot while script selection is loading. 
Downloaded and ran MT 1.5.0. Same problem. Tried it with Ctrl instead of Command. No difference.
Thanks -- I'll make that fix. What is the effect (if any) of enabling term_vector storage at the top-level as I have done here? 
Sure - https://nofile.io/f/qOcGSTrXqkE/minecraft.zip Mods included - just in case.  PS. Also, if land at pad and dismantle/remove rocket - pad still mark as used.  Not sure if this can be fixed.
Hey guys,  I just tried it out with v2.0.0, the function is executed without any exception and the outcome is the one expected. I will do a few more tests later to see if it works with other cases.  OS is Windows 8.1  Thanks. 
Hi @pascalav, thanks for looking into this, and for your detailed analysis.  First, I don't think we want to change any of the logic around when `isValid` is called, primarily because the existing `of` and `with` methods have a specific contract, which always returns a valid `InterledgerAddress`.   Here's a summary of the current naming conventions:  *  `Interface.of()` methods are like a constructor, whereby you supply all of the required fields to construct an object, and you get a fully-constructed, valid, immutable object back (typically a static-method on the Interface). * `Interface.from()` methods are like a factory-method, whereby you supply some "raw materials" that can be used to derive everything necessary to call `.of()` (typically a static-method on the Interface). * `Interface.with()` methods are called on an already-constructed object, append some information or data, and return a a fully-constructed, valid, immutable object (typically a non-static or default method on the Interface or abstract implementation of an interface). Note that most interfaces in Quilt do not have a "with" method, because most objects are not appendable in the way `InterledgerAddress` is. * `Interface.builder()` methods return an instance of an immutables-project-generated builder that can be used to mutate data before actual construction. For example, `InterledgerAddressBuilder`. * `*Builder.from()`: This has a specific meaning in immutables-project-generated builders. See [here](http://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#builder).   With that in mind, `InterledgerAddress#of` is  meant to function more like a constructor, and _not_ like a builder. In other words, when you call "of", you will receive a complete, fully-valid `InterledgerAddress`. Likewise, the contract for `InterledgerAddress#with` will always start with a valid `InterledgerAddress` and result in a new ILP address with an additional suffix.  Thus, in order to accomplish something closer to the builder-pattern that you identified above (where callers can append portions of an ILP address before actual construction) we have several options:  1. Do nothing. Force callers to construct their ILP address as a String before calling `InterledgerAddress#of`.   1. Extend the builder generated by Immutables to support this functionality, and then just have developers call `InterledgerAddress#builder`, and use that thing with the new "just append a part of your ILP address" extension method (Unfortunately, I don't think [Immutables](immutables.github.io) supports this in the builder out of the box, but it might worth investigating. If you can't easily customize the generated builders, perhaps it would be worth logging an enhancement in the immutables project). 1. Define our own custom builder that extends the Immutables-generated builder, and is then returned from the static method `InterledgerAddress#builder`.  Overall, I haven't run into a case where I've wanted to gradually assemble an ILP address using the `InterledgerAddress` or `InterledgerAddressBuilder` classes. Instead, a much more common use-case I've encountered is where I have an ILP prefix String (already assembled) that might look like, `g.us.foo.`, and I need to append an account to it (e.g., "myaccount"), so I will often only be doing this:    With all that said, I vote for Option 1 above, since I've never encountered a use-case for option 2 or 3 and it's not clear if Option 2 is even possible.  Thoughts?
Looking at the stack trace, it appears to be something with installing the SDK    You probably can't reproduce it locally since your system has already been setup. This was on a new install.
The destop client is working fine. Webdav is working fine too.

SecurityProperties.user is an example.

Hey Tommi, I think I generated a PR for this - I didn’t merge as I thought I’d let you have a look first :) I’m happy to merge it though if you like...  Chris

No package with `diabetes` was loaded. And the dataset I was interested in was in package `mclust`. But you can try <kbd>F1</kbd> with any other object which is in a package which is installed but not loaded. E.g., function `tidy`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12725868/61072343-bf2d4c80-a41b-11e9-87fb-767dc75e2525.png)  If `tidyverse` is loaded, the problem is not present: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12725868/61072434-f56acc00-a41b-11e9-8d4f-f5291dcbc912.png)  
@FabianTerhorst here's my interceptors, added as Interceptor and networkInterceptor respectively:

Only Cumulus TV is installed. Asus Nexus Player, running Android 6.0 Build MRA58N. 
It should :/ Closing this one, will reopen it in lightblue-rest. 
Absolutely. Both the nodes and edges files are plain text csv files. I've put both into a tar.gz, but it's still too large to upload here. How can I share it?
Still crashes with java 7 http://pastebin.com/EqpEN3ZC

]run this under eclipse not intellij, and show me screen capture
Also, I tried to upload image with Android 6.0 but the image failed (similar to the issue on 5.0) to upload after several attempt. 
Yes, that's the book, and I see the icon of my friend Mara Greengrass (http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/14216097) in the place of the cover icon.  Is there some XML output which I could send you to help diagnose this? 
Yes, that would be great! In the meantime, a small note in the docs would help. 
I'll retest as soon as I get an opportunity.  Are there any particular logging settings I need to turn on? 
This is a paid dockerhub account with private dockers support. Not sure if this matters. 
@solohsu this is the log which I was success bootup after reflash Ed Xposed and Riru. Should the implementation be more inefficiency to detect old and new version (apk) while checking modules enabled from module list?
The effort to modernize the logging layer is being scaled back (result of some discussions), as it will cause other issues in the compat layer.   I'm considering this closed. 
I"m not sure what you need - I included the error message I got back.  I'll add the statements used to create the objects, is that what you mean?

I'm using the latest version available via the twitch/curse client.  I tried loading up just now to see if I can get this info for you and naturally it didn't happen this time. I'll keep my eyes peeled.  The tooltip had your normal error line for when a part id isn't found in the network but I don't remember the wording. The display gui had the red X and the same message.  Further info: The display screen on the left in the screenshot is using a variable card reading a single slot's item from the apiary (the queen slot) when the problem happened that slot was empty. The display screen on the right in the screenshot is using the list of items from the apiary, this showed the big red X on the screen and the back of the screen was red.   I don't know if WHAT I was using it for matters but there you go!  I'll try to get more info as soon as/if it happens again.
@sbernard31 Sorry for the inconvenience, I think I found the reason why I've had so much trouble with this.  After testing with a custom model that only has a single instance string resource, I found the following:  If I request only the resource, i.e. /3000/0/0, it works. Changing the resource to opaque, it also works.  But if I request the instance, i.e. /3000/0, it doesn't work, independently of using a string or opaque resource. 
Didn't knew i could disable custom window chrome lol so ty for letting me know! The "iconify" button doesn't work only when custom window chrome is enabled. It works fine when disabled.

I did the both methods and the error keeps showing, i even tried to invalidate cache and restart AS: EmptyThrowable: Null child action in group Toolbar Run Actions () of class class com.intellij.openapi.actionSystem.DefaultActionGroup, id=ADB Uninstall  Im using AS 1.4 stable and osx 10.11.1 
Well, i checked out the ftb wiki and it says that the version that im using is "rv2.stable build 1" i dont know if says alot but yeah... i have the newest version feed the beast client.  Maybe i should mention that im using a stirling engine from Ender IO to power the ME controller, maybe that is the issue?  Thanks for answering! :) 
I've died several times.  Also, restarting the game has no effect.
I copied the dependency from the README.md, which is currently listed as 0.1.10. It synced just fine so I assumed I was using 0.1.10.   `compile 'com.openlocate:openlocate:0.1.10@aar'`
This might be related to some race conditions regarding logging and similar "cache modifying" actions. Caches get overwritten more often than they should.

Here it is. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ipujmq38sr70ikz/BiomeOutput.zip?dl=0  I however don't see a genWeight in the output. 
I do have "always run in the background" on as well... All the same settings I've had before
https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/blob/master/plugins/factory-plugin/src/factory-plugin.ts#L17  is invoked at every browser refresh. 
I am using version 1.0.3. The issue is with the "logger" definition.  When I create the logger as below, the application runs without issue: logger("com.abc.def", INFO, ["FILE"]) root(WARN, ["FILE", "cloud-watch"])  But as soon as I use the "cloud-watch" appender in the logger definition, the application fails to start: logger("com.abc.def", INFO, ["FILE", "cloud-watch"]) root(WARN, ["FILE", "cloud-watch"])
Redisson 1.1.3 recompiled with Jackson-core downgraded to 2.1.4. Dropwizard framework depends on it. 
Remember that elk.core and elk.algs has to be compilable by gwt. I therefore vote against using xtend code in those parts of elk.   I'm not sure I get the problem you mention. Why would a dependency to xbase help elk.core to accept a unary `-`? The generated code shouldn't contain any xbase calls, should it? 
Reinstalled the latest update. The Hitomi (webp file extension) source is giving me the same issue.
@tsmaeder I see this in both Che 5.10.0 and Che 5.14.0

Yeah, I know.  I can add a bit of documentation about when it will expire.  I'm wondering if we can also get someone (our co-op student?) to look into re-building it without the expiry date.  Or, could ask NCBI about that, though I have no idea who I'd contact.  Imported from GitLab.  Originally posted on 2015/11/18 08:22AM
I can change item 0x2 to something Leif can inherit and see what happens when I get to that point. Or are you wanting me to check item 0x67?
@Scottmitch I've debugged it and found out the reason of the problem. After that I had tracked changes of 4.1.0.Beta5 version and I understood, that it is not a bug :) Apologize for the noise!  For the version 4.1.0.Beta5, according to #3712, I need to call `client.ctx.flush()` after all writes to the channel: https://github.com/idelpivnitskiy/aerogear-webpush-server/blob/4.1.0.Beta6-SNAPSHOT/server-netty/src/main/java/org/jboss/aerogear/webpush/netty/WebPushFrameListener.java#L203-L213 And it solved my problem.  For the current version, according to #3860, I also need to call `client.encoder.flowController().writePendingBytes();`.  Isn't it? If everything is correct, the issue could be closed. 
Just attempted with:     http://10.17.36.12/mjpg/video.mjpg , same behavior. Attempted to just enter "10.17.36.12" - http:// was automatically prepended within the dialog box, but still same behavior. 
@StevenArzt Please push the `TrapSplitter` class to the repository :) 
Verified that it is fixed. Working now under both Forge and Cauldron servers. Thanks! 
Hi @filiphr, yes we have `unmappedTargetPolicy = ReportingPolicy.ERROR` and it compiles. For example, if I remove the annotation `@Mapping(target = "isAdded", constant = "true")` the build fails with compilation error. So it is problem only of the plugin
exactly, and will do. Just let me start Minecraft from scratch so the log isn't quite as massive XD. this was on a server I set up, but I expect it'll also happen in single player, unless SpongeForge is causing an issue somehow. If I can't get it to happen in singleplayer, I'll also give you the server log, obviously
While that would still definitely be a bug worthy of a ticket, multiple logins does not work. I've tried upwards of 20 times and I get the same Ldap error messages in the server log but on the client Ldap config UI all works smoothly. 
It always doing it everytime i start the server,i did not use the /reload command,nopey 
Hi,   Yes that makes sense, I guess the only scenario I can think of is if if the last modified fetched in a header only request and is ignored because of this strategy. 
The problem began since updating the client to 1.4.26v10, it has never happened before.  I tested with Windswept Heat, and Kodama´s Reach.   The game indicates that i´m waiting for other player to pass priority back to me, meanwhile the other players report that they are waiting for me to search my library, but the window never opens.  Other detail seems to be that the log indicates that i began searching my library.  Tested this problem with some friends, and they have the same problem to.
Hi, thanks for the answer.  I'm using 1.4.1 from maven. 
Cyberware Version Alpha0.2.9. loaded as part of The Raxpack 2, for 1.11.2:  [https://mods.curse.com/modpacks/minecraft/263527-raxpack-2](https://mods.curse.com/modpacks/minecraft/263527-raxpack-2)
The plugin is 0.0.20. It doesn't seem to trigger on load, but it does trigger quite a few times (my last editing session had 6 triggers between start and clear of the error). Either way, a decision was made to refactor to a JSON model instead of YAML (for other reasons) so the problem hasn't reoccurred. 
It works. Thanks!

This issue has been fixed with latest chectl release and worked fine in couple of my clusters.  Thanks for the fix.
Oh, sorry wrong issue number. Comment edited. After debugging of testConcurrentConsistencyEnforcement, I can say, this is same problem.
Sure. Here is the `index.xhtml`:    I set a breakpoint on the line `int i = 1` to see if the debugger stops. It stops only if I use the `commandButton`.
Same issue with our fork than with your fix, there was a misobservation when trying our fork.  The misobservation is really strange.  When executing TWICE this command:   
1. i got an old extension return 1 when a specific method is called, and the new extension returns 2 2. upload old extension first, the return value is 1. 3. upload the new extension, there was an "OK" with "_extensions" 4. the screen on companion doesn't even get a refresh (so the components did not changed, just like nothing happened.) so the return value is still 1. 5. then i modify a name of a existing component, the screen refreshed, but the loaded extension is still the old one. (returns 1) 6. i disconnect the companion, and reconnect it back, it then returns 2.
@kneth Sure.    LogCat actual output:  > Contacts which have at least one email which is from a real person & active: 1  LogCat expected output:  > Contacts which have at least one email which is from a real person & active: 0 
Yes this was the cause. Some pools use Usage instead of CollectionUsage. See my PR that fixes it, at least for Java 11 on HotSpot
For your information: this error remains even in Snapshot 1032. Hoped pull request 3179 would fix it.

> Does this bug occur in all games?  with a quick test it seems it only happens with touchscreen games. Currently playing GT Racing 2 The Real Car Experience and Spider-Man Ultimate Power and both have the same problem. but Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party doesn't suffer the same problem, but it's a non-touchscreen game
Thanks for quick response @aslakhellesoy !  I scanned through the execution logs and found that following is the only Stack Trace Available -  Your block takes 3 arguments, but the Regexp matched 2 arguments. (Cucumber::Glue::ArityMismatchError) step_definitions/subscription_allocations.rb:90:in `/^I create a foo (5.5|5.4|5.3|5.2) Subscription Allocation( with a( future dated)? subscription attached)?$/' features/foo/subscription_allocations/subscription_allocation_details.feature:153:in `And I create a foo 5.6 Subscription Allocation'  Hope it helps to trace the issue.
my only use case is the `complete` one.   I see no problem with adding the exception argument to `after`. Having only one is less confusing.
Hi joschi,   i will test it with the next beta version.   Thanks 
Many thanks @MichaelRoeder , your suggestion fixed it. But I'm still having problems running gerbil. I want to add an annotator as a service through the web ui. This annotator is running locally on localhost, but when I add it I get a 405 error even though I can connect to it normally via standard web interfaces (e.g. the browser). Is there any documentation on how to add an annotator (via uri or in some other way)

I can provide a pull request for that problem. I just have to investigate another method in this class, because "KNXCoreTypeMapper.toTypeClass()" is called from two different locations.  Maybe it's best to log a warning message, that the given DPT is not supported. Unfortunately, it is not mentioned in the documentation of the binding that only some specific DPTs are working. A link in the wiki to https://github.com/openhab/openhab/blob/master/bundles/binding/org.openhab.binding.knx/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/knx/internal/dpt/KNXCoreTypeMapper.java would already be a good hint. 
Hi, sorry for the long delay. I didn't find time to work on my project or yours in the last weeks. Glad you could reproduce the crash.  
Will do that! Fix is coming up. 
@philwebb  This is for actuator endpoints. Please find sample code here https://github.com/JagmohanSharma/SpringBoot2Issues. I added custom content negotiation configuration but disabled it. Now it is a plain spring boot configured and have set `spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.favor-path-extension=true` with spring boot 2.0.1. So here test `ContentNegotiationTest` is getting failed where I am executing info endpoint.  This works fine if we use spring boot 2.0.0 OR set `spring.mvc.contentnegotiation.favor-path-extension=false` with 2.0.1 itself.
Oh, sorry then I was probably using older one on this server. 
Sure : 1- Go on https://regex101.com/ 2- type in the regexp part : \w+ (word matching) 3- The text part : "Éabc" 3- You can change the modifier on the right on the regexp part to get U for unicode.  You will see as a word Éabc with the modifier, and abc without the modifier. The same thing happens inside openrefine with UTF8/16 file. It is not a bug but an interpretation of the regexp. In fact, the problem is far more complex than this simple example. If you want a complete explanation on unicode regexp, please this document is exceptionnal : https://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html. I invite you to read on the dot operator to understand why it could be useful to have a U modifier.   I find a way to get good results with the \p{} tag, but sometimes it would be far more simple to do it with the modifier. By the way, a very interesting problem for my own experience.   Thank you for your interest. 
You can replicate on the simplest model, example below.  The error occurs when the array element to $pull does not exist. MongoDB shell correctly reports nModified as 0 but the mongo driver's WriteResult incorrectly reports 1 because it reads nMatched as 1 (ignoring nModified).    and check the `UpdateResults`.

No this is about you having to manually set permissions on entity classes before a user can do anything. It should be runAsSystem so If a user has edit rights on an entity he/she can annotate that entity without problems  On 14 September 2015 at 20:59, Morris Swertz notifications@github.com wrote:  > What would be the expected behavior?

I'm using RO as a test file since it has a handful of imports. This is all in Clojure, but it shouldn't make a difference since it's using the same methods... I threw in a quick `save-ontology` method, and converted the OBO format to RDF/XML, and there are no import statements.  Here's what I'm starting with:

Hi Harald-  Thanks for the email reply! I'd be happy to share it, what is the best way to do this? It is over 30MB (~48000 sequences, of rhesus macaque, Plasmodium vivax, and human/sheep cytokeratin contaminants, and a few proteases), and includes reversed sequences (starting with XXX_ in the fasta file, from prior use of MSGF+). I had to process it to remove dots (stop codons in ~20 macaque protein sequences) and some keratins that were giving errors, so I'm (unfortunately) not surprised. It could be that the XXX_ entries are causing problems as well.   Any advice on how better to construct it would be appreciated!

Adding the timeout indeed improved the response time to recovery. It's still a bit longer than I'd like, but considerably better.  Thanks!
making a video and uploading it would be problematic for me. also this effect does not always happen
I dont seem to have that file in my neo4j setup 
Hi, thanks to take a look.  it happens in a Samsung with v21 and in the emulator v26. As mentioned is hard to reproduce manually so I add a breakpoint on the onCreate, on that moment I turn the device and continue the debugger.  What it might be important to say is that I am initializing the adapter onActivityCreated inside the fragment.     So, what I can see with the debugger is:  Activity onCreate -> Turn device -> onAcrtivityCreated -> Init adapter -> Activity recreates -> onActivityCreated is called again (new view, new adapter) -> init new adapter -> Post runnable from old adapter is called -> NullPointer because it misses the reference.

@michalgr  yes ! It is just like what you say! 
Thanks for the response  Hm, seems the bug is on my side then. I'll try running with only IC2 and GT, also will try updating forge

@ashimokawa  Okay, thanks. I guess the timing is just a coincidence then.  @danielegobbetti  I live in Finland and our daylight saving time change is in October, so no. Both all-day and non-all-day events get duplicated, I just chose to screenshot those as they aren't from my personal calendar.
Disable auto-build does not sound like an option. We rather need special treatment and problem markers for these cases.
Sorry for the late response, I haven't had the chance to test it before. It is still not working and I think that the issue is that bluetooth state receiver is unregistered once bluetooth is turned off, meaning the new code won't be called in case described in the issue.  `close()` is called once bluetooth is turned off: https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/blob/135a7774e26d7bae61c13d584c8905c5c737fee5/ble/src/main/java/no/nordicsemi/android/ble/BleManager.java#L207-L249 and that method is unregistering bluetooth receiver: https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-BLE-Library/blob/135a7774e26d7bae61c13d584c8905c5c737fee5/ble/src/main/java/no/nordicsemi/android/ble/BleManager.java#L729-L736
Yes, I agree with your analysis that a fix for https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/837 would also solve this. 
Of course I killed the apps:-) 
Are you referring to the following example in the [ComplexAccessPoint.xml](https://github.com/iipc/openwayback/blob/master/wayback-webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ComplexAccessPoint.xml#L65-88)?  I have not tested it.  That is a database driven functionality, no?  That was my assumption, which is why I didn't test, as we don't have the database back-end.  If not, I could test it out, but am not sure what else would need to be configured for the Oracle features to work.  Also, we do know that this is not specific to StaticMapExclusionFilterFactory, as it is also an issue with StaticListExclusionFilterFactory, at least that's what my testing suggested. 
Yes, it is. 
@samhaink Could you try ssh to one of the container and see if you're able to retrieve the location info? Use `wget --header "Metadata-Flavor: Google" "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/instance/zone"`.  @mayurkale22 has tried to reproduce this error but it looks like everything is working fine with our GKE instance.
Yes ! This fix the problem 
Hi, I was using 4.2.2 before. It happens with almost every HTTPS request I believe on API 21, maybe with some exception as github pages worked fine.  Will try to make a test now.
@psxlover  I can't make other types of facades because when i place a cobble structure pipe on the assembly table i can only make ExtraBiomesXL block facades. And as you can see in the image, i don't even placed a block in it, so it's definetly a bug :/ 
Strange, now it also worked. I can’t remember how it occured anymore. 
@tglman thanks for making it clear! It's correct, that the orginal version of the database is from one of my previous OrientDB instances, but it should still fall within `2.1.*` scope.  I am using [PhpOrient](https://github.com/Ostico/PhpOrient) as the client interface. Do you know if they use old serialization format?

Yeah, I have the same version of the helper extensions. I must be doing something wrong; also re-sideloaded a new version of the release APK, re-enabled dev tools, and still getting the timeout. Hrm; I'll look more tomorrow.  Also, cc @joshmarinacci for discussions on using dev tools w/ FxR

Thanks for your quick response :) Sure, here you have the stack trace:  
1) 2.1.3  2) I am not using an encrypted library 
Hi , Thank you first. Yes, this error will definitely appear every other night. 
Yes, same error :___(
@quanticc I can no longer reproduce this issue with this commit, thank you a lot! 
Yes, I do have that set.
I tried it with yesterday  and also @jvasileff , but let me try again right now  
5.0.23
I tried with the v0.12 binary release and found the same error:   
Checked recently with latest master, controller Main is running fine.
rescan twice with the same results  filescanner is ok and find the new movie  jetty doesn't recieve anything from the scanner and the new movie isn't stored in stage_file  
I mean using maven-git-versioning-extension with maven-3.3.9.
@jefftinker  I can see same configuration as you see on your device. @wvpaf  Secure Boot is enable in my device.

@davidjgonzalez Hi David, its DAM Update Asset. I'm doing some tests for a future migration which will be at a much larger scale.
1.0 for MC 1.7.2, as it says. Not sure about is it 0.6 or 0.7 from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293503-underground-biomes-constructs  I've also tried some other version, usure which exactly. I'll try some more other versions soon [didn't actually have much time for that =D], just notified in case it is useful to support compatibility with that version.  I can send you the .jar file of the UBC I used. And in case it's a single version bug - ... Well, I'm stupid then) 
It is the same phone. First with CM 4.4.1 and now I installed a new ROM because I had some issues: http://forum.xda-developers.com/devdb/project/?id=7565  Because the RAM is limited processes are closed very fast after switching the window. I only recognized it at full syncs or when big media files are up/downloading.  Sry forgot to attach the debug info.  AnkiDroid Version = 2.5beta27  Android Version = 5.1.1  ACRA UUID = 35c33b2d-da48-4f7e-9f51-88ae7a3e8e9d  Do those two devices have something in common that might differ from a standard Android system? Are you using a custom rom, perhaps?  — Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3902#issuecomment-160562217 . 
I haven't tried that scenario.  The campaign was already loaded before the players connected.  I'll ask someone to help me try that scenario, and get back with you.  This is the campaign with an empty [Empty Map with Two Tokens.zip](https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/files/3189348/Empty.Map.with.Two.Tokens.zip)  maps and two tokens.

None to be noted.  Also, it seems to be working now. Maybe a one-time event?
 Yes Sir, here they are: I made the GAP pack into a zip. file because it wont let me transfer jar. files. [crash-2020-02-05_23.13.42-client.txt](https://github.com/DonBruce64/MinecraftTransportSimulator/files/4166407/crash-2020-02-05_23.13.42-client.txt) [Golden+Airport+Pack+[Immersive-Vehicles]+0.2.2.zip](https://github.com/DonBruce64/MinecraftTransportSimulator/files/4166434/Golden%2BAirport%2BPack%2B.Immersive-Vehicles.%2B0.2.2.zip)  
Both notepad and word-pad give me only blank characters, no text. What do you use to open them? 
@phantomjinx  I've tried it with this [service](https://services.odata.org/TripPinRESTierService/) with generated . the server is the same for both the read and update operations. There are no credentials for the service (just need to open the link and copy the url from browser - there is a unique key so noone can modify the instance a person is using). The read operation is working as supposed, but when at the data mapper step it has error. See attached screenshot below  ![Screenshot from 2019-05-28 15-30-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46523434/58481861-8b44e300-815d-11e9-88df-724013aa9263.png)  I can try this integration with the service we use in our tests (the service is based on olingo tutorial project).
I found the "bug", I sent the log with netcat and this is cause that error. I switched to nxlog and now the input can't stop. Thanks
Hi,  I believe that the problem is happening because the plugin is trying to match the `/*` with a `*/`. In my case I have only the former inside a String.  I believe the following code can reproduce the problem:    By the way I'm using IntelliJ IDEA CE 13.1.3  Thanks! 
I am using 1.0.1. 
yes i'm in the latest version. It wasn't showing additional effects in the description text. It was still working as a half health weapon though. 
When I am using tracker on my cell phone. If I click on the device that I am trying to track than it saysthe error and it's not moving 
The php logs don't report any errors! All log files I can find (Nextcloud log, php log, php-fpm log, nginx error log) are empty even though I get the error multiple times a Day. I don't get it always though... I wrote a small script provoke the error using curl, I'll report the Output as soon as I get any!
No upgrades, I have seen it in three machines, have not tried more.
Thanks for the quick response @rwinch  Sure, I'll be glad to work on this :) This will be my first contribution to the project, so it might take me a little bit longer than expected, to get familiarized with the contributor's guidelines I'll come back as soon as I have the PR ready
I have added Optifine 1.10.2 HD_U_D6 because my computer isn't the best with AMD Radeon Quad Core HD 7660D. I am running Win10 and 64bit Java allocating 4.5GB of RAM, using FTB launcher (I have had horrible time with Curse launcher because of my poor internet), playing single player (not online server). I didn't check the console at the time, gonna have to check after it happens again. Other than Optifine, no other alterations to/of the mods.
All config files for MobEscape are in the ZIP file i attached on the first post
This appears resolved in the latest branch. 
In other word, if I click superLike button some times(eg：12 times) quickly and in a short time, the cardStackView would swipe to top direction( this is not the bug), but when I raise up my finger, the cardStackView cannot stop immediately and still swipe to top some time more(this is the bug I find).  (This is only in Ver.2.1.0( not find in Ver.2.0.0))
I just sent you an email with all the data to reproduce the issue.
@SecUpwN , My pleasure!  > Adding getprop -  AIMSICD internal Log & Logcat.  Hope it can be of any help. Need more ? let me know...

Perfect. Works now! Thanks. 👍 
This was actually a UNIX issue - the JVM needs to be started with -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8. This is running on matrix and should propagate to all the SciGraph servers when they're reloaded. 
@gsmet I will do it later today, but I searched a bit deeper into the issue and I would like to show you my findings.  I found that the `MongoClient` and the `ReactiveMongoClient` have a difference as to when they are instantiated and called for the first time.  This piece of code in the `MongoClientProducer` is called only once.    However, in the case of the `ReactiveMongoClient`, the `configureTheClient()` is called *after* the initial call to the `axle()` method. The `axle()` method returns a null object, this object is cached because of the `@produces` annotation, and but the `ReactiveMongoClient` is initialized after the initial call.  This is not the case with the plain MongoClient, and this is the reason for the failure I believe.  
@David-Development The crash was just happening with v0.3.0, not with "-SNAPSHOT" version. Yes it seems the problem is not entirely related to SSO but with system permission granting system. It's happening on all devices with Android >= 6 and <= 7.1  @tobiasKaminsky Yep:  This is an Android Studio project.  Thank you both for your answer!
Thanks for the reply @ivansenic .  Yes, this is happening constantly. I have three instances of a service-connected as an agent to the CMR. Each invocation of a service takes around 2 seconds and there are few thousand requests that are in pipeline. The error comes in very early during execution. In CMR, I've got a Remote Manual Server Sensor and a Timer Sensor and trying to instrument few classes (around 5) in a package.  I've tried assigning Direct Memory on CMR and agent side but with no luck. 
i removed all other mods, and made a whole new mc directory to install it in, but still crashes, ill reinstall jei to see if that fixes it.
It is hard to say because the file`/home/tdurieux/git/patch-clustering/Expression.java:348` does not exist and I have no file called Expression in my project. But it is maybe related to me useage of the DefaultJavaPrettyPrinter : https://github.com/lascam-UFU/automatic-diff-dissection/blob/master/src/main/java/add/features/detector/repairpatterns/CopyPasteDetector.java#L39
Yes, it returns correct headers along with 401 code if there is no `authorization` header. Which is a bit inconsistent, to my mind because responses for a request without header and with the "incorrect" header should be the same - 401.
Thank you for the fast reaction!   I'm using 2.1.0. I just started using (and loving it) and use it with kafka 2.2.0. I managed to get it running by explicitly removing the transitive lombok dependency.
Here ya go: 
> Can you tell me what should happen after the spec gets edited? Should we call the same API we call when creating an API Provider based integration to get the integration object back? If yes, does it mean that the previous integration will effectively be discarded, with all its changes?

Thanks for investigating. This is the ferry http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/3500103  Right now I cannot see any issues with the tags of the ferry. The only interesting part is the TMC.   
@sabbyanandan yes, this needs to be back-ported as well. Updated it to #2632 
You can do the same thing in your interceptor by calling `System.nanoTime()` ! 
My language does not transfer the values from the arguments array to the frame, no.  Writing to the frame slot has no measurable benefit, and only drawbacks for interpreter speed. Arguments can't be changed, so, there is no real benefit from specializing on their type.  See for interpreter speed overhead: http://stefan-marr.de/papers/oopsla-marr-ducasse-meta-tracing-vs-partial-evaluation/#x1-270024  See for peak performance speed: http://stefan-marr.de/papers/oopsla-marr-ducasse-meta-tracing-vs-partial-evaluation/#x1-300016  It is labeled 'typed args' in both cases. Even for peak performance, there are few benchmarks that benefit. Overall it causes even a slight slowdown. 
  The general question here is: Shouldn't DataView support primitive type arrays? I can query for a List<Byte> so that would probably be the correct translation, but this is a horribly inefficient way to store this data. Also, if I translate a List<Byte> to NBT, I will get a NBTTagList containing NBTTagBytes. 
When hitting enter I can see an HTTP-404 on the developer console of firefox: http://localhost:8080/sabi/swagger-resources/configuration/ui  with this information I found: https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/983   and tried to access: http://localhost:8080/sabi/api/swagger-resources/configuration/ui which results in some JSON and a HTTP-200. 
Yes.  it's trivial.  compiled using makefile. not through eclipse project. Is there a way to provide you more logs?

It's going to be tricky to do much with the cluster metadata before loading plugins.  Do we need to write to the keystore at all during startup? Could we instead move the responsibility for upgrading an old-format keystore to the `elasticsearch-keystore` command?  That said, on reflection the keystore might not matter so much here anyway because it's something that a user can create again themselves. It could be enough to emit a more actionable error message telling them to delete and re-create it if it can't be loaded.
I'm not sure, the only project I've used recently has android targets. It's 0.4.5-rc2 (from source, using the commit above). I've seen it only twice during the whole day today, so it's quite hard to reproduce.
Basically, every time we make changes to the codebase, I run the gradle build/install, the first time the apk is installed it crashes with the previous error, the next time I build/install, it works. So for every change we need to compile/install twice...
Yes I know it's pretty vague. I can sometime reproduce it but it's very tricky to document  The only thing I know is that I am indeed having  1. a third app (GitHub Desktop) but I often have it and I never notice anything wrong  2. I am experimenting with the layout and permanent facet link to this issue #2287 3. The model is pretty heavy  I will close this one as it's indeed to vague  and I try to add some info related to #2287   
Apperently Github wasn't stable when I added this. The template was filled completely. I reqrote it again and hope the text will stay visible.
If the following code is in `my_module.py`   
yeah many things were happening. I am not sure CMDcam is related. It was a keybind apart of that mod.  https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cmdcam
 with : http://localhost:8888/yamj3/api/person/series.json?id=2&job=actor,director,writer&max=11&dataitems=artwork  yes i have the same error which appends when there is no people attached to this seriesId 
Sure,  But, If I use redis server on my win7, the problem was the same, so that code does not work with not embedded redis server. 
@sixdouglas I don't think this is caused by your changes. Still, I'm not sure why this has happened. Building on Travis-CI works fine. Maybe there is something on my system?
Yeah Olivier fixed it in a PR a while ago. I thought he had closed it with his PR. 
Yes I've tried it with the weirding Gadget as well. It too doesn't work. No fluid gets put into the chalice when no player is nearby.
Obtained bow through both creative mode and survival(crafted) Enchantment books (luck and draw) thought creative mode. Was not able to test obtaining Enchantment book thought survival.  Order of placement in anvil to create the crash:  Bow then book  I will go back and do some more testing with more order of operation variants. If you have any suggestions.  Will the bow luck or draw enchants be applied to a book using the enchanting table?  By "battlemode" I asume you mean if I had selected R and had my weapons drawn. That did not occur to me, I will have to retest. 
I am using "pi4j-core-1.0.jar", let me try 1.1-SNAPSHOT. thanks again for quick response. 
@HammerGS Yes it's in MekHQ.    @neoancient Basically I outfit the mech the way I want it in the MekLab in MekHQ, everything looks good, not overweight or under, all criticals sorted, all parts accounted for.  I hit Begin Refit and well to be blunt, nothing, no error message, no confirmation message just nothing.  Tried repeatedly pressing it, tried different mechs of various tech to see if it was a specific chassis or tech level but same result, no error message or confirmation message.  Refit via kit works no problem but customizing from the lab is just met with no messages of any kind.

Yes, it works after compilation. Even without compilation Idea is able to work with it, it just shows error "Cannot access '[enum]' in '[class]'." which is false and in version 0.11.16 it was working properly.. 
Ok, take a look again. 
Something like this in logging.yml:   
I have 0 experience with Java development, so I'm not really comfortable doing that.   But I just added the logger and will try to reproduce and report what I find.

Hi @marcanpilami  I will recheck it on Monday.  The issue was in text selection.  Logs displayed correctly, but, I was can't select them. So, I can't select some part of logs and copy/paste it to somewhere. But, without time-filter everything is ok.

It occurs also with the 1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT. Cannot re-open the issue.  Here is the stacktrace:   
If `TextRenderer` serves no purpose, then it can be removed. Otherwise, I would expect it to be modified to work in a more efficient way (which I assume would mean changing it into a `BasicRenderer` so that template-based rendering would be used when appropriate).
Hi Kyle - I've asked Andrea to reply if she has time. If she is not able, I'll get back to you after my next trip (beginning tomorrow), after I've tried to re-construct the path to the errors. Note: a couple of other achieves have been built since the update and they are fine. 
 
It seems to be more than just updating this script, in the end, as several bundles seem to not be living in the org.eclipse.kapua.\* namespace anymore - at least the jars aren't?

Hi.  No it appears to happen on the S3 homescreen which is locked in portrait.  Cheers. 
Yes, we are facing this issue on this particular device only. Please find detailed bug report below: 
time the kompilation and you will see that it takes about 50% the time when -kompiled is there.  There is lots of caching going on there, but this time that works against us.  But now I'm confused, too: wasn't .k supposed to keep all the caching? 
in my shell , I try to generate jimple files under SOOT default output dir. 
We have created pull request #7106 that resolves the original issue. The pull request to resolve appendix issue has not been created yet. Maybe it should be processed in dedicated issue?.
The server spams "[Server thread/WARN]: Can't keep up! Did the system time change, or is the server overloaded?

@eivantsov  Thanks. This is the content in yaml file.   
It worked well with 6.0.1 thanks. Today i will try with 6.0.7 also
No that fixed it completely  I'm running it now  On May 28, 2015 12:49 PM, "Kristoffer Smith" notifications@github.com wrote:  > @brendanclement https://github.com/brendanclement - merged your > changes, thanks! did that fix it completely or was this just the first of > several steps to getting it fixed on Lollipop? >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub > https://github.com/theksmith/CarBusInterface/issues/5#issuecomment-106577399 > .

Every release, ever. 
actually with the samples that you given, but i just change the data and add some function to do multiple delete. 
Sorry, @ZacBlanco, I could not find a template. There is no pinned issue showing a template nor could I find an example under https://docs.alluxio.io/os/user/stable/en/contributor/Contributor-Getting-Started.html  **Alluxio Version:** 2.0  **Describe the bug** In file $ALLUXIO_HOME/bin/alluxio in line 83 the call ps -Aww fails because busybox doesn't know the 'w' flag. busybox is used when the environment is alpine (docker image!)  **Additional context** I suggest using pgrep instead of parsing the output of ps like this:  replace  `for pid in $(ps -Aww -o pid,command | grep -i "[j]ava" | grep ${keyword} | awk '{print $1}'); do`  with  `for pid in $(pgrep -f "[j]ava.*$keyword"); do`  **portability of ps** 1. If you're providing dockerhub with your own base image you do not have to be portable. The complete idea behind docker is to NOT rely on the availability of certain tools or certain versions of tools. When writing a Dockerfile you are 100% in charge of the environment and it (the container) will run (almost) everywhere. You don't have to care about the difference between GNU, UNIX, busybox, Mac, Wintendo, etc.  Long story short: For your Docker image it is irrelevant what is installed on some computer somehere in the world.  2. You are right, there are still a lot of local installations and "on premise" installations. You want to use the "least common denominator" between all relevant platforms. But that would not be BASH. It should be SH. And as you pointed out, the `-w` flag is not part of the UNIX specification of `ps`. And then you have GNU and GNU is not UNIX. ;) But GNU is a more popular than UNIX. So why stick with the UNIX specification? And what about Windows? There are a lot more Windows installations. Why not stick with Microsoft's WSL then?  You got the picture…  3. It is always a bad idea to parse CLI tools which are intended to print out human readable stuff like `ls` (use `stat` or `find` instead), `ps` (use `pgrep` and/or `pkill` or pid files), `free`, etc., because these tools are formatting the output according to the values they print (e.g. count the whitespaces in `ls -l` output for different directories).   4. Disclaimer: I'm *not* here to start a flame war. Its your choice completely how to fix the `ps -Aww` issue. I don't want to change the way you write code or anything. I don't want to offend you in any way. The points above are just remarks. Nothing more. Please feel free to NOT comment everything of my way too long text. I'm sure that your fix, whatever it is, will work just fine. :)
To confirm my config for `vm.stats.interval` is also at 60s also on KVM. Incidentally, looking at the code, I think VMWare and Xen are handling this differently, so they may possibly be returning correct results (haven't tested though)  Yes, tested on 4.11.2.0/4.12/master with ubuntu16.04/18.04/Centos7 vms  My stress test ended up running for 5hrs and the metrics never really changed.
Yes it's a different IP address. And to be precise it's was not a "real" migration, I just installed Subsonic on a new server and set the same parameters (as it's just a few podcasts and one music folder it was easier this way). 
Nope.
The Immersive engineering ones. Everything was working fine before updating Immersive Railroading
Add an autoplaylist that is a live youtube link. After a while add songs to the playlist expect them to end and fall into the autoplaylist. After a while the autoplaylist is playing, ask some people to add several songs and use the QUEUE command!  I believe that if the bot spent a lot of time playing the autoplaylist it will be easier the bug appears!  But when I reboot the bot this bug disappears after a while!

I'm going to assume this is the appropriate log since it's the only one I can find that looks to be relevant.  Part 1: https://pastebin.com/rJxtVkp5 Part 2: https://pastebin.com/CQv2N7uy  Disabling FTBUtilities-4.2.4 which is the primary chunkloading mod of the pack had no effect. trying others. edit: still having no luck with disabling other mods. reverting AS to 1.8.4 resolved it though.
There is, but I'll need to revisit to remember what it was...  
I think the design of `addHttpHeader` is pretty good because I don't have to implement a `WebViewClient` callback to add custom headers.  My point is: I used it at first, but it seem not to work so I went the custom `WebViewClient` way.  Calling `addHttpHeader` is pretty more convenient but it seem not to be working. 
no, I haven't set any capabilities.  And opera runs fast on my system. I turned off all opera widgets 
I removed the config file before running Minecraft and that did the trick! It seems like "config.evilcraft.blood_stained_block.blockWhitelist" is the only one that needs attention.

Hi Safris,  Thanks for the response. I changed the log level to finer here is the output we got. To me its searching for a manifest which is not available in temp folder . I suspect unzip jar didnt complete properly. Could be a permission issue. Please review and its imperative for us.  Launching a JVM...

No clue, I have heard of some random render issues in the over world. Other than this I only see this issue on space stations, and only in unlit areas.  
@kirwan  sorry, I had deleted  the sameple app. I just use imagepipeline not use drawee, call   > com.facebook.imagepipeline.core.ImagePipeline#fetchDecodedImage   **The Failed Situation is submitting two image request for the same url image, but their width/height is different.** 
@petebankhead in this particular case I am not attempting to use saved training objects from multiple images. These training points that I have saved are from this image but just during a different training session, therefore I do think this is a bug.  I would like to be able to combine multiple training objects from different images in the future, is the best way to go about this the script you gave in https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/256 ?
https://paste.ee/p/2GkRJ  Edit: here is a direct copy of the console: https://paste.ee/p/ViAHK 
To return pending transaction, its need only database, as any valid user connected will be owner or super user, i dont see there are any case of using multiple user with same database. so this query will work nice to rollback transaction for owner or super user of postgres database.  
Yes trying to get some outside input here. Can’t figure out what is causing this error and think it maybe something with how the binding interacts with the framework that is outside my understanding hence why I posted to see if I could get some guidance on where I need to look.    I know that the servlet is not starting but I haven’t seen this error before and the error in the log is just so non specific to me that I don’t know where to start.
I fixed it. Bridge blocks can now only place blocks that endermen can place. Which unfortunately includes TNT, so I added a config option to ban TNT from bridge blocks. 
blood told me to report this here: https://github.com/MinecraftPortCentral/GriefPrevention/issues/664#issuecomment-401636559
@tobiasKaminsky Can you please tell me your email address to send you the file?
It is highlighted just as normal code, no disabled coloring is applied: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26939/35976786-398790e8-0cf2-11e8-8409-d819a3bb5a45.png)  And now I see that problem is not only with highlighting: the IDE also does not ignore code in disabled block as it should: if I declare class with the same name in both sections, it is highlighted as error: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26939/35976941-b77fb110-0cf2-11e8-8bdb-dd8a82e79c3c.png) But it not an error actually: depending on whether FOO_BAR is defined, **_exactly one_** version of class FooBar exists
I had a problem with an update from 1.1.4 to 1.2.1. So I deleted all versions and installed the new version 1.2.2 which works fine: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/395 
Changed title according to feedback by @rsudev   Additional question: Which library version are we currently using with the new map (to match the table provided be @SwissPoPo )?

@mucek4 Send via mail is not needed as it is contained when using the mail link already now. What device is not working for you?  I tested with the ZTE Grand Memo LTE, Android 4.1.2 again with current NB and it has still the mentioned problem. I guess a copy button might be a good idea. 
:D 
Oh sorry I didn't include them, just create new integration, select random start step and as finish or any other step select Database connection and as action select Invoke SQL. 
Hmm.. I don't a simple repo yet.. But the cause sounds right to me.
Literally just installed, configured, failed. I’ll have some more info later.
Hi again ! :D   Here is my screenshot: http://www.noelshack.com/2018-24-6-1529168035-json-bug-gadgetsmenu-17-minimum-et-18-super.jpg ! :D   Thanks ! :D
I will try with 3.0.0 later today and update you. Yes, the /var/run directory is on user root. but neo4j is trying to create a directory under /var/run as this: /var/run/neo4j/neo4j.pid So I created the /var/run/neo4j manually but the stop script is deleting this directory.  is it ok to run neo4j as root user? and disadvantages or security risks?  Thanks   
Yes, the issue in the mailing list reported by Stephen Wong has probably the same root cause.  There, they have a restricted Proxy where Domain Names have to be configured explicitely. In our case, the Server running Pushy is restricted of external DNS lookup.  The common problem is, that the Pushy mechanism (Pushy or Netty, I didn't have a closer look so far) does a DNS lookup upfront and sends the IP Address to the Proxy instead of sending the Host name to the proxy and let the Proxy resolve the Name. 
Something similar, using /rsprices for index list. Can you work on this or I'll take the issue? 
I use non-aoe attacks when this happens, but it seem your right about the calling for help thing, wich i know existed but felt weird in the last version, but it's mostly due to 1: There are no way to tell if the other pokemon are targeting me like a "A wild ??? appeared" text (it feel like the other one attack me with no reason) and 2: My active pokemobs target ANOTHER pokemob than the one i was fighting, so if i attack magikarp A, and magikarp B come to help, my pokemob will sometimes target B instead of A, and it's even worse when there are more magikarp, so maybe the problem comes from the fact that there need a way to know if other pokemob are targeting me + my pokemobs need to attack the one i am targeting (it would be even better if i can target another pokemob while in battle with another one, like attacking magikarp A then using a move on B then going back to A for example, i think it worked at some point but dont anymore)
Not 100% sure but I noticed it with the latest skript version. 
2.0.0-37. MC 1.9. 
I am connecting to the Caché database using its JDBC driver. Everything works great: SELECT, DML, calling procedures, ER diagrams. The only thing that doesn't work is stored procedure return values, either as the return value of the procedure itself, or as OUT or INOUT parameters. So the snippet above is the only snippet that there is. I'm trying to execute this: ? = FCE_Operations.ATM_GetAmountOutAndFee(100,0.5,?,?)  FCE_Operations is not a table; it's a container for stored procedures only.
@timtay-microsoft I was using 1.3.30, which is the version one currently gets when following the quickstart from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-java  - you might want to upgrade those samples.  Then I upgraded to 1.15.0 and the problem still repros. Digging further, I found I spelled "GatewayHostname" instead of "GatewayHostName". Turns out that the Java SDK requires this exact capitalization. For any other spelling the SDK will just ignores the gatewayhostname segment and instead of providing an error it will connect straight to the IoTHub. For reference, the .NET SDK works with any capitalization of "GatewayHostName".  Btw, with the correct spelling I am hitting another error that I now need to investigate on my end first.  For this bug it seems like there are two things to fix: 1) update your samples to a current SDK 2) allow any capitalization of "gatewayhostname" - or fail if the spelling is not correct, instead of silently connecting to IoTHub, which clearly isn't what the user has intended.
The `handler` is initialized only [when the map is loaded](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/blob/master/MapboxAndroidDemo/src/main/java/com/mapbox/mapboxandroiddemo/examples/labs/AnimatedImageGifActivity.java#L75), so if you close the activity before the callback fires, you'll get a `NPE` from the `onStop`. I didn't analyze it further and not sure why the bear was not showing up.

I found a lead! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2972986/how-to-unmap-a-file-from-memory-mapped-using-filechannel-in-java Blacklisting all the alt contigs will results in a whole lot of file handles being opened then immediately closed (but not actually released until the next GC) hence the file handle exhaustion that doesn't happen on large input data sets even when using an order of magnitude more threads. I'll add some explicit defensive GCs into GRIDSS and see if that improves things.
Is this ok? 
It happens when the server stops, my script was very small when this happened, and I modified it alot from then. This error happens Randomly and doesn't seem to be compared with what ever script I have.
Thank you, I sent it to you, but my email often is in Spam; so if it is gone, I will send it again with a different email. And thank you! I wish you a good Easter holiday!
And to be cleared, it works perfectly well in JVM mode and hot reload mode.
it only for some reason happend when i was in the mining dimention  when i went back to the overworld it didnt happen anymore im launching the client up now to test 
1.- I just try to enter the admin console and it fails. The problem: a bad built javascript file. 2.- Maybe I only found this on a tomcat behind an https only apache. (can't remember all the cases, it happens since last week) 3.- /srv/eng/admin.console 4.- No... how do I know this is done? I will try 5.- I think I add it automatically, let me try again with explicit prod profile 
I deleted my previous instance of pcms and reinstalled the project from scratch. Installed the latest from master. There is still no preview or refresh when editing. There are no JS errors or 404's. I tried Chrome and Firefox.  After an update, if I double click on the component I just edited, then the update renders,
I'm not crazy, and I've been stuck with an semi functioning IDE for weeks. If you think that's because my environment is messed up or whatever, or if you're just not interested in fixing a problem that seems to affect only one person then just say so. But calling me crazy is a bit of an insult. 
An artificial example: `dot` has a default node node spacing (nns) of 15 and `neato` has one of 12. The `LayoutDotExporter` retrieves nss from a graph using the `CoreOptions` class. There, a default nss of 10 is specified. Thus, for a graph without any explicit nss set, both `dot` and `neato` end up having nss of 10.  Additionally, after the first `#getProperty(nss)` call, the graph will actually have a specified nss: 10. 
https://gist.github.com/ciscam/f538eb21e40978f10b75463aa23648f4 Here's the "logcat -c; logcat -v long" output Turning off all providers didn't change the behavior, thanks for pointing that out, though.  Also: Using the app from F-Droid - I'd try the Play Store version, but it's still on 2.32.3, which works fine when installed from F-Droid
Yes, "outofmemory" is also what I assume.I ran several tests yesterday on a Samsung Galaxy S2 and a Galaxy Tab. Both crashed if the imported GPX was "too" large. It seems to be independetnt of the GPX file I used.Splitting the GPX to smaller files (<40MB) works well. Yet, when I import a second GPX file, again c:geo crashes. If I restart c:geo and then import a second or third file (with another restart inbetween) it worked and I could successfully import the whole file of 160MB.So, there seem to be two issues:  - when importing the file, c:geo should monitor the system ressources and abort the import gracefully with a error message (without crashing the app) if it otherwise would run out of memory  - after finishing the import, it seems that there is no sufficient cleanup of the used ressources, that is why a second immediate import exceeds the system resources and the app crashes 
@andrm  Layout is the default values in both cases.  Do you suggest changes? How would this affect avoiding the issue when changing allocation problems?
0) Set lightweightEdges=true 1) Create two vertices and create edge between them  2) Go to graph 3) sekect \* from V1 4) click on V and click on incoming or outgoing edge  Then you get this error.  
Never mind, those Strings  in eval was confusing. 
@heiko-braun the integration is just a super simple API Provider integration with a single implemented flow, running in my local minishift. Will keep an eye on it, but I got it once yesterday and now twice today, no idea right now what could trigger it.
Yes, it does. 
@lgou2w Not solved yet... But I feel.. I was using a dev build?... I test that Paper Spigot version and my friends said bukkit was better that it..  I think I should wait for the full version of 1.14 Paper Spigot, so I closed the issue.. 
maybe there is something wrong with my shapefile. would you be able to provide your test shp file? Thank you!
Again, thanks for the replies guys!  Henry is correct - the modular upgrades let each storage unit contain 300 stacks each. I run a server for several friends, so I was trying to provide them with plenty of room  I totally understand the lag part, too. I went into creating this issue under the assumption it was likely throttled for performance. I wasn't sure if there was a way to adjust it or not. If there is, fantastic, that would be great. If not, I'll find workarounds. I still love the Ender IO system.  I might need to create a separate "issue" for this, but have you all considered adding any kind of "advanced storage"? I may type that up later. 
`/proc/self/mounts` file contains three sda7 items, `mount -l` shows the same info. See picture below: ![untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11829223/34601695-19b0c17e-f238-11e7-820e-e66286f7f6ec.png) 
There you go, full test consistently reproducing the issue. 
@yegor256 for the release notes, that would be good enough I guess.  It's a shame that `git log --oneline` will still look bad though, but if it was fixed, it could drive the release notes. Fixing up `git log` is more for blame analysis later on to work out why something changed, or _what_ _else_ changed with it. 
Thank you for that. I tried a 0.11.5-SNAPSHOT with the following SHA1: f9575b034d576b94194e7814cfb5af8f119b0b19, and it did not resolve my problem. It did not change any of the above behavior. 
I never experienced this with other connectors using OAuth but to be fair I did not play with them as much as I did with concur. There were no other deployments, no reset, nothing. It was on minishift, syndesis tag 1.4.5 so no image updates and I did not run any tests, it was all done manually.  Exactly what you mentioned - I set the OAuth for concur, created concur connection and integration, it was: database -> mapper -> concur (create listitem) -> log (body, headers) -> LOG (everything). All I did between republishing was editing the mapper step. 
I'd guess when you have no credentials at all (from a clean installation for example). 
I simply tried to import the spartanizer on the running plugin and to configure the active tippers, nothing happened and there were some errors in the console

updated to include that (I'd thought It obvious with the Forge version.)

It's "undefined callback". I mistook it to report things accessed from within callbacks, but it does this. I had previously thought this to be an issue in PhpStorm (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-50785), and have enabled and disabled d-a-c with Restarts in between (and without changing anything else) multiple times to make absolutely sure that it's the cause. I had started with an empty project and enabled all PHP inspections. ![d-a-c-undefined-callback](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1022803/72550402-f8df8400-3892-11ea-8c93-d9ad265b43b6.png)   Re: "Notify on accessing member of mixed, object, stdClass", I can't find it by searching in the settings, what key would it be under?
Thanks, Laa.  Would check on this & update this thread shortly. 
Sorry, I think I accidently removed some info when I initially submitted this ticket. If you import an emx you readily imported and then use the same options again, it does not inform you that you have already imported this data, but gives an unrelated error.   I hope this is clear?  Otherwise just let me know. 
Sorry for the lack of feedback, this issue is not easily reproducable. I'll reopen this issue (if I have the permission to do so) in case the problem occurs again.

@tsmaeder This is on the OpenShift dev cluster we use. I don't think it's a cluster issue as it's pretty consistently reproducible.  What do you mean by "default" registry? We're currently moving away from having Che provide default registries of any kind, since the che.openshift.io registries are for prod/prod-preview only -- https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14266.  I've tested: - Che-server `7.0.0` + devfile registry `7.0.0` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `nightly` + devfile registry `7.0.0` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `7.0.0` + devfile registry `nightly` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `nightly` + devfile registry `nightly` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `nightly` + devfile registry `nightly` + plugin-registry `nightly`: **Does not work** 
Hi @jeqo. Thanks--would love to have you work on this. Yeah, let me wrap up #257 first. That may take a day or two as I'm juggling a bit right now.
@vaishali51 I was already working on this issue. Please verify if someone else is working on the issue or not before submitting a PR to it :)
You are correct Tom, currently remote debugging is not allowed by default in Java 11+. Allowing it all the time would be a security concern, which Alasdair also raised on PR #7834.  Right now I've gone with a solution that leaves the default behavior as is, and if the user wants to enable remote debugging on their server they will be able to set the `WLP_DEBUG_REMOTE=y` env var.
The JASPIC code/jar is copied to the glassfish/lib folder and registered as a MessageSecurity through the admin console. Instructions taken from here: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-authenticroast/ (see section container configuration).  The actual JASPIC code that is deployed deployed is here: https://github.com/ratcashdev/authenticroast You'll have to compile it yourself. Make sure to copy both the API and the IMPL jars. The app through which I test: https://github.com/ratcashdev/JSR196OAuthLogin (has a dependency on the API)  Try to change the SampleOAuth.java class while it's deployed 2-3 times, and do  GET /api/test/secure/oauth  with the header: Authorization: BEARER mytoken  BTW: Is there a more straightforward way to register the JASPIC code without messing inside the admin console? 
For me it didn't work on the beta7 version! I now changed to a signed certificate, so I wont be able to test this in the future.

Correct, the rest of the settings in the index template are applied successfully, and most days the field limit is as well.  I did output all the index templates and go through them, this is the only one that applies to logstash-*
`navBarHeight` is 144 (48dp). Thus the resource does exist.  The `hasSoftKeys` from the StackOverflow issue seems to works fine. But I might be a bit hacky to just measure the window imo. 
Good morning Matthias! There is nothing in the error console, only the log message that I have  loaded my bib file. Attached the error popup. I'm on Win 7 64bits.

Just an update on this. I know the problem hasnt been properly adressed and its might even be a problem on my side.  But, i have upgraded to Android Oreo again and havent experienced the issue on this version of android.
Most of the root-related messages were eliminated by the grep, but it was just some ~10 more lines per instance, eventually resulting in root permission being granted.

Good question. Maybe an "Open file as new tab in current project" option is missing, too. 
For now I think we should try to just make the numbers the same size across Android versions if possible.   I do agree that the date and date-time widgets need rethinking. If you could file a separate issue with your thoughts on what that would look like, that would be very helpful. Before doing that, I recommend you check out the related issues filed by @dalerhoda.
Well, I'm trying to learn how to use the collector. To start I'm analizyng the URL http://www.cirf.org/italian/home.html  If I understood correctly I should me able to get "L'associazione" in collector.referrer-link-text for the source:    But seems I'm not able to extract this link.  If it can be useful I can copy here the full .xml  Thanks for your time. 
I tried to remove optifine, but it is a similar result mods: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44133869/50726423-193d1480-1150-11e9-9017-f8bb1200b5da.png) 
The related modpack was removed as it accumulated too many issues. I did a quick comparison between 0.2.2 and 0.2.3, the latest is more efficient and seems to address the original issue. 
I don't see the behavior on the demo and I don't see it in previous versions of glowroot.  After some additional testing I have to assume the problem is on my side.   We use an apache webserver to proxy in https connections to localhost and if I bypass that it works as it should. Hard to see how a proxy setup would be responsible for this kind of issue but that's what it looks like.   
`resourceBase` is the directory directly containing my index.html `pathInfoOnly` is true, but setting it to false or omitting completely won't help.
promregator.discovery.hostname is not set in my instance. I will try and test it soon.  When the prometheus server scrapes the /discovery endpoint (CURL job) the json is returned with the prometheus servers hostname in the targets array. when I test it with my laptop the returned json has my laptops hostname in the targets array.

Thanks for quick response. Exaclty, changing to English language, work fine.
I am not exactly sure but yes I was playing with update settings for threadpool. 
@eric-milles - thanks for the response. I cannot provide the project but I will try to reproduce it in a minimal example. This will happen next week as I have my hands full right now. I'll write here with an example. Thanks!
I think so.  We'll need to test this carefully because I believe Google Maps does retain its own state information, and we don't want to be fighting their implementation or moving the camera/zoom unnecessarily.

Yup, just updated to bata9 and everything seems to be working as expected.
It may be the problem of some vendor issue. I also can not reproduce in other devices which version also is 4.4.4  
Live TV is working in the latest preview so I'm closing this issue 
I am using most recent version, that is 1.0.RC7.6 
Hi, Thanks a lot for responding to my issue. I really appreciate this. The issue does not surround around the db object not returned, but the issue surrounds when the same db object is returned to 2 threads at same time, then one thread errors out when trying to do the db operations. I will try to modify your junit test case and send you a sample program or so, which you can test it out. FYI, I am using your spring data project from orient db with spring boot and it submits the requests to rest controller and rest controller in turn uses the repository from spring data with shared connection pool to do the updates. This is the time when same db connection object is returned to both threads it errors out as the last thread which gets the object works fine, but earlier threads error out. Please hold on for a week or so and I will build a sample project and send to you for testing purpose using orient db spring data module. Thanks, Likesh
![It doesn't work™](http://novaember.com/s/573172487.png)  It's an ASUS ZenWatch running Wear 5.0.2, and my OnePlus One is running on a CM12.1 nightly which is based on 5.1.1. 
I'm using this in my Docker container `/repository/maven-central/io/openliberty/openliberty-runtime/$LIBERTY_VERSION/openliberty-runtime-$LIBERTY_VERSION.zip`  What's the URL to test the new build ?  Thanks
I am still able to reproduce it on 1.4.19 on Firefox and Chrome on Linux and Windows 
it is in #281 - can also be shipped with 1.3.1 if we want to (I vote yes). I'll leave the decision with you :) 
thank you for the tip - it worked (I didn't even see that button) 
@clintongormley I am sorry but I couldn't reporoduce it anymore and don't have the stack trace.

Yes, I use static maps. But they are not downloaded on GPX/waypoint import (no mention about it in `logcat`). They are only downloaded when I update the cache or list. 
Hi Well it's on one of my users server, and this pne is behind a reverse proxy. Yesterday i've implemented login with a geberated password, so new login method, and I have the same issue. The strangest thing is that I'm doing the exact same thing as the nextcloud app. I've built the nextcloud app on my computer and this one is working on his server. 
"Did this happen while you didn't move to another app screen between sending transactions?" yes  ok, lets see in 0.1.32 :) thx 
@dooboolab Since you have edited the comment after closing the ticket we didn't get notification about the change. We used the version `2.3.14` as per the last comment and still have the issue. Now we are trying to use the latest version `2.3.17`
I was also thinking that JRebel relies on specific patterns in class file. I disabled AspectJ plugin for JRebel (as class under the test in from AspectJ framework) - this should have prevented instrumentation. But the result was the same, although JRebel log stated plugin was disabled. We do not know how JRebel is implemented, maybe some other code of the tool instruments the class anyway.   Here is [a dumped class file](https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/files/426627/org.aspectj.weaver.ReferenceType.1471595599440.zip).  I believe there could be other instrumentation libraries that heavily rely on bytecode structure. Could it be possible to append the value returned from `@OnMethodEnter` to the end of local variables array to avoid shifting existing variables? With this approach risks of collisions probably would be minimized.. 
Oh sorry, my description is wrong, this is the correct: Placing the ores above a stair, or any half block, the mcmmo plugin has the chance to dupe the block, instead of the player has placed it. It was suposed to happen just with natural ores found, not placed by players
Chrome for mobile. But i think its not the browser, i think it is currently not responsive.
Thx for your answer and the for fixing the bug in the next update.   I somehow missed the Tutorials part of the book and looked at the page for the importer. I am sure i can figure it out with this informations.
Hello Alex,  sure. I think it was generated by some youtube-converter.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jAcN2NE5xC7U4FtArG28-Y4APmaHuuNV  This is the test code      public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, JCodecException {          FileChannelWrapper wrap=new FileChannelWrapper(new FileInputStream(args[0]).getChannel());         FrameGrab frameGrab1 = FrameGrab.createFrameGrab(wrap);          PictureWithMetadata fr1;         do {             fr1 = frameGrab1.getNativeFrameWithMetadata();             if(fr1!=null) {                 System.out.println(fr1.getTimestamp()+" "+fr1.getDuration()+" "+fr1.getPicture());             }         } while (fr1 != null);      }  fr1.getPicture stays null for above file, for the mp4 files in the test resources, it contains a frame object.  Thx for caring, CGJ 
Yes, just looking through to pinpoint .  @haraldatbmw ty for the data points
I prefer leaving our own fetching (although flawed), but adding Javadoc to that method disclaimering we are not a fetching library, thus the fetch faults are not necessarily the parsing faults, as well as wrapping the fetching line with a try-catch segment logging out a short exaplanation that the sitemap failed the fetch not necessarily the parse.   I do think there are/will be many cases where people will need a fast sitemap parsing and they won't want to delve too deeply into their own fetcher etc, they will look for a quick and dirty sitemap fetch.

Yes, let me tell you how I have it set up.  I have a 13x13x13 compact machine that I have placed the controlled miner on each floor against the outlet wall with a one high mining level and have it black listing fences.  Then I have the collector on the opposite wall.  I have fore resource hogs sitting on a 1x1 cube with fences around them.  I have this set up on four different floors inside the compact machine.  My goal is for the controlled miner to break only the truffles and the cyclic collector to ship them out using the Cyclic item cables.  Every time I set the controlled miner to 13x13 it will not mine the truffles.  Only on the 11x11 will it collect.  I was using the Cyclic power cables, but have changed to flux points thinking there isn’t enough power  Get Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef> ________________________________ From: Sam <notifications@github.com> Sent: Saturday, August 24, 2019 1:55:24 PM To: Lothrazar/Cyclic <Cyclic@noreply.github.com> Cc: Roach009 <owensjd@hotmail.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com> Subject: Re: [Lothrazar/Cyclic] Controlled Miner not working (filters) (#1202)   Can you explain this a bit mroe clearly?

minecraft v. 1.6.4, Mariculture 1.6.4-1.2.1e, I am using the FTB Monster pack (if that matters?) v 1.1.1... forge version 9.11.1.965 
Thanks for replying. I'm using the recommended Forestry version, recommended Forge, and OptiFine (I don't think that'll help with a client and server dupe). I can always reproduce this, and made a short video showing how it is done.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/tbqlv5rglejrfgv/Dupe.mp4 
No 
After having some more time to test this, it does appear to be a number of boolean operators issue, not a number of queries issue. It was getting hung at a query (example) for about an hour. Then it would hit a longer query that KSQL could never get past.  @apurvam  - There are no error messages. As I stated, I'm defining 'loading' as the "Building AST" message. And KSQL just stops printing anything. I never see the more common messages about rebalancing, etc as it executes the queries.  I've created a minimal queries file that seems to exhibit this behavior:  
I recreated it in the simplest way(cobblegen & furnace) with the 3 storage/inventory spaces(1st furnace, 2nd barrel, 3rd void) and wasn't able to replicate the overflow. A pic of the test build is included, so if u want too i'll be able to show u the treefarm build on server to give u a first person view of it if that'll help.

Seed: "-2663283399219067512" Amidst v4.1 using both 1.9 and 1.8.9 profiles show spawn at -12,220 in a Plains biome. BOTH created worlds spawned me very close to the same place (close to the spawn location reported by NBTExplorer) in an Extreme Hills biome. NBTExplorer shows that the world spawn for BOTH PCMC versions as -3,249. Note: I spawned on a grass covered dirt block in both cases.  I realize that two data points don't imply a trend but it looks like this also manifests in pre-1.9 worlds. 
Yes i did,  but i am missing deeper knowlledge on what a autoreconfig does. I need help if the default build instructions from libpostal do not work within the preset setup. I see forgot to push my latest state to the branch yesterday.

It does. 
This is the ontology https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/BigDataOcean-LOV/tree/master/BDO-Ontologies/canonicalmodel
For me when the app was uploading a new page and a new image it was just hanging on the upload for a new page and never completing (waited for a few minutes). However, if I can fix this issue by: 1) Tap the image 2) Select Retry 3) Tap the image 4) Select Cancel  5) Back out to Site Pages  Then the page uploads successfully. Just revalidated a few flows and this looks like it's an issue on other media blocks as well not just gallery. 
Thanks @veyndan !  @neslihanturan Case 1 happens when you have a small device (like the Nexus S that I emulated). When the action bar is full, extra items go to the overflow menu, which is when the issue occurs. Test it on a Nexus S emulator and see?
I updated from build 238 to 244. http://echopet.hawkfalcon.com/job/EchoPet/changes  I have not tested CraftBukkit yet, but build 238 was working just fine in Spigot. During the same update, I updated spigot build 1292 (was working with echopets 238) to build 1299.  http://ci.md-5.net/job/Spigot/changes 
Yeah, I'll file it over there too. 
No, I tried it with keys instead, still nothing.
Sorry, can't attach example
Understood, I've updated my post.

@timusus I could replicate it on all lists( albums,playlists)
I logged as the go user on the machine running Go Server and ran `git clone git@bitbucket.org:teamname/repository.git -b topic`, and the clone was successful. Then, inside the just cloned repository, running `git config remote.origin.url` returns `git@bitbucket.org:teamname/repository.git` as expected.  I'm not sure it helps, but I tried running this command on each repository inside the flyweight directory, and none failed.  
it's M_PRODUCT_BOM_ID varchar(40) 
I used 200000000 and it still fails.
How can I do that simply with terminal emulator on my rooted device and without giving here some personal informations?^^ I tried  #logcat -f /path/filename then 'launch' Mirakel. I obtained a file >250ko with many things other than mirakel stuff! 
I tested it on some apps and appears to be working correctly.  Importantly it doesn't appear to have broken anything either.

I set "Fetch messages up to" to "any size (no limit)" a few weeks ago. It was no improvement over the 32kb setting I had before.  I was able to catch a duplicate entry at 6:17 am this morning.

One shows K9, the other is taken from Thunderbird a few minutes later... ![Screenshot_20191014-064002_K-9 Mail_s2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4147858/66734551-d6893500-ee63-11e9-9e15-a4fe54e11aef.png) ![Thunderbird](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4147858/66734558-dbe67f80-ee63-11e9-9599-e6e49c9f7948.PNG) [k9-log1-private-data-removed.txt](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/files/3723342/k9-log1-private-data-removed.txt)
Yes.  I tried using one called "achunkloader" and it does the same thing.  But thanx for the suggestion!  -Rick
My css file is in the root directory of the java project. An example path to the file is `pathToProject/projectName/style.css`. Also, I'm able to use `getClass().getResource("style.css");` to get the absolute path of the file from the same class that I'm having these issues with. Doesn't this mean my css file is in `src/main/resources`? 
You're correct.  My phrasing was vague.  It's just TestRig and (TestRig via ANTLRWorks).  No other tools. 
i don't get any exceptions 
Sorry about that. It has been tested on iOS version 11.4.1 but on more recent versions as well, so it does not seem related to the iOS version. It has NOT been tested on Android since adding a token from an otpauth url does not work on Android anyway. I can't seem to find the Google Authenticator app version but it is up to date since it does not appear there is an update available in my app store. To reproduce it, you need to have 0 token in your app (so the "Begin setup" screen is the one that appears when opening the app). Then you can open a text editor and write a url similar to this one to generate a fake token : otpauth://totp/cedric?secret=123456789&issuer=Test&digits=6&period=30 When you click on it, it will open Google Auth app automatically (since the otpauth url scheme is associated to that app on iOS) and prompt you to add a token. When you click Yes, the token will be added in the background but not visible, the app will stay on the same Begin setup screen as if you had no token. Only when closing and re-opening it, you will see your token.
I'm using the same version. Whenever I click on a contact, it takes me back to the chat list. It works fine when I disable the option. Are you not experiencing the same? 
I try again many times;  the Device is "魅族"；Android version : "6.0"  and if i use the website: "http://img.benditoutiao.com/material/20170914/081cf6c0-98e8-11e7-aecc-4fb4862aa761.png@!news-list-single-pic" I cannot load the image;  It's like the log file I sent earlier；  but if i use the website: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yline/as_lib_sdk/master/pic/1024_1024_png/01.png or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yline/as_lib_sdk/master/pic/640_1120_jpg/01.jpg I can load the image as normal;  Therefore， This makes it impossible for me to be comfortable with progressive loading api；  hope you can solve it.    
I'm working on a non-traversal tool.

I've uploaded it. Thank you very much. 
Ah, that must be the problem.  It begins with: https://  Would be good to allow that as we may start moving to using secure transactions soon.

I simplified the Class, added some dokumentation and output. Hope now it's clear what happens [RefreshScopeDeadLock-2.0.0.RC2-v2.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/files/2101180/RefreshScopeDeadLock-2.0.0.RC2-v2.zip)
No, not yet. And it only happens on my tablet (had planned and thought I had mentioned it, but I guess not). I'd guess it's rendering the list or meta lists at the same time which causes the crash. 
I see this might be a duplicate of #784. I'll try to see if it's reproducible later.
DBeaver version: 5.1.0  Sometime even reload doesn't helps ( Maybe problem in OS, I don't know (

Hi @sengsational   Some phones can have dark mode during the evening.  With the new Q release you can turn dark mode on for all uses and apps. I don't know if all have this beta installed. If not then I can look into it :)  Best regards Daniel
Hi! Really sorry, was a bug that i found in 0.10.0. In a 0.12.0 it works.  Seems that in 0.10.0 in schema.ftl there are two roles defined with a old definition (schema/update and schema/insert) when the correct roles must be registry/update and registry/insert.  I correct this in my installation addign this two old roles and i deletem them when i update to last version.  Regards and thxs for answer.

Ah, there is the error log. Was looking at 'adb logcat', but that didn't show anything. It is some kind of authorisation error. If I disable authorisation on the /RPC2 mount, it works without a problem. The password is correct. If I uninstall everything, install 2.0.1, do the configuration, it works.

 OK, sorry for the terminology. It's a livestream probably but for some reason it doesn't work in NewPipe. 
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/annotation/ConditionEvaluator.java#L103-L113  I was debugging the code and it never got to evaluate if the condition matched (at a method level), because the `phase` was `REGISTER_BEAN` and the `requiredPhase` was `PARSE_CONFIGURATION`.  Returning `null` or `ConfigurationPhase.REGISTER_BEAN` on the `getConfigurationPhase` seams to make it work just fine.
AppleCore-mc1.10.2-2.0.1 and SpiceOfLife-mc1.9.4-1.3.6.jar i need to run the latest forge so i can run sponge for the enjin website plugin 
https://timings.spigotmc.org/?url=yuradereto https://timings.spigotmc.org/?url=ceginadeqa  Note: These were not during peak time, and I can run another if necessary  Thanks
The command system is quite obstrusive in comparison to other plugins and some commands do not make sense to have in game. For example, some commands will overflow the chat, making some information the command gives to not be readable... 
Seems to be fixed... 
@damienmg Florian wants me to ask you if I can just rollback this change. 
 Version of AE appliedenergistics2 stable-1-1.7.1，this is my  local server ,this  is the plugins named Residence-1.6.1-v2.6.6.6,my mcpc is cauldron-1.7.10-1.1231.01.207  @TheJulianJES 
If you go into the history you can turn on incognito mode.  The quick settings is shown in the tips screen.![](https://i.imgur.com/77QOJus.png)
Note that I tried `bazel build //examples/cpp:hello-world --experimental_strict_action_env -s`, but the console output produced by the -s flag did not change. It still contains the full PATH and TMP, TEMP. Is that to be expected?  I have yet to test the impact on the actual caching, I will post the results later.  (E: Still running release 0.5.4rc1)
i just placed the autoworkbench, so there was no initial recipe. will try to make a setup with only buildcraft.

From docu: "Concave Triangle Meshes For static world environment, a very efficient way to represent static triangle meshes is to use a btBvhTriangleMeshShape. This collision shape builds an internal acceleration structure from a btTriangleMesh or btStridingMeshInterface. Instead of building the tree at run-time, it is also possible to serialize the binary tree to disc. See examples/ConcaveDemo how to save and load this btOptimizedBvh tree acceleration structure. When you have several instances of the same triangle mesh, but with different scaling, you can instance a btBvhTriangleMeshShape multiple times using the btScaledBvhTriangleMeshShape. The btBvhTriangleMeshShape can store multiple mesh parts. It keeps a triangle index and part index in a 32bit structure, reserving 10 bits for the part Id and the remaining 22 bits for triangle index. If you need more than 2 million triangles, either split the the triangle mesh into multiple sub meshes, or change the default in #define MAX_NUM_PARTS_IN_BITS in the file src\BulletCollision\BroadphaseCollision\btQuantizedBvh.h"  I made a thread in their forum  http://www.bulletphysics.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=10547 
Yes I'm pretty sure - I've also reproduced the issue locally. My test case consists of 3 threads:  Thread #1 - connects 1000 users to a channel "/users/user-" + id (simulate load) Thread #2 - connects a single user and disconnects him every 100ms (simulate locking when adding/removing resource) Thread #3 - sends a group message to group "/users/" every 1 second  Testing this with 1.0.6 - reaches 4000 threads Testing this with 1.0.13 - after 10 minutes run, already around 9000 threads and keeps climbing.  The only change I did when I upgraded to the new version - changed the messages.offer to dispatchMessages 
then it is probably the case that the debugger functionality is disabled in my external node. Thanks! 
The error message that gradle return is non-zero exit. 
Menu key on keyboard, that is between right Windows and Ctrl.  The key is quite convenient (as apposed to the mouse) to speed up work.
@ousenko Yes, it's possible. As a workaround until this issue is fixed, you could do something like this (apologies for any invalid java syntax, I'm not a java dev): 
All tests [here](https://github.com/hatstand0/Staskken/blob/master/Parser/src/test/java/TextParserTest.java) except for the first one, fail due to constraints on the value stack size (Expecting a single element only) 
@Turini  It couldn't be an interceptor, because interceptors only execute before the controller method execution.  @garcia-jj this kind of comment doesn't help at all ;) 
In the left pane is okay, just map the problem. 
Yeah, I'll try to see if i can create a small app that reproduces this.
This question looks more trick. I made some investigation. Add jackson-module-kotlin is not enough. By default java and kotlin in runtime does not know about field name.  You should pass **javac -parameters** for compiler  Spring boot 2 in spring-boot-starter-parent set up it by default   here is **(no Creators, like default construct, exist): cannot deserialize from Object value (no delegate- or property-based Creator)** But if I uncoment `objectMapper.registerModule(ParameterNamesModule())` that parse perfect.  So quarkus by default register this module.   
We didn't convert from JAX-RS to Spring, but we do use Spring quite extensively for run time configuration. Disabling the spring-web module fixed the issue for us. Thank you.  
Hi @nawroth ,    
It is for 1.12.2 but I have found something there is a conflict with https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mapwriter-2 version 2.8.1 got the rgb selection and use when the map writer is putting beacon type lights for waypoints.
This is a reduced program from the R8 compiler: https://r8.googlesource.com/r8  R8 generates optimized code and will re-use locals when available.  
Even with no custom AuthenticationManager, still seeing the same behavior of a NullEventPublisher and no events being published through.  A minimal spring-boot-starter-web + spring-boot-starter-actuator + spring-boot-starter-security example with no custom GlobalAuthenticationConfigurerAdapter at all shows the issue off as you don't see BadCredentials audit events when logging in with known bad credentials. As soon as you stick a custom auth in and auth.authenticationEventPublisher you get the appropriate events being published. 
ITW 1.7.1: icedtea-web-1.7.1.win.bin.zip ITW 1.8: icedtea-web-1.8.win.bin.zip, also tried icedtea-web-1.8.portable.bin.zip In the javaws.bat file I defined paths for Java by adding at the beginning: `set "INST_ITW_HOME=C:\icedtea-web-image"` `set "INST_JAVA_HOME=C:\Zulu\zulu8.36.0.1-ca-fx-jdk8.0.202-win_x64\jre"` `set "JAVA_HOME=C:\Zulu\zulu8.36.0.1-ca-fx-jdk8.0.202-win_x64\jre"` For Java, I tried ZuluFX, AdoptOpenJDK and Amazon Corretto. I'm on Windows 7 x64. The .jnlp file is licensed/proprietary and I'd rather not share it. Are there any test .jnlp files that I could try and run? Maybe one of them would have the same issue. Feeling the same about the full log, do you mind if I share you the log via PM? Not sure if the log would be of same use if I cut out any data that I don't want to go public.

Hi Philip,  The document and process identifiers seem to be fine. Possible examples are:  ### Document identifier  `<DocumentIdentifier scheme="dbc-docid"> urn:www.digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au:dbc:einvoicing:doctype:core-invoice:xsd::core-invoice-1##urn:www.digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au:dbc:einvoicing:process:einvoicing01:ver1.0 </DocumentIdentifier>`  ### Process identifier  `<ProcessIdentifier scheme="dbc-procid">urn:www.digitalbusinesscouncil.com.au:dbc:einvoicing:ver1.0 </ProcessIdentifier>`  I tested the current version of SMP and it accepts the values fine.  I don't know your code very well but I was thinking (very simplistically) to initialise the length values and regex values from environment properties for a quick fix. Default values are the current ones. Override with -D arguments ;-) 
@wilkinsona Thanks for the quick feedback! I created https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-17518
That is, strange...  The log that was on Minecraft launcher when the game crashed showed something about Vengeance Spirit.

@farin: the chat window was in use during one normal game, and one test game. It never showed any text. I could not see my own nor other players' text. When I say the panel flashed black, I mean the area above the chat input box - the input box was still visible. The version used was 8abd756.  Java on Mac is tricker than java on Windows in some ways. - The default java version on Mac OS X 10.10 is `1.6.0.jdk`. Apple [made java selection harder](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57986/multiple-java-versions-support-on-os-x-and-java-home-location) than it used to be since OS X 10.8, so it can be assumed "all" Mac users use `1.6.0.jdk`. - As a developer, I could also change JDK to for example `jdk1.7.0_45.jdk`, but this is an exception.  Looking at files in use by the process running JCZ it looks like `1.6.0.jdk`. 
Sounds good. Thank you!

Currently A52. Not currently in a position to push for the newest... and as I said, I couldn't duplicate it locally, so I couldn't see if A59 also exhibited the same behavior. 
@xLaMbChOpSx, thanks for assisting. I completely re-flashed my ROM from scratch without AIMSICD installed and.. faced the same issue. I figured that AIMSICD **cannot** be the cause at all and traced down the Issue to be related to [Aptoide](http://www.aptoide.com/). Within the logs I discovered that the package installer could not find an identifier - I guess Aptoide removed it or something and thus my phone refused letting me press the install button. **All good now, issue solved and world saved.** Thank you for reviewing my logcat. ;-)

Hi,       Here is the output from sstablescrub from two of my tables, the keyspace is "cybersparta" and table is "asalogevents". The table is the one that had the wrong field.

Do you mean the pom.xml files ?  They start with : `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`

I could find it in the code. I have added a log message into SipCallManager.sessionEnded and SipCallManager.cleanupSession but sessionEnded does not seem to be called. 
Even though I only installed JDK, i do find a jre7 folder: C:\Program Files\Java\jre7 containing: readmes and licences and Folder bin containing 85 files and 3 folders (dtplugin, plugin2, server) and folder lib containing 27 Folders and 531 files. but I'm glad that i got the jar to work (with admin via cmd).

No, jumping via the viewer works, but does not enable shortcuts.
Update: Ok, so we're running the following mods now: OpenComputers 1.5.20.38 computronics 1.6.0 Forestry 3.6.12.3  And the Scummy species is completely gone. Also, "Grog" has no recipe anymore. When I check the client-log, this line (http://git.io/vEY0E) never shows up. The config option for OC bees is set to true. Any idea? 
Hi, sadly it's not a non-sense, must be a problem at Zonky side - https://app.zonky.cz/id/283426
Yes, roughly. However this issue while related I think more focuses on the lack of support for Android App Bundle in either Fresco or SoLoader and splitting binaries that way.  I could be mistaken, but this issue is reproducible on every device I've tested, not just select brands.  And as per Fresco shipping guides, there is no note of the use case of shipping via Android App Bundles, and we can't use the `splits` key as when you use `bundle` the `splits` key is ignored.

However, at the point of creating this issue, I hadn't been keeping it running when restarting Che server. After your comment, I tried starting Che server while Registry was running and that hasn't made any difference.   > Also, do you restart a workspace from the User Dashboard or the IDE?  I've been restarting the workspace from the IDE to boot up the workspace machine from the snapshot. 
It is the latest Prerelease 10.3.0-rc1 on Windows x64.
Looks like Jetty 9.4.12.
super cool!
wow thanks for your fast respond. its happened on client. i think the problem is with the multiple files upload, because when i changed the variable to false, the file upload did working (but only for single image).  or maybe i need to setup something else? cause when i tried to upload 3 files (in my laptop browser, its a web after all), it doesnt seems to have any trouble 
I do apologise, A relog cleared the issue.
Hello, @VISTALL!  Thank you very much for such quick response and the update of the implementation! Have just checked: works fine!  > Can you say - how you used Consulo with NodeJS ?

hi @lambdapioneer, I reproduce this issue on Lenovo K900, with android 4.3 inside
Thanks @vietj for getting back quickly, I shall upgrade and test. Will let you know the result shortly.  EDIT: Yes, it's executed by a worker verticle
I'll probably be able to re-check this before the end of this week and will get back to you once I do :)
well a solution may be to use ONE variable witch is increased until you find the first letter and the index of the number of letter matched is > 0 (in my example the first value should be the index 2). That way we keep track of where it COULD start the next recursive sequence. if the match fail, instead of continuing from the current position, as you do now, you'll have to fall back to that stored value.  do you like it?i'm planning to write down some code when i'll have time  whoops, seems like we don't have a way to call a reset on the stream, or to do a peek() of multiple position.  In that case a buffer is the solution, start to save it when you would had set the possible start of recursive sequence. 
just went into my test world and now its working correctly with Minecraft Enderio and NuclearCraft
@jexp, this is a log of an embedded neo4j application. I did some traversal via the Traversal framework (the whole enclosing transaction is read-only). I don't have the storage files, but this very query succeeded the next time, so I believe, the storage was consistent.

I don't think I'm communicating this effectively. It is not an issue of individual verbs, it's an issue of entire classes of verbs/adjectives being handled incorrectly.  You don't need to reinvent the wheel, nor try to fix every irregular individually.

That's correct. I am running 4.3.0-SNAPSHOT (required for my project)
Ok i have updated to 1.9.1 and there is still the same issue.
Yes, this is reproducible. It occurs only after clearing history.  - Android: 10
hey @rucquoy ! I think this would be a great thing to take a stab at. If you don't mind, it would be great to get a build together so that @lime124 could see how it feels on device (with these changes).   Thanks so much!
Sorry, I'm not very familiar with git :-/ What does "pull request" mean?

I'm not sure how exactly this PR should look like.  Ideally there would be only one `DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler` instance which is used everywhere by default (instead of multiple instances whose default configuration needs to be kept in sync), but where should this instance be created and where should it be configured?

I have leveled up with the xp in game but that's about it. I tried making a new world with the mod by itself and I was still invincible. Is there a config I need to change? 
Player Johndoe is online on my mc server and he was jailed several times. And i want to check his record with the command /jail record Johndoe But i have to type in every letter of his name, tab completion doesnt work 
Yeah it doesnt lag anymore
This is for NoMoreRecipeConflict mod. I am using it as a simple gate before a costly recipe look-up, for optimization sake. I don't think this method has any effect outside crafting. You could imagine a modded recipe that first check this method of the inventory. The recipe would work in vanilla crafting table, but not yours. As opposed to other inventory in blocks, where not implementing isEmpty() may bring issues with hoppers.
It works well. Thanks a lot. 👍 
@MHerbst - sorry, but I'm not sure how to do this? - got it DEBUG set to TRACE I suppose. Will try with the next restart, thanks.  But since all other 40 Homematic Things never throw an error, and if I define the 6 wall thermostats without any Channels definitions they don't throw and error either, I'm more inclined to assume it has something to do with the Channels/delay statements.
All other geo-aware apps works fine. Feels more like crash happens when app finally gets location and trying process/save it somehow. When GPS fix already acquired by demand of other app or I standing under clear sky with phone, it crashes immediately. When I'm trying to get location in building (near the window) it takes a while to catch all satellites and narrow down GPS precision to <30 meters.

Hi, Ours is a native android application. We are currently using 3.0.0. But I also looked at the latest github code and looks like the behavior is still the same.

I'm afraid that I could not post the full debug.log because it has been a long time since I last found it. Fortunately I have latest.log at that time and I can post it here [2019-09-21-2.log](https://github.com/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft/files/3702256/2019-09-21-2.log) Let me discribe this issue again. When players log in the game or complete executing teleport command like /tp or /spawn, they would often get disconnected and the game client would display "A fatal error has occurred, this connection is terminated". They can continue to try to log in the game, then meet the same issue and disconnect again. However, by attempting loging in the game over and over again, they can still get logged in and play normally just like this issue has never happened before until next disconnection. I'm sure only AcademyCraft need LambdaLib in my mod list. To my surprise, I tried to remove AcademyCraft related blocks like Imagfusor(machine) in the chunks which I always played in and the frequency of disconnection actually dropped.
It is transport client. I use scala 2.12.  That's all the code left. Then I ran `lsof -p pid | grep TCP | wc -l` every second. The count increased by 3 exactly the same number of es servers configured for the connection. 
I used the last commit.  Set up scene2d ui libgdx test and you will catch these problems easier because it use json e reflection alot.   I remember that the compare was failing (both types should be equal). Is it because type dont have interfacesCache object or for some reason type was created and didn't use the same pointer as type2 ?  
So it seems in a brand new database astar() and dijkstra() are working. But in my existing database where I have subclasses for E and V and many nodes they do not. I have put the property 'weight' on the class E itself, no sure if this is an issue.  If I do ShortestPath I get this:  orientdb {db=SpinOffIntelligence}> SELECT shortestPath(#13:834, #39:27)  +----+-----------------------+ |#   |shortestPath           | +----+-----------------------+ |0   |[#13:834,#23:74,#39:27]| +----+-----------------------+  If I do the other I get this:  orientdb {db=SpinOffIntelligence}> SELECT astar(#13:834, #39:27, 'weight')  +----+-----+ |#   |astar| +----+-----+ |0   |[]   | +----+-----+  orientdb {db=SpinOffIntelligence}> SELECT dijkstra(#13:834, #39:27, 'weight')  +----+--------+ |#   |dijkstra| +----+--------+ |0   |[]      | +----+--------+  In this case it did not throw an exception. I did set weight = 100 for ALL nodes though.  Question is why do these not return any data now?

Thanks for the fix. The problem with the missing update seems to be solved, but other test cases that were successful before do not work anymore.  I tried to describe the problem with a minimal example and therefore omitted `sparse=true`.  
No, I do not know what else to say @bl4ckscor3 
I found out the problem was because I had changed my usenamne on geocaching.com. When I logged in with my new usename, it works just fine. I don't uinderstand how to use maps offline. I can save the caches in my phone so I can use them when I am offline. I cannot use the maps and navigate to them in that case. I always use mobile data when I am geocaching, so that is not a big problem. But, in some areas, there is no connection to the Internet using mobile data. So, how do I get the maps when I am offline?  I use wifi at home and mobile data while I'm outside.  I have the version 2013.05.18.

What i meant was in the Downloads section "zipkin-test-0.1.0.zip"  leads to a file not found error .  
ok, in the simplest possible form: just add the following dependency and the error occurs:   
@taylordelehanty, when you say you can't recompile, I'll need more detail than that to provide guidance.  For instance, please include a link to a gist with the error messages you're getting, or a screen shot of the errors.  Here's a quick gif showing how I'd build the custom version on my Mac.  Your mileage may vary depending on how your environment is setup.  ![buildcustomwhiterabbit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/117722/8367776/b04917be-1b56-11e5-982c-681c755942d0.gif)  @schuemie, would you be able to release v0.5.1 soon after approving this pull request?

I'm located in Croatia. I experienced the same issue in Czech Republic. It seems that content country does not have impact. It was working fine until the last week.
I was looking up a single vertex by its long id. The getVertex API is more convenient because I just want the single vertex back, not an iterable or iterator.  I switched to getVertices, which is what will be called internally if I go through gremlin. Is it the official recommendation that all janus calls go through gremlin? I prefer to use the janus APIs directly when they make sense as I feel that some of the gremlin query re-writing can be a little un-predictable.   Anyways, there's 2 for sure bugs here that need to be addressed, using gremlin won't fix them:  1. The javadoc for getVertex is wrong as it states that it will return null if the vertex doesn't exist. Either we should fix the javadoc or we should fix the method. I would prefer fixing the method, but I'm not sure if anyone is relying on the exception throwing behavior, I would assume not as it's an undeclared assert error. 2. getVertices should not throw an exception when a vertex doesn't exist and batch loading is enabled. I get that we are skipping the existence check to help performance, but once we determine that the vertex doesn't exist, it should just be removed from the response. There's no good reason for having it behave differently when batch loading is enabled.

ı don't think this issue exists at the latest version @vibhusharma101 , thanks for your interest :) Please let me know if you are unable to find a suitable issue for you.

Hello @danglotb ,  There has been in those past 2 weeks lots of updates on Sat4j, you should use this version to reproduce the issue:  https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/tree/ec652dcd90e7277ff373ad073bed9fffa556d867 This is the state of the project at the time I did my experimentation.  Thanks for your help.
Sry, shouldn't have taken a modded dimension^^". It was "Aromas Dimensional World", but it occurs on every Dimension change. Here is the [fml-client-latest.log](http://puu.sh/qeBYo/ccc4c517c7.log)   (Sry, 4MB is too big for pastebin :/) 
No writes to internal SD in my case prolongs the lifespan. Also, maybe caching in memory could be an option for devices with more RAM. Maybe adding a wrapper over the caching stuff that allows to choose either file cache or ram cache?  (Also no traces of 4chin on storage)

Hi all,  No, im using POT textures as well. I have not tested with the latest version of the robovm backend though. Will check if that solves the problem.  But, I have been overriding IOSApplication.Delegate's didBecomeActive and willResignActive to simulate calls to ApplicationListener pause() and resume(); I need these to show a pause screen when the player comes back to the game (after a phone call maybe).   Can the backend be modified to call pause() and resume() just like Android? 
I think so. Would we not want to support Ubuntu 14.04 as well?
Working now, thank you! =D 
Thanks for the answer. I try my best !
 I tested with 27, but it failed too
Yeah we're upgrading to 1.6 to see this solves the problem. Our upgrade cycle is slow.. I'll let you know.
Hello Stephan,  I've checked the changes, and looks good. Where can I reopen a ticket? 
It's almost like the CPU is being bogged down at consistent intervals. so if a video is playing the video playback will stutter slightly and resume. Audio is not affected. Same thing with Gifs, in which they will stutter slightly. I'll test it tomorrow and give you the timing. The problem is solved by ending the program with task manager.

We were using invisible armor stands to project text. Now we're using a holograph plugin and it doesn't seem to be happening. This still however of course happens when an OP (which has perms to hit players wherever they are) hits a player in the SZ
I have tested and it's fixed at this release 1.0.15, thank you very much ! 
Please provide an example if you can 
wouldn't think so, i've never had this issue from any forgemod or other hack client with multimc
I'd rather we go with a similar value as Ethereum.

I've tested this on three machines. It's not showing up on Mac or Windows, only on Liunx64 (Ubuntu 14.04). Even there, it's only showing up the first time the program is opened and the first time the crawler is run so at very least it won't affect many people. 
It's PostgreSQL. In fact, when I type `begin` AND press enter, then it's being uppercased and below the new line `end` is added, but it stays lowercase. As to the Eclipse settings: General > Editors > SQL Editor > SQL Formatting {Convert keyword case: checked, Formatter: Compact formatter, Keyword case: Upper}. If you need more/other settings, please let me know—greetings.

> @k7aravind 1.8.1 is the latest production release (1.7.x should be considered deprecated). Can you tell us what error you are getting?  Can you please tell me how can i see the logs. This is what happens, when I try to open the jnlp file through command prompt using 'javaws abc.jnlp', it works. But if I try to open using windows 'Open With' option, it doesn't. It does not even open any command prompt to  logs things that are happening. This happens only in 1.8 version. Whereas in 1.7.x, even when I open jnlp with 'Open With' option, it immediately opens command prompt where I can see the logs and icedtea-web looks to be working fine.
> It runs well in my local. >  > could you please provide a project that reproduces the issue?  Here is the project for reproduction: https://github.com/JevonYang/nacos-config-server-validate  when the configuration in application.yml, it runs, but config-client could not work. when ths configuration in bootstrap.yml, it runs failed.
Maybe we could think about a OpenStreetMap alternative?

Hi David Thanks for your reply. I was just playing a little more and the 13th directory is OK. I can open it. It is the 14th directory. Unfortunately since I am out and about I can't see the name or content, but once I get to a PC I will give you more details.  Just FYI the previous version of the client worked fine with a very similar directory structure (though all the directories were children of one main directory before on Andriod - when I resynced, the new client changed everything to be under / ). Oh, yes, and the crash happens irrespective of whether I am on 3G or WiFi. Best regards Alex  "David A. Velasco" notifications@github.com wrote:  > Hi @happybee , thanks for your detailed report. >  > What is the name of the 13th directory? How many subdirectories does it > hold?

Raw JUnit5 test, I mock all dependencies (for a service: all repositories, for a rest endpoint, all services, ...).  According to me, using `@QuarkusTest` is for integration test, my definition of a unit test is a test testing only one composant without any dependencies ... So this is a best practice to use raw unit test (without any framework support) and mocking everything so all my tests runs in a few hundreds of ms from my IDE ...
Fixed in #165.  I don't think it matters too much if it doesn't display in the buyback menu - I'm going to be improving that part of the UI at some point. ^^  I will add a small price decrease for cum-stained clothing, good idea!
Sure thing! GCraft is v4.0.0.106 BC is v7.99.5 also running simple fluid tanks v1.6.0.1  The one image shows straight GCraft pipes and as you see the reservoir doesn't fill. The other shows a single gold fluid pipe segment which is enough to get it to work. I can't seem to duplicate the anomoly that happened earlier... but i can detail exactly what i did.  I placed 2 simple fluid tanks and connected them to the refinery, one in for oil connected to the face with the oil tank, the other to the bottom and wrenched to it pull. I then went to the oil tank with a creative bucket and started filling with oil but the oil drained faster than I could fill. I looked over and found the dense oil tank filling with oil. The oil seemed to pass through the refinery as if it was a pipe segment. I was even able to wrench pipes in order to pump it back through in the bottom of the refinery and out the side, again as if the refinery was just a pipe segment.  ![gc pipe only](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29808007/27967455-215f66a2-6311-11e7-8018-b942b560e0d1.png) ![with bc pipe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29808007/27967456-216ff530-6311-11e7-8d70-293e18932093.png)  
Yeah, I know what you mean. Chat events tend to get a bit messy when you have formatters and filters all listening and acting on them. In my case, [ChatControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrol.271/) is the main incompatibility; I have to set its "Formatter" listener priority to "MONITOR" in the config, which then breaks my punishment plugin's mute command.  Edit: Scratch the mute thing, that seems to have broken with a recent update of ChatControl. >.< 
Hi,  Thanks for your reaction. I'll try out your suggestion and will let you know if the behaviour is as expected.  Regards,  Rudie. 
ah ok,  yes I use it: public static final FSTConfiguration FST_CONFIG = FSTConfiguration.createAndroidDefaultConfiguration();  static {         FST_CONFIG.setShareReferences(false);         FST_CONFIG.registerClass(String.class etc etc );     }  maybe the fallback doesn't work on older android versions ? 
The compiled .apk comes to 1679 KB.  Also to add: the garbage collection seems to happen after the startService() call has been made, I've tried moving around when the service is started (for testing) and found the garbage collection always occurs just after the service is started. 
> Must be something special concerning your input file.  I tried several input scores including ALL examples shipped with audiveris. None of them works in my Mac. I cannot speak for Windows/Linux because I don't have an access to either for the time being.
No, but it shouldn't exclude directories just because they contain a BUCK file - it should only exclude directories if that BUCK file defines a project_config for that directory/module.  An example would be a module containing a lib/ directory which in turn contained both .jar files and a BUCK file with a load of prebuild_jar entries. Since the commit referenced above, that lib/ directory is being excluded from its parent module and is therefore hidden in IntelliJ. It wouldn't make sense to put a project_config() in lib/BUCK because there are no appropriate src_roots... there are no sources. 
it's still going on after various restarts (still stuck on the same game). I havent any step by step to reproduce the problem as it happen as soon as i installed the latest release; Reinstalling HotSUploader doesnt solve the problem either (and i did not touch the saved replay folder). I really wish i could help you more with this one but i dont know how I could, any way that i could get the logs or anything that could help solve this ?
It does indeed.  I was just about to submit a pull request recommending subprocess.call(). 
sonar openedge plugin 1.9.2 with sonarqube 5.6.  Riverside rules plugin 1.0.4.  Thanks. 
I would settle for either smushing it all into one line:    As long as there's no lines starting with `|` and it compiles I could go either way. My work around just moves the "| true" back on to the previous line.  
@johspaeth you are right. `GeneralDigest` is added to the list `classes` and the [code](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis/blob/129c90dbd4d6f3c38523865d3bb792616f8755b8/CryptoAnalysis/src/main/java/crypto/typestate/CryptSLMethodToSootMethod.java#L72) adds `<org.bouncycastle.crypto.digests.GeneralDigest: void update(byte)>, <org.bouncycastle.crypto.digests.GeneralDigest: void update(byte[],int,int)>]` to the `res`

Here is everything from my pom for packetlistenerapi https://pastebin.com/wE4YG6wV
Target API is 28. It is failing on my phone, not the emulator (my test on the emulator it worked fine as well). My phone is running Android Q B5. It appears to only crash when accessing certain PDF files. These files are in the downloads folder and were downloaded from the browser. I can open these files fine using the built-in viewer.
Yep, fixed, thanks. 
Starting from Eclipse it seems to be fine
On `Apache Maven 3.1.1` Same problem appears on `Apache Maven 3.2.1` 
Does this work?  Steps to reproduce:   1. Use GA on iPhone   2. Have multiple logins listed (let's say Google, Amazon, Facebook)   3. Delete the last login (Facebook)   4. Before the app has fully refreshed/updated and removed the Facebook login from your screen, delete the same login again   5. After app has processed this, instead of just deleting the Facebook login (and throwing an error the second time around), it will have deleted both the Facebook and Amazon logins (i.e. the last and second-last login in your list of logins).
I've tried only on Android - real device and simulators 
Wrote a small sample and my previous statement with the ID's seems to be wrong.  ID will be just the name without `LOCAL` and `REMOTE` with the `ignoreTags` filter.  Will also investigate further, but this is what I used, maybe you have some tips for me:    
lol :smile:  
When you create a class to use in the body of an endpoint api, the java client generates a class for it. If you specify a parameter byte[] in the endpoint api body, the java client generated class will have a function encodeparameter with byte[] as value and a function set parameter with string as function.
With 2.2.3-SNAPSHOT, the stacktrace is different but the issue still exists:   
When I started the restore it was on, however I turned it off while it was still restoring.  When I turned it back after the restore it continued to backup all of the sms on the phone (which at that point was just the restored ones) 
When I simply open Terasology and click on Single Player nothing happen. When I open in terminal using ./run_linux.sh Single Player don't work either, but in console come out this error message that i gave. 
Yes, I can try to implement what I suggested, by mid next week. Will that be OK with you?
When i disalbe killaura entity i don't have this issue anymore
it didnt have any properties when i mined it which is the thing
Can you tell me where the logs would be located?  I tried the different versions of config_dir, but all end up in the same result. Also --trace or --debug did not display any additionall information.
I don't know how to see the profilers can you please help me with this?

Look at the gif in the comment. 
Thanks for reviewing my suggestion. Yes, my confusion is from the fact that myMultiplyFunction is defined further down into the file. Can the definition come first?

I use this [plugin](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/NFC), but I have the same problem with this [plugin](https://github.com/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc).  There seems to be something that does prevent and does not allow the passage of information in the application.  I also tried the [babbelLab](https://github.com/babbelLab/cordova-plugin-kiosk) fork, but the problem is the same. 
I added baritone-1.2.9.jar and baritone-1.2.9-sources.jar to /libs in my forge mod folder structure as I couldn't get the baritone gradle dependency to work as documented here: https://jitpack.io/#cabaletta/baritone
The solution to problem: When the Vertex types of an edge are detected to be different, then validate that directed == TRUE, else throws error.   This will ensure consistent representation without flipping around different types.  ### Update: this was not the solution
@artembilan It makes sense that it should work and it does work in the test. However, I can't get it to work with a web-based boot app. I added `spring-cloud-gcp-starter-storage`, but I just keep getting `Could not open ServletContext resource [/gs://<bucket>/<object>]`. What am I missing?
I have tried in different file types, same issue. Also found someone that seems to have the same issue, reported [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115009228428-Problem-with-Surround-selection-on-text-insertion-).
@davidohayon669, other controls work fine.  Android's three dots menu always does not work for non fullScreen mode.
Unfortunatly, I can't remember ever using a mod that caused similar problems. I played around with Ruins and PlaceMod but if I remember correctly, Ruins doesn't add stuff to villages and PlaceMod only spawned its own villages using its own logic.   But thanks for looking into it!
no, just the app needs restart. 
Sorry for not replying fast. I have my phone rooted and use greenify to keep apps out of using RAM. So not that much RAM usage. Also, I haven't used KISS for a week or so for I am using "ap15". As I have mentioned it, can you work on such a Launcher too. That would be great. Or options in KISS to show all app names on home screen with customization options.
1.7.10 and the latest version of AR 
I can reproduce it like this: 1. `create db test <root/>` 2. Insert nodes: `for $i in 1 to 1000000 return insert node <test/> into /root` 3. Replace values: `for $i in /root/* return replace value of node $i with "test2"` --> cancel during execution 4. No more queries can be executed  Sometimes it works, i guess it depends on the point of time of the cancellation. It seems that the query is still running cause executing of other database commands isnt possible too. 
It's definitely not correct ;-). Well, you can try to observe `ProcessBean` instead of `ProcessAnnotatedType`, analyze its `ProcessBean.getAnnotated()` and then use `ProcessBean.getBean().getQualifiers()`.

If it is of interest I think I have it replicated in a smaller way that you could try it out, the repo is over at: https://github.com/LukeButters/conscrypt-jetty basically you need to start that web server send non stop http 1.0 requests to it and very very very slowly the memory just keeps growing. @flooey this is the best reproducible case I have so far, I don't know how to make it leak faster sorry.  Here is a graph of it growing over ten days  ![leak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7076477/65667175-81d37500-e082-11e9-86ae-c0892f870b80.png)  I also mentioned this to the jetty users mailing list over at https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jetty-users/msg09100.html 
I didnt really pay attention to that because I have never edited the messages.yml file.
Yes, i use the version 0.10.1 I tried with one of your svg file. In fact this is my xml widget code

@macdonst I implemented locally in Xcode changes for all 4 files from [this request](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/pull/2363/files), relaunch app on my device and it not helped. Notifications worked but without sound. Maybe I missed something?  ##### Additional info:  1. Without my fixes (original plugin version and version with [2266](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/pull/2363/files) fixes) using received token from plugin, I can send notification with `Production VoIP Services Certificate` 
Here is an example how to reproduce the problem https://gist.github.com/stepango/52e9c69186317af1e95b 
Using the Elasticsearch API. The problem is that when setting the allowed maximum number of indices in the server configuration, the web interface would only display this exact number of indices. These indices were always open (the only active buttons in the web UI were 'close index' and 'delete index' and the closed but retained indices would not show up. Not being presented with appropriate manuals made me resort to the ES API.  I'm glad to hear that this seems to be resolved in the latest beta; I'm looking forward to testing it by myself. Thanks. 
That is awesome @ashaar364 !  Would you be around at all some time this week to talk through the proposed contribution process stuff that _just_ got added to the repository?  This would be an excellent chance to try it out in the wild.  (Happy to talk through it by email too if time is tight, although it would be good to meet!) 
@igormoreno ok - try with this commit https://github.com/benchflow/benchflow/pull/266/commits/b4f8adb9ac869c47bd799d03d971161bbd41fc31

yes it does 👍, I made exactly the same change, but I figured the other places also need  update since it will fail if master changes and so on.
Thanks for reply! Yes, I am very keen to contribute, I'll work on it.

I think I cancelled it, but not sure at this point (was on vacation and not paying close attention), sorry.  I think the main thing I would have expected is for the size reporting to have a reasonable value, or switch to showing just bytes transferred if it can no longer calculate percentage. Since it appears to be tolerant of deletion (this is good I think) - at least the display should be corrected.  (There's also something to be said for having it only check size once -- does OC actually tolerate the file size increasing DURING the upload process?)  However, I can also see some justification for: If it's going to continuously check the size - it might be worthwhile to note the deletion and abort the transfer. (I can also see the opposite - OC could protect against an accidental deletion if the upload was already in progress...) No strong opinion on the behavior choice - but the UI shouldn't display a gibberish percentage when it doesn't know the file size any more.   Another option - grab the file size continuously as you are now, but cache the last successful one. If you can no longer determine the size, use the cached value going forward, but highlight that it's out of date in the progress UI in some manner.  
An error still pops up: https://pastebin.com/DEwLa9F7  The database name changed to meerkatvotingplugin instead of meerkat-votingplugin  Also, I'd really like to keep my namespace the same for every plugin.
I've attached the log showing a few runs of the application. This time the debugger seemed to mostly stop. I think it was something like 2 times stopped, 1 didn't, 3 times stopped, 1 didn't.  WRT delve, I have an entry, `dlv.path=d:/dev/projects/_go/bin/dlv.exe`, in idea.properties to point to a delve I sometimes build myself and it installs under GOPATH/bin. The problem with not always stopping on breakpoints happens with the delve you bundle with the plugin, as well. I haven't changed anything that I can recall which would affect how Idea starts other than the VM memory settings.  One possibly related note is that yesterday when I reported this issue, I was using the default Idea settings for the heap, 128m start and 768m max. I normally use higher values than these and for the runs you see in the log, I had set starting heap to 1024m and max to 2048m. I'm not sure if the intermittent stopping is related to memory use, but with the default settings it seemed that the debugger mostly didn't stop. For the runs with more memory allocated, it seemed to mostly stop.  [idea-log.txt](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin/files/233078/idea-log.txt) 
Thanks! I'll add a unit test and PR it to this issue later today, as I'm in a meeting right now.

I moved the warzone lobby to the west side of the zone, the spawn that messes up is towards the east side.  Zone layout: NW: -48,63,164 SE: 123,63,72 So, a length (x) of  171, and width (z) of 92.    Warzone ent: 38,63,68 (the sign in the center of the platform)  Team one working spawn room: 14,68,78 (26 blocks from warzone)  Team two non-working spawn room: 61,69,158 (93 blocks from warzone)  The room I ended up having to put the spawn to make it work correctly: 70,68,88 (38 blocks from warzone)  Hope that helps and isn't just a jumble of garbage.  If you'd like I can give you my server info and let you hop on and mess directly with it.  I have no issues testing revisions of the plugin to get this fixed!

Hi David, Thank you for the correction. I'm not sure what the master branch is. I tried using these function for a groovy script instead of the imagej ones. Since i mostly write script that i distribute to my imaging facility users, i'll prefer to test the modification once the IJPB update site is updated. Rémy
Yes they can access anything in the same area. Anything at all, just not the activation of the portal. They can occasionally open the interface to the Keystone Receptacle, but that is it. And we aren't sure how they do that when it happens.  It is the same problem with and without rune combinations. Once we figured out it was a problem, we stepped into a brand new world and tried tons of different combinations and the like. Different set ups, different combinations, different numbers of gates on the same combination. While i am here, i do have a question, where Gates that have a rune combo only accessible by a Keystone with the same combo your original design? Or are Gates that share the same combination should be able to link to each other without a keystone?

@eolivelli  yes is correct, bk2 had been partitioned from the network. We were writing on bookkeeeper with replica 2 (precisely at that moment on bk1 and bk2) and at that moment bk3 was reading the data from bk2. When bk2 was partitioned, we expected bk3 to read from bk1 after a few minutes. Instead after 30 minutes he was still trying to read the data from bk2.  I have this expection from bk3 logs:

Hi Jurgen, according to the Eclipse updater I'm already on the latest release (0.5.3.201211132019) and the problem still occurs. 
That's a great guess, but I've already compiled most, if not all, of my static dependencies PIC.  I'm out sick today, but one example is that dyld won't be able to find the shared library for gtest-main.  Bizzarrely, that's a Bazel-built shared library completey unrelated to the other dependecy with the static child (which happens to be gRPC).  So in this unit test example:  ''' cc_test( ...   deps = [    "gtest-main",    "gRPC", # depends on static foo.a   ], )  ... the so for gtest-main will not be found unless I set linkstatic=1 on gRPC.  Strange but true.  
I see, but did you try to connect again after turn off/on with device being discoverable? Because my problem is that when Bluetooth turns on I call `establishConnection` and then it hangs.  I am using Nexus 6P, Android N Preview 4    This is the code. 
Sorry for the late reply :/ So here are the pics, and, you know, i know what i am doing with server side :) You guys are awesome in programming, but server side is my stuff :) Again, here the pics:  ![unbenannt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5807595/10167364/83b24a5a-66c8-11e5-8452-17fc3d7fe2fb.png)  ![unbenannt2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5807595/10167372/87e23e14-66c8-11e5-8c18-6a4d775de388.png)  (Also one more thing, is the Pegasus gate intentionally not working, like setting itself together to a ring, or is it just this build?)(And if so, is the Pegasus gate actually dialing with the lights, or as a normal Stargate (in this version of your mod rewrite of course :) ) 
The Git Synchronize dialog is working again for me, perhaps after a restart. With the latest build (0.1.1.20151110-1130) and several restarts, the Task List view still appears as the previous image each time, so is not intermittent.  It is difficult for me to tell when the problems began since I have several workspaces I use regularly, leave multiple instances of Eclipse up for days, use slightly different toolsets/views (e.g. git sync / task list) in different workspaces, and have only switched to the Clean Sheet theme in some of them.  I was previously using a Mars M7 build, but updated Clean Sheet as well as the platform around 9 Nov to `eclipse.buildId=4.5.1.M20150904-0015` which seems to be the latest Mars.1 release. My build has JDT, WTP, Mylyn, EGit, Subversive, and little else, so I don't suspect any SWT/UI conflicts occurring.  ![ec](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2455397/11064504/2cd139e0-8783-11e5-8132-1d5aec1cd56e.png)

In the new version I can't reproduce the error. So I closed the issue... 
Yes, that's what it should do.   Problem is that it doesn't go to half, it goes to a bit more than half. I thought the screenshots/explanatory text would explain it.  My screen is a 4:3 screen, 1280:1024 pixels. It should try to fit it to half the screen, then notice the client doesn't fit, and make it as big as it has to be.  But, it makes the client slightly bigger, see: black bars. These can be removed if I manually resize the client.  If it's not clear, I can make a video on it.  Ps: sorry for not replying, Deathbeam, I must've forgotten. If I use other programs, they take half the width, but they don't have a minimum width. If you know of a program that also has a minimum width, I can test it.
I used Lingering Souls and Battle Screech.
I uninstalled Google Contact Sync using Titanium Backup. I just tested this again by installing/uninstalling it again, and found that I can easily reproduce the error. It requires 2 reboots before the group UID shows back up 
Unfortunately I do not, apologies.
I've created a screencast of DBeaver 6.2.5: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T3CKL02uc8U-QVmczk4HUxOjRpTMTSeE/view?usp=sharing 
I think updating the user guide to say replace step 1 from https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin with 'brew install gdb' and following the rest of the steps, then going into keychain to ensure the self signed cert is always trusted should be a sufficient update. I could try my hand at writing a post explaining it all later on if that would help.

Yes. Also, happens for clicking completed download. If there is more than 1 completed it sometimes tries to open the other completed file, not the one clicked
I was running 1.0.7f as I was unaware that you updated it 27h ago, now everything works as intended, I still would love a filter where I can actually enter the mod name though, so you could just take this as a suggestion instead of an issue. 
I'm willing to put in some effort, but I'm afraid that I might have some difficulty finding the problem and could really use some help  I'm using 1.10.19. I tested with 2.0.31-beta also and it appears there as well. 
MAC, linux 都测试过，都是这样。
I also cant olace torches on the trunks or any block for that matter on anywhere on the tree 
6.0.8.2 at this moment. I'll Need to re-test this issue on the Weekend, but i got an infected ear at the Moment and am out of order.
In my case chunking happens because I have Varnish in front of my nginx webserver compressing text files with gzip. I don't know how to reproduce this directly but maybe people in the owncloud bug know. possibly by enabling gzip chunked is used? 
A missing calendar add-on means, that the intent _in c:geo_ cannot be started.  A missing calendar provider means, that _the addon_ could not find the system service for calendars. I had added some inline TODO's in the code. 
Sent you a New crash report. My OS is brand new and nope Have no second device  
I am using the lastest version (2.0.0-SNAPSHOT), and I am getting the same exception of the past version (at org.openstack4j.openstack.compute.domain.ext.ExtAvailabilityZones$ExtAvailabilityZone.getHosts(ExtAvailabilityZones.java:61)) and the documentation still says that that the method is not really implemented yet. I realized that in the class ExtAvailabilityZones, the hosts map has a "jsonIgnore" annotation, and the http call is not the one which returns the information with the details I need, I made two changes and the method started to work for me, I will do a pull request for you with my changes, let me know if I am in a good way. 
No changes were made.
I checked strings of text to make sure that threading was not the issue.  I could not find them anywhere on my Gmail account.  Installed 1.0.11.   Started to send messages to contacts just to get a bunch of received SMS going.  After 10 minutes, I'm not seeing any auto back ups hitting Gmail (checking Gmail, don't know how to see the status on the phone).  I did a manual backup.  Checked Gmail and only sent SMS are seen.  None of the received ones were found (tried doing a search again just to make sure it was not threading).    By the way, does SMS Backup+ save a rotating log file anywhere on the phone?

@skabashnyuk thanks for your response, still waiting on checking the issue as I needed to upgrade OpenShift to 3.11 in order to make use of chectl for deployment. Nearly there I think, OpenShift is upgraded but chectl doesn't seem to want to work, not sure if you have seen this issue before, I am getting:  > Failed to connect to Kubernetes API. E_CHECTL_UNKNOWN_ERROR - Message: Protocol "http:" not supported. Expected "https:"  when attempting to run `chectl server:start`. I have opened a bug report for this issue #14712  I will get back to you with a response as soon as I have been able ot install using the operator.
Absolutely sure. I am able to insert the textual single word clipboard content into K9 and into Google input field in Firefox. But in Kontalk only the blue indicator showing the input position (the blue 'drop' in your screenshot) appears but not the 'paste' button above. Independently of the input method (Swype or AOSP). 
@bonii-xx  
@jDramaix Thanks for fixing this. 
Yeah, it has been fixed. Thank you
@nitaliano I followed the documentation here to generate the APK. [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html#content](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html#content)  Here is the app/build.gradle  
Yes, I can provide an example (unfortunally this issue tracker won't let me add a pom.xml or pom.txt as attachment :( - so I have to add the pom content directly):  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>    </project>  The problem is caused by the dependency declaration.  If it is removed all runs fine.  If it is defined, the rule execution crash with a NPE ... probably because a POM artifact hasn't "real" dependencies ? But we need/use such declarations in our parent pom to force all projects to rely on some basic dependencies

Well like I said the same thing happens if I close and restart the server as well, so it's not that.  Also I'd consider not supporting /reload a bug as well, I need to /reload sometimes to update plugin configs for plugins that don't have an individual plugin reloading command. It takes like 5+ minutes for the server to restart. Couldn't you detect the reload somehow and do whatever you need to do over again?  Also I'm using v1.5.3.
Yes, it happens regardless of the character type (letters, figures, special, capital or not).  If I select a first contact via the list and type additional characters in the search field to search for a second contact, the same phenomenon happens (the manually typed characters cant be deleted).  Note that this doesn't happen in the general search field of the welcome page, only on the contact page after pressing the "+" button.
Good question @cwhelan  I tried with the following minimal alleles input, and it worked without error:  On the other hand, I confirmed that the case with the original, full `--alleles` input still crashes on the latest GATK, version 4.0.10.1.  I don't think there is anything particularly special about the command line I'm using, except maybe the `-L 22`: `$HOME/gatk-4.0.10.1/gatk --java-options "-Xmx4g" HaplotypeCaller -R $HOME/GRCh37files/hs37d5.fa -I /mnt/fast/test.bam -O gatk.issue5336.test.HaplotypeCaller.vcf.gz -L 22 --genotyping-mode GENOTYPE_GIVEN_ALLELES --alleles gatk.issue5336.test.vcf.gz`  I will try to play around with the alleles input to get a small set where I can reproduce the issue... 
through essentials there is a money limit that a player may have at $ 100,000. If the player has 100,000 in his hands, then when they withdraw money from the ATM, they disappear. There is not enough verification whether it is possible to give the player money or not. 
Tried it on a new world with a spawn egg and only SW mod. And yes, they are either invisible, or not there. I also tried a regular wolf and it spawns normally.  When I do a spawn egg, they don't seem to spawn at all. I don't hear barking or growling when I spawn a creeper next to that position. When I spawn a normal wolf and use a treat to make it sophisticated, it turns invisible but I can hear it growling.  I'm using a docker container. Here is the command I ran:  `sudo docker run -it -d -p 25566:25565 --name=mc_test -e EULA=TRUE -v /mnt/raid/config/mc_test/:/data -e UID=1003 -e TYPE=FORGE -e FORGEVERSION=11.14.3.1450 -e SEED=-1339183346 -e 'JVM_OPTS=-Xmx2048M -Xms1024M'  itzg/minecraft-server` 
That's what I'm thinking. If we use possible semantics elsewhere then why does this model not type check without errors?  Anyways, if you move both operations from `B` to `A` these classes still don't have `op` in common (see below), but now the model TCs without errors?   
Yes, both latest version. Right after connection
Hey @sarxos, thanks for the quick reply!  I'm not using any logging framework aside from my own embedded logging interface. I played around with including a logback configuration file in my working directory and got some output from the logger that your API is using. Should there be any particular configuration settings I should be including in the logback.xml file?  Thanks again. 
@Nadahar I don't mean the bug was caused by f5afcde, just that that was the version I was using when the bug occurred. I'm not sure if it could be related, I haven't noticed the bug described in #672 before 
It's not always reproduceable. But my impression is it happens more often if the numbers are not changed after they are set from the suggest button. 
I discovered this a couple of days ago and wondered since I thought we implemented that. Then I discussed this with OSIO-Che team and not everyone thought that we should implement it, but we agreed that it is better to ask you and Stevan.
Hi @macdonst. Sorry for the late answer. Xmas holidays :-).  Your commit does fix the behavior I described, when app is force-closed.   _EDIT - My mistake, removed._  Let me know if I can be of any help. Thanks! 
That sounds great, any idea when a version with the fix will be available in Fdriod? I'd prefer to not have to install the APK directly.  I agree, colons in filenames are not great, but some artists / podcasts put colons in the names of the titles of songs/episodes, so they inevitably end up in the filenames.    There are lots of music players that can play files that have colon in their name, I'm not sure what the technical limitation of parsing out special characters from a file name would be: * The default music player that ships with Lineage OS * Music-Player: https://github.com/MaxFour/Music-Player * Simple-Music-Player: https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Music-Player * Vanilla Music: https://github.com/vanilla-music/vanilla  There are other's I'm sure, these are just the ones that worked as I went down the list of music players in Fdroid. I prefer the UI in Odyssey and how it handles relative-path playlists, so I'd really rather continue using it rather than switching to something else if this can be fixed.  Edit: I'm not a java programmer, but in the commit mentioned above, why not split on "://" instead of ":" to handle URLs?
I am not sure how to separate Optifine and LiteLoader from Forge.

Thanks for your reply, divadsn, I tried so far: - turn the notifications off/on - I have the Google Dialer set as a default phone app - turn on the priority notifications for the Dialer  Unfortunately, still no luck.
Hi @karldahlgren  it's working like charm , thank you so much .  but i found another issue , which is related to response Unicode . if the response is coming in languages like Arabic,China,Herdaw    it's coming like rubbish data.  can you please provide fix for this issue or it's related to Spring boot configuration?  Thank you.  
I am using version. 14.1.1-RC-3.  As for security I meant my own security issues without encrypyion as information that would be passed is sensitive I do apologize for the confusion.  As a simple request, would it be possible to add an optional password to the encryption so if you don't have the password you cannot read the encrypted data? I just want as much informational security as possible. 
@mrniko sure, it's a singleton injected into the RedissonClientFactory.  
I was using macOS and it didn’t work.
Oh, I forgot that I recorded a video of me doing just that: https://youtu.be/0tbFpkUKiEY I created a new instance with only Optifine, FBP and forge, on a fresh world.
Could it be a maven `settings.xml` thing?

Appologies for not including a version: This was on Roots 3.0.7.  The server I play on has just updated to Roots 3.0.10, which fixes at least the Aqueous Soil bug, as what was once fully grown nether wart just sitting there (unlike the auto-dropping wheat right next to it) is now never fully grown and my nether wart collection is growing.  Caelic seems to work faster now. Magmatic has not grown and Terran gave me 1 or 3, so I can't tell yet if it's doing anything. Still investigating whether sugarcane works as expected on Aqueous soil.  I will report back and possibly close the issue if I can't find anything weird.
Sure, do you happen to have a Maven snapshot release I can point at? 
When the client starts there is a loding time. In this time i wanted to resize the window. When i resized the window by dragging from top border it moved and resized in height.  So when i started resizing the bounds were like  x:300 y:100 w:400 h:600. After resizing it was about x:300 y:183 w:400 h:517. While resizing it moved the window by the same amount the window got resized.  I think it could be resize and drag at the same moment, based on the window size. Because the windows forms top border was ca 83px under the mouse after dragging.  P.S. Not real numbers and i can not reproduce it because my pc is without os atm.
@greenrobot Yes, it is reproducible. And objectbox version is v1.3.4. More info:  1. I have delete my default.json file by mistake at first. 2. The objectbox rebuild default.json file, but its IDs also reset, so I follow steps （https://docs.objectbox.io/advanced/meta-model-ids-and-uids）to increase IDs and test it to upgrade my recent app, the result is OK.  3. But some app users report that it would crash when upgrade app, the logcat show me that nativeCreate crash.
Thank you @vsch for investigating. Maybe I am using the API incorrectly.  Here is a minimal test case (in Scala) that passes in 0.26.4 and fails in 0.34.40  
This no longer affects downstream directly as we've removed the Che icons from CRW's plugin view.  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-561  So... if everyone is cool with the ugliness in the light theme as it stands today in Che, then we can close this in favour of #14510   > In that case I suggest we merge the existing PR for #14510 and leave the question of icon serving/storing for another day.  I don't see a PR linked from that issue. Am I blind? 
Yes. Try this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAUprtSLJt6YEtBjiZRAHIg It happened for me after load + 3 page scrolls.  For search: "en qué país está desarrollando la vacuna para el coronavirus" on the second page.  If you need more examples I have it.
I bumped up my glide version from `4.3.1` to `4.5.0` and the issue is now gone. If I go back I'm still getting the warning. It seems the OkHttp integration library doesn't actually make a difference for this issue. In my case updating wasn't a problem so I'll use the latest.   Thanks.
@jiazhai Yeah, it seems to have some sort of issues about DNS but still can't fix by using various internet providers or proxies. anyway the command `mvn package` with option `-DskipTests` works and fixed the building failures. Thanks
@Grover-c13  for what i have see, there are multiple problems 1. the cache object it's not returned (so the cache it's not working) 2. if the cache object it's returned, the object on it won't update after 'user' action ie:    -- i catch a pokemon, it should disappear from list of catchable (it should disappear after the encounter i think)    -- i loot a fort, he should have looted expires    -- pokestop should be invariant objects? using their ids has hashcode to update them? 
From the NWBib point it's not urgent as I deployed a more robust way of processing the URIs yesterday. 
> Did it ever work with the new binding?  I don't recall it ever working.  OTOH, the post I linked to above stated that it worked in 2.5 M2. Frankly, I don't see anything materially different between M2 and M4, other than the charset change you already mentioned.  From what I saw, even the `javax.mail` and `org.apache.commons.mail` lib versions didn't change.  As it works with the OH1 binding, there must be something different... 
@rbygrave thanks for the workaround, but a workaround isn't a fix. I would expect a stateless update to work with `CascadeType.ALL`. This bug is the reason why we are stuck with an older version of Ebeans, the newer versions are unusable for production due to this issue.  Note that a fix for this and another issue was proposed in https://github.com/ebean-orm/ebean/pull/1403, but was rejected due to refactoring work. The provided unit test shows that a proper solution never made it to `master`.
Well, it just got strange. Apparently if I exit the game with fuel in the reactor, it will properly add it to the system when I start it up again. Reactor Layout: ![2017-04-24_21 14 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7060121/25364843/341e8ed4-2933-11e7-9c67-cf767b30e5f3.png) 
 No, that's it.
> I just made a quick fix and made a SNAPSHOT release (fix is not yet on github). > Can you please check with version `2.2.3-SNAPSHOT` and see if it works fine for you? If yes, I will make push the fix and make a release.  How do I get 2.2.3-SNAPSHOT? I can't get it from maven.
I dropped our SFB in the hellosceneform example and got this result:  ![screenshot 13 06 2018 08 33 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22001502/41335040-cb07883c-6ee7-11e8-90fe-ff6011f777f8.png) It touches the plane but it also has the peter-panning. The suggested_collision section of the SFA file is like this:      "suggested_collision": {           "type": "Box",            "center": {             "y": 0.302197,              "x": 0.005333000000000032,              "z": 0.0           },            "size": {             "y": 0.604394,              "x": 0.5046660000000001,              "z": 0.494           }         }  I calculate it by iterating through the OBJ file and calculating the min and max value for each component. Is there a way to visualize the bounding box in Sceneform to see whether the model and its bbox match?

Apologies for not picking these notifications up sooner. I spent this morning code walking the [Forsaken Soul](https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/blob/1.12/src/main/java/WayofTime/bloodmagic/ritual/types/RitualForsakenSoul.java ) ritual and the [Cloned Soul](https://github.com/Ipsis/Woot/blob/1_12/src/main/java/ipsis/woot/plugins/bloodmagic/RitualClonedSoul.java) ritual. I see a couple of things that might be clues.  Uniqueness appears to be calculated as a penalty not a boost. Since your code runs this as a constant it should not be an issue.  One difference I see right away is that the original [lines 113-118] includes a *4 multiplier for animal mobs, while you fix this at *1 for all entities. I don't think that's the root cause, but it could help.  The other difference I see is in the health calculation, the original uses entity.getMaxHealth() [line 120], whereas yours is a little more...complicated :) [lines 143-148]. Apart from uniqueness, this is probably the key value driving the calculation of crystalbuffer/willbuffer amounts. I'd want to see if this somehow progressively lowers as time goes on for some reason.   
ok,It could work for 5.1.1 but would set CHE_HOST和CHE_DOCKER_IP_EXTERNAL https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/3846
Fixed, thanks so much!

The player executes the command /unl glass (or any id 1.14) Then I restart the server and when the player enters, this appears in console https://gist.github.com/iGuillem/9c4f00a4f4c7de78fa87cc93739c139a I don't remember if the player disconnected before restarting or if he was ejected on restart I don't know what other screenshot I could show
I wrote a letter to your email fredsa@google.com Thanks for the response. 
I'm not sure what's being proposed so I thought I'd try to clarify a bit.  I'm using the primary file directory feature as a way to avoid a bibtex file that contains a full, machine-specific path the files directory -- a full path doesn't work when the bibtex file is checked out on different machines or by different users  (#2930).  Specifying a primary file directory does get around that problem but it causes the one I'm mentioning in this issue.    So, as the beta stands right now, JabRef 4.0 is considerably more annoying to use (in this regard) than JabRef 3.x.    It doesn't seem to me that there's a documentation fix for this.  But maybe there's something I don't understand.
I'm using the Dokan version that came with Cryptomator; is it safe to install a newer one? > Dokan Library 1.2.0.1000 (x64)  The same thing is happening in all my vaults (all in OneDrive). No special characters (or spaces) in any file names. 
It seemed consistant if it was locked onto a spawner that didnt exist... but if i moved away it would work fine.. i do have mods changing spawners drops... enderio adds broken spawners and actually additions adds spawner shards but neither one changes the spawner itself.. also have recurent  complex adding vanilla blaze spawners to the overworld.

It'd be nice to filter by visibility as [is done in calabash-android](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android/blob/3b3eb4b436df061cadcc4a8879c8b19f072ffbf3/ruby-gem/test-server/instrumentation-backend/src/sh/calaba/org/codehaus/jackson/map/introspect/POJOPropertyBuilder.java#L337). 
It is 4.0.20-6 on the Note 4:  ![screen shot 2017-04-22 at 01 03 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17218461/25404215/57e9ead0-29ff-11e7-8b66-216ebad12e5b.png)  I haven't tested it myself on the Note 3, a user did that. But my workaround has fixed it for the Note 3, too, the user has tested it.  I am curious what Samsung will respond. Please write their response here if possible.  Additionally it seems that Google didn't turn the webview authentication method off on April 20th. Does that mean it has been postponed? So that Samsung can fix the issue before the webview authentication will be completely disabled?  Thank you very much for your quick responses!  Kind regards  Dominique

@Banbury I think it's because the game is arbitrarily adding 5px to the height of the window in a lot of its calculations. I cannot confirm this because my swing knowledge is still lacking.  Happens in every game I try with multiple panels but only when using look and feel settings other than Metal (default) and nimbus from my Debian system.
It's not quite clear to me atm.  We're experiencing that documents are randomly not being released by some stages. (That might be a bigger issue though)  To mitigate this we're resetting their states by modifying their state in mongo if they have been stuck too long. This is done in a rather naive way, so unfortunate reset can lead to this, but I'm not sure. 
I suspect it was introduced in the CECP code, so it should be fine in CE/FATCAT.

I've just been able to launch gama on my Ubuntu : it was the same issue, but in a lot more of "folders". Just deleted all the gaml folders (together with the xtend-gen), and it runs like a charm. 
I will try to check on this later, but to continue my app I had already changed the logic to use non-null values instead of nulls.  I had actually run into another strange situation between two computers where I saw Integer returned in one emulator, but Long from the other emulator.  (To ignore that, I changed my local variables to `Number`) 
I had sent the email as requested although I don't know if it was received
Not yet, other than it does seem to be specific to the makeup of the procedures in the failing script. Trying to recreate the problem with anonymous code. 
ok, good to know, feel free to close issue.
I think it makes sense to do so.  
I managed to start activity more than once in both cases, using freshly built project from SDK, you got to tap real fast though, maybe this is low priority.  android version 6.0.1, samsung note 4
Yes indeed, getUserObject in com.jme3.bullet.control.* classes could just return spatial.   It used to be set from setSpatial, but the new cloning doesn't call it anymore, i wonder if a similiar issue could affect other controls that relies on the old behaviour 🤔 
Hey there.  I am on RebornStorage-1.12.2-3.0.3.36. I dunno if it's related/something you can fix, but it also takes several seconds to load a single page of recipes from a crafter on the client-side.  I'll test that out when I get a moment. I already moved all of the patterns to a Crafter and it's gonna be tedious to move everything back, haha. Do Crafters and the multiblock accept piped items?
Well any youtube video which is 16:9 is scaled to 18:9 on my mobile phone. But if you really want a concrete example, try: https://youtu.be/1uhE7PWfrYU
Sadly I don't think I have a simple to reproduce test-case for you. You can have a look at the implementation in the linked PR above, but you may not be able to make much sense of it.  To reproduce simply, you'd need to rpc invoke a   function where: - the function continues to emit on its `Flux<O>` output after the `input` completes (or cancels, for that matter). It could for example disregard its input entirely and use `Flux.interval()` - have the `Flux<I>` input complete() AND cancel(), as is done for example by `FluxGroupBy` - this will freak out the gRPC machinery, which will cancel() the __output__ stream as well.
I've only tested with the default config options.  Stone axe appears to leave two strip behind but its a "phantom" item that goes away if you try to pick it up, same with stone sword. Stone shovel only needs 1 strip and works as intended. 
I can confirm that the bug only appears when there are external images that aren't loaded (In my test just now). If I load them through the button the bars are back as usual. 
Clear data did not work, but I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it from play store, and it worked now.  Is this app using the faster Enketo forms yet?  I thought it was implemented already, but I don't see the switch language option in the form. 
No. The only way was to replace the unit.

The fix works fine. The proxy is returned by the ProxySelector object.  However there is another problem (might be worth to open another issue): The SOCKS proxy is registered for the protocol scheme `socks`. The protocol scheme in the selector reflects the protocol of the proxied connection, not the connection to the proxy server. That means if I want to get a proxy for an HTTP connection, I have to request a http/https URI which can never return the SOCKS proxy, because the selector expects a socks:// URI. I suppose a SOCKS proxy should be returned regardless of the URI used, because it is applicable to all TCP and UDP based connections.  Maybe the solution is to set the SOCKS proxy using the `setFallbackSelector` function in the `ProtocolDispatchSelector`. This time I attached the [patch](https://github.com/MarkusBernhardt/proxy-vole/files/603466/socks-fallback_patch.txt) directly.  Details on the intended meaning of the Java Proxy Variables can be found on the following link. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html

was trying to pull honey from the side of a rustic apiary, seems like you were supposed to pull from the bottom. [sorta like mc furnaces] but in the process of trying to pull from slot1 from the side i sent the server into a crash loop
Both are being powered. It's for a piston door. In these screenshots, i'm underground. 
Yes! The hide function works fine. But manually it is very uncomfortable to go through all boards.txt file. Hide function with a small menue to check or uncheck which board should be hide or not.

@eivantsov Ah, great idea! How can I enable debug mode for Postgres?
The read pairs that are not merged are left as unmerged read pairs. For example in this file 13% consist of unmerged read pairs.  
Still happens... and quite reliably too. Plop one of those and an end portal down, hop back through, wait 30 seconds and return back.

@olegz I updated the sample to add a field bean but the application still fails to start up.   If you comment out the SCS dependencies in the sample and run the app, it will start up.  https://github.com/Walliee/implicit-function-binder-issue/blob/222baa4f9656197d5d41670ace147e377e4a5131/pom.xml#L24-L32  I think the issue is that `ContextFunctionCatalogAutoConfiguration` (during `FunctionCatalog` construction), tries to initialize all Function/Supplier/Consumer bean definitions it can possibly find and the `SimpleInstantiationStrategy` tries to do so using a no-args constructor.
I don't have any filters on my home screen (didn't know I could). I called the screen where I choose e.g. to search for caches or switch to the saved ones "home screen" - since I didn't find a better name for it and because of being the first screen welcoming me.  By the way: It helped to delete and reinstall the app. But I think this cannot be the answer since all saved caches - including all my notes for the now "invisible caches" - have been erased as well (last update/saving of data too long ago). I tried to save the last status - and I got the message all was OK - but in the end it turned out that nothing was saved but an earlier status was still there.

@Snow-Pyon     Try this. I haven't put "numbers" or any sort of list type here. I am still receiving this warning.
ok. This is strange. I try on my home computer (Ubuntu) and it works as expected. I used "fresh" pref and also the same pref than my other computer. It was the same database.  I will try again on my work computer (windows) tomorrow. 
How do I get such _latest dev release_? 
i'm waiting too ;-;
You could negotiate a custom license with K-Type. Alternatively, Kredit is a free OCR-style typeface that would be suitable, if not exactly what card embossers use: http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/typodermic/kredit 
Just checked and there is no shadow either.  I also tested with an empty card in a CardViewNative... I'm using the emulator btw. 
version is 2.1.4 I sent you in email the data. 
Neither auth.statusChange or auth.authResponseChanged are fired. 
@kcooney , Unrooted Tests still happen without Apache Storm and Elasticsearch. It happens with sample code like following.    I added my environment information. Project type : Maven project Eclipse : Mars.1 Release (4.5.1) Platform : Windows 10 
Well, for this test I'm only using requestb.in, so it has nothing to do with jenkins.  I just ensured that the proxy is set on the PRN, and it still made no difference.

OS windows 7, x64 The problem was repeated all the time, but only on one of the projects. I think it was the file that was to blame. I'm sorry I did not save it for tests.
On the first screenshot, the "n" value is correctly reported to 82. After Step Out (screenshot 2) the "n" value is bogus. "err" is not reported at all !!!  If you follow the second option, i.e. to Step Over at the "return" line instead of Step Out, the debugger stops again, but at line 31: sr, ok := r.r.(*strings.Reader) for unknown reason.  Sometimes, If I just hit twice "Resume Program" twice (for each stop at the "return" line) I get crash with the following error:  null java.lang.NullPointerException 	at gnu.trove.TObjectLongHashMap.put(TObjectLongHashMap.java:142) 	at com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.nodes.XValueNodeImpl$1.computed(XValueNodeImpl.java:145) 	at com.goide.dlv.DlvXValue$3.run(DlvXValue.java:164) 	at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.runReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:884) 	at com.goide.dlv.DlvXValue.a(DlvXValue.java:187) 	at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl$2.run(ApplicationImpl.java:309) 	at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511) 	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266) 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)  Last thing, that I've noticed (see my first screenshot), at line 31, is that the reported value "ok: false" is and never should be false. This line always succeed (which is confirmed by the fact that the message "panic("Unexpected Reader!")" is never displayed).
it solve the issue, but each time I run pod install issues start again. Thats the real issue. Why react is installed like a pods module.

Hi @diotto! Yes I have sent the Custom UI notification besides the other two and it seems to be okay.  In the main screen it shows the watch is connected (however after some time it disconnects, it is also an issue for me, but this no custom notification issue is present when it shown as connected). In the Stats I can see e.g the Gmail notifications twice. One of them has a record with GROUP comment, the other is with CONTINUE, but I can see only the standard notification on my watch.
@juwlee This sample is running fine on devtools website but I am running it in Android Studio and the error described above is thrown internally. 
Only on the Cauldron Server. Sorry for the late reply. Worldedit is a plugin i use. In single player i have no problems or issues at all cause i use forge. I don't know if you will be providing support for plugins, but i thought it was worth mentioning since a lot of people use cauldron. Also on the server i have found no issues with this mod. I'll do more testing with it if i can even removing all the other plugins to make sure exactly which one it is. 
I installed the plugin using the install new software:   https://github.com/WedjaaOpen/ElasticJasperSite/raw/master/

Sure, first off all it was a old dashboard from Graylog 3.1. I deleted multiple widgets and added new ones. I also changed the placements of the widgets on the dashboard. And then at the end just saved it with the save button. Then I went to the enterprise reports page and clicked on "Contents" button which resulted in the error message posted above. If you need anything else please let me know.

I still have the same issue:  
MS SQL Server 2014 and 2016 produce this error. Prepending the table promptly shows the correct results, but directly typing the field name will only display table names in another table specified out of this subquery, i.e. out of scope.
The bi-directional edge-based algorithms would not work properly with the behavior in QueryGraph due to different edge IDs for same edges when using different edge filters. Node-based algorithms do not have a problem with this behavior since they use IDs of nodes to store costs which are still the same. Edge-based algorithms would use the edge ID to store costs and therefore the IDs should be the same as long as it is functionally the same edge. In my pull request #158 there are tests for bi-directional Dijkstra and A\* which do not pass due to this behavior (I turned off the tests temporary, e.g. see `DijkstraBidirectionRefTest#testViaEdges_FromEqualsTo()`).

> One way to easily solve this could be to always put generated code in e.g. build/generated-sources.  I think, that is the best solution. Another one is not to execute xsd2java or wsdl2java by default. And execute it only when it called explicitly.  For example:

Hi @climbage . Sorry for the delayed response.  My java version is Oracle JDK 7.45. Centos 6.6 This behaviour of hanging only happens for certain value of geometry Point. My work around was to print the Point before calling geodesicDistanceOnWGS84 function. The value of Point that hangs geodesicDistanceOnWGS84 causes printing of the same to crash. I catch the exception and don't call geodesicDistanceOnWGS84 for those odd Point values.  What I have not been able to figure out is in which case I end up creating a Point that manifests this behaviour.

You didn't understand me correctly in the point 2. I was thinking about yokes and sidesticks in the cockpit of the aircraft, but I was not thinking about yokes for controlling the aircraft. 😊  As about #4 of my list, the best way to reailse this is to move separate engines' controls to the U-Panel, and when the user is using the keyboard to manage throttles, he manages all the engines' power in one time as usual.  **Also I would like to suggest point 5**: a feature for adding instruments with different sizes. For example, modern aircraft have large screens as instruments, so it will be great to have an abitity to add thicc screens to the cockpit 😏
Hm, one could hack it even more by only considering begin/end when found as whole words surrounded by whitespace equivalent.  But I think, it might be worth biting the bullet and use some simple parser (generated with antlr or something).

@szczepiq Hi, for one occurence I was able to implement a default constructor. For another occurence, it did not feel sensible to add a default constructor. I changed this and mocked all used method calls manually. For me it's ok now.  btw: Thank you very much for sharing and caring for mockito!

Sure, we could do that. There are a couple of outliers in `HttpHeaders`that have words with consecutive capital letters, `ETag` and `WWW-Authenticate` (see http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/constant-values.html#javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders.ACCEPT). Maybe we can just create a special case for those.  I'm not fond of special cases, but that would ensure that we normalize exactly once and use `HttpHeaders` constants everywhere else. 
Yes. So basically, when user tried to join the room in a freshly installed app, this crash occurs as soon as he joins the room after giving the camera permission. It does not occur after that
Of course (I removed non relevant fields):    In my documents `stores` is an array of objects. There are usually 50-200 nested documents per root document.  I didn't use the "nested" query in my previous message, because it doesn't change anything to the performance issue. But I still need to use "nested" in my case (I have other fields). 
@AndyScherzinger ~~The same account works on a different device.~~ It seems to happen for every new account. So it's not device specific as I initially thought. @nickvergessen There is nothing which would hint at an error in the nextcloud.log on the server. (except a few entries where I mistyped the password of the test account I was using) 
- The repetition of a bug (permit priorisation of a redundant detected bug) - _correspond to number of testcase where the same bug ID has been created on the corresponding tag execution._ **=> Yes, that what I had in mind. "TestCases Affected" would be a clearer title for user understanding**  =>I have in mind the fact that bugID are open to the testcaselevel. But it seemed to me that it was more precise to open a bug at the execution level because the  country/robot combinaison could impact the execution.  But in reality, this is maybe too specific to my organisation and some users do not use countries in Cerberus. So yes, link the TestCase associated should be the better solution.   => If  noKO/FA (**then no bug reported**) , the collapse could be close like screen attached.

Well, I made a test world on 1.10.2 with BM 50 and it worked as it should.  As soon as I ran the ritual, I no longer had strong legs.  I then logged back into my server with BM 48 and it too has been removed.  Looks like I needed to fully log out and not just leave the server to have everything reset. 
Thanks! We are running version 2.3.0. We have now turned on more verbose OpenTSDB logging and I will try to get some logs next time this happens. It happens only a couple of times per day out of millions of queries, so they can be hard to track down :)

I've tried with both 8.0 and 8.1. I have no idea if it used to work as it's the first time trying Syncany.  In the ownCloud log, I get an exception about missing auth headers, but that's probably a side effect of the Exception on the client side.  Regarding the DH parameters, I have been using those for years and I think I've been using the ownCloud client since ownCloud 6. I know Java is quite picky about what it can accept as DH parameters, but I guess I've never needed to connect any Java app to this server before.

I didn't save a log. Does the program keep a log of recent games saved somewhere?  I agree that the owner chooses. The problem wasn't related to ownership versus controller(ship?). I controlled and owned the only attacking creatures:  a Mutavault and some other small red creature (I think either Rakdos Cackler,  BTE, or Firefist Striker). My opponent casts AEtherspouts, I let it resolve, and the next choice I had was whether to put Mutavault on top or on the bottom of my library.

@a93h Thanks for the response! Sorry it's taken me a while to reply, but it's hard to really get answers for you. It's not often I actually play music on my phone, so it's hard to know what's changed between instances. However I can say that one time I played a full album which was successfully scrobbled, and then a minute or two later I played a song by a different artist and it didn't scrobble. Definitely no reboots or anything in-between.
It works worse because it does not allow ID's and they are needed for POSTERS! so the solution is worse, please can you make the ID's work for the trade posters? Thank you! it is very necessary and the only solution is the ID per theme of space, please I am not until the experimental version because the / give 276 etc. does not work. does not allow id, I need it to work in 2 ways for [TRADE] mainly thanks!
@mario I got some errors related to "Upload failed". Do not know the reason for now. Will try to check the log. Unfortunately, the log cannot be sent when upload is already in progress. It would be nice to be able to force an upload for the Log file. Another error, and this was upon swiping the top of the screen downward, was about some "SSL initialization failed" I think. Will try to conduct some more testing later. My phone gets a bit warm when Video and Wifi seem to work concurrently. Both Video or Pictures get stored/recorded on external SD card when using the camera app. NC user data are also stored on external SD card. 
@jsotuyod In regards to the first question, I have tried the CLI with both the ant cache file and with its own cache file. The CLI command seems to fail on the creation of the cache file resulting in the cache file containing no violations even though there are violations present in the code. The CLI command I was using was the following:   This is after fixing the error that occurred and it still says the cache was HIT. Looking at the code it should say  `Incremental Analysis cache MISS - file changed`.   I also attached my very basic sample project which can replicate the issue. I enabled the duplicate imports rule as my rule-set to easily see the issue.  Run the Ant PMD task once then remove the duplicate import and run the Ant PMD task again you should see the same output.

I think reported issue is my wrong usage, so Enunciate should do one of: 1. Throw exception in such a case and shut down WITH MESSAGE telling exactly what is wrong. 2. Provide general support for generated sourceSets so dev do not experiment to find working combo.    As you might guess I needed to include generated sources for mappers dto, query beans, as they reside in a different folder. I think there should be support for it natively. Thank you for a wonderful tool!
i used 8 tbu fuel to show this bug. i split them, first 4 i put inside just vanish, no depleted fuel and no energy, then i used the other 4 and they process just fine. now i can pipe tbu into the reactor but if i try a different kind of fuel it will disappear unless i put one manually and let it disappear before piping in the rest. best way to describe it is that the first fuel i put into the reactor sets the type and then i can pipe that type into the reactor. i play on modern skyblock 3 latest version - 3.4.2 nc version is 2.11a ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3329748/45632911-281b9080-baa7-11e8-978d-00478461798d.PNG) ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3329748/45632912-28b42700-baa7-11e8-90a6-365de472bfbd.PNG) ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3329748/45632913-28b42700-baa7-11e8-9c82-db30d8028764.PNG) 
you can use the GpsStatus.Listener with the events GpsStatus.GPS_EVENT_STARTED and GpsStatus.GPS_EVENT_STOPPED .   see http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/GpsStatus.Listener.html for details  I havent tried this myself 
All I can say that it's 100% reproducible on my Android. And it's "introduced" with 1.9.1. I'm using connectBot for years now, never seen before.  As I've never developed anything for/on Android, do you have any ideas how we could "sure-fire" this? Any chance to trace/debug/log GUI activity?
Thanks @albertzaharovits for the comprehensive reply. I'll take the changes for the spin and report back; once thing to note from the start, there are differences in the rest vs java/transport API. With `GetAlias` one can restrict the filtering only to aliases vs indices (`GetAlias.setAliases() vs .setIndices()) while with `GetIndex` one can set specific `IndexOptions` - which SQL uses namely for `GetIndex` to not expand to aliases but rather only indices.  Again, I'll pick the updates and report back.
Hi, looks like it was a java related issue. installed JRE and set Java_home to that and everything worked ! you might want to add that to the installation directions, at least for windows systems.  p.s. could you have a look at this ?
yes, I've made some basic queries and I didn't notice anything odd. It also works with any class extending E. 
@RobbWatershed I using latest version.
I can't follow your analysis.   [ExportXmlLog in lines L218-L250](https://github.com/goobi/goobi-production/blob/master/Goobi/src/org/goobi/production/export/ExportXmlLog.java#L218-L250) are using bean based objects, so object `s` is from `de.sub.goobi.beans.Schritte` and has method `getBearbeitungsbenutzer()`. Method `getBearbeitungsbenutzer()` is returning a class object `Benutzer` from `de.sub.goobi.beans.Benutzer` which have a method called `getNachVorname()`.  Why now calling `s.getBearbeitungsbenutzer().getNachVorname()` is causing an error, is a good question.  I set a debugging breakpoint in MySQL Helper method `updateStep()` but this method is never called while printing a docket for a batch nor a message got logged. 
Now it's work.  Thanks. 
No, the 'Ask me' option does not even appear in the menu when I right click. But the surprising part is that, when run, the program has no errors and opens an instance of eclipse successfully. 
Hi Trask,  I am trying to debug the Agent module and see how it is connecting to the cluster line by line.  I got to find that we need to debug java agents using java -javaagent:jarpath. I tried that but getting errors like below. If it is not the right way to debug agent module, kindly let me know the way so that I can simulate on my local environment.

After replacing the auth2-client with compile group: 'org.springframework', name: 'spring-core', version: '5.2.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT' and adding https://repo.spring.io/snapshot, tests run all right  Which puzzles me a bit. You did a change in spring-security (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/commit/7cbd1665a6ba5df01ab676db7d945b6599c2000a) but asked me to update the core to the latest snapshot? How come?
yes I tried, seems to be not working at all
Yes, I read the whole readme at some point.  If you want details:    My default template restricts everything [X] [?].  Reproduce with "Simple Explorer":    - Install it, whitelist IPackage:getPackageInfo, deny everything else. It will be able to access the file system.  Reproduce with "QPython":    - I installed QPython. - I manually enabled the inet restriction because Xprivacy doesn't create a prompt for that (another bug btw?) -When it asked for IPackage:getPackageInfo, I whitelisted that. -I denied every other permission. -I went into the Editor of QPython -I clicked the icon to save the script  I was able to save my script wherever I want and I was also able to delete any files... and everything happened within QPython.    Note: QPython does complain there is no SD Card, but you can ignore that message and access it anyway.   https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.dnielfe.manager https://github.com/qpython-android/qpython
It might be my client. which makes no sense since I can spawn giants and my client won't crash and my computer is quite strong. I will reinstall the jar. 
Hello, @monperrus   Such a call helped to solve my problem:  `launcher.getEnvironment().setComplianceLevel(9); // Java 9`  Tell me, please, if it's not the right way. 
@fennifith I meant the clock in the left upper corner of the notifications panel. Cause the usual clock apps(deskclock, omni clock...) use it as a shortcut to the app, if you could implement it, that would be great. Thanks. ![](https://i.imgur.com/7sxj1WC.png)
> This could be because elasticsearch disables explicit GCs. What happens if you keep calling this API, does Elasticsearch run out of memory?  Yes, if I execute the query one more time, Elasticsearch hangs forever. Most of the time when there's activity on the node, Elasticsearch terminates abruptly (OutOfMemory). 
I'm actually waiting for Sponge to fix issues on their end before I am going to do more testing. As far as I know though there was no errors or anything out of the ordinary in the log files when I tested this originally.  EDIT: I tested with Forge 1902 and the latest Plethora compiled from source at the time, SpongeForge, and GriefPrevention.  On that note, there's an issue with SpongeForge's fakeplayer UUID exclusion system which you can see here: https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge/issues/804 as well as this issue: https://github.com/MinecraftPortCentral/GriefPrevention/issues/123 both of which are not issues with Plethora directly, but maybe you will find those issues useful. 
No, this can be fixed in molgenis.R.ftl There are some fixme comments and an example on how to fix. We just need to loop through the attribute meta data and get every type to create a vector. This can then be added to the csv read method.  I just didnt get around to it because of time so I fixed it in the R script calling the API

@maggiolo00 Thanks! No fix on 2.1.x is needed. I'll just go with `convert` option
I don't believe it is limited to just the euphoria rom, but I haven't tested it on any other one. I'll try cyanogenmod when I have time  
I reproduce on http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com/ 
Thanks @cstancu. I'm using GraalVM CE 19.0.2 
Actually, this is a duplicate of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry/issues/174 The #174 is fixed, but the fix is not released yet.
Yes, I do. Also, it doesn't seem to matter whether I have OptiFine on it or not. Extending from OptiFine or Vanilla 1.11.2, neither work. I also tried renaming the folder, json and the id inside the json of the version, but it still isn't showing up and I have no idea why.
Hi @jgrandja I tried to submit a PR. Hope the test I add is enough  FYI : it does fix my issue on my project
I will create a test application soon. 
@gigabit101 Sorry about delay, Mystogrigen gave good information on the version but I think I gave enough to reproduce in whatever version you wanted to try.
Just grabbed this from the logs when executing a search:   
Here it is    But it does not works when I register a basic lambda with the builder method `withFallback`~
@lixinchengdu In your example, yes, but you can't do it vice versa
https://pastebin.com/AwswcAUL 
I just got the latest code from your master branch.  I checked, and it does have the changes for the commit you mention.  But it still exhibits the same behavior.  Seems like one way to fix it would be to have a try catch around the call to client = clientPools.borrowClient() in skipToNextHost(). Then after catching the exception it could try the next host in the list.

Nope. It seems to be related to magnet/bauble. I use Thaumcraft which relies on bauble too if I remember correctly. I don't know if that's the cause. 
ok I have updated to the final version of mapstruct thanks. But the compiler Warning still persists. I have taken the lombok mapstruct example from github to reproduce the compiler error (https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct-examples/tree/master/mapstruct-lombok) ok this is the mapper Inteface:  With the plugin installed the ConverterDecorator class has a red underline saying "@Mapper or @MapperConfig annotation is missing"  I use the latest IntelliJ 2018.3.4
I don't see the value of it being a mandatory configuration value. A default value would be enough I think. I'll have a quick look to add a default value.

Sorry, I checked with `Greenwich.SR2` and the problem still happens.
I replaced the transfer node with an Ender IO item conduit and there was no problem. So it does seem to be somehow related to the transfer node. 
stupidly I deleted habridge... and now after reinstalling i don't have any config webpage to open ....
Probably I lost the time to get the log...the first log item that I had :  eclipse.buildId=unknown java.version=11.0.3 java.vendor=Oracle Corporation BootLoader constants: OS=win32, ARCH=x86_64, WS=win32, NL=en Command-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86_64  org.jkiss.dbeaver.model Error Mon Jul 22 10:41:18 BRT 2019 Error initializing Windows registry 
I don't know.  I don't suppose I have a choice. :)
Yes, please wait until I get home. I think it will be in 2 hours.
Sorry about that, i just updated it to show correctly.
I almost never logout, this is definitely an unlikely corner case. I created this issue just to document it, I personally don't need a fix.
Crafting the recipe by hand was fine. Of course that I made a lot of components by auto-crafting. Cannot pinpoint which one of them was causing the crash. I reverted back to a backup and crafted the coils by hand.   I thought that it might help to post such a crash here. 
@airsquared Hey, sorry for the late reply but it's working now

It's hard to reproduce because it happens rarely.   Close on the report should have been called only once, else there is some bug with NUnit. Also, EndTest() should have been called on all tests before Close(). 
I put this line in PushController.js file    is that right to do @evollu ?
Hi @bsideup   yes we use 1.8.0.

This is definitely not stale. It just hasn't been looked at by anyone.
The above code change fixed the issue for me. I have to first ask to for approval before I get contribute a fix, same as for the other issue. Once I have that I can create a fork and fix it unless you don't just want a diff. 
The full example is the same as in the original issue (#539) but I will add the link here as well:   https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/files/483635/inline_partials_leak2.zip  If you will look at my last comment in issue #539 I also explained why I think that the test that is supposed to cover it passed.
Well I don't have any of those mods. And the emc is correct on some most worlds. I have Ex Nihilo Ex Aquilo botania, thaumcraft and add ons, blood magic. The only difference in worlds is the one is a botania garden of glass world which changes recipes but other GoG worlds are fine. Is there a way to clear cache or something?  
It can wait. Points don't belong to specific packages, do they? I'm thinking for the one thing I was trying to do I could have a point category that different people can all have conditions in their own package check. 
> @jonasPoehler are you using our latest internal ebean version (11.38.2-FOC5)  I didn't test with -FOC-5 yet, but will do so as soon as I got time for it. A soon as I can verify the problem fixed, I could create a test and PR.

@imurchie Please advice. @TikhomirovSergey Appium logs shows 501. Will post the exact exception ASAP. 
Is there something fundamentally different about `deactivate` vs `shutdown`? We don't currently consider shutdown interfaces as not using the things the refer to.

Thanks. It works now. I think the lib treated the file as corrupt because there is an empty line at the end of the file unless I deleted it manually by a text editor.
@leonard84 thanks for the explanation. That's what I thought as well. And I strongly agree with this should be mentioned somewhere in the documentation. Also the exception here should be clearer in reflecting what the real problem is. Right now saying  is very misleading
http://pastebin.com/7Nc5DNMK  Seems to be a problem with Sponge + RTG even after we deactivated that RTG generates these structures. 
Both the original and duplicated shears go into players inventory Both will have same durability, - so new shears at 238 durability when placed in crafting grid with sapling - when removing crafted dead bush from crafting output using mouse, 2 shears will appear in players inventory with 237 durability as soon as dead bush is removed from output slot.  I have not automated my refined storage yet so not sure if it also happens when auto removed from crafting output.

Hi. Thanks for your reply. I've created the logfile below following the readme. [logcatOutput.txt](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/files/2776511/logcatOutput.txt)  This part seems interesting: `01-20 12:19:30.720 17803 17803 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main 01-20 12:19:30.720 17803 17803 E AndroidRuntime: Process: com.nextcloud.client, PID: 17803 01-20 12:19:30.720 17803 17803 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to create application com.owncloud.android.MainApp: android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: duplicate column name: redirect (Sqlite code 1): , while compiling: ALTER TABLE external_links ADD COLUMN redirect INTEGER, (OS error - 2:No such file or directory)`

The drop down menu, and the filter input are not styled with bootstrap. Neither are the previous, 1, 2, .... 5, next buttons.  If you compare my screenshot to the datatable shown on the Bootsfaces website demo, you can clearly see that mine is missing all of the Bootstrap styling for some reason.  I understand that the new datatable is unfinished, but I wanted to make sure that it wasn't something I was overlooking.  Everything else on Bootsfaces works wonderfully, and I can tough it out; the functionality of the page drop down and the filter is freaking sweet so I'll gladly wait for the fix on the actual styling.

OK, thank!  BTW - this happened to me on a Windows pc as well in the past (same project).
Sure, I appended the logcat and I also made a video of the app 'crashing'. Hope this helps.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/vqiizsi7hwda00j/19-07-03-21-54-54.mp4?dl=0 [nextcloud_logcat.txt](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/files/3356680/nextcloud_logcat.txt)

Yes confirmed can run if i exclude xerces.  So far still runs fine but i don't know if i will use that xerces or not.  Can you please enlighten me what the usage of xerces? and why it conflict with liquigraph?  Can this issue solved without  i need to exclude the xerces?  Thank you
I'm using 0.50.6, without any proxy.

Oops, yes, @grzesiek2010, I meant database migrations. So those are run by getWritableDatabase/getReadableDatabase, right? Are there cases where those aren’t run or might fail?
hi,  i cant upgrade on that particular machine because we are a lot to work on it at the same time. I'll try on a fresh local install and keep you inform.
I've rebased my local repo on the latest from this github repo and I'm still getting that error. I've also tried deleting every board I have in deck, so it's a completely blank account. I'm still getting this error. So, corrently, I get this error now every time, and I get it even when there is nothing for the app to load (I have no decks). Anything I could be looking at here to help fix this?
My MainVertical deploys the ServiceVertical. The future is fine, if the ServiceVertical completes the future, but on a future.fail(cause), the AR in the MainVertical is not processed.   MainVertical#start:   If I do exchange startFuture.fail(ar.cause) with startFuture.complete() the result is propagated to the MainVertical, but not on a failed future.
Strange! Today, I neither can reproduce the phenomenon. Sry. 
Yes it is same with the 0.3.2 version. I found the solution. Need to change        public boolean canScrollHorizontally() {         return getChildCount() !=0;     } to      public boolean canScrollHorizontally() {         return getChildCount() >1;     }  in TailLayoutManager class
There is still an error on startup: https://hastebin.com/gajujuzazo.pl If I change it to cascade mode it works well though

@Tora-B Apologies, first time using github for this purpose. The issue is that after the initial death loop, the server was attempting to synchronize hundreds of times a second with that player, even after a full reboot, and managing to get the player out of the Dimension. This persisted from the time the player logged in after a server reboot, until a crash or hard Kill command. The server, as a result, was hitting upwards of 200% CPU usage, making it unplayable for all other players.   @Electroblob77 I'm afraid the log was nothing but thousands upon thousands of lines of "[Server] Server thread/INFO [ebwizardry]: Synchronising spell emitters for Playername" with no variation. I honestly wish I had more information for you.   A solution was found, however much less than ideal, in deleting the player's playerdata from the server.

I've tested it with another dataset with ~270k entries that worked fine as well.

Thanks for coming back...  **We are using the CDH 1.4.0 Kafka package (which is based on 0.8) installed from a docker file using:** `RUN sudo yum clean all && sudo yum -y install kafka && sudo yum -y install kaka-server`  **To confirm, the file at /usr/lib/kafka/cloudera/cdh_version.properties contains:** `version=0.8.2.0-kafka1.4.0`  **The only changes were to:** 1. Copy the necessary jars to the /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/jars 2. Edit config file for kafka/zookeeper hosts to localhost 3. Add three dependencies to compute class path (scala-library 2.10.6 and optionally adding kafka_2.10/kafka-clients)  **Running compute class path gives:**   
@cpfeiffer Thx for the quick reply!  It's a guess that debug logging doesnt't work because of the same reason, but since it's trying to write to the same location it seems logical that it's the cause. The directory exists, owned by `root:sd_card` with permissions 775.  Here's a quick logcat when pressing `Export DB`:   
Yup, works fine now ;) 
yes. I have removed every block in the 3x3 area, and as soon as the top layer of dirt is removed, the layer under it gets tilled.

Yes I just tested it with commit `10ff2945f7` . It happens with any AppBuilder application (for example the Blank template). The debugging session starts and it instantly ends. Internally we get exception that the socket was closed on the other end. 
So the idea is to replace the else by:   but I not sure what to put in the last else. Is the log a good idea?
Which snapshot can I use from Maven to test this?  Once you let me know I'll run our integration tests again to see if everything is working as expected with your proposed fix 
This place is recommended to be changed to the 3.0.0.M1 version.  
I tried it on top of aff46bc2f0e59cb9b59f6db982ddd490cf1d2b3c and it still fails. Also, I think my proposed test from above is flaky in some way... 
Please find attached sample test.sh in the test.zip.  I put 2 symlinks.  One is /src/test-branch/src and another is /src/test-branch/mtx/src.  When I index and deploy, both are listed in the directory list in the browser but I can not see the file contents.  It says 'Failed to get xref file'.  Under /data/xref, there is no entries for these 2 directories.  [test.zip](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/files/2700028/test.zip) 
Hi, I'm not able to test it with NB10 or 11. I use NB9/JDK11 at work as part of my employer's tool suite and do not have the authority to change/upgrade versions. The reason we use NB9 is because of the lack of sufficient JavaEE support in NB10+.  Even if I was able to successfully test the plugin on NB10 or 11 it wouldn't solve my particular use-case.
So, the end result is that I had to copy the entire assets dir to the parent directory of the JAR, and then reference it through LIBGDX normally. Since gradle exports everything inside of the `assets` directory to the classpath of the JAR, I had to put everything inside of a subdirectory called `resources`.   When launching the JAR, the assets directory will be extracted to the **working directory**. This means that if your working directory parameter in IntelliJ is blank, it will attempt to copy the files to the root of the project _I think_. Below is an example of a working JAR configuration. ![screenshot from 2015-10-21 20 51 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7645647/10646802/87a249b6-7835-11e5-8b97-8afcc289c35d.png) 
Now I can no longer reproduce the problem.  This morning I tried to insert the profile picture and it works.  Now I try to reproduce the problem.  What I know is that last night I didn't open the screen to crop the image.  🤔
I have the same behavior (the conversion is done but the program hangs). I also tried to remove my ~/.umlet folder.  is there some logs/backtrace I can provide? 
@Fr4gorSoftware: Installed branch **fix-shared-qrcode** and scanning via Share intent is still not working.  This is the version I tested on   The toast now appears (as opposed to before): `File not found`.  Tested on several different images containing qr codes and failed on all. The image is a regular jpg image that can be successfully scanned by other scanners, including by secscanqr when using the camera, but sharing from the gallery app via intent is not working.  sample image: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48893368/73138500-883f2100-4063-11ea-8917-685290efef3f.jpg 
2.2.1 (yeah I know …) 
This is what I'm using:  https://gist.github.com/Febilian/6aa0cb30b68d8f0f24949b5cafc99838  I'm using In Control to manage where the mobs spawn, which is why all of those options are at 0.  Now that it's been said, I wonder if putting the tier 3 mobs at 0 is what caused it... even though they are supposed to spawn indirectly anyways, I thought?
You have to look very close to see it on the pictures.. Maybe this will be easier to see: ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/56C0P8q.png) ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Kfq44St.png)  Maybe try download and zoom with a photo editor? 
7.1.2
Hi Vlad,  Interesting. I just did several tests with a remote machine node which does not have any source and using the OTP debugger I can attach, step, break, etc. However, I noticed that it doesn't work unless I have loaded the module into the VM on the remote node _before_ starting the debugger and doing Module->Interpret...  A little background: my application is that I am developing small embedded computers which run erlang and which have very constrained memory. I am very impressed with ErlIDE and it looks like an ideal way to develop application code for these remote devices -- hence my series of experiments with trying to get debugging working.  Thanks, Devin 
Correct. An OTP can be reused several times because Yubikey table does not get updated despite the update method in CauthRealm returns "1" which means success. But actual commit is not done. This line:  https://github.com/biobankcloud/CauthRealm/blob/master/src/main/java/se/kth/bbc/crealm/CustomAuthRealm.java#L462   So in summary, when an OTP is used once, it should not be possible to reuse it again. 
It is set to true, but if you @ alone it take a random player, should i disable that ?
Yeah @clintongormley, I'm going to revamp the exception message a bit to include the related issue information so that the test will pass and the errors will be more informative. Thanks all :) 
@damianszczepanik; Thank you for the fix!
Specifically:  apicurio/apicurio-studio-ws:0.2.45.Final apicurio/apicurio-studio-api:0.2.45.Final  The UI image works though.  I am running these in AWS ECS and was a fresh AWS RDS postgres database.  If I downgrade to  apicurio/apicurio-studio-ws:0.2.44.Final & apicurio/apicurio-studio-ws:0.2.44.Final everything worked ok.  I could try upgrading to 0.2.45 now that the database is populated? 
It's the emulator that comes with Android Studio. I start the application in landscape mode. The slider is situated outside the bounds of the dialog box. I mean the activity is screenOrientation:sensorLandscape. So no there's no rotation.  
Yes. It's work! Thanks   
I guess you're lucky ;-) Since Vertx-core is an Eclipse project, we do not need a CQ in order to use it. The question is more: do we want to rely on a beta version. What's your take on this?
Hi @yaohaizh,  Please refer to [this document](https://docs.gauge.org/latest/installation.html#installation) for `Gauge` installation. In order to setup [Gauge java](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-java) with [Gauge VsCode extension ](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-vscode)we will have to build package from there respective branch `vscode_java_debug_support` as they are not released yet.  How about, if I build those packages and give them to you. Otherwise, I can explain how to build them locally.
Where a query has a colon in it, Solr is detecting it as a field and returning an error. The ratings file entry would look like this:     and the error looks like this:  `[ERROR] Caught Solr exception :: Error from server at http://solr-location:8983/solr: undefined field Wonderings`  In our case searches with colons are most likely because that's a document title in our data. It's not clear to me that we should necessarily remove punctuation altogether, as we may at some point have to deal with citations, which can have a wide range of punctuation in them.  While we can do some work to escape punctuation in our rated queries, I was wondering if it would be appropriate to do this escaping in RRE instead, perhaps controlled by a command-line flag or a line in the pom file.
> the same logic as getOrDefault when figuring out if a resource is set.  This is what I mean. `get` -> `true`, `Default` -> `false`.  If an entity has a resource set explicitly it should return true for that resource and entity.    `RESOURCE.retriever().isSetFor(card) -> true` `ANOTHER_RESOURCE.retriever().isSetFor(card) -> false` 
Crashing on 4.7.1 release
@LordFokas I have used NanoHttpd to build a web server in android.Then use browser to open the address that supply some html.The serve method will be called several times when the html to be loaded.And in the method I use getMimeTypeForFile() method to get mimetype. I will get wrong mimetype first time the html loaded most. When i refresh it,it works. I think it's not finished loading mimetypes for the first time, second time get into again.

Possibly, and furthermore, I've also confirmed that animation smoothing also breaks on Wyrms. Makes them jittery, like above.
Opened ticket #160129 for this issue.
@hotstepper13 As for the last question: In my experience, as long as the servers have found each other initially, additions and removals works seamlessly. So the answer is "yes". And the one that went down will be removed.

i see the message    
@jvrao sleep() helps indeed. test passes under the debugger (which adds delays). I did not look at this much closer after finding a repro & workaround/unblocking myself.
thank you for your interest. It's appearing but pressing anything and it disappears, so far I only managed to press the "report issue" button. I will try to make a screenshot if it's possible.
@marcphilipp ... I'm working on #343 at the moment (could you review what I've proposed) and had also started on #144.  Since #343 is still slated for the M4 release I'd like to finish that work before I commit to any further fixes.  After that I'd be happy to pick off some of the up-for-grabs (I may need to add the  methods in #656 to finish #343 though).
This fixes my issue, looks like some anvil combos were indeed left out. It should probably be PR'd.

Thank you for the quick reply!   I’ve inherited the use of a persistent database from when `Simple Monitor Exporter` was used. We want Simple Monitor to retain state when restarted (our processes can take quite long, hours or even days) and we have preference for postgresql when it comes to relational databases.
This occurs on my 4.4.2 VZW Galaxy S4, Moto G running 4.4.4, and my Nexus 7 running 5.0.2 
Thank you for the quick fix. As this only happened once so far I think this is hard to reproduce. But I will update to the latest release.
Yes, you are right. Some days ago I installed original 2.0.0 Google mi fit (automatically updated). And now Hart rate sensor don't work. As you can see,  every app says,  that I have hr version 0.0.0.0.  I tried to downgrade, install the same software. I have only one error message "problem with transfer  Metadata"   I think problem with sending software (or getting it by mi1s).   Hope you understand my mind)  About logs - I've already attached it)   I found that this bag is very old, and some people put MI band in refrigerator for some hours. I've tried it, but it's doesn't work :(

@jansupol Thanks for pointing us to the corresponding TCK test. I created the original Jersey issue before the TCK was transferred. I'll see if I find any difference.
I'll look at what it would take to do this, and hopefully will have a pull request for you shortly.
Will look into that. Strange thing is it's completely intermittent. And Syncany will run for several hours, then suddenly drop everything without apparent reason, and certainly without any ports or firewalls reconfigured.  Yesterday upgraded to snapshot 2015-06-24, which seems to have helped. Still the occasional miss on boot, but now I can just close and restart the gui, and everything's fine (prviously required reboot).  Everythin else is roses. Beautiful software. 
I found a solution for UNIX systems: set the ENV_VAR:  LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 The question is how do we integrate it into the maven project. 
@modwizcode Yes. Similar to what I would consider damage in the sense of a Minecart. Player punches which could possibly cause destruction of the object (Except with armor stands, destruction is guarenteed). 
No.  They both find the same errors.  The problem is with the ability to EXCLUDE those errors.
It crashes more without optifine unfortunately. That's why I started this thread. Messing with some optifine settings has stabilised it slightly but it still crashes.

Ahh, hmm - you are correct, those tests are in fact marked local. Whoops! This can probably be closed non-actionable then.  Though as an interesting side note, nothing that _isn't_ local ends up in java.log, which I think is what mislead me. Are other execution strategies supposed to generate log lines as well?
I updated the app and it works perfectly now. Thank you so much!

I have never used discord, but I can look into it.
Works. Thanks a lot :).
Sorry for late. I use this library to play video https://github.com/Bilibili/ijkplayer. So where can i find your sample app? I'd like to try it myself. May be something's wrong with my project, I'm going to review my code now. 
Dear Phillippe,  Sorry for the late answer, but I have some days out and only now I saw your  question.    I couldn’t reproduce the situation because I didn’t understand why it  happened (it dosn’t give any error message), but I saw the answer of Thomas.    Anyway I send you information about your system environment like  Windows/Java version, but this situation happened before, with other Java  version and even with other machine.    Thank you for your attention.

Yes I had about 30-40 old merge requests that have already been closed, so it went ahead and parsed 20-30 of them and correctly added the comments but the build failed (not sure 'cuz the branches didn't exit anymore) And then it seemed to have run into some exception and won't parse the rest of the merge requests or any new ones which have the branches available, no comments, no build. just seems to be stuck. Restarting jenkins does not help either.  I'm using Gitlab 5.1.0 e36372e 
The app that remembers the folder is KeepPassDroid as my password db is in there. The two files can be downloaded to the device only by choosing to keep the entire folder offline.

This should be verifiable out-of-the-box with any JDK distribution and default cacert file. Why do I need to import auth0.com cert file  in OL own keystore file???   Also, if the **jwksUri** signing key fetch fails, should I not see something in the logs for that ? Currently I see nothing 
Thanks for the reply.  I wasn't aware of that 1/256 in concat, and it makes sense that it was removed.   But something's still not right on my end.  The part where I was saying that transform is expecting non-normalized data is in HistoryProcessor.transform(INDArray raw):  This was working prior to normalization - if I do an `imwrite` of cvmat at this point with normalized data, I get a black image. If I don't normalize the observed pixels, it get the full color image I'd expect.  From what I've read online, opencv's CV_32F is expecting 0.0-1.0, so I would have expected the opposite results but that appears not to be the case because "record" is now denormalizing the data before writing it to the mpeg.  Why shouldn't transform also be denormalizing the data when converting to CV_8UC like in record?   
I replaced the getBaseContext() with this and worked great! Thanks alot for the reply. 
It seem to work. Regarding your PR - isn't it simpler to move `cipherIn.flip();` outside of the `if`? Like this:  ? And re the test - my test involves a remote broker, I am not sure it is reproducible with localhost because timing is completely different in that case. Also, my message is not large as yours - a JSON body of 4224 bytes is being sent + some headers (dunno, probably less than 256 bytes). Maybe for a better coverage it makes sense to run test multiple times with different message sizes. Cheers

No...that does not match my case.  Maybe I was a little unclear: Network==Internet, so disable all internet connection leads to the problem.  Follow the steps above and tell me if you can reproduce this.  By the way: The non-available location should be avoided if you switch on coarse-location on your device... 
@N-Olifer here's a sample:    The solution is to `detachFromPager()` when the `ScrollingPagerIndicator` is detached from window.
How can I activate the debug logging of HTTP request in Vertx ? in the meantime I have added the header "Accept:application/json" to the facebook provider config to force the Fetch method of your OAuth2API class to use this header and then it is working.  The facebook API responds with content type application/json instead of text/javascript.
I didn't realize they were ordered now. Agreed! 
sorry for the misuderstanding @snicoll. Spring Cloud Contract needs a configuration to switch to JUnit 5 but I think that since spring boot 2.2.x use JUnit 5 by default we can consider adding this configuration properly    WDYT?

> @inqistor regarding your dropships, it looks like they somehow got mixed up with their parts. I ran a GM Restore Unit on each and their doors and bays now survive reloads. Did you attempt any refits on those units?  Nope. Both were spoils from Ground Battle, although I restored 1 point of SI on Union, because it got destroyed during combat. Leopard just had some damaged armor, and after loading next day, all bays were destroyed somehow. Although I think I added them manually in MegaMek, not from RAT. Maybe they are corrupted in that database? Both were deployed in Shut Down State, as AI is unable to Restart them. Maybe that flag caused error? I have now two more Drop Ships, both salvages, and both seems to also have all Bays destroyed. Leopard CV was fully operational, and destroyed during Space Battle, so it doesn't seems to be influenced by Shut Down status, or Ground Map.

Yes, and I see an open/close pair being called by the transaction manager.  But there's extra opens being called from the methods in org.springframework.data.orient.commons.core.AbstractOrientOperations that are never closed, so the OPartitionedDatabasePool acquiredCount never goes back to 0.  For example:  @override public <RET extends List> RET query(OQuery query, Object... args) { return dbf.db().query(query, args); }
Thanks for the speedy response. We are using Oracle JDK v1.7.0_80 with Seam 2.2.2.Final. I can't see anything strange in the JBoss config so I'll try and reproduce in a Vagrant box with a fresh copy and one of the Seam examples. I'll let you know how I get on.

sometimes I need insert array with null values because length of an array is important for me and I want to get back an array of the same length as the insert  when I insert record [#-1:-1,#5:0] that DB returns [null,#5:0]. it is OK for me why I cannot insert record [null,#5:0] at once

Heya @jmmv. I don't know a lot about the Docker internals but will tell you whatever I can.  When using the `-v $(pwd -W):/src` flag on docker, I am saying "I want the contents of the current directory ( given by `$(pwd -W`) to be mounted under docker at `/src`".  I was calling this volume because it uses the `-v` flag, but it looks like the correct name is "bind mount": https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/  The sources are definitely on windows (the host) in this case, in the current directory. I just checked and it is indeed a NTFS drive.  The sources are being exposed inside the running docker container. As far as I know they aren't copied anywhere. Changes that I do in the host are reflected in the container, and vice versa. I don't know the details of how Docker accomplishes this.  I think there is a bug in Bazel's `--watchfs` because: - the files do change inside the container,  - file changes are not recognized with `--watchfs` - file changes are recognized with without `--watchfs`

I think I figured out the issue. Last night I moved the analyzer with the book still in its slot. Breaking the analyzer with the book in place doesn't drop the book. Apparently the book contains the research (as opposed to Thaumcraft where research is stored in player data), effectively resetting the discovered seed mutations. When I did this I went into creative mode to get a new book, perhaps that is the issue.   The "missing info" I think, is then just the info being reset, it's likely I didn't get any new mutations after that happened. I thought it might be related to mod conflicts from mods I added to my installation this morning.   When I just checked on mutations I ended up breaking the analyzer again and the same thing happened. I cheated in another book. By that time I had successfully mutated sugar cane seeds and they appeared.   In short: mutations don't disappear from books, breaking the analyzer loses book and resets research. 
i added a caldav sync adapter account connected to a radicale caldav server running on a vps of mine. i get a message saying that it was successfully added, and then i go to the calendars view, and see that no calendars are found yet. but then in a few seconds of navigating around menus, i see one calendar show up in the list. then maybe 30 seconds later (or even much later), i see the other calendar for that account show up in the available calendars list.  one of the times i tried this, i saw three calendar events show up. each event was for a different month. another time, no events showed up. after being first added, the account detail in the system preferences shows that it is syncing for a long time.  what i expected was for both calendars to appear when the first calendar appears, or within a few seconds. i also expected all of my events to show up, since i have more than 3 events on my calendars.  as for the original bug report, eventually all calendars showed up. also, i don't think that i actually merged in the ssl patch anyhow ( #83 ). i am using a cyanogenmod 10.2 nightly on the i9100 (galaxy s2) and am mostly pleased with its stability.  thanks! :-)

Hi, sorry for delayed response, I've tested it, the pedestal of rending works fine on everything but Omothol creatures, so I guess It's the same issue. Hope this will help.
My driver is set to postgresql-9.4.1211.jre7.jar (default). Do I need another one? How can I change it? In Postgres you can use any marker for function definition ($$ is used in examples, but you can use any other string). The problem is when you open function definition from DBeaver (F4 -> Source) the marker is $function$, from pgAdmin it is $BODY$. So if you try to execute this sql you receive an error. Also this error is given in some other correct scripts, this one is just an obvious example. 
Are you still experiencing this problem @adchilds or is your feedback based on something else?  Stacktrace from #1137 includes this line:    The issue was reported against `2.0.4.RELEASE` which handles the rename of `expiredKey` on line 815:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/2.0.4.RELEASE/spring-session-data-redis/src/main/java/org/springframework/session/data/redis/RedisOperationsSessionRepository.java#L815-L816  I believe you're considering the current state of `RedisOperationsSessionRepository` and not the one from the release against which #1137 was raised.

Yes, it appears to be the same problem! I get the same error message in DBeaver.

@eivantsov I'm running Docker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40.  Part of the issue is that this machine is attached to a corporate network, and IT has linked /home to be part of an LDAP configuration. Based off of ongoing discussions, it's possible we will not be given permissions to /home.   I had figured that the reason Docker was throwing that error was because it's trying to use the on-disk `/home/user/eclipse-che` as a volume, which I was trying to configure to be elsewhere, perhaps `/usr/local/home/user/eclipse-che`. 
Most probably yes: Live map -> Open cache from popup -> Menu Navigate/Compass  
@tobiasKaminsky sorry. no, I cannot do this in the next days.
Now it's working fine. Thanks for fixing it.  Still, when building the client, the following trace appeared:  > [INFO] --- frontend-maven-plugin:1.3:bower (bower install) @ spring-petclinic-client --- > ... >[ERROR] bower angular-ui-router#^1.0.3         mismatch Version declared in the json (1.0.8) is different than the resolved one (1.0.9)  At the first glance, it doesn't seem to affect the running project though.
@dennisoelkers I'm running graylog on docker, and the log files on not their default location, do you know where they are located? There are no indexing errors logged in the dashboard view in the past 24 hours. 
Normally, the game runs at an average of 35% CPU usage. Usually it takes a lot of unoptimized/tick-heavy mods to start incrementing that number to 100%. This mod does it single-handedly.  And I'm not surprised, if the mod works by looping through all blocks on every tick. That's probably the most inefficient way I could imagine a mod like this to work. It would function exactly the same if it only updated every 20/40/whatever ticks. It could even loop every 5000 ticks, and the update lag STILL wouldn't be visible 99.9% of the time, because usually worlds have static ores that were created on generation, with none being placed/moved afterward.
I tried the workaround, and it works well.  BTW, the brave library only depend on zipkin2, so I thought we can replace with zipkin2 completely. But it seems difficult...
I found this happening on 1.3.1 also, with the compressed recovery bug.

Yes, but I think it's safe to do it anyway. For example, if the user downloaded the model from elsewhere or copied it from a laptop.

Hi @fmichielssen ,  You are right that it shouldn't affect the manually created service in any way, although it seems to me that it does delete the services. I've tried it with the original example configuration on minikube and with a slightly modified one using kubernetes with ACS. The problem were the same in both cases.   I've tried to collect more info about it, please let me know if I'm missing something and maybe that causes the problem.    In the config file, I use the following settings:  In the log, you can see that before the delete operation there is 2 available service: shinyproxy-srvice and kubernetes. Although we don't have any service associated with the proxy and `getProxy(proxy).getService()` value is null, the two service gets deleted.   Looking at the kubernetes dashboard I can see that the pod is successfully deleted, my shinyproxy-service is also disappeared, and the kubernetes service is restarted(its age is just a few seconds).   I'm not familiar with the kubernetes java client, but could it be the issue that the filtering at `kubeClient.services().delete(getProxy(proxy).getService()); ` line is not working as expected and if it gets a null value it deletes every service?   It would be nice if you could do a quick test with the example config and see whether you can access the service after shinyproxy deletes the pod.

I have tried with your suggestion, and there is no exception thrown anymore, but my interceptor code doesn't run, so it still can't work.  I decompile the code after Byte Buddy running, I can see the delegate filed, and the `handle` method in `org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerAdapter` is already be enhanced.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20675747/66993740-b32de680-f0fe-11e9-9586-a4f86817d54d.png)  I guess the reason for my interceptor doesn't run is the implemented subclass of `org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerAdapter` override the enhanced method, and it loses the enhance logic.
@dsyer it's supposed to populate the field `Environment` on the main eureka landing page (top left section), just like `eureka.datacenter` populates `Datacenter` field (which works).  The default behaviour without any of these props set is it shows the value `test` But when I set it as above as `eureka.environmenr` it replaces that with empty string.  If it's not used anywhere by Spring Cloud, then why does it clear out the default value?  The [EurekaServerBootstrap](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/d23a57d13bf3d60668a1deb8ec94bfe212e5051f/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka-server/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/netflix/eureka/server/EurekaServerBootstrap.java) supposed to do it from what I can tell, no?

@lulf we do not have a single script you could use to test this.

sorry edited it just before your comment to be more clear, its a grindstone from astral sorcery 
It produces for both new world and new cart. To re-produce: 1. Give your own steam and minecart. 2. Make a link between cart and steam loco.  3. Add fuel + water, start running slowly. 4. After start running for a while, Its lost their link. (Apply for electric and perpetuum.) **Update**: Its happened when using train dispenser to make a train. To reproduce: 1.

The call completes successfully, the issue is in the [waiting logic](https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/ff858dd492b3376e2b7374174b9c2a1fe68abc3f/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/jaxrs/resources/SubscriptionResource.java#L569-L594). We currently expects a subscription, invoice and payment event. If `autoPaymentOff` is set, we shouldn't wait on the payment event.  Does that make sense? 
@gerzytet  Each card(issue) serves as a reminder and also a job to do.  I would say it's a bug of the website since the link is dead when it shouldn't. We do have the Javadoc for CommonFunctions, yet the website just doesn't show it anymore. I will have to investigate what is going on.  Wiki is different in missing information, not the link to the existing information is broken.
It is some random localhost port like 60456, 54329 and so on
I will try to make up a simple project that reproduces the problem.  But generally I think the flow goes like this. - Initially there is no session created on the server and no session cookies in the browser. - The controller/servlet creates a new session and sets an attribute. then throw an exception (thus the error in the response above). - A custom exception handler forwards request to an error page (a jsp without `<%@ page session="false" %>`)

/search?uuid=xxx does a retrieval: displays the metadata detail page.  Looks like Share and Link use the same end point, the first to share in social networks and the second to allow to copy it to the clipboard.  http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/search is the search endpoint, but if you send the uuid parameter displays the metadata detail page for the uuid provided.

This is a good idea!Better than current solution.
Nexus 5, by default, uses the Hangout app for SMS, the standard SMS app is not installed by default. When I try to send a GeoSMS from Geopaparazzi using Hangout Geopaparazzi launch Hangout but nothing appear on screen. 
I figured out the problem. I'd thought I'd left the multifarm without one block so it could be copied. I hadn't. 
I can't duplicate your success using the same json document, so something else must be the issue.  Are you doing something different with the imports or with the sparkSQL context?   
Sure. I even managed to make the crash happen when the file was already open this time. This is the output from the bash console after following those instructions:  
Good question - it started by setting the recovery modus and restarting the application 
This is using SDK v2.2.2 
If the fragment is in ViewPager and still `RESUMED` then it will technically be visible all the time so it's not the best solution. But I guess I could make it work by simply switching the whole list visibility to `INVISIBLE` based on the   calls in Fragment, or maybe navigaton controller state 🤔 
@kdavisk6 for sure, will submit a PR later.
I can't seem to place the coffin anywhere except where I placed it initially. I'll try a vanilla bed and check the version and report back in about 5 minutes, maybe?
Thanks for the quick reply Alexander.  I went to "Preferences->SonarQube" verified properties where correct and verified "Test Connection" was successful.  I restarted IntelliJ and verified this again.  But then things deviate from what I think you're describing in "Analyze > Inspect Code..." and "You should see a whole category named "Sonar" containing all the rules you defined in your SonarQube profile."  I don't have a category called "Sonar", only "SonarQube", as shown:  ![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2962748/2442258/47496ec6-ae1f-11e3-8fd0-36de91f6acfb.png)  And I should add, I'm running on a MacBook pro OSX 10.8.5

The only crash I got. On some test the local server was not correct finished without crash. In such case I killed the virtual java machine. I understand the recipe cache of a mod violate the recipe refresh on dimension reload.   
See my comment here: https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/FABsMenu/issues/22  It is not a flickering, but a selection state on the menu items that seems to be triggered on fab button click.
I believe the issue is because I'm using Spring-boot.  They must register the protocol `classpath:` somewhere, so `new URL("classpath:/...")` is actually a valid url, causing `UrlUriLocator.isValid` to be true.    I checked the tests in `TestImageUrlRewriter`, and that is correctly returning false for `UrlUriLocator.isValid` for classpath urls 
It should be STRING_LIST everywhere, I changed the name in between. Sorry about that, I fixed it now.  I was able to circumvent the problem by disabling statement caching in the connection pool. This is my connection pool now:

@kasper-piskorski you should wrap transactions in an auto-closable `try{ }` block so that when the test fails, it remembers to close the transaction. This doesn't solve the root cause of this issue, but it helps to not cause other tests to fail due to transaction clashes.  I've made this change in my fork. In case this change hasn't got into master by the time you work on this, you can see (and pull it) here: https://github.com/haikalpribadi/grakn/blob/refactor/test-integration/test/graql/reasoner/atomic-query/AtomicQueryUnificationIT.java
1. Start a session with recording on. 2. Close the session, recording quits after 2 minute(or whatever is the set time period) 3. Start  the session again, just after quit recording is send and  before recording docker container is killed. Error occurs because docker container for recording is already up(which is about to die ).  
No exception is thrown, just null being returned. The job does not start.
happened only once. It did happen while he was using it yes. maybe it's a one-off.

I imported an integration that was failing for Ricardo, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HPBKGzc8THx05_AqO5IxNhNHH2AfJJXs/view?usp=sharing) is the ZIP export.  The integration started with WebHook and then invoked a REST API via custom API connector and ended up publishing to Slack. Could be that the issue is only when we use `Pipeline` which we do for custom API connectors and (IIRC) don't for HTTP connectors.
Oh yes, v0.2-2 did indeed fix this. Thanks :)
Try to save as much as possible whenever something changes.

@jbduncan:  1. Test was written before the new parallel test support of junit 5 was released. So i thought using AssertAll gives me a handy way to run my tests in parallel. 2. The performance impact is virtually zero as only in case of an assertion error an element is added to the synchronized list of failures.  3. Non-deterministic is ok.  If an API supports streams it should also work if used with parallel streams - or, if for some reason it does not support parallel streams, it should be stated in the documentation of the API.
Ok I can do that.

After testing a little bit with /minebot plant, I have determined that the game only crashes whenever you try to plant carrots and potatos. Sugarcane just doesn't work correctly, and the bot doesn't plant it at all. All the other crops (Wheat, netherwart, and beetroot) work just fine with no issues. I am using the latest version and made sure by redownloading it and extracting it again.
Would it be possible to have a check in place in HostPort that checks if there is more than one `: ` and  and no `[]`? That or verify that it is actually a proper ipv6 address rather than reporting back an invalid address?
Jo,  Thank you for the suggestion. That appears to have been the problem. In in the past I must not have paid much attention to whether I was typing in the "Save in" field or the "Save Bag As" window, but I followed your directions to type in the "Save Bag As" window and was successful. I think it would be helpful to make it clear to users that they should click the "Browse" button and not just fill in the "Save in" field. I will be sure to clarify this step in my institution's documentation!  Jamie

Your test needs an assert that tries to reference the value you just captured. Which will cause the NullPointerException.

Reading the code about recover() according to the prompt, the message will do reput. Analyzing the log again, i find some about the error log. The first error log of ReputMessageService: 2018-09-11 16:46:46.976 WARN ReputMessageService - [BUG]logic queue order maybe wrong, expectLogicOffset: 1050988840 currentLogicOffset: 1050988820 Topic: role_change QID: 4 Diff: 20 The cqOffset reputing:52549442. There is something wrong with cqOffset 52549441 of qid 4.  From the producer log, the phyOffset is 80549937024 of cqOffset 52549441, as follow: 2018-09-11 16:37:32,006 [ INFO ] MissChecker - send msg success, topic:role_change, tag:1536655040000, index:399503976, result:SendResult [sendStatus=SLAVE_NOT_AVAILABLE, msgId=0AB314D91D3F070DEA4E3710B4E7BD18, offsetMsgId=0A60706900002A9F00000012C1267F80, messageQueue=MessageQueue [topic=role_change, brokerName=syz-00, queueId=4], queueOffset=52549441]  In the recover log broker, the max phy offset is 80549937216.

In truncateDirtyLogicFiles() before return, get the cqoffset by getMaxOffsetInQueue(). And The cqOffset should be 52549442.   I think the last message(cqoffset 52549441, phyoffset 80549937024)  was damaged. In the log, totalSize, bodyLen, topicLen are right but propertiesLength is wrong. As checkMessageAndReturnSize() find it abnormal and return false, the message is dispatched.         DispatchRequest dispatchRequest = this.checkMessageAndReturnSize(byteBuffer, checkCRCOnRecover);       int size = dispatchRequest.getMsgSize();       // Normal data       if (size > 0) {              ..........        }  As the topic was not set in the DispatchRequest, we find the log " /home/suiyuzeng/store/consumequeue/0 mkdir OK ". So the message whit cqOffset 52549441 may was not despatch to the consume queue.  In recoverAbnormally() ,only the size is checked. Should we check isSuccess as in recoverNormally? Truncate the messages when isSuccess is false.

I have verified that this issue has been resolved. 
I shoud mention that this only started happening once we upgraded to Android Studio 8 / gradle 0.12  We were using JAVA8_HOME explicitly in the retro lambda config section until the 2.1.0 release of gradle-retrolambda, we don't seem to need it anymore (and this issue occurs with or without the retro lambda config section).  We do still use JAVA8_HOME for our CI server.  The issue has been intermittent, if I do a clean and run assembleDebug again it usually works for a little while.  I'll see if I can set up a small example that replicates this tomorrow.  Our project is open source though, you could try replicating it yourself if you'd like. https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/OpenTreeMap-Android

Hi, I am using latest version of file system collector i.e. 2.8.0. On the second run 3 xmls are produced whose file name are prefixed by 'del' as I mentioned in my first post having reference of **sample.zip!a.txt**; **sample.zip!b.doc**; **sample.zip!c.pdf**. Below are the logs for your reference:

Ok, since noone can replicate this, I'll close it with unverified. I'll reopen if I can reproduce it. 
Not sure what you're using for it, but I'm using Jackett for torrents.  ETTV - .magnet file The Pirate Bay - magnet url
@tomasbjerre  No , on admin page I am able to see the page where I can setup triggers. 
I'm using java 1.8.  WebAppContext is declared with setWar.  Because I'm working on a standalone app, I'm declaring it like here:  https://github.com/AlanHohn/webmvc/blob/master/src/main/java/org/anvard/webmvc/server/EmbeddedServer.java
It's [`org.threeten.bp.YearMonth` from the threetenbp project](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp/blob/master/src/main/java/org/threeten/bp/YearMonth.java), included via https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP.    I'll try to isolate a sample. 
Nope, it doesn't  occur with grass or any vanilla minecraft flower. I can further add that this happened on FTB Infinity 1.8.2 with Botania updated to the lastest version.  
@LlmDl What do you mean by that? I don't understand :/ (sry I'm new to this Plugin stuff)
I'll wait for release :) Not a big issue :) 
It is Command Prompt (64-bit) with settings exactly as you show.
The argument for user-feedback is not quite correct with existing optimization (rewrite expressions into 0 = 0 or 0 = 1).  I will move the optimization to later phase (planner or optimizer) and post a PR to discuss more around the code, if needed.
1. Oh I can overwrite the direction by loading a saved destination! Saved one for each direction. Now when I'm about to go somewhere I've never been before, I load up the coords, preview it, and then load up whichever save points me in the direction I want to materialise facing and then re-enter the co-ords! #FlawlessVictory!  2. Sounds good!

LinagesOS 15 (Android 8) but I also have the same problem on my tablet that is running on Android 5. For me it doesn't look like a problem that is related to the Android version. I think you can reproduce the problem on any Android version by just rotating your device while you are in the station list of radio channels.
Source position section of modifiers already contains annotations in other cases ... and I am OK with that personally. Only the name of this section is confusing. Otherwise it is OK. The types behaves same. E.g this one:   And many thanks Thomas for fixing that! I have to learn to create more issues ... and not to do it on my own.... looks like we are not only 3 on github ;-))
I was curious about that message, too. I strongly doubt it because all the cfcs work perfectly and even though they will have issues, I'm 100% certain they won't have unclosed tags all over the place as indicated by the output above (or in other experiments I ran). Will check tomorrow morning though. 
Yes, that would work - detect the illegal argument sooner. 
Lets keep it separated - just posted a PR -    :(. I can look at #231 as well later this evening? 
I was using Version 3.4.7.  This PR implements the code, that causes the errormessage. [https://github.com/deegree/deegree3/pull/955/commits/fa34625bebcd077ca03c52c14338cd88d1c517b2](https://github.com/deegree/deegree3/pull/955/commits/fa34625bebcd077ca03c52c14338cd88d1c517b2)                if ( !FileUtils.directoryContains( workspaceDir, dest ) ) {                      IOUtils.write( "Unable to upload file: " + p.second + ".\n", resp.getOutputStream() );                       return;                   }  Maybe i am wrong, but i read this code like: "If the File does not already exist in the Workspace, then throw an error." => Uploading a new File is not possible.  I do not get the connection to the Security of the REST interface. Sure it was a PR to secure the Rest-Interface, but the Problem is not caused by a missing Security-configuration
i just updated: it also happens routes with "normal" ids like "itsToCep". But to answer your question: we have many routes that are very similar, but the start or endpoint are different. For all the best approach (in terms of readability) was to include the url in id. The number of routes (with generated name) is known on runtime (by configuration) so we need a way to identify the routes and keep the "readable" - numbering would be not sufficient. 
> Did you even enable "damage-on-use"...?  ahhh, I haven't seen this option before. I'm sorry to waste your time.
My apologizes for the less provided informations, i thougt that my description were sufficient enough. **Windows 10 Version 1709. Project SDK: 1.8.0_144 Project Language Level: 8 (important for reproducing this error) My maven pom:**   My presumption, as described earlier, is that JDA 3.3.1_299 is compiled with java 9, where the method `java.nio.Buffer.flip()` is overwritten by `java.nio.ShortBuffer.flip()` (Used at `net.dv8tion.jda.core.audio.AudioConnection.encodeToOpus(AudioConnection.java:537`). If i use Java 1.8.0_144 and Project Language Level 8, then i get a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` Exception, because my runtime tries to call the method `java.nio.ShortBuffer.flip()`, which does not exist under java 8 and should be `java.nio.Buffer.flip()`.
Actually we had the same problem for accents, the file is renamed (also altering the original). So we decided to do the same for spaces. 
I guess you're right. The [RFC states](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3) that:  > The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a >    Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field.  Request message >    framing is independent of method semantics, even if the method does >    not define any use for a message body.  So in that case, I guess the client should at least send a `0\r\n` body to send an empty body if nothing has been sent.  Right now the client sends the following:    Is there something wrong with this request? 
Hi I tested with 1.3.3 and .4, same issue Unfortunately I do no have a stacktrace 'cause I fixed my eureka clients to set both URLs as a quick workaround but remains sensible to new clients who do not do the same.  I looked over commit f95f7a5 and it sounds good. Thx for that. I'll test when new version will be available.  Christophe 
Didn't help. The reason seems to be that the error output shows a '?' instead of the unicode escape. When I replace the `assertTrue(t.getMessage().startsWith(...))` with `assertEquals(..., t.getMessage())` to see the differences, I get:  Maybe, just remove the character from the `startsWith()` argument? Comparing messages meant for humans is anyway a bit fragile; they tend to change without warning.
> Hi, > cannot reproduce. Which driver do you use to connect? What's your MySQL version?  Hi, MySQL version is 5.3. But what happened when the application started. I think that unrelated to version.
The newest.
Ok. I don't even know where to find it.
It works well with github.com API  but not other gitHub enterprise domain. My che.properties is like below.  oauth.github.clientid=XXX oauth.github.clientsecret=XXX oauth.github.authuri= https://oss.XX.com/login/oauth/authorize oauth.github.tokenuri= https://oss.XX.com/login/oauth/access_token oauth.github.redirecturis=  http://xxxx:8080/ide/api/oauth/callback auth.oauth.access_denied_error_page=/error-oauth  One thing I should mention is that che server send request to **"https://api.github.com/users" in the middle of oAuth with my GitHub Enterprise domain.   I think the domain should be my github enterprise host.  
Sorry, it was my fault. I thought it's not the connection because another signal user told me he has the same problem, but this router blocks voip, this was the problem. I still didn't get a debug report. 
@clintongormley I don't think we can guarantee that an old nodes will not join the cluster later on - after we performed an initial check and allowed the restore to start. So, checking the state at the beginning of the restore will not be a complete solution. 
Tried again but not able to reproduce. 
I updated my little test project to 6.0.0-beta2 and it still fails. Have you cloned it and ran 'gradlew test', or do you have any other test case?
> Does the problem occur, when .  I have already fixed this and pushed the commit, but it is not shown in Github. 
Ex1: "1 new messag" instead of "1 new message and Ex2: "2 new message" instead of "2 new messages" I think its a small bug in coding. Found this problem in latest release 1.10 (14 Mar, 2015) 
Of course, but I'm fairly certain I got an accurate reading earlier in the game when I used enhanced energy conduit.  Much as I'm loathe to mess with my setup again, I'll try switching that out and see what happens. 
I tried moving the Lathe.xml file, but it regenerated the same, and didn't fix the problem in-game. I'm using FTB continuum 1.4.1 (I updated AR+LV and IE though). I just tested a brand new profile with just AR+LV and JEI, and it still ate a stack of Iron.
I build this project with the develop branch.

Success!  Downgrading to 425 works fine.   Thank you very much for your quick response.  
According to daydrem docs: "App button: This button depends on the app you’re using. For example, it might show menus, pause, go back, or change modes."  So it's a good idea to map that button to the general back action
  http://prntscr.com/cf09n0 The items are there, but there is a StackOverflow and then all item renderer disappear. NEI GUI disappears too. The bug happens only when the Atomic Disassembler is in the visual part, here: http://prntscr.com/cf0a14

I can't give a timeframe, but this will be a pretty high priority bug so we hope to tackle it ASAP and get it into the daily builds + a preview release of RStudio in due course.  
We use javassist-3.21.0-GA.jar, there are no other versions on the class path.

Yes I can view the video stream in my web browser.

No, unfortunately restarting device or the app didn't make any difference.   Also I cannot give you logs since it has been deleted after I reinstalled everything from scratch to make things work again. Couldn't you reproduce the issue? If there's no other way I still have my backup which I can restore (and thus break my configuration)
@apurvam unfortunately this didn't make it in. How high of a priority should this fix be?
This is a segment from logcat last week (our app is com.bynd.looper), which doesn't give a lot of info yet - I'll try to get a longer segment and some stats on how long it takes/etc. Note that it's excessive cpu use, not battery use.  One thing is that it could be that our app does quite a bit of custom processing which is done in the activity, not the navigation service. Although we need that, we might need to look into pushing that into a second service (which would also need to be a foreground service, so will require a second icon in the status bar, which is mildly annoying).  
@saturnism I found cause of this issue and made below pull request.  https://github.com/jdeferred/jdeferred/pull/37  I never work with 'fork' and 'pull request'. so if something is wrong, please tell me. 
Using latest Windows 10, Eclipse running on Java 1.8.0_181. I've re-enabled "EGradle project decorator" an I do not get this error anymore in startup log. But I removed some plugins since my initial post, so it could be that... I'd say that if you cannot think of an obvious cause for the stack trace I posted, don't spend too much time on it.
When testing on the Demo it works fine - Interesting. What can I do to debug the problem? What is weird is images and videos download fine - but files that don't have extensions (my ssh public and private keys) fail and PDF's say "2147483647% Downloading <filename>" and hangs at that crazy percentage amount, then says failed after a minute or two. Also, txt files fail - It would appear only videos and images load fine :(  Like I said, images and videos work fine in the app - Everything works fine from the web interface. Any suggestions? 
Treat as an empty list, no results would be expected. Think about not executing query or this condition(if its "or" query), to not waste cost querying on GAE 
I couldn't remove the salvaged generator until I spawned a normal one and replaced the salvaged one with the normal one.  Also, I am using Optifine, so that may be the issue, I suppose.

Ok, so it seems that creating nodes like:    Will result in regex matches not working, but reversing the order does work.  Test CSV: [phone_type.txt](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/files/269105/phone_type.txt) 
Unfortunately we can't run our app using Java 8.  The app uses the new HTTP 2 client classes from Java 11 so it has to run with Java 11 or newer.
I wanted to use a token as a service to service authentication mechanism, more or less like an API key but, for that to work, the token shouldn't expire.  For now, I  define the expiration date as the long max value as its required but, since the spec doesn't require any field, I was curious about the implementation.

Had the same idea as stalep. But not only gradle itself is a problem. When importing a gradle project into IntelliJ or Eclipse, the output paths of gradle and the IDE are NOT shared (because gradle wants no shared paths, because that destroys correct up-to-date recognition). So, if you want to start the test from your IDE, it still will not work. Eclipse and IntelliJ, have default output paths, but can be reconfigured to other paths. So I would suggest:  On the one hand the ability to recognize the default IntelliJ (`projectRoot/out/production/classes` and `projectRoot/out/test/classes`) and Eclipse (only one output path `projectRoot/bin`) output paths should be added, and on the other hand some kind of additional output path configuration for non default output paths may be useful
I agree that it might be hard to fix (especially for all corner cases), but I was surprised to see that overriding the getter with the explicit return type didn't work either...    We still get `T` in the metadata.  (I tried overriding both the getter and setter with the same result).  Perhaps a reasonable compromise would be to at least make this work?
@md678685 Good to hear I'm not going crazy and there is an actual issue. Is there anything I can do to help OR have you made any progress? I have people dying from falling beneath platforms they teleport to daily.
I can deal with dependencies of different version. Not a pretty setup but doable.  https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv-examples/blob/52ff65a0b58889b623bab525268d593f2a4817be/OpenCV2_Cookbook/build.sbt#L50  Here it is a bit different due to `parent` declaration. When I am trying to use artifact `opencv` it requires its parent according to what is in POM (artifact `javacpp-presets`). It is treated different than just a dependency.  My suggestion is to release parent when children are released.  
Appears to be fixed, i'll leave this here for a few hours more since I just only switched to the new build. 
Ive reset the spigot.yml and updated the 1.14.4 jar and all seems to be good now, not sure which was at fault but .. thanks for your help though :)
@ostephens sorry for late reply I am using Window 10 operating system There is no error in command line of open refine i have check. I am sharing the video [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xmc2rGwBx_KkylkAUeNozELOUu-bknhi/view?usp=sharing) let me if i have done any mistake.
Per discussion with @wenleix, the Exception is thrown when we `array_sort` an `Array` of `Row` and there are `Row` contains null elements. Since `null` is generally treated as unknown in SQL, the order of the two elements cannot be determined.

@mrniko Yes, this test also fails on redisson-3.11.1
yes the time of the day in the game  it make that only when i turn on light and wait a little time  after turn it off time work great  i try it on a fresh server and fresh map 1.5.2 forge 738 with the same effect  thanks 
Yes the plugin prints some information into the build log but all these logs are correct. The message I want to print contains the PR_Number which is for each build correct but the link where it comments my comment is not logged. I can't figure out any details here.   So thats basically my problem the environment variables and the parameters are fine.  What about the build.xml?  PS: Using 0.1.0-rc11 
I didn't do anything different before or after.  Just opened it as usual.  One day the maps showed...the next they did not. 
The latest update seems to have fixed the issue, i can see lots of pages with items when i search "EMC:" in NEI. Approx 6000 items or so vs 2000ish before 
Hello @mcomella   I first noticed the bug by going to outlook.com to see my mails but I tried it with numerama.com to be sure that the bug is not linked to outlook.com and it also happened. So the generic steps are: 1. Go to a website W 1. Connect to this website 1. Access your profile (or whatever data that need you to be connected to be seen) 1. Use the notification to clear you navigation 1. Go to W again  Expected behavior: You should reconnect to see your profile.  Actual behavior: You do not need to reconnect to see your profile.

When the power goes out that activates which allows for the inductor to loop with itself. It's used to preserve the current so it can hold on to its charge for a little while.

I used water buckets in this example but same goes with other liquids. The Locking Track is in Boarding mode. I have tried putting water directly into cart, into loader and into tank feeding the loader.  ![2014-12-22_13 30 26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20052/5525533/493a5fa0-89df-11e4-9497-90d4622d696b.png)  In all cases when cart was partially filled and there was no water anywhere else the cart was not sent off and it would be stopped after I have sent it off with the button.  The cart get set off the moment it gets fully loaded with any of this 3 methods and it won't be hold after it goes around. Whatever I try the behaviour is identical to "Force Full".  I use version 9.4.0.0 and I have some other mods present like GrowCraft, Botania, OpenComputers etc... I don't have IC2 mod though.

Ok I think I have narrowed down the bug. Due to the convoluted nature of what I built it was not easy to follow, even for me. But i managed to deduce it to a smaller pattern between refined storage and storage drawers. I have an interface block that my machines pipe into via ender io, and I have an external storage connected to a drawer controller master than has four 2x2 drawers on it, two are for ores two are for dusts. If I add a dust to the system via a grid it does into the drawers correctly, if I add a single dust via the import row of the interface it goes in correctly. However, if I put two dusts in there three end up in the drawer, 3 will end up with 6, 4 ends up 10, etc (I was clearing the drawer between each test.) Also if I add a stack upgrade to the interface, there is no problem, so I think it has to do with the interface importing and how it exports to  the drawer network.   I am going to submit over a RS also and reference this issue, though I think it may just be an RS issue.
[payara-micro-remote-cdi-event-demo.zip](https://github.com/payara/Payara/files/2419095/payara-micro-remote-cdi-event-demo.zip)  Hi, Yes I have tried with string events, in the example I posted it is a simple serializable object as there is another method in the application which @Observes a string.  I have attached a sample application, it is simply a case of starting 2 instances of payara micro using mvn exec:exec. Note that in the pom.xml, the version of payara is 5.1.81, which works fine. Change this to 5.182 or 5.183 to see the issue.

Yes, I use mCropImageView.setImageUriAsync(Uri.parse(mUriStr)) to set the image. I guess It doesn't work because there's no ExifInfo available.

It took me awfully long, but I can finally reproduce the issue.  If 2 threads share the same Redisson instance, and both are using the same lock, it's possible for the following situation to happen: 1. **thread A** got the lock, and is within the `RedissonLock::release` method. It has successfully released the `RedissonLockEntry` and removed it from the `ENTRIES` map, and is sitting on line 132 to unsubcribe the channel from the collection, and potentially release the connection. 2. **thread B** gets into `RedissonLock::subscribe`, finding no matching entry in `ENTRIES` creates a new one, and calls `connectionManager.subscribe(listener, getChannelName());` 3. **thread B**, within the connection manager finds a valid pubsubconnection for the channel at `MasterSlaveConnectionManager::subscribe`, line 466, and will therefore use that connection 4. **thread A** resumes, and calls `MasterSlaveConnectionManager::unsubscribe`, which removes the connection from `name2PubSubConnection`, unsubscribes from the channel and remove all listeners for that channel. This effectively makes thread B wait forever on a notification that just will never arrive.  This can be easily forced with well placed breakpoints.  Notice Redisson 1.1.6 alleviates the problem by reducing the usage of PubSub connections by using optimistic locking, but is not free of this problem.  I haven't cheked, but this very same problem may also affect other parts of Redisson that depends on PubSub, such as `RedissonTopic`. 
@doanduyhai  Achillies Version   
The code here: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube/blob/master/openshift/openshift/src/main/java/org/arquillian/cube/openshift/impl/client/GitServer.java#L91 defines a hostPort on the pod.   This is something that is generally considered a bad practice (see [1]). Also its something that is not supported on all environments (e.g. Openshift dedicated). But even with plain Openshift, it requires certain configuration on the user side in order for that to work (more specifically it requires that the user is associated with a security context constraint that allows host ports).   So what I am suggesting, is to remove the hostPort definition from the pod and use a service instead. So that we access the git server through the service. Ideally we should also expose the service as a route (if possible) so that its easier to consume externally.  [1] http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/config-best-practices

The db is PostgreSQL, and we have no error when launching a dump This error only happens when we make a SPARQL request on the organization URI  here is the full trace :   
Yes, I have! But it is not connected. mongoDB plugin creates a bean called mongo and that holds a connection to a mongo, which i overriden to be a connection to Fongo. The problem I faced (I know better now) Is gorm does not connect via this bean. There is another bean called `mongoDataStore`. I needed to override that too. My new problem now is Fongo does not have the alternative of this on!   As far as my research went, the solution is to also override the `mongoDataStore` bean! I am working to create a plugin for grails that uses fongo as a data storage for really fast Integration tests. [Fongo-for-Integration-tests](https://github.com/amexsofts/fongo-for-integration-test) .  Basically, What I want to achieve is override every call to the mogo process to be to fongo. From what I see now, you have support for Unit tests only!

After looking at it, he asked me to turn all modules off and try updating again before he would start thinking about it. I did and then it worked - no bootloop. My only modules are XPrivacy and rovo89's smiley replacer and since I've had this problems for a few weeks and I started using the smiley replaces three days ago, I assume it is related to XPrivacy.  After being able to boot when the modules were off, rovo89 told me to contact you. 
Seems to be fully working
currently i'm using only optifine and xaeros minimap  i don't think that mods are causing the bug..

I used 984 when wrote this issue. I'll try soon to recreate it with 996. 
A repository rule doesn't actually help @c-parsons's case, as it still will be cached build-to-build (there's no file that changes we can depend on).  But maybe repository rules would be the right place to add a "force to run every time" option.
I spent the afternoon running some tests and profiling the impact of a few ways to handle this. I wanted to share the options I came up with to get some feedback from others who may have encountered this in the past or have thought about it for more than a few hours.  ### Use concurrent data structures Replace all data structures with their concurrent options. ArrayList -> CopyOnWriteArrayList & HashMap -> ConcurrentHashMap  This will fix the immediate problem by ensuring that during iteration a change in the underlying data structure won't cause an exception. But, there are two issues to consider:  First, `CopyOnWriteArraySet` is only efficient for read-heavy workloads. Since there is typically one write per read (iterating and persist) there would be a costly performance penalty when the COWAL has to copy the array on write/update/remove. This may be a non-issue because the data sets are so small, but something to consider.  Second, the real problem is that the FileManager is running arbitrary methods (`toProtoMessage()`) from non-UserThread without any synchronization or safety from the `Storage` classes. Even if we fix up all these current issues they will just reappear in a different form if it isn't fixed in a more sustainable way. It is really non-obvious which class members need to be thread-safe and which ones don't.  ### Create protobuf objects on the UserThread instead of the FileManager writer thread This seems like the cleanest design moving forward. Current and future `Store` objects don't need to care about thread safety.  The `FileManager` is easier to reason about as well since the work queue `AtomicReference` would just store the immutable protobuf object instead of a class instance that can change.  But, the overhead for building the protobuf message on each save is pretty significant. On average, it takes around 1500ms for `DaoStateStore::toProtoMessage()` to complete. This negates a lot of the batching work that the FileManager hoped to accomplish and can cause the initial dao rebuild to take quite a while.  ![on_user_thread_after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8082291/70292605-7b086300-1793-11ea-985a-34fab20a361f.JPG) ![on_user_thread_after2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8082291/70292606-7b086300-1793-11ea-95c0-a61d567c83a8.JPG)  ### Hybrid solution There may be a hybrid solution where we don't generate protobuf messages on the `UserThread` unless we are immediately shipping it off to the work queue. I think this would bring back some of the batching gains, but I don't have that data yet.  Additionally, it might make sense to just whitelist the really expensive persistent objects, roll our own synchronization, and find a way for "most" users to not care which would guarantee correctness and allow profiling to determine where to optimize instead of bugs.  
@krzyk thanks for pinging. Yes, I think we should be a bit more flexible here. Classes have functionalities but sometimes they also have limitations, and then what you propose makes sense. I'd just like to use bit more formal `cannot`.  
- open app - go to starred articles - press back* -> closes app - re-open app -> shows unread articles  \* I have found out that I am not allowed to press back, but instead I have to use the "middle" button which just suspends the app. Whit this, it also works with fresh articles for me.
Ok, I just got a popup that a new version 2.1 is available in Eclipse.  Previous version was 2.0.0.v20160927-2006 and I was asked if I want to migrate my settings and I selected "yes".  I am using it on Windows 7 64bit with a 32bit Oracle JDK8/Eclipse Neon.1a.
This was working on a previous version. But I just checked the linked issue and it looks like the `lib` directory will go wherever the final build directory is, which I guess it's wherever the `finalName` config setting points to?  That will work for my usecase.
Yes 
Well, I only discovered the bug because of my work on Junit5. I'd be more than happy to open an PR with a simple unit test for the regex.
When I say truncated I mean that the text has been split in two lines, when it fits in a single line.  
The version of Resisson is 2.8.1
Well, it doesn't give any errors. But it just doesn't put any reference to moviemeter (id or any scraped field) inside the xml files of the scraped movies. So maybe it can't retrieve the id on its own or maybe it doesn't scrape at all, even with a nfo with moviemeter-id present.   Example of scraped movie (nfo file present, but no moviemeter-id inside) with latest yamj and only scraping from moviemeter (not imdb, nfo etc in priority): http://d-h.st/xiS1  The entire test yamj and jukebox: http://d-h.st/CAW6 
  edit: with the appropriate brackets on the val assignment of course, idk how this github formatting works.

I'm seeing this when the book comes up from a scan. 
Yes, same across v1.1.383, v1.1.421, v1.2.243
Yes it did not, ok good to hear that you are fixing it,  i hope you fix it soon,  well done. 
I have tested the current dev branch and removing the AdMob account now works correctly :)  I have the log for the "AdMob info lost" error, it's this one:    However I wouldn't care about this as it's caused by using Titanium Backup, probably something doesn't get correctly backed up.  BTW, I use Titanium because I just backup all apps this way, and this way I don't need to use the export/import functions of Andlytics to keep the historical data. I'm just lazy :) 
Interesting! It looks like I misinterpreted what I experienced -- you're right it has to do with the list length and not the contents. That makes a lot more sense. I've updated the issue to include the latest information including that this was found on a Motorola G4 running Android 7.0. It seems to has to do with when items need to scroll.  I'd be ok to close this since I think you're right there's not likely to be anything we can do.

Yes, It does solves this bug and it works. 
To reproduce it is if you have another mod installed with a tank, like Extra Utilities Drums, try rightclicking the drum with the oil bucket, or if there is oil in there because of pump, it can't find the bucket for the fluid. 
Yes. This stuff was added to docs: https://bozaro.github.io/git-as-svn/htmlsingle/git-as-svn.html#_configuration

Thanks! If I can relate the other issue to the this plugin, I will reopen a new issue with more details.
Not immediately sorry. Our tycho build is not yet ready and we have some other pending changes that we want to validate before making a pull request. I haven't made a commit yet. The changes are still in my working space. 
@luluzhao yes my code is also multi-threaded. In my case, I think (but need to do more investigation) that I have:  - one background thread which finishes some trace segment: if this segment tips the trace over the threshold set in `DefaultStreamingStrategy` it starts to stream part of the trace  - the main thread (in parallel) returns and finishes the trace at the top level; this then causes the main recorder to send the whole trace back to X-Ray  If these aren't properly synchronised, it's possible for them to clash giving rise to the "Segment already emitted" errors. I could do this synchronisation externally (in my code) but it would make my code a lot simpler if I could rely on the X-Ray library to do this for me.
Tested and it's working fine. Thanks! 
Unfortunately, I don't think there is a general rule.  German writers would likely simply avoid ending a sentence with a digit.  There are too many: 1. Platz, 1. Preis, 1. Mannschaft, 1. Bundesliga, 1. Liga, 1. Rang, 1. Kategorie, 1. Reise, 1. Tag, 52. Woche, 3. Monat, 1. Jahrhundert, 1. Buch Samuel, 42. Kongress, "1. Simmeringer Sport-Club", "1. FC Nürnberg" - these are all grammatical correct use. It's not specific to dates, that was just where I first noticed that this is really a major problem. Once you look out for them, they are literally everywhere. Just go to http://de.wikipedia.org/ and type "1." into the search box. Even with "42." you get many suggestions.  So I believe my workaround is doing the best heuristic - assume that digits followed by a dot does not end a sentence (it could, but it usually won't).  There are other cases where the assumption that a dot always ends a sentence is incorrect - in particular abbreviations may or may not end a sentence. "Äpfel, Bananen, usw. sind Obst." is another example that is incorrectly split by CoreNLP. (usw. = etc.; Apples, bananas, etc. are fruit.) But these are hard to define without already having POS tags and without massive learning/dictionary. To get some samples, you could look at Wikipedia page titles: https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Usw.&redirect=no  For the digits+(no space)+dot rule, I  guess that not splitting the sentence is correct in over 90% of cases; but that is a wild guess. Linguists might be able to come up with a number, though.
The tipper suggests to remove the empty constructor of Bool. Doing that cuases compilation errors, since another constructor exists and the empty constructor is used.
Sorry, I added everyone as an ally and now it's working.
I couldn't find the location at that time and it stopped after a server restart and so far it did not reoccur.

Hello, i suspect that you mean the logcat output of the crash? I'll do that in a separate issue because it seems to me that this is not related to the non-updated location/signal values. https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/300  Here I could give you my output .csv if you want, but i'd rather send that privately because of all the geodata included. 
Oh, I didn't know that. Actually I'm always updating to the latest Oracle Java runtime.  Thank you very much for the snapshot! Unfortunately I had no luck with it. The result is the same. It starts like a charm with kernel revision 55, but fails with 57 (and I assume also with 56). Though, I can use the workaround in both scenarios. (BTW: I like the little touch you gave the today number!)  Unfortunately the console doesn't give me much information:  ![st](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14349333/27489414-c99d606c-583a-11e7-9573-588547f35754.png)
Dunno. It finally finished. I will be doing another big upload and I will find out. 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Donate arduino-1.8.9-linux64.tar.xz   this is the URL and the item downloaded.h   the item w as downloaded, uncompressed and installed.  The resulting problem was traced to    the java/bin subdirectory.  There could be other problems but I would have to resolve this before   I could troubleshoot more deeply. 
I do not quite understand what a custom (manually created) driver is. I use the **MS SQL Server / Microsoft Driver" that is supplied by _DBeaver_ and downloaded within _DBeaver_.  Should I used another driver, downloaded a driver from other source, or should I have specified the command line parameter differently?  On that the bug only happens with Generic driver in _DBeaver_ 4.3.4+ seems odd, since the fault already existed in _DBeaver_ version 4.3.3.1.
Hm, now I don't quite understand how this should work. 1. `Enable authentication for /project endpoint` is on 1. I have gitlab repo `https://my_gitlab.com/jenkins_sandbox/user-webhook-test`.  1. Next I create Multibranch project at my jenkins: http://my_jenkins.com:8008/job/test_webhooks_project/. In project configuration I add git source specified above. 1. After that, I add webhook to gitlab repo (without any jenkins user or api key): http://my_jenkins.com:8080/project/test_webhooks_project/ 1. `Test` button return status 200, but not trigger jenkins project; any push to repo also return 200, but jenkins project is triggered and started.  So authorization doesn't required. Or I did something wrong?  Thank you.  P.S. Maybe it is ok: I don't found any way to trigger project by webhook in repo that not speficied in project's settings. I mean that if my jenkins project uses gitlab_repo_1, and I set up webhook to this project in gitlab_repo_2, then project not triggers. So if project can be runned just by repos specified in project config, then I think this is enough for security (unauthorized users can't create and modify projects).
Sure, here it is   
My device are HTC One 801e (M7) phone, Android 5.0.2. and Nexus 5.0 emulator (Genymotion), Android 5.0.0. All the text is not styled correctly in my all devices. 
Helllo @bclozel, thank you for the reaction.  In our team, we provided our own custom `RequestedContentTypeResolver` for `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` to convert our own accept header and content-type header. (This is because the accept header controls versioning.)  Usually, HandlerMapping is executed in the following order.  1. `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`) 2. `ControllerEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`) 3. `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` (CustomRequestedContentTypeResolver)  The value of MediaTypesAttribute cached by `HeaderContentTypeResolver` of `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` is cleared when `ControllerEndpointHandlerMapping` ends.  However, for some reason, our team executed HandlerMapping in the following order. (I am aware that this is a rare case.)  1. `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`) 2. `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` (CustomRequestedContentTypeResolver) 3. `ControllerEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`)  In this case, the MediaTypesAttribute value cached by the `HeaderContentTypeResolver` of `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` is inherited by `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` without being cleared. Therefore, we can no longer resolve the MediaTypesAttribute with the CustomRequestedContentTypeResolver.  Manipulating the HandlerMapping order can solve the above problem. However, if  `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` alone can clear the value of MediaTypesAttribute, can the value of MediaTypesAttribute be handled without depending on the order of HandlerMapping?  What do you think?    
What happens is that K9 stops when it's trying to sync INBOX i.e. the "circle" on upper left corner of the phone goes around and around. No error messages. After a while the "circle" just disappears and new messages stay unsynced.
The only scenario would be an old world that had by chance set the id to something out of the range of the new Minecraft ids. 
Hello,  Yes i confirm that with the latest release it's ok 
Well, my error doesn't display the "error" button, i only can press "ok".  The owncloud sms app has been installed yesterday (the server-side app too).  Thks for your reply :). 
It could have negative side effects on the integration runtime
  EDIT: The name of the file originally was `PM-PU-1027-T-A1.fastq` rather than `sample.fastq`. I've posted here differently because I didn't think it would be relevant.
Sure. Two of my set titles were   Blood for the Blood God!!!  WOOT!!!!!  Just like that. And it would not save the set. Every time I would check the folder or exit the game. I also had one with a ? But that title changed so I don't remember what the full set title was.
confirmed. Can we change that so that we can sort by any of the rank files available.  Use case: a geneset is significant in one dataset and not significant in another but very close.  Might want to compare the ranked list of the two datasets to see how they differ.

yes
I will work on updating the documentation to reflect the current implementation. For me it would either be the ability to say: use `Hostname` from the node, or alternatively be able to provide a hostname which will be used by each broker and the bootstrap without the need to specify an override for each individually. Which do you prefer?  Thank you for the offer! For the meantime, I would like to continue exploring on my own and learning my way around the codebase :)
I'm sure that dealing with this one will help by using ZAP Proxy through jenkins plugin. Most of companies will use ZAP Proxy through automated tools as jenkins plugin. So this is my selling points ;)  :   -All the developers to home i presented ZAP Proxy and how to use with jenkins told me that they have to obtain a delta between two or three jobs and need to tag false positives.  -As you know the managers need also the information to see how the issues are dealt with and the only thing we can get when using ZAP as daemon is the report.  I hope you understand the importance of the fix ;).  thc202 : the alerts are shown with green flag .  Thank you all for your help.  Best regards,  Abdellah AZOUGARH

Version 20.0.0    
First, I has installed the plugin from jetbrain's repository, then I generate the .jar from github (master version) by idea 14 and installed it (overwriting the previous version).  (the doubt that I have is that I do not know if it was the other way around (first the master version and then I has returned to the repository version of jetbrain), and finally  I returned to the master version)) 
Oh sorry I haven't seen the dup.  I extended the actions generation inside the actions.js file to handle a custom type of action which I am currently developing (https://github.com/Sheldor5/alfresco-share-clipboard) and I haven't found another way than overwriting the OOTB client-side javascript file. 
Ok, closing this issue.
As I have a setup to reproduce this and as we agree on option 1 I will provide a PR shortly.

You are correct that `4.6.2` and `4.7.3` don't exist for `spotless-ext-eclipse-jdt`.  But `goomph` knows about them, so we should be able to make a lockfile for them.  If you don't have time to provide the lockfiles, can you point me to instructions for how to make them?
Any of these three blue buttons on the right. I tested it again, though, and for the lower two it only happens once I put something into the inputs. So probably not the button press itself, but the form handling or server queries are the problem.  ![buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14839707/36886462-cc560ba6-1dec-11e8-9ecd-5f891170442c.png)

Hi  @vroyer !  Thank you for reply!  I changed  level for `org.elassandra.indices class` from INFO to DEBUG in `logback.xml`: 
One of the tests no longer fails (with your library fix).   org.evosuite.runtime.mock.javax.swing.MockJFileChooserTest still fails. I'll look into it when I get a chance and see if anything pops out, but I thought I'd see if there was something obvious first. 
I'm using 2.2.6 
Many thanks for solution. One more thing I need to ask that how can I get the changed selection item at my custom binding and post update accordingly? I have also defined rule for this. Actually, I am creating one custom binding for testing like when I select timezone from selection then it should display time according to that timezone in Date item. 
This was fixed by #9  
[Java Swing Jayatana](https://code.google.com/p/java-swing-ayatana/) _"is a project that brings Ubuntu global menu (AppMenu) and HUD support for Java Swing applications."_ (says [webupd8.org](http://www.webupd8.org/2014/02/get-unity-global-menu-hud-support-for.html))  It's obviously not strictly necessary but buys me the convenience of the HUD (searchable menus) and of course a nicer design.  I'm not sure this is on the Arduino side, but - as stated before - all other Java software I use runs just smooth. 
I tried both Hardened and Leadstone Fluxducts as well as Basic Universal Cable from Mekanism.
Unfortunately I don't know what quickboot is, so I would guess that it's not enabled... I'll check the beta.
Thanks a lot @amisevsk . I figured out the issue today. Some configs were missing. Btw , my version is  7.0.0-RC-1.1
@wangkhc Indeed, it means classifying the existing index settings, and writing a test that ensures that every future setting is classified one way or the other.

Hi Benjamin,  Thanks for your quick response.  Our regular (in production) app is using the Crouton 1.8.1 jar and it works great on all version of the OS up to L preview.

In broker logs.  Running in a 3 node cluster.  Unfortunately I'm not sure we can reproduce this anymore - it was breaking clusters frequently enough (once every 1 or 2 days?, with no obvious path to recovery) that we've downgraded to 2.2.1 entirely.  I'm going to test out 2.3.1 when it comes out - we were also hitting some Jetty thread pool issues that merlimat said were getting fixed then.

I think in tests we could check correctness of toString() return value and a request URL of the json() method. 
I adjusted as follows in Eln.java and compiled:  It did not work however.
No.  I only recognized there are all threads waiting, which has to be a deadlock... It is reproducible, and it has to do something with the timing, without debugger it's much easier to reproduce... 
Hi  I am using an airsonic server which is normaly compliant with the version 1.15 of the API.  The video is an avi file. I am able to play the file too but the progression bar doesn't work properly (cursor stay at the left) and the duration of the video ( at the bottom right corner) stay at 00:00.  What server are you running on your side ?  Thanks  
@snicoll Thanks for the quick explanations. I see what you meant and I just noticed this on the upgrade instructions:  > Classes annotated with @ConfigurationProperties can now be found via classpath scanning as an alternative to using @EnableConfigurationProperties or @Component. If you use @SpringBootApplication, scanning is enabled by default for the package that contains the @SpringBootApplication-annotated class.  We wanted to put the our service bean together with its configuration, and use `@EnableConfigurationProperties` to conditional switch on/off the bean initialization in a consistent way.

Hi thanks for your answer, i have tested on my Xiaomi where it works, unfortunately i don't have the Samsung S9 to test it. The logcat file is really long i past it into a txt fil,  hope is correct. [logcat.txt](https://github.com/AltimitSystems/mv-android-client/files/2824627/logcat.txt) I use these plugins: ![plugins](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47223252/52166831-b620ac80-2712-11e9-901c-a419e1588b6d.png) My RMMV and Project versions: 1.5.1 i use WebView. If a samsung S9 is needed for the bug, i can find one for test and update the logcat.txt, just tell me if the logcat that i've upload here is correct. Thank you for your time. 
@lbeurerkellner I can't reproduce this bug either. Maybe it happened in the early days when we moved to Eclipse and the system was not stable?
Thanks! 
I think I didnt describe it really clearly.  The red line, the player icon, and blue square are "flashing"(appear/disappear) when the UI "refresh" itself to update its position etc. But everything is working fine, no softban. I'm at a steady 70kxp/h

No change, still does not show all Camel routes/WARs  I have one tomcat with 20 WAR's deployed and 1 Hawtio instance deployed. I can see 3,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,20 on the Camel view, but all 20 under the JMX ? "org.apache.camel" view.  If I stop/start I get a different sub set of the 20.  Let me know how I can help.

seeing a lot of errors relating to "LibraryLWJGLOpenAL". it's possible this is related to the sound issue [https://pastebin.com/wNcQC8mc](https://pastebin.com/wNcQC8mc)
Perhaps tipping at app version same Google is doing for developer console? If this is to complexe close that issue, was just an idea.
@snicoll I tried with the execution id specific for the "main" artifact (the one without the classifier), but that did not help.  What did help however is changing the order to the following and now it works:    I'll leave the qualification of this to be a bug or a feature up to you ;-)
> Does this prevent you from doing anything, or is it just log clutter that should be cleaned up (error should be caught better) ?  I detected no functional problem. I would say that it is jug log clutter that should be cleaned up.
funny because to me always found this really confusing. either true decimal or something like in HT: 17y 50d   or 17(50)
@JamesSmartCell had a similar problem in iOS and it was fixed by dropping the 0x (which caused the fail import on iOS), I think the problem might be the opposite on android
3.1.0-GA 
The thing is that I already don't have to worry about this happening with later versions of Multi-Hotbar, it's the fact that people can still use an older version of it to do this, and have their own copies of it.   Is there any way for CarryOn to insure that CarryOn "items" will only stay in inventory for so long as they are actively selected, and always drop if they aren't? Otherwise there will always be the potential for various other mods to do this.  
I'm using 0.13.7.201111141412. I guess it is  the latest daily build version.  I've set my workspace eiditor encoding as UTF-8.   Preference -> General -> Content Type, Text -> Erlang source file  I changed to default encoding form ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8,  but it still doesn't work. 
As per specification https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.3 I think, In this case, we should return with HTTP-200 active=false.   
I'm in a fairly populated area along 95 between New Haven and New London.  It's a pretty good connection.  I get this issue across all Android devices (Note 8, S7, Pixel).  If you need any info from me, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Like I said, it's not a huge issue, but I figured I would bring it up.  Thanks for looking into this.  
audio=on, width = match_parent, height= match_parent  don't work audio=off, width = match_parent ,height= match_parent can work audio=on, width = wrap_content, height= wrap_content  can work audio=off, width = wrap_content, height= wrap_content can work  I only found this problem on my Honor 10 Lite
I guess that's another issue than this one in any case. Yes, if you are on yesterday's snapshot it will work as it seems to be a regression in Spring Security. 
no stack trace with `docker logs` and no stack trace in `logs/pulsar-standalone.log` is there a log file I missed?
Uploaded the client code here - https://github.com/vivsrivastav/tut-spring-boot-oauth2/tree/vivsrivastav-client 
Started new server, I only had luckperms, essentialsx, vault and authme installed, issue still occurs when I leave the server in front of a skeleton and then re-join skeleton still tries to attack me
Sure, attached.  [catalina.2016-10-11.txt](https://github.com/tomasbjerre/simple-bitbucket-commit-checker/files/523585/catalina.2016-10-11.txt) 
I'll probably need to write a new detector. [This](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01518606/document) document explains the bug in part 2. Basically whenever an element stored in a sorted data structure is modified, it needs to be removed and added again, or the structure might break.
In the test case, all four additional values are valid millis (Long.MAX, Lon.MAX - 1, Long.MIN, Long.MIN + 1). Need to look at behavior after 1970 vs before 1970 
Today, the test is success passed on CI (https://ci.codenvycorp.com/view/qa-nightly/job/che-integration-tests-multiuser-master-ocp-all-tests/96/Selenium_20tests_20report/failsafe-report.html#org.eclipse.che.selenium.languageserverJsonFileEditingTest). Hence the bug is fixed.
I have attached some piccys of the server start log file. With the duplicates I get a Java duplicate null pointer exception. Unfortunately the files didn't attach in order but you will get the idea. The debug level was 7 and I reduced it to 4, but no change. As you will see from the log I am running CraftBukkit, the latest Dwarfcraft, PEX, World Edit etc. and all works fine without the duplicate trainers. It does create one duplicate successfully!! Thanks for your help, I have run out of ideas, we will run with just a central training area if we have to but it is a bit of a hassle. Thanks again.  ![final_load_msg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10723674/8898502/7f326c40-3468-11e5-822c-3b6b0dd3d296.gif) ![java_warning](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10723674/8898503/7f3dfbdc-3468-11e5-9984-75b6ae596836.gif) ![server_versions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10723674/8898504/7f4ab0de-3468-11e5-8494-cb0378545d3f.gif) ![trainer_load](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10723674/8898505/7f5780a2-3468-11e5-8e34-1a3f524174a6.gif) 
Yes, that's the right repo.  Here's the annotation : https://github.com/who/springfox-examples/blob/example/override-responses/src/main/java/com/github/who/springfoxexample/controller/TestingController.java#L17 
Tested with SpongeForge 1731 and forge 2079 / 2088. 1.  Start the server (no special java flags) 2.  OP myself 3.  Put myself in gamemode 1 4.  Take any chisel tool (I chose a Stone Chisel) 5.  Put myself in gamemode 0 6.  De-OP myself 7.  Left-click anywhere on any block  These steps might seem simple in mind, but this is really the only things I do.  The mod works without sponge added, and it recently started to happen (guess i can backtrack that).  Here are new logs: [fml-server-latest.log](https://gist.github.com/FiveEYZ/a61983b213d697b67a93744914ac172d) [latest.log](https://gist.github.com/FiveEYZ/08647e1fd7ef43abb8c8c4f1db1c63e0) 
It's working again, thanks for the quick fix.  Grabbed the latest snapshot using this maven dependency (I am using maven for this particular project):   
@yueh  Yes of course. http://pastebin.com/HnRkpKm6  @Ianaver  Helps only full  dismantling of machines from AP2 , Its happens every time when entering the world.

Hello, in fact Dbeaver was left unused, minimized and only connected to a Sql Server. I can execute or not some query, that the behavior is the same. Disconnecting the database almost does not change memory usage.  This happens only in versions 4 or higher, I removed 4.0.2 and installed 3.8.4 and the problem disappeared.  I will do the heap with the heap as recommended.

When I click the icon to listen to the pronunciation of a word, I see the message "speaking" but I can't hear anything. I raised all volume levels to max. The speech to text isn't working. I can't find any settings to adjust.
So OpenJDK jdk8u172-b11 is one of the JVMs I have seen this on. Also, it happens for me while running the app in IDE (Intellij 2018.2) and also while running the Spring Boot executable jar.  It's interesting that it consistently fails for you. The behavior I saw was that it would pick the String overloaded setter most of the time and int overloaded only one once in a while.
I tried the dev version v1.8.1-dev_b52d9274(1527369785) The result is the same, i.e. got 2 entries each time.  The original app has the visceral index. You can see the captured image of my previous issue (#248 )  BTW, visceral is measured as an index, not in kg or %.
The newest the version 5.7.1 
Thanks for your swift comment! I just created the ElekShield.ino sketch where I saw the problem in Github Gist: "#2354: Arduino IDE 1.5.8 in WIN7-32bits: problem with sprintf()". Thank you for looking into this problem.

Yes. And the vulns load fine. I can see them in the alerts tab. They just don't get included on the reports.

The bug is that it raises the lint-error instead of formatting code (I run the apply goal - not check)
BC, but i just noticed that i cannot place your oil into any inventory. 
Yes, the current behaviour is right... guys, what do you consider a better option here:  (1) change from `IlegalArgumentException` to some other exception (which one?) (2) the `HttpMethod#of` receiving the list of allowed methods and throwing it directly (3) no one... any other option that I don't know yet =) 
Sorry it wasn't clear. I'm referring to the group view. I have several groups and many subgroups, all static, making the list longer than the "view" and giving me a scroll bar. After playing around with it a little, I realized that when I drag an entry from "All Entries" into a group, there is no issue. However, if I drag an entry from one group into another, and the group view is scrolled down, it will jump to the top. Hope this is clearer. Thanks! 
> Can you try to do a loop to measure the mean exec time of ls?  `ls -Risah src` time in Bazel:    Looks pretty fine to me.  > Bazel taking a long time is not suprising but the exec should be pretty fast.  Do not really get what you are trying to say. I can look at `iotop` and see that `cp` runs way longer than in terminal - although not the whole Bazel waiting time. Is there a chance that Bazel is suspending the `cp` process? 
It happens with 'com.otaliastudios:cameraview:1.4.1'
Nice catch. Amazing. Thank you so much! 
@AmolGangadhare I've tried a clean build and the workaround,  the error still remains.
I will post the log when I get home from work. The error is an "Unable to connect" error. I am using socat. I may setup a pseudo terminal with a link of /dev/pty/0 and socat creates a link to /dev/pts/7. If I configure mycontroller to connect to "/dev/pty/0" it is not able to connect. However if I configure "/dev/pts/7" it connects without issue. When my system reboots the socat command will run providing a static port for mycontroller. However if mycontroller attempts to connect before the virtual port is created it should retry (at least a few times). That would be a real nice feature.  thanks again,   Brit       From: Jeeva Kandasamy notifications@github.com  To: mycontroller-org/mycontroller mycontroller@noreply.github.com  Cc: bpair brit.pair@yahoo.com   Sent: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 10:29 AM  Subject: Re: [mycontroller] Retry Serial Port and Virtual Port support (#36)  @bpair Thank you to update here.

There's no default access in interfaces: by default they're all public.
The latest 2.1 snapshot (20120725.141221) is massively unusable for both the http and https internal connectors.  Without changing my code (just updating to latest snapshot) both connectors are now hanging and timing out even on Linux where I didn't have any trouble before. 
PR submitted - #25255
The issue is intermittent at startup. This is a code quality issue in Bookkeeper with how it is integrated with Zookeeper and how it checks and handles state at startup. Since it's a Bookkeeper issue, I'm closing this as a non-issue for Pulsar.
Sorry for the late reply... Email was miss-filed. C:geo version number has probably updated since then.

If you can tell me how to install the debug build, I'm happy to test it. I don't have a rooted phone.  I put together a trivial test example - and in creating it found the bug is slightly different to what I thought.  http://www.tx9.co.uk/zxingtest.php  I cleared app data, then used the "go to a.php" link and scan a barcode, it takes me to a.php Then I use the "go to b.php" link and scan the same code, and go to b.php Then I go back and use the "go to a.php" link and always end up at b.php, even if I scan a different code.

I confirm the fix is ok with 1.2.0 after recompiling micronaut mongo-reactive 1.1.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT with this micronaut version.

When multiple threads deserialize dates concurrently it is possible that the Threads return due to racing conditions wrong dates, sometimes the result of the other thread. 
@zhangzhx I've tried multiple times and have not seen this error again.
I think I can do that, but I do not like this idea, because now the rules will depend on the content of ListItem(A). If other rules match the whole ListItem(A:K) block and do something else, then it will be very bad, because it is very hard for me to detect whether or not the C semantics want to include mathing the ListItem(next) case or exclude the ListItem(next) case in other contexts.

I am not sure, sometimes my desktop Linux Spotify client is empty, I think it happens when I shutdown/reboot my computer without closing the Spotify client beforehand.  EDIT1: Another case is when I am disconnected from librespot-java client and I reconnect my Spotify desktop client, afterwards I also can't see any song selected in my playlist.
Right! Sorry I forgot to post the versions xD `Nucleus version 0.10.1-5.0 (built from commit 627f6b8)` `SpongeForge` `Minecraft: 1.10.2` `SpongeAPI: 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT-b88f5eb` `SpongeForge: 1.10.2-2092-5.0.0-BETA-1746` `Minecraft Forge: 12.18.1.2094`  No errors in console and the starterkit got reset too I think, I will add some other kits to test with those as well though. 
ok, i will see
In a normal situation, yes. However this is a fix that modifies a user's action (e.g. the user might have created the .nomedia file on purpose). I'll see how long 3.0.2 will last and, if needed, I'll delay this to 3.0.4 or 3.1 (whichever comes first).

Manual transmissions currently in do not work the same way that a tractors would at least in my playing with manual transmissions that the Trin Packs have added into the game. Or maybe I just misunderstand how manual transmissions for cars work currently. It might be due to them using gas pedals instead of throttles. Which I will be using on my tractors since that is realistic.   As far as breaking goes when I drove the UNU Groundhog I didn't believe it turned sharp enough. While I understand that an updated physics system for just this would be too much to ask for really, I'd be happy if you just pondered on it. Maybe look into it whenever you work on other physics parts. In the case of keybinding there would technically need to be three keys or a switch in some way. I do agree that differential brakes are non-intuitive, I believe that 100% as I have seen people not realize that the two pedals next to each other are both brakes in real life. But as I said there would need to be three keys for braking with a differential braking system as most tractors and all modern tractors have a function to connect both brakes for use on the road, that is so you don't swing around throwing your tractor over while braking cause of someone in their car. I believe this can be done with the three keys we already have and have differentials be a toggle able thing that comes turned on by default under the U menu. Then for differential braking have it default to the keybinding such as s+d to use your right differential brake and make you turn right sharper, and s+a for left turning. Obviously keybinding is the easiest part in this case.  A final addition that I see I did not talk about is a PTO. I can't seem to find how ground effects are "started", from the video you posted it seemed as though they just need to be low enough to scrap the ground. Obviously rotatable objects are possible but I am curious as to how that would be made functional with the ground effects allowing us to "turn off" or lift up our equipment for transport. I currently dont have any examples to look at until Seagull finishes his industrial pack. I am sorry if this too is possible like you said the manual transmission can act in the same way as a tractors, I just cant seem to find it in the manual anywhere.

@vijay-murali I have the issue with model 1,9,11 (trained on Oct. 2*). And the code I use branched 3-4 days ago from the the master. It shouldn't be too old, right? My code captured the error which was led by 'CLASS0'. This not only makes a bug in core/evidence.api_calls.from_call but also in core/evidence.types.from_call. Any more ideas? I can investigate into it more given you're quite busy now. BTW, could you direct me to our best javadoc dataset? Thanks!!
The message appeared this morning, but I only started testing UMS yesterday.  I didn't have debug logging turned on for your library at the time; I've since turned it on, added some logging to output the buffer if it's negative, and am waiting for it to happen again. I'll post more info when I have it.  I'm not up to speed on the Chromecast protocol (to know whether it's guaranteed to return 4 bytes), but you're calling `.read()` on an `InputStream` and not checking if the return value is `-1`, which would indicate the end of the stream.  You could get some strange behavior if that happened.  A different approach might be to use the `read(byte[] b)` method on InputStream, in case there are fewer than 4 bytes available. 
@misaochan : Yes, sorry for not precising. @Bluesir9 : Indeed the bug is reproducible in the Mapbox demo app. Apparently there is a related bug currently https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/issues/10101 so let's wait until they fix things and then update, since it is not a critical bug.

I would if I could, but I have no video recording software. I can describe a scenario using some photos, however.  On my mini Isla Nublar I've been building, part of the tour road goes past the Aviary and up a gentle incline to a cliff road, like this ![2018-07-25_00 11 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41495834/43180753-661b92aa-8f9f-11e8-9fa8-a9383a8b89ae.png)  The reason the tour track is like this is because the Explorer completely failed to travel up the slope with the original, straighter tour path. I initially thought that was because the slope was too sudden and the car wasn't allowed to correct itself before going up another slope, so I fiddled with the track to make the parts where the Explorer is level again longer. At first, it worked, but I tried doing a test run of the whole tour again today and the Explorer went about halfway up the slope before turning around and traveling back down. So, I went to the spot where it had turned around and I meddled with the placement of the track a bit, touching none of the other bits of track, and tried again from the very bottom and 20 blocks away. This time, the Explorer didn't even climb one slope before turning around again, despite the track having not been altered at the bottom in ANY way. Here is the same screenshot with the spots where the car failed to climb the hill pointed out, as well as the starting point: ![failure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41495834/43180949-7c5aa6ea-8fa0-11e8-8b20-a327e4262d50.png) If possible, I'll try to find some recording software and record the bug in action, as well as any attempts to work around it, to demonstrate how bizarre it is.  
@mkouba this issue is (currently) the last issue of my myfaces extension for quarkus. If this issue is fixed, do you like to host the extension as official quarkus extension? The extension is here: https://github.com/tandraschko/quarkus-myfaces I think i would need to create some tests and release MyFaces 3.x M1. 
I'm using v2.4.1
Oh, sorry. 0.5.1. I assumed autoupdates.  Just updated to 0.5.2, looks like NPE gone.   
probably around 50 height, and 80 width, its one of the smaller zones and usually resets fine. The warzone that triggers the out of memory is usually random and not any in particular. I did notice before the server would lag up like crazy and print out tons of null pointers when a warzone would randomly reset and the server would barely recover after them. I am thinking maybe those errors intensified and the server simply crashes without displaying them? Ive posted those errors before and could try to dig some up.  Edit: We have 6 GB of RAM allocated to the server and we usually have 2-3 freed up while the server is running  14.07 12:40:41 [Server] INFO Free allocated memory: 3447.0 MB 14.07 12:40:41 [Server] INFO JVM allocated memory: 6092.0 MB 14.07 12:40:41 [Server] INFO Available total memory: 6092.0 MB

No, it's completely messed up. When it's night in PC, moon and stars are showing, the sun is up but low at the horizon on PE.  Possibly, the moon is at the same position as the sun, if that's what you're asking?

Thanks, Paul!   I had overlooked that preference, and when I switched it to *All*, on compilation it threw exactly the right warning, helpfully painted orange to make it jump out: `warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]`.

sorry, my friends. i am sorry to reply late. I tried to give the imageview a tag, but it's not works. I was using the Glide 3.4.0. and here is my VIewHolder:   
yeah
OK, this is effectively hard to reproduce, but I still can do it. If I clic on the arrow, the schema combo expands correctly. If then I clic on a schema, it works fine.  The problem seems to occure after a first start of DBeaver, if I clic on the combo arrow twice.  I have found several hs.err.pid*.log files.  I attach several of them [hs_err_pid_DBeaver.zip](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/files/723295/hs_err_pid_DBeaver.zip)  Hope this will help... Anyway, this is a minor bug that I found "by accident".   
Version 1.1.9, according to the logs, it happens right after calling `.schedule ()`.
Fixed in latest version, thank you!
Added OS (Arch Linux). I tried with a completely minimal hello world main.go and it does indeed work.  I'll try and create a minimal example where it fails, could you suggest a non-trivial go project where debugging does work and I can try and work from there? I just tried with https://github.com/mitchellh/packer, which doesn't give the error, but nor does it actually stop at my breakpoints.  
Hi @dzc34,  It's the develop version.  Thanks :)
When I Start the server  None of my scripts were enable and when I enable all of them I got that error
I found this to be true on both the master and develop branches. I pulled them both just now and see the same behavior on both.
There is no `.pmd` file in the project folder.  I fixed the error message problem but hit another.  To fix the error message, I went into my PMD ruleset XML file and removed a custom rule.  The custom rule is based on a Java class I wrote.  If I include the custom rule, then the PMD plugin throws a `ClassNotFoundException`.  The PMD plugin does not have the class in the classpath.  How do I add my custom class so that the PMD plugin can use it?  I tried "Select a working set..." on the property page but that did not seem to work.
So in my UI designer, a workaround for this issue is to add a menu in the first index like so: - New Menu - Menu1 - Menu2 - Menu3 ...  Then I re-size the New Menu to zero (not null, sorry for the confusion) and then the font is fixed. Just a simple workaround.

my 4th relaunch of the server fixed it guess. And i have not tried to reproduce it.
It was set to false , ill try the new build now 
@rubensworks  > I assume you meant an exporter on the bottom of the apiary, the importer obviously won't do anything.  No. I have an Importer on the bottom of the apiary. When the queen splits into a princess and drones, the importer pulls them out, then tries to put the princess and any drones it can back in. Combs or drones that don't fit go into the chest.
let me test. Any core mods requierd?
i try to change the resolution, mean i type in "1024x768" but the canvas doesnt changed their size. It happens most the time. It only works 1 time.. 
My `reticulate` version was 1.10, I have installed the development version and now works normally, thanks.
Actually, many... I'm gonna try to figure out if the error is caused by any specific plugin
Yes, I tried building it in different ways, and changing the position of the structure tower and the rocket assembling machine. Finally I found that the problem is when the rocket is built with a structure pipe from buildcraft.  If you put a structure pipe in a external side of a rocket and after the building you place a block next to the rocket, it can rises to the level of the new blocks (depending on the side you place the new block). Also depending on where you place the structure pipe it can rises just after the building without new blocks.  ![2016-06-08_12 52 47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19404111/15892634/0b2a5832-2d7b-11e6-9220-11c7d5081f5e.png)  Edit: It also happens with other buildcraft blocks like the refinery, or external mods, like Carpenter´s blocks, ArchitectureCraft, Galacticraft, IC2 or Mekanism. 
Only when i'm morphed I can't break them at all, expect for the force wrench... when unmorphed anything breaks them 
I'm implementing actions for Ashley. I want to keep the possibility and syntax of adding parallel events to entities just like its done with gdx actor events where you can write things like  actor.addAction(action1); actor.addaction(action2);  and they will work together as parallel actions.  In my implementation there's one ActionComponent and one AcionSystem. You can add an action to an entity with this kind of syntax  Actions.moveTo(entity, x, y, duration);  The static method adds the logic to the ActionComponent, but before doing it, it checks if the entity already has the ActionComponent and ads one if it hasn't. So turns out if I add 2 actions to an entity in a row, the second one won't know that the previous one already scheduled the ActionComponent creation and instead of adding only logic to the scheduled component, it will schedule a new component creation and overwrite previous one.  
I'm on Nougat.
 
I do have Biomes O' Plenty (the large mushrooms in the backround didn't give that away?), but the biome around the Nether portal is "Hell": ![2018-04-28_07 37 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8942955/39397665-0f5f0a54-4ab8-11e8-9ad1-b135f5303126.png) I turned off spawning, and there is a Dynamic Surroundings dust storm going on in that screenshot.  Biomes O Plenty uses a "wrapped" version of the Hell biome, but as far as I can tell, it doesn't change the biome dictionary registration.  If you look at https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.12.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/common/BiomeDictionary.java#L417 you can see that Forge registers the biome as Hot, Dry, and Nether.  Looking at your code, it seems there are a few species that spawn in "dry" biomes:   Also, I can think of a couple of dimensions added by mods that players might want to blacklist Animania animals from spawning in even though the biomes there are otherwise favorable for them: Mining World (from Aroma1997s Dimensional Worlds) and Twilight Forest.  Galacticraft dimensions would definitely be a bad place for Animania animals to automatically spawn in, but they are registered in a way that would make this possible once grass was imported - e.g. the moon is Cold, Dry, and Dead; Mars is Cold, Dry, Dead, and Sandy; Venus flat biome is Hot, Dry, Dead, and Sandy.

Exactly, I guess the application is still running in the background in some way. Going to application manager in Android and chosing "Force stop" and then launching it again solves the problem 
I'm running android 4.3 at the moment with Glide v3.3.1. Glide line is vanilla as it gets.   
The user reported back saying this was the problem. According to [Gnome Keyring documentation](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring/KeyringIntro) "login" is the default keyring and it seems like this one was not present on the system.  Still, rather than crashing Cryptomator should just not offer this feature then.
Just tried that, can't get it to work, even with a brand new world and a brand new minecraft install. I'm running the latest version of forge (2299) and cyclopscore 0.10.3, commoncapabilites 1.3.2. Is there a dependency I need to update or something?

@kalessil Thanks a lot for fixing! Sorry, didn't see your question before. To answer it: This class inherits from a library class as parent and we need to overwrite that protected property here (it's intended usage... kind of crappy, but yep).

In India common plans start from 1GB per month and aren't that expensive.  As I said earlier WiFi coverage is limited to a small proportion of users.  And I have observed that if we upload data after scanning is complete instead of sending after specific interval then data use is less.

Yes, using a spawn egg on the spawner resulted in the same thing.  The spawner spawns one creature then reverts to the original spawn setting.

Since there most likely won't be visitors on kafdrop and in our case it is not even connected to the internet I guess no. But in general if you run a website and you use the link then you cannot guarantee that Google is not collecting visitors data and therefor you have to embed the fonts, so yes.

Hmm, I missed the `@JsonProperty` annotations last time I checked the generated code. I think I expected them on the method parameter, rather than the method itself. Or maybe I was just tired.  So... it seems to me that indeed, just adding `@JsonIgnore` is enough! I've filed a PR, in which we can discuss the implementation details: #466. With this PR, all of the above tests pass. 
@dsyer - spring-boot with tomcat works well. I've been using it for a couple weeks now  @snicoll - I haven't tried vanilla/standalone jetty. I do regularly use the maven jetty plugin and the gradle jetty plugin though.  I'm willing to dig into this more, though it might be a few days.

No, it doesn't. Middle layer is Volley with explicit zero numbers of retries set for each request. Top application layer doesn't do retries as well without user's consent. I'm still investigating issue - for now I can only stable reproduce the retry in a "controlled environment" with mocked server, where I see fall backs to SSLv3 for second call invocation. The behavior makes sense from one point of view - it's reasonable to try another transport if first one fails, but not in case when the server is actually busy processing first request and the call changes a state on backend (i.e. it's not a GET request). 
Thank you for the feedback/tip.  I prefer to leave resetting the workspace as a last resort. I first tried closing and restarting DBeaver; this seems to restore normal functionality. I closed and restarted DBeaver again to make sure it was not a fluke; it still works correctly again. This surprises me a little, as I had certainly already closed and restarted DBeaver once after the last update (today, from 4.3.0 to 4.3.1, both Community Edition 64 bit installer with JRE).  For completeness sake: my OS is Win10 Pro 64-bit (fully upgraded/updated as of 2018-01-02).

Hi @ndeloof, Plugins are in place, they were downloaded in previous restart. Sorry, I attached little part of log. This is the complete log: 
Thank you for the workaround @TatuLund, it works. I'd just expect a simpler way to get the layout chain, maybe not through the `RouteRegistry` but in the navigation events. Something like:

@serge-rider , Oracle 
I mean once you have configured the start.bat/sh to have jetty running on a different port.  If you try any port other than 80, the proxy works, on 80 it does not. All the rest of the openhab system are working fine. (e.g. GreenT UI & atmosphere) Just the images/videos are missing. I assume somewhere in the code the number 80 is removed as it is the default port, but the proxy expects a number, and returns "-1"   It worked on 1.4.0 about a month ago which was my last merge. 
The following reproduces what I'm seeing:   
Updated issue as found the real cause (Assistants able to demote mayor, and then subsequently kick) 
What doc said.  Chunks were loaded. 
I have no idea - but I can also ot reproduce it after deleting the database ans start from scratch. Feel free to close from my perspective
Here's a logcat from when I launched the application.  http://pastebin.com/0zvWx7pU  I tried launching the app without having an internet connection, and it crashes instantly. That should be much easier to reproduce. 
@gashcrumb that's right the sample should use a Google Sheets connector or an API provider where the finish connection is able to use some collection shape 
@leoek  Absolutely. As you can see from https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/blob/fec925dcc83aeba9fe25e3658644d55cb1fe5629/windows/ReactNativePSPDFKit/ReactNativePSPDFKit/PSPDFKitViewManager.cs#L63-L105 we were creating a css file that can be passed to the PSPDFKit for Windows framework. This file would subsequently be passed to a `Webview` which drives the PSPDFKit for Windows framework. But because of file limitations within UWP, you cannot simply pass a file from a local path to the `WebView` to `fetch`, it has to be a file within the web context which is what https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-resources/uri-schemes#ms-appx-and-ms-appx-web explains. The issue here is that the files accessible from the web context is only from the install folder. In production mode, it is not possible to write or move into the install folder for security reasons (which is understandable). This is why previously it was working when debugging but not when deploying.  I hope this is understandable and just ask if you need any other clarification. 
**Updating Forge Did Resolve the Issue**
Hi @gunnarmorling,  I just checked with latest snapshot and indeed it seems to work OK, both in my reproducer test case and in our "real" code.  Do you have any idea when we can expect a release with this fix?  Thanks a bunch! 
I'll upload video in next 24h. Paper 332 is 1.14.4.
yes the different cases I tested are working. You can even access the generated logger without any troubles. Apparently, only java8 or streaming API have issues 
That's strange. The blocks beneath me in this case are dark oak logs.  
1. No Sponge. 2. Placed Gearboxes (call them A) 3. Added Sponge  4. Placed Gearboxes (call them B)  Gearboxes A working fine. Gearboxes B not working (you can rotate them but they arent passing power).
Yeah, maybe gui.json is corrupted. Here is: [gui.zip](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/files/1550046/gui.zip) 
* It happens on Samsung Galaxy S7 and S8.  * Yes, it happens every time.  I have to check logcat. I'll write you again.
I tried to refresh whole workspace, but it did not help and double-checked that all projects exist. Unfortunately there is nothing in the Eclipse error log (checked both view and log file on disk). If you do not have any clue what the problem is, I could try to compile and debug the plugin from sources. 
@mattrjacobs yeah, just fired a build... I'l report in like half a hour... 
Yeah. it was in the latest version of the plugin. Revert back to 1.5.03

Hi @laa ,  Here's the data file as requested along with additional info.     [hs_err_pid1714.txt](https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/files/283573/hs_err_pid1714.txt) Just FYI , i have the " develop " branch too and it fails too 
What I can tell you is that issue #321 seems to be fixed and we are not having any crashes related to the screenshot feature. This issue can now be closed. 
Hi , Ok ,so I have developed a simple application with glassfish 3.1.2 and I have used its library of  Mojarra 2.1.6 Which implements JSF 2.1 .  For web page I have created once with PrimeFaces 5.1 and ViewScoped ManagedBean to control the view. the page contains two elements :  1. **p:commandeButton** : that implement a simple  function It is a matter of incrementing a variable type Integer for each click on the button (i++) 2. **p:outputLabel** to display the value incremented after click When I finished reading this link: **http://mjremijan.blogspot.com/2017/04/high-availability-ha-session-replicated.html**  I have created successfully the cluster withe two instances in different machines and the replication between instances worked well if I deploy a simple page .jsp (I have the same ID session) but if I deploy the jsf application (Which I have just mention on top) to test the High Availability after launching firstly the first link :  http://instance-1:280280/myapplication  and secondly the second link :  http://instance-2:282281/myapplication on two tabs Navigator The scenario is as follows: so if I click on the button in the second link the value is incremented and is displayed on the page but if I click on the button in the first link no change occurs and in the log file I have this error : javax.faces.application.viewexpiredexception viewid=/Page.xhtml could not be restored.  Now I refresh the  first link and I click on the button the value is incremented and is displayed on the page but if I click on the button in the second link no change occurs and in the log file I have the same error : javax.faces.application.viewexpiredexception viewid=/Page.xhtml could not be restored and **Reciprocally** if I refresh the second like I have the same Scenario   so  If you want more explanations you ask me thanks. 
I have also tried it on a resource and the whitespace is still stripped.  I'm including my enunciate.xml in case there's some difference in how we configure it that causes this.   
I think it does not pay off, since parsing will probably not be Sulong's bottleneck with the new parser. 
I was actually trying to register Lead with a custom trait that isn't "Poisonous"  I was just surprised when the check I have against double-registration in my code wasn't triggering and I was seeing an error. Just seems to me that this is a race condition of sorts...

No problem, here's what the `&default_response` anchor looks like    Let me know if you need anything more
Thanks for the fix, update it on our side and set it to autoupdate. Basically that means as long as you don't make fundamental changes to project structure and keep tagging versions in the same scheme, everything should be fine.  We use a straightforward text file for the build instructions, e.g. see https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/HEAD/metadata/de.guerda.matekarte.txt , so just fork the repo, apply your changes, commit them and open a merge request.  Our server part at https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/ has some python script that help to check the syntax, look for updates, build the app and provide standard commit messages. If you don't want to use these tools, this is fine, too. Just keep two things in mind if you do it by hand: First, use `git pull --rebase` to pull in changes from our master. That helps to keep our repo clean from "merge branch" messages. And second, prefix your commit message with the app name (like "Matekarte: Changed description.") That way we don't have to lookup the actually changed app/files. 
Yes they work fine. I will try again when I get home from work and let you know.  > On Sep 21, 2013, at 9:43 PM, "DSH105" notifications@github.com wrote: >  > Strange. It works for me. Do they work in the "games" world? >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub. 
Yes, i was able to do it as i mentioned in the issue both for Github as for internal Gitlab Repos 
If i find something else i am  going to tell you. Thanks for the quick fix :3 Edit: i was running the latest on curse. I should have told you. But then again i should have told that i did check your "Latest" source code and made my guess based of that.
I'm running latest stock Android 6.0.1 (april patch) on a N5X   I've never rooted it so I have never enabled run as root. My config syncs all user's folders excluding "/Android".  I am sure when I installed syncthing (3 or 4 app updates ago AND on Android 6.0.1) I was able to edit stignore (it is when I excluded "/Android" folder). 
i don't call ResponseBody.close() ,is this reason ? 
See #66  
Just want to note here that the email address also appears on the Support page. So it will need to be updated in two places. 
It shouldn't have.   We had no issues before I updated towny and the rest of towny changes get saved.  It's all the same database, just different tables.  The issue also occurs on both our test and public servers, which have completely separate MySql.  I can try wiping the towny tables on my test server and reverting towny to my old version there and make sure the problem doesn't exist.   (I can't revert with the data I have as towny really doesn't like it.)

As i see you already support something related to OMX.MTK codec in your workaround. Or you talking about some other workaround? Will provide you with device info tomorrow. 
Yes it works with an empty list. I updated to Syncthing 0.14 and this problem is still there. Its an Samsung GT-S7710 on Android 4.1.2 
@jmatsushita it is working now!
The second | 1 | 2 | is gray (surplus). When I print the List<Map<String, String>> I made it looks like: [a1b2, {b=2, a=1}] When I print table.hashes it looks like: a1b2  Could it be a JRuby RubyArray vs. Java ArrayList problem?  Will try to investigate, at least on the cuke4duke side. The ruby code in cucumber is a bit hardcore for me as a ruby novice 
@sharajava  now fix it like this  public class MySQLUpdateRecognizer extends BaseRecognizer implements SQLUpdateRecognizer { 	... 	//fix before ------------------- 	@Override     public String getWhereCondition() {         SQLExpr where = ast.getWhere();         if (where == null) {             return "";         }         StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();         MySqlOutputVisitor visitor = new MySqlOutputVisitor(sb);         visitor.visit((SQLBinaryOpExpr) where);         return sb.toString();     }  	//fix after -------------------- 	@Override     public String getWhereCondition() {         SQLExpr where = ast.getWhere();         if (where == null) {             return "";         }         StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();         MySqlOutputVisitor visitor = new MySqlOutputVisitor(sb);         if(where instanceof SQLBetweenExpr){             visitor.visit((SQLBetweenExpr) where);         }else if(where instanceof SQLInListExpr){             visitor.visit((SQLInListExpr) where);         }else{             visitor.visit((SQLBinaryOpExpr) where);         }         return sb.toString();     } 	... }  but MySqlOutputVisitor have too many methods named visit,  it can works but not a good plan may be know druid then fix it at all 
But the point is not only that we do or do not do the check ... What bothers me and the student here is that the warning message regarding the name of the module and the program extension makes no sense, and that we should not see any Maude errors.  Maybe all these are related in some way, but our users do not know that.

Ok, I tried to open 3 other text.exore files and got the same error (stacktrace below). It seems to be a cycle in the TextEcoreResource.getEObject(TextEcoreResource.java:467) method that never terminates.

Hi benas,  Can you help me with the maven url of the snapshot repository? 
Ok, the bug seem to be Chrome specific: firefox version40.0.3 = ok ie version11.0.96 = ok chrome  Version 48.0.2564.82 (latest) = bug!  I've also attached the xml.  It's really in editing mode that the bug occur because in the view, the date is ok  MartinO  [test_date_xml.txt](https://github.com/geonetwork/core-geonetwork/files/106687/test_date_xml.txt) 
In IE11, data for ShowView is still cached (see the original scenario for ShowView) 
At GapiTestBase.java L105: String fileName = snippetFileName.split("\.")[0].split("/")[1];  This assumes the snippetFileName contains a "/" char. (e.g. testdata/snippet.snip) I don't feel this assumption is correct since it will cause an out-of-bound exception if the file name does not follow this pattern (e.g. snippet.snip).

Now it's working fine but  gvr opacityanigallery app crashed 
as you can see from the dynmap, half the map isn't generated yet, so i'll fly over that way and see if i can find any gaps.
No, System.gc() is only a hint. Also with Java 7 and its concurrent GC, I doubt that this method would ever block.  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#gc%28%29  There are a couple of suggestions (aka Hacks) around, but basically you can never really estimate sufficiently enough how much main memory is left. I would rather suggest to take a percentage of overall memory instead of free memory. You could also make that percentage configurable. (I know that you can already configure the absolute number, however these errors occur mainly on CI VMs and I have not figured out how much RAM they have and even if they have the same amount at all). 
@eivantsov it was a firewall problem. I added some exceptions about docker in my firewall rules, and I now able to run the command but now, I have this error about postgres     
You're welcome.  Sorry for the dep resolution problem, I have fixed it, you can pull. If having further problems or a fix which I should test, please call.....  Cheers Markus

https://www.genuitec.com/products/webclipse/learning-center/javascript-debugger/ - it is separate feature, but it's going to be integral part of JSjet (documentation is merged already). However, first I need to get JS Debugger installable into Nodeclipse. Right now, at least JSjet can be used with Nodeclipse :)

Oh my goodness I'm sorry! I forgot to add that. I'm using Stoneblock 2, Version: 1.0.1.  Also thank you!
@jbq Yes found same thing as you when reading the timestamp.proto file, and if I generate a Java Class from .proto file I don't have same behaviour, I really have TimestampProto.Timestamp.  @garethahealy  Ok I pushed some code to github to reproduce the issue at [https://github.com/panes/dozer-protobuf ](url)  I did 2 correct cases:  - **DateConverterUsingXmlTest.java**, one with dozer mapping using xml file, defining one custom converter: **SUCCESS**  - **DateConverterUsingSpringAPITest.java**, second with dozer mapping using API with Spring injection, defining one custom converter: **SUCCESS**  I did 2 wrong cases:  - **WrongDateConverterUsingXmlTest.java**, one with dozer mapping using xml file, defining one custom converter and one mapping: **FAIL**  - **WrongDateConverterUsingSpringAPITest.java**, second with dozer mapping using API with Spring injection, defining one custom converter and one mapping: **FAIL**   May be I'm using badly dozer, and you can explain me how to do it in a good way, I want to define a custom converter from com.google.protobuf.Timestamp to java.util.LocalDate, this step is working, and use this converter automatically each time I define a mapping from class A with a Timestamp field to a class B with a LocalDate field. When I try to define a dozer mapping with such setup I got the issue about ClassNotFoundException. Let me know if you need more details, or if I should do things differently.  Thanks. 
@rhuss maybe we should containerize the syndesis client tool? I want to avoid new users to check out the source code from github to be able to install it.
@salaboy See the change in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/pull/58. It does not increase resource quotas. The problem is that without persistent volume, all Rabbitmq data is stored in the temporary volume, When Rabbitmq is restarted or rescheduled the data gets deleted, so all queued messages get lost..
I will take a look at this today.

Hi @maggiolo00   No, it's there:   
@tchiotludo we tried this out, upon first access of kafkahq instance nothing happens. It seems to hang indefinitely, nothing in the logs either.
It had the milestone set, therefore I added it here without looking at the content. 
Exactly, if I disable DiskSpaceMetrics (and only this one) the errors goes away. Currently I get the following message in Dynatrace: > Your custom metrics quota of 100 metrics has been reached.   I'm not sure if this quota is per day or in general, I haven't quite figured out yet how to make Micrometer visible in Dynatrace.
I dont know how to mess with Sampler but there just a recipe selected only 3 of them laggin the server 
I have implemented the plugin in my server, and i have these problems, the people can go through blocks. There is no damage from falls when you're riding your pet. Finally, if you die, the pet appears again next to you. I like this plugin, but users have told me this. Thanks for working on this project! 
№1 directives aren't formated №2 no auto complite №3 inside directives nothing works, no parsing, no compiler check (like its comment) :) 
@iocanel I played with this a bit yesterday and it doesn't seem like an easy fix, due to all the mutability inside Dekorate. My current assignment is to find bugs, not fix them, so if you could take this, that would be great :-)
Verified in master branch. 
> Can you please send a PR with your fix?  Sure. I will submit a PR as soon as possible
In my eyes _modifying_ CTEs should definitely be added to the modifying statements counter. Otherwise the users might assume that they could safely commit or rollback without side effects after running such a statement. This is dangerous.
Still happening with 3.5.4 
Hi Dave, It does not solve the problem of `getResourceAsStream` which returns `null` while `getResource` returns an URL.  You can easily reproduce it: by adding a folder (let say `file:///C:/config`) in the loader path. If this folder contains files in subfolder like `C:/config/original/myfile.txt`, and you are trying to access it by calling: `MyClass.class.getResourceAsStream("/original/myfile.txt")`, you will get a `null` while calling `getResource("/original/myfile.txt")` is returning an URL.  Finally, I don't think the first "/" is the issue (it is more unusual to use `file:///` comparing to standard classpath usage). The major issue is more related to the fact that classpath entries that are added by using the loader.path mechanism are NOT added recursively ... (see source code below)    Changing the recursive flag from false to true seems to solve the problem.  By the way application loading time is becoming very long (if they are plenty of files to load). Why do you need to perform that scan and fill your map with all the found files? Is that not possible to use directly the `URLClassLoader` standard mechanism by using the `addURL` methods? (I mean for resources ... I understand that for classes you need to intercept it... ;-)).  Thanks for your support. 
No luck. Better exception though  Release build with 8.6.0 results in this on the emulator:    Windows based emulator in case that varies: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17216760/71899836-7baa6580-3154-11ea-9b12-ca4df27d8c4a.png)  Again if I build restricting to  `ndk { abiFilters "x86" }` it works. The \lib\x86 folder appears to have the same .so-s (at least by file size) 
Oh yes, it's linked the Configuration changing after the prompt is displayed, but I don't change the configuration. Please find the stack trace below

That's tough, because I have the admin project running for quite a long time, and it was the first time ever that this occurred. So I also cannot reproduce this error at will unfortunately.  I'm running `spring-boot-admin-2.1.4` and `tomcat-9.0.10`  The project is as simple as:   Yet I'm not sure if this might be a reactor/spring issue rather than spring-boot-admin?

Oh sorry.. sure it's projectcube.eu. We found another bug, sometimes when a player joins the server they got a full inventory of the gadgetselector and they cant remove the other selectors. I have to clear their inventory to fix this. Sorry for reporting this much :c  
Looks good to me!
Sorry @lfoppiano for my late reply, just checked your fix and it works now as expected. Thank you!  I used master @ 593c3b8525f5ee013de527ff74142ab5eb7ceeb6, 3 commits after your specific commit.
Hi,  I don't think I will be able to share the file. The file size is huge and it's a consolidated AWS billing csv (21G).  All I am doing is uploading that file into the elasticsearch which runs on AWS (m5x.large) instance. I am using Indexing as sample-*, mapping as default ( just to test) and row as 3, then upload the file.  The actual process goes for some time (approx 4 hours) to upload the content to the elasticsearch. As soon as it reaches 60 to 70 % I get this error. Any solution to overcome this is of great help.  I am using the latest jar 1.3.1 with basic HTTP configuration on elasticsearch.
I've uninstalled and reinstallad but I have the same iusse.

@RetGal I made a new issue for the refactor: #392
Sorry for late reply 1. its OK that the Slots are not Item Specific but for Farm Automation with AE2 or this mod i like to set the slots to a Specific item like the Hoe or a Axe to auto pipe new Tools into the Slots so that not two Tools of the Same type can be in the Farm. 2. Consume Stacks means that in the Left set of Slots 1 Item not Planted to create a Placeholder for this Plant... 3. Your Farm current Pickup all Plants and stores them first in the Left set Slots for Planting so the Farm fills itself with the Farmed Potato's or Carrots. Thats OK but the Farm can only Export from the Right set of Slots. I think that the Handling of the Pickup needs a configuration (Ingame/Configfile) to make the Default Location for of Harvested Plants the Right or the Left set of Slots...  MfG PpVolto 
I'm not sure what you mean. Just opening newpipe leads me to a captcha and crashes it, probably fetching the "Hottest" videos (which is always youtube-curated trash i never watch and could do whitout entirely)

I am using the gradle plugin, it doesn't fail. :/  Maybe it is a problem in ddmlib, see this issue:  https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79396  and this one: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=79396 
@olgakup somehow I missed the first comment (sorry!)  Yeah you finally changed what I was referring to (so +100 to you!). For the Number of Pending Txs history event I remember we said that we're not going to implement it (at least yet) mostly because when we are syncing the number is always 0. In any case it should be a live event and instead of showcasing a graph just only a number (but I suggest to move this to M2).
The issue is still present in my environment. I am not sure why the reproducer issue is not failing. Perhaps the difference is that my `@SecondaryTable` is in the midst of a class hierarchy (A > B (with SecondaryTable) > C). I have a patch that works locally (it actually is the patch already suggested in my initial bug report) and will submit a PR.
cytosacpe 3.2.1. I know they have done a lot of work on the deleted node/edge between 3.2 and 3.3 but likely people will be using 3.2 for a while yet.   
That sounds like a great suggestion, wasn't aware of that hook in the statement builder. One thing I'm not sure about is DbMigrate appears to always wrap beforeMigrate in a TransactionTemplate. Unless that were changed to follow the same transaction detection, likely wouldn't fix this particular case.  Somewhat related, the transaction treatment of beforeMigrate vs e.g. beforeEachMigrate is different (this is understandable based on their scope, but initially unexpected). I think your suggestion would work as-is for beforeEachMigrate because it is called within the doMigrateGroup() method.

Yes, thats it. But only the content is listed if you try to open a file it asks for a password. But the first access via activity tab lists table of content without password.

[Simple Java Mail](https://github.com/bbottema/simple-java-mail) salutes you; it works. I'll see what I can do about that junit test.  Providing the code I used for this is a little problematic. I'm translating from a Java builder API to an intermediate model which is then translated to a picocli command structure. I'll see if I can provide a simple demo.
while waiting for the reply i had done some testing and indeed moving them 1 more block away from eachother fixes that problem, so i guess that means the problem has been solved  thanks for taking the time to read and help
What crazypants? I do not know a mod or similiar called crazypants.

I simply wanted to get started experimenting with JanusGraph and felt like following the building instructed commands should work. While I may eventually want to use jars they are not my priority now. I just wanted to step through the docs, get the basic JanusGraph server working (probably with inmemory backend I suppose) and start to make some simple experiments with Gremlin etc to build a trivial graph database.
I used simple SELECT query like: `SELECT GEOM_COLUMN FROM TEST_TABLE;` And result is: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62873/75966519-c7665a80-5eca-11ea-96e7-261b0c135270.png)  BUT it works different on new tables.

@dsyer I see this error when I use Boot 1.5.3.RELEASE.  I am using PCF 1.9, SCS 1.3.4 with Spring Boot 1.5.3.RELEASE. If you update the pom from the above sample project to 1.5.3.RELEASE and push to a CF env with a config-server bound, you could see this error.
@dakrone Thanks for working on this bug. I am using ES 1.4.4 on Ubuntu 14.04 using the official ES deb package.  Here is the config file with which I can reproduce the problem : https://gist.github.com/setaou/7a65a242251f897aab35 .  After testing on a vanilla install with this config file and a very simple index (the example at https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch#indexing), I discovered that the problem seems to affect more than just translogs. Here is the listing of files after the indexing: https://gist.github.com/setaou/7ca4f2b8abdcae55b8de . I suppose this did not appear on my previous setup because /data/ partitions had a lot more free space than /var/lib, so segments were only stored on /data/. 
all streams are affected. Only this happening with MI tv with pie edition. There is no effect on playback but that view AspectRatioFrameLayout resize modes are not working at all.
Thanks for having a look. So the seed has nothing to do here (and yes I change it for every training), when I said "between run" I meant between epochs = a play until reset() state. And even with the changed configuration the actions taken by the net are very similar from one epoch to another. It could make sense after many epochs, but it doesn't in the beginning as we can expect A3C to randomly discover patterns, except here for example the first few actions have never been changed, even after 10k+ iterations.  So the first few epoch action sequences taken are: 10100110111110011 1010011011111001101 1010011011111001 ... and after 11k iterations: 1010011011101000100010100110111010011...0110111010011010 1010011011101000100010100100111010011...000111010011010 1010011010101001100010100110101010011...110101010011000  Notice how the first **9 actions ('101001101') have not changed a single time during all training**? Gut feeling tells me there's something wrong, either in the gym (the initial state is always the same so no need to change the initial pattern) or in the action discovery.  Otherwise with the tuning changes you suggested the NN now learns correctly:  <img width="1216" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 11 18 13 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11771531/32932092-0e17004c-cb89-11e7-90ab-50def942e94a.png">

Sure, source attached, it's your example changed, in file MinimalDraggableExampleActivity.java I added simple GridView. Few things can be noticed in "Draggable (minimal)" example:  - when activity appears we shortly see scroll bars next to each grid view (maybe because of fixed list item height) - that not too much important :) - when dragging list element grid view disappears and appears when list element is dropped  [src.zip](https://github.com/h6ah4i/android-advancedrecyclerview/files/578381/src.zip) 
Hi. I've got /usr/share/doc. I'm logged as an standard user, but the Mint Package Installer asks me for my root password, just like any other installation I've done before. When I open the .deb file, the Package Installer starts by default. Is there any other way of installing the package? Thanks.
Yes, I have granted contacts permission via Android 6 Permission Menu under Settings. It did not work. Then I checked that CM's Privacy settings are off, they were turned off when looking at them. (GMSCore, GSFProxy, Google Play Store --> shield disabled). 
Exactly, I was referring to that. From what I saw, currently the algorithm that BootsFaces uses is just to concatenate `alert-` plus **user-provided-string**. That allows the user to easily customize, but it should be documented I think.  I can do a PR for that.
@eivantsov  Please find my response inline  1. Any chances you upgrade to Origin 1.6? We have been running che 5.20 on origin 1.5 for couple of months & upgrade to origin 1.6 would require considerable effort, I would consider upgrade if we manage to nail down the issue to origin 1.5 with kubernetes 1.5.  2. Do you use a custom recipe to launch a workspace? If so, which one? I'm not using any custom recipe to launch a workspace, I'm using java-default stack & console-java-simple project.  3. "CHE_INFRA_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT" should be set to eclipse-che or whatever namespace you used for Che server deployment I've set CHE_INFRA_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT to the same namespace that che-server is being launched.  The reason why workspaces were being launched in a new namespace boils down to the issue https://github.com/eclipse/che/pull/8795  To overcome this I set CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE, which matches the value of CHE_INFRA_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT.  Now, the workspace pod starts in the same namespace as che-server, however it throws the following error message "Message: Route in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Route: no kind "Route" is registered for version "route.openshift.io/v1". Received status: Status(apiVersion=v1, code=400, details=null, kind=Status, message=Route in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Route: no kind "Route" is registered for version "route.openshift.io/v1", metadata=ListMeta(resourceVersion=null, selfLink=null, additionalProperties={}), reason=BadRequest, status=Failure, additionalProperties={})."  I tried to diagnose the issue, the following are my findings.  ## 1 I've set DEFAULT_CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_STRATEGY="unique" & dynamic provisioning is enabled using storage class as below  kind: StorageClass apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata:   name: gp2 provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs parameters:   type: gp2  $oc patch storageclass gp2 -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'  $oc get storageclass NAME      TYPE gp2           kubernetes.io/aws-ebs  $ oc describe storageclass Name:		        gp2 IsDefaultClass:	No Annotations:	        storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true Provisioner:	        kubernetes.io/aws-ebs Parameters:	        type=gp2  The following happens when launching workspace, The workspace requests for 2 pvc's each of which are 10Gi size, I believe this is picked up from default che.env  I've not created any pv since dynamic provisioning needs to launch 2 aws-ebs volumes & made available for workspace pod. I see that the dynamic provision isnt triggered & the claim requests are running forever. In the background che reports the above error on Dashboard & Che Server Logs.  I made the following changes to che-openshift.yaml for PVC  - apiVersion: v1   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim   metadata:     labels:       app: che     name: che-data-volume     annotations:        volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: gp2   spec:     accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce     resources:       requests:         storage: 1Gi - apiVersion: v1   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim   metadata:     labels:       app: che     name: claim-che-workspace     annotations:        volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: gp2   spec:     accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce     resources:       requests:         storage: 1Gi  Che-server deployment goes through fine, dynamic provisioning gets triggered and things work as expected. Workspace starts fail with error message mentioned above On debugging more into pvc claim request during workspace launch, I see an error stating no default storage class found, though storageclass default is set to true.  So I plan to create another storageclass which is cluster-wide default using the below script.  kind: StorageClass apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 metadata:   name: generic   annotations:     storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true" provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs parameters:   type: gp2  ## 2 I tried the option of using common volume for all workspaces.  I've set DEFAULT_CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_STRATEGY="common", so that workspace uses the claim-che-workspace pvc already provisioned as part of che-server deployment.  In this mode as well it throws "Message: Route in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Route: no kind "Route" is registered for version "route.openshift.io/v1". Received status: Status(apiVersion=v1, code=400, details=null, kind=Status, message=Route in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Route: no kind "Route" is registered for version "route.openshift.io/v1", metadata=ListMeta(resourceVersion=null, selfLink=null, additionalProperties={}), reason=BadRequest, status=Failure, additionalProperties={})."     
1. That's fine for me. I don't care about renames. The only thing I care about is that when something has changed in git, it reports in svn as changed as well. The underlying reason is that I use git-as-svn as a shim for a system that has no git support built-in (we came from svn). I actually don't even need the full history, just the *x* number of revisions. I don’t even need all files in the history, just certain types.  4. I will come back to you on that.  New thread dump, now almost 99% CPU consumption at rev 6561.

That's the question that needs answering. Would the URL resource contain full path data so we could check that the regex `".*file:(.+\\.jar).*"` doesn't match the result?... except that wouldn't then work when running a Spring fat jar
@akarasulu the bug is related to this Hub issue  https://github.com/optdyn/hub/issues/3755
This can be reproduced without any feature store, database or data sets. The `wfs1.xml` can contain the following minimal configuration:    For the second test, the `wfs2.xml` can be simply a copy of `wfs1.xml`.

The idea sounds good. But what if the bore head is indicator for the size of the hole?  So there are 5x5 and 3x3 bore heads. But the actual problem that you can't go at the side of the tunnel bore with a 3x3 head would be the same. Also that you can't see what's ahead. So I think we need an redesign of the model. A little more curves at the head (I know it's not vanilla design style)

@cweitkamp  Yes, sure. The issue is not with the host definition - this is the Docker container external port; the issue is the internal side of the container where openhab / the bindings are running. Basically you need two parameters to be able to resolve this, the one for the host that indicates other external devices how to contact openhab and the internal for the binding that indicates the binding how to access the container internally. You may want to look at the most current version of the Homematic Binding; they had a similar issue and resolved it by adding the internal parameter and the behavior indicated in my resolution proposal.

Hello @tarzanek,  See my terminal output:   Thanks
I made [sample project](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/files/2562948/demo.zip).  `GET http://localhost:8080/headers` will return all request headers (proxied to `http://postman-echo.com/headers`). The `foo` header is blacklisted (via the `sensitive` property), and then set to the value `B` explicitly.  Expected behaviors:  * A request with header `foo: A` should be replied with `foo: B`. * If a request contains the header `foo`, it should not be passed on to the downstream service if `foo` is 'sensitive'. * Setting header `foo` explicitly using `.header(...)` should still be possible, even if it is considered 'sensitive'.  Actual behavior:  * A request with header `foo: A` should be replied with `foo: A`. * 'sensitive' headers are not censored from a request (documentation says it does). * Headers can not be manually overwritten when marked 'sensitive' (not documented and makes the library unusable in some use cases).

The `libudunits2.so.0` lib is located in `/usr/local/lib/`. I have no idea if this the standard location for this lib (was the folder suggested by the `udunits2` manual). Actually for some reasons (address not found by curl apparently), I was not able to install `udunits2` using my regular package manager.  Concerning my `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, here the list:  I did not know that RStudio would use another `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` than the one of my global env. Where should/could I modify that? Many thanks in advance.
Sorry about the delay but I plan to get around to doing it very soon. I'm currently evaluating the algorithm that creates optimized routes (given an area; to traverse every single road as efficiently as possible). I plan to finish it this week at the earliest and will fix this bug 
I believe I downloaded it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7 a while ago.  FWIW Windows declares its version as 6.1.7601 SP1 Build 7601.  Somewhat surprisingly, after rebooting this VM and trying to launch the latest daily build everything works. Given that the issue seems to have magically resolved itself I'll close this but let's keep our ears open in case we hear / see anything else from users running Windows 7.
Unfortunately, there is really no (visible) user action causing the trouble. Session mode is set to video only once before opening the camera. So this can't be the cause either. I only have my custom logs which do not provide further information. The only thing I can add is that there are usually at least 5 seconds between opening the camera and starting the video record. I'll take a deeper look into the code later on.
URLConnection works for local URIs as well as http URLs. Some institutional APIs return a PDF file instead of a link to a PDF. Generalising MimeTypeDetector eases writing custom fetchers a bit. 
Sorry, I've just seen your message. Thanks for the contribution 👍 I've just merged it into our develop branch and it will be released in version 0.7.0.

@xcaspar OK， honored to do.
With this fix, it works well :) 
I'll get onto it tomorrow when I find some minutes.  Another thing I just noticed about the templates are the hardcoded strings (e.g. "Back to Homepage"), which should probably be read from messages for localisation?! 
Yes when I checked the version in the command prompt it correctly says the version is 0.975.1

Hi. I use this card: https://www.taisys.com/p-detail?lang=&id=9bf9kZO3CJ682Mn-Uuesyonyz9d5ZdPycGwMJF2i3Q Basically, it supports all Java card 3.0.4 functions. Here is its algorithms test report: https://github.com/crocs-muni/JCAlgTest/blob/master/Profiles/results/Taisys_SIMoME_VAULT_ICFabDate_2016_ALGSUPPORT__3b_9f_95_80_3f_c7_a0_80_31_e0_73_fa_21_10_63_00_00_00_83_f0_90_00_bb_(provided_by_PetrS).csv
So that behavior would be leaving the file from time T2?  I don't think that is a possibility, because that file doesn't pass the filter(s) saying to only give us files that parsed.  I always viewed the behavior as 'give me all the code at time X, and then filter out anything not matching one of the filters.'
it looks fixed to me
Yes, I believe you are correct.  The schema (in the picture above) does not show all the properties because it is schemaless as the properties were created by the ETL process.  One fix could be to check existing schema (or data) and use the case of the imported data and not the case of the supplied "indexes" field.  Another fix could be to force schemaless properties to use the case of any indexes if indexes are already defined with the same name.  Finally, what would happen if you had a schema for your class and imported (via etl) some other data that had the same name but a different case than the property name -- I don't know that I exercised this but I would assume that it works by finding the correct property to shove the data into.  Either way, it's not a huge issue but it's still a bug that could cause someone to lose time (and hair).  ;)

Yeah that would probably be the best way to address it.

Hi Guys, Is there any alternative link for these tutorials? I am looking for something, where on spring rest API calls, I can run any process or task with data. Instead of too much conversion of data.
I wish I could, but it's proprietary code, and I can't share the data or the functions. I'll have to check if I can generate some fake data that and function calls, but that's going to be complicated.  Is there nothing that I could do with, e.g., sampling the process, which could show you where exactly the whole process “hangs”?
@KarlZeilhofer CvPipeline has a release method which calls release on any saved Mats. This frees up the memory used by the images that are stored as each stage processes. In general, it's not important to be called, because calling process() releases the previous data, but as @cri-s pointed out, since BottomVision uses a pipeline per part, it's possible this could use up a lot of memory during a job run. We need to change it to release after bottom vision is done. This is a pretty easy change, so I will probably do it right now :)
It doesn't appear to resolve the issue.  We modified to this:    Their clients still appear to be afflicted, where the other Android / IOS clients are still connected fine. Could it be related to ciphers? I've got both users attention for the day so I can modify the parameter set and test if you've got suggestions.
Updating the pack and server today, will report back if it is still happening.

Hi Holger, I have literally used the basic template provided with Tabris 1.0 for iOS and changed the URL to point to by OSGi Tabris server. No other changes. Should I need to DEinstall pre-release Tabris DMGs from the Mac first, or are they independent? Thanks, John 
I'll check when I got time
Reg dejavu: we had to do 0.5.1 just for osx, it was 0.5.0 with 1 (maybe 2) cherry picks.  If yosemite will be dropped in 3 months, we can also ignore 3% of homebrew users (unclear how many if any are using bazel) and publish homebrew recipe only for el capitan and further (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/15003#issuecomment-311401027)
Yes, but in the latest forge version you get 5 shield icons for botania armor pieces with +5 armor. And you are pretty much invincible with a full botania armor set of any kind.

Thank you Niels for the quick response. Let me rerun the code and validate once more. I will share complete example soon.

No, unfortunately I'm still seeing the same behavior in my Nexus 5.  It looks fine when previewing, but when I snap the photo, it quickly switches to a lower exposure and then saves the photo. This problem only seems to happen in relatively low light scenes.

Or we have to specify them in machines in some special way ?
Missing methods would be reported by the compiler. Here it was not explicitly missing, but inherited from `Object.toString()`, which does not print the file path but some string which was not useful.

@desperateCoder I've tried opening the web deck app, then also logging into and out of the web UI and re-opened the web deck app. The three dot menu is still missing in this one case. However, it does display correctly once there is a column in the board. It only seems to be missing when there is no columns yet. 
Gregory,  I agree it is a complex issue but also maybe a flaw in the TAP protocol: - if tap has started writing to the http response, it is FORBIDDEN by HTTP to change the HTTP Status, forward or redirect = HTTP_HEADER info ! - as you said, if the response is committed, then the TAP server can not modify the response (except close it but not reset it); of course, you should log such rare cases in the uws.log with stack traces !  Maybe you should bufferize the complete TAP response (formatter) in memory or into tmp files in order to let the response ready ...  Or explain that issue at the IVOA level to make a TAP enhancement ?  Laurent 
"Does the (real) test actually need to execute the real code of some methods, while others are mocked?" correct  "null is the default result for any method returning a reference type, so recording "result = null" for them is redundant. Or is there something I missed?" yeah, that's just for this test code - not null in the real code

I don´t know if it crash after clicking. When i click the blobsaver_setup.exe, the circle next to the cursor appears for maybe one second and thats it. Have also reinstall java to get sure i have the last version. Have tried a "normal double click", "right click as administrator" but always the same result. The circle next to the cursor appears for maybe one second and thats it. I am logged in with an administrator account so the question "Are you sure you want to run this program..." don´t appear. Version 2.2.1 i can install normal. But 2.2.2 and after not.
Still the same problem, just a failure somewhere else:  Example:    Using the ` 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` version.
Thanks for the quick reply. Unfortunately then it compiles to:    cutting off the rest of the string 
Yes, that's right, we initially discovered the issue in a setup with HAProxy, but we are able to reproduce it easily with just a standalone Jetty serving a static page and a remote browser (Chrome or Firefox).  For example accessing Jetty from a smartphone connected to the local WiFi.  As I explained in the mailing list, we can reproduce it also with JDK 1.8.0_72 and ALPN 8.1.7.v20160121.  I attach a log running Jetty with `--module=logging -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.http2.LEVEL=DEBUG`  The page load that fails (the second in the log I think) starts at 2016-02-29 19:20:13.985  In this case the visible symptoms were that page load halted while loading an image, and after many seconds page load finished leaving one of the images with the broken image icon in the display.

Sorry I forgot: CC  1.7.10-1.73 p++ 1.7.10-1.2.4  Yes, it does the full chatmsg via speaker output, then returns the error. 
@lbergelson - I didn't see any stack trace in the output. Here are examples from similar samples:  [gatk_debug_60k.txt](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/2046269/gatk_debug_60k.txt) - Runs properly [gatk_debug_70k.txt](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/2046270/gatk_debug_70k.txt) - Malformed output 
I just specified "EXPORT-FILE-NAME=myfile.txt" in properties expecting the file to be created in current directory where the script was running from in 2.4.1 (this was what I do usually). No export file folder. Finally I ended up using export file name as “output/myfile.txt” and it worked.  Yes, jumping to parent directory might not be required - we can test it.  Note: I was testing/using the new feature to stream individual source files from a local zip file and write a simple transform to insert them to a modules database and writing back status to export file. This works great, but I could have used an example (for each use case with loaders) text and use Cade. Needed to figure out by looking at source code and errors. I am now tempted to cleanup/make generic a transform that takes optional base directory (defaults to /), permissions (defaults to user default perm) and collections (defaults to no perm) as input and bundle with corb or at least provide a downloadable file. This can be used as a flash deploy tool for source modules. Or developers can modify as needed.
I've completed the changes for this, but I don't believe I have the right permissions to complete a pull request.   appears when I try to push to a new branch  There was only one file changed for the code, and three tests were removed that tested the escaping of square brackets (however, they are now special characters in terms of cucumber-expressions).  Is there a way for me to gain those permissions, or would you like me to just post the changes below?
I have tried the Command script and attempted to load a session, there are no errors. The bar just constantly says " loading request into browser.." etc.

Need to reopen this. Line width is now fixed, but the colors are not set correctly. Obstacle restricted area is not showing up green. All multipoints flagged with hostile, also render as black now. WIth RenderAsIcon set to true, correct colors are rendered. The problem is that the kml only produces a line color as ff000000  
Yes, it is.  I fixed the generated code manually by moving the default initialization before the _super call and the remaining explicit initialization after as before.  Thanks for this great project. It saved me huge amount of time and the results are impressive.
Thank you so much for your investigation and time you've spent, but unfortunately I messed everything up with service naming and led you to wrong assumptions.  `camel-producer` and `camel-consumer` are not using `camel-zipkin` lib, that lib is not covering my needs, so I decided to make lib myself (https://github.com/Playtika/sleuth-camel) hopeful after I get proper result we will publish it to maven central. Next step - to contribute to spring-cloud-sleuth project for 2.0 boot and brave support, my lib is targeting 1.5 boot which is my preference so far.  Anyway issue I posted is related to JSON's which I attached below, they seems to be correct and I see that Zipkin got them and parse them in proper way, but unfortunately not showing the desired result of lag, which I trying yo achieve. I'm not pointing that this is a bug, maybe it's by design, just wanted to have confirmation of that.
Did the same test with a fresh OVA (2.1 Alpha 2) using 3 AMQP Inputs from the same host and it is working with out issues.  Did the same test on my "default" hosts (OVA 2.1 Alpha 2 updated OVA from 2. GA) run into the issue that not more than 3 AMQP Inputs are working.   I guess that this is more a "local" and no global issue. 
All right, I'll let you know if it happens again since I don't know how to reproduce it myself. Thank you

Ok wireshark showed a lot of data at the beginning and then got throttled by "tcp window full" but kept sending packets of 65kB (local TCP connections allows big packets) every 3.5 seconds or so. Fits the ~140kbit/s quality of the music. At 60.015 seconds after response was sent I got a ClosedChannelException to the sendFile result handler. The data kept flowing though on wireshark. At 290.893 seconds the FIN flag was finally raised in a packet sent from the server and data flow stopped. Finally at 341.009 the buffer was empty in the music player and the client responded with FIN, completing the closure of the connection.  So I did a new test. I created a 120G sparse file using the command `truncate -s 120000000000 zero`. I'm testing on the same machine, so throughput is about 1GB/s so 120G is enough for >100 seconds, well above the 60 seconds idle timeout.  I then ran wget against the url serving that file, downloading at maximum speed all the time. Here's the result:    So the connection still breaks even when sending at full speed.  For reference, the documentation of `idleTimeout` is:  > Set the idle timeout, in seconds. zero means don't timeout. This determines if a connection will timeout and be closed if no data is received within the timeout.  If the Linux sendfile syscall is used to send the file (I didn't manage to find out), then it means that it's not actually possible to monitor whether there is activity on the socket or not in software since the operating system is transfering the whole file in a single call.  I don't know if the bug is in vertx or in netty but the idle timeout originated from netty. If either is indeed using syscalls for the transfer then I guess the idle timeout should be disabled for the time of the syscall..  So I wrote a workaround to use AsyncFile + pump instead -- speed dropped to 300MB/s but no more idle problems.. 
@chumer awesome! I think, both flags will be very useful!
I'll send the log if it happens again. 
Hi, I'm sorry for the delay but I cannot test this bug.  I only use TCP Trip Event after "Wifi Connection" and now WiFi Connection is never true. When I open "Edit Condition" for "WiFi Connection" I get the message "Waiting for WiFi scan result" and a pink spinner.  The waiting never finishes. This is with Easer 0.7.9.1. I have the message "Some skills do NOT have sufficient permissions" but "WiFi Connection" and "WiFi Enabled" both have green ticks next to a grey box.

It's Cyaonogenmod 10.1 on the old Nexus S from Samsung. But as said I don't think anything on the system side is responsible for that. It's only happening the very first time. Afterward the application successfully requests the gps fix.  
Interrogated users to get the info you needed.  Turned out someone used a hammer from TiC with a silk touch upgrade on it. harvested the area with the fuel rod. Maybe server timing sync fell out and tried to reassemble the multiblock without  the fuel rod? 
> Why did you put the pasword in Qoutes?  I couldn't setup admin access at once. I used this online service: https://bcrypt-generator.com. It generated a hash, but it didn't work. I thought, it was because of "special" symbols, like `$.`, that's why I put the password in quotes. Then I tried another online service: http://bcrypthashgenerator.apphb.com. It's hash worked. Finally, I forgot to remove them.  As soon as online generators are not reliable, and there is no way to access admin tools without having hashed password, would it be better: * to have some standalone util for generating hashes for passwords? * to let login to admin without a password (then you can generate hash using built-in tool)? * to skip passwords hashing, and let users encrypt their passwords using master key?  For me all this three "security" realted topics ("application secret"/"password hashing with `bcrypt`"/"master password for values") looked a little bit messy (or complex) when I read docs. Probably, it could be a subject for simplification or more clear explanation. 
@clintongormley Not yet, but I'll try to ascertain whether this is still happening by doing a ton of cluster restarts with and without the plugin. I'll reopen if I find this is still an issue. Thanks :) 
FYI this was the translation I did:  ![screenshot from 2016-12-08 21-45-00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4511254/21027090/9b964d50-bd8f-11e6-8b41-ff62e728e1cf.png)   What I had to do was to manually select the uploads folder so that it got a ending / and then it worked.  ![screenshot_20161208-214636](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4511254/21027156/e6fad9fa-bd8f-11e6-9099-c1f095735264.png)  
This is the mods and configuration i'm using if that makes it easier to locate: http://zlepper.dk/crash.zip 
no stage files at all  
I am using this code to show notification in main activity    I am not using any foreground service to show notification

sorry for that, I've updated the code accordingly. As I was doing it, I noted that the trace issue has to do with the `isHDragEnabled` and `isVDragEnabled` restrictioning. Because when I write `int dX = x; int dY = y;` instead no traces are caused. But I don't know the reason.

As I said its Ubuntu:  
Thank you for your response. In the server logs I can't see anything interesting, just a bunch of failed parsed messages:    The issue seems to appear in some days, usually is gets back to normal when the index is deflected. We have 30 indices with 20 mil entries each. 
Thanks for your response. Below is the sample project that I created. https://github.com/prafullp/bnd-issue.git
Yes i try. They keep teleporting. If a put the waypoint close, they teleport point to point 
My sample project is based on spring-boot 2.2.4.RELEASE and spring-cloud Hoxton.SR1  that is spring-cloud-starter-sleuth and spring-cloud-starter-gateway 2.2.1.RELEASE 
This appears to be a bug in querydsl-jpa-?.?.?-apt-hibernate-one-jar.jar since I removed all dependencies to it and added references to the following individual jars:  QueryDSL 3.2.3    and everything compiles correctly now 
I press "Add to home screen", get the dialog asking what to call the shortcut, press Add, and nothing happens.  I see the same with the chrome browser.  Neither work with either the stock Google Now launcher, or the KISS launcher.  Strangely, both browsers did make shortcuts ok before I started alternating between the launchers.  The phone's a Google/LG Nexus 5X if that makes any difference. Maybe I should close this issue and raise one with Google for android.
Hi Alex, I'm actually pretty sure that volumes doesn't do what I want since they are only available at runtime. What I want is some way of pulling artifacts out of the built VM at build time. It seems that docker cp would achieve this, but there is no binding for it. I'd be interested in adding this if you thought it was a good idea and could point me at where in the code it should sit 
Thanks for your quick answer, I will try to clarify the maximum of your requirements to to locate this issue and fix if finally it exist. We have only the next cookies at localhost (develop enviroment), the request sends: `Cookie:SESSION=9d1995b6-2831-4de4-a8c3-de41ef9ac970; JSESSIONID=76E7B5DD151E565C48B4CE398463FFCA` - _JSESSIONID_ has domain=localhost and  path="/context-root" - _SESSION_ has domain=localhost and path="/context-root/" (notice the end slash **/**)  The container is **Tomcat 6.0.36 (servlet 2.5)** The configuration is xml based as you suggest at #101: _web.xml_    _applicationContext-session.xml_ (class with @EnableRedisHttpSession) `<bean class="org.springframework.session.data.redis.config.annotation.web.http.RedisHttpSessionConfig"/>`  Finally the  _SessionRepositoryFilter_ has some changes to fix the #111: `currentSession = new HttpSessionWrapper(session, getServletContext());` changed to: `ServletContext context = super.getSession(true).getServletContext();`  `currentSession = new HttpSessionWrapper(session, context);` at lines near 193 and 202.

Where Can I see these logs? The only thing what I noticed after configuring template details here, that agent never comes online for fargate then i checked in aws which led me to conclusion that it never created a task definition.But for testing when I created task definition manually in aws for fargate & passed ARN of it rather specifying a template details, it spins up a fargate container agent in AWS. I'm just getting "pending—All nodes of label ‘Fargate-Slave’ are offline"
I'm using the arrows on my [seats plugin](https://github.com/Eufranio/OpenSeats/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/eufranio/openseats/SeatListeners.java#L91). I can use any entity for that, but arrows were known to be the `ridden entities` in the past, so I first tried with them.

I am using the openHAB binding, but it is adjusted to work with the latest ZSS master. However I have documented the solution of my problem here: https://github.com/openhab/org.openhab.binding.zigbee/issues/531  If everything would only be that easy :)  @cdjackson: So fortunately no real big issue with the latest master.

Open Eyes said it is Galacticraft Core fault. I post the issue there too. My guess is that at the beginning when the games load checking for updates open the Galacticraft Race menu and when you open the inventory at this time too to many events happen at one time.(only my guess)(tested with a large modpack)  http://openeye.openmods.info/crashes/1c3479f595ded84318521d272881415f  https://github.com/micdoodle8/Galacticraft/issues/1864 
I tried to narrow it down, I used it with a custom-made pack and on server.  Now, a clean setup: a forge server forge-1.12.1-14.22.1.2478-universal.jar  Mod:   "version": "4.0.15",   "mcversion": "1.12.1",  Behavior: It is impossible to teleport when on a horse. There is no cycling back and forth, so it may have been artifact from other mod.  Is the lack of possibility to teleport mounted intended behavior? If yes, this ticket can be closed.
After replacing the IC2 feeder with the admin feeder, the messages stopped.  I then went back to the IC2 feeder and the messages returned like before.  This happens even when the net retains a constant 20k charge.
Sorry I meant it happens around 10% or 20% of the times I upload a picture. I am on CyanogenMod 13.0 based on Android 6.0.1 on a Nexus 5. I will try to get a log.
@teolemon no, but i would like to get it if you tell me how.

Where are the log files?  Not sure I have any at this point.  I killed off the directory in Dropbox and then re-setup everything.  Now I don't have any issues with hundreds/thousands of zero-byte files.  So not sure where the problem lies - Dropbox or Syncany. 
It can be reproduced by using the zoom function in chrome, for our resolutions we have to bring it down to 50% or lower.  ![dfstrp7nscu_wf1ifujgrcc6hvd7tccieoket4vqog8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1372708/2865423/90e0489a-d21c-11e3-924e-0c35a402d605.png)

Hi - I attach two files - one for the Stream tab log and the other for the Alerts tab.  [Alert_Console_errors.txt](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/files/708103/Alert_Console_errors.txt) [Stream_Console_errors.txt](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/files/708104/Stream_Console_errors.txt)  There are no entries in the server.log at the time of accessing the site.  Thanks - hope this is the right data.  Rgds
Ok great, they render fine when on crop sticks. I don't know if this is caused by agricraft or rotarycraft or if I should submit it as another bug but when harvested the canola plants drop canola seed husks rather than canola seeds which are the item they are farmed for. 
Well this sounds more complex indeed and in the end is not error prone due to concurrency issues :(  I suppose locks would prevents database corruption and just throws errors in Stetho.  Maybe for applications that needs to keep database opens add a callback in the instance builder to ask the application for the SQLiteConnection or whatever Stetho needs on target database ? 
Hm, I thought about it and I thing its our Bot that creates the problem, I´ll try to find it and maybe I´ll be able to fix it by myself because at the fact that we uptaded the api version, our bot uses maybe old commands I guess. So thank you for your quick support 
this is my configuration: https://github.com/michalszynkiewicz/preview-search-engine/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties
This is boost from FreeBSD ports. It hasn't been built with any special options, and is supposed to work for everything.  
Adding the generic types to the `SenderSupplier` then using this form works  
Hard to say, if it's something that'll show up after 2-3 weeks of usage it seems like it could be a p0.  Could be related to the same kinda thing that QE reported.  The result of the timeout is that the UI displays a big error instead of integrations.
It looks like it's _trying_ to load all the jars, but I get a NoClassDefFoundError when I don't modify the classpath in the script:  Without modifying classpath:    EDIT: Added shell script debug output. 
I can reproduce it on my pixel 2 with Rocket 3502
Yes, using gcloud to deploy works without error. Yes, I enabled the Service Usage API and the error still occurs. I've also signed out and back in with my Google account within Eclipse hoping it is just something related to authorization.
I'm afraid I cannot justify the time to further edit videos that are intended for such a small audience.  If I am to spend the time cutting down the video (assuming this does not get my bug reports ignored because I could have faked the problem)  then I will have to release it to a wider audience to justify the time I spend on it.  Is that what you would prefer in future?  I have a 43 minute video about bins clipping through ceilings when harvested even if the ceiling is many blocks thick.  Currently it is private, but I would be willing to cut it down, but then I'd have to make it public to justify the extra time spent.

From what I understand, the problem is due to the `}'` part -- that is closing the inline xquery and continuing the XML text block section. It looks like the parser is getting confused and is not doing the xquery => XML transition, so is parsing the `'` in xquery mode.  Thus, the parsing modes should look like:

Hi,   Thank you for responding - looking forward to getting this resolved.   I'm assuming I should update with all the changes since 1.0.0 since GraphMLDemo references ComponentNameProvider and ComponentAttributeProvider (not present in 1.0.0)?

I'm running JDK 8u121 on Debian Jessie with Spring-Boot 1.5.9 (Spring Framework 4.3.13). As far as the idle-timeout concerns (and I understood SharedBlockingCallback correctly) it indefinetily blocks due to `-1` as a timeout for WebSockets, hence the WAITING instead of TIMED_WAITING status of the threads. The idle timeout for the QueuedThreadPool is on 5000ms seconds, though. 
So what about this term: `F1[ xᵇ . F2[ F3[xᵇ] ] ]`  (with F1, F2, F3 all functions). Are any calls blocked here? 
Yeah, those are both good additions as well.  I'm hoping @Jaggeroth might jump on this one, if he has time.
I think this issue is indeed related to #265. And the solution proposed by @StrangeNoises (#265#issuecomment-262994643) seem to work.  However someone more knowledgeable than me should look at case of the reusable cells.
I have sent mappings, settings and configuration to e-mail address associated with your github account 
You get kicked out of the arena and brought to the exit location. Except your inventory is wiped. Typing  does not kick you out as you are no longer part of the arena.
@vacla, yes, this feature works if system language is set to English  @maruohon, I am using 1.14.4 but I have been experiencing this issue on all versions since 1.13.2
yes, in the newest build it works thanks 
I dont have isolated test code, only app. code, relevant fragments are:   
I tried with a simple msi that contains only one file and it worked.  I don't understand why it fails with the other msi. The other msi size is 80Mb.
@badlogic We use Gradle.

Thanks for your answer James.  I've got a front-end web page containing a paging list of some resource, in which add and delete operation can be performed. Add or delete operation will reload the current page. I'm considering how to design this. For example, when I'm in the 2nd page, delete all the resources in that page making the page empty, then I go to the 3rd, then turn back to the 2nd, the page is still empty. This is what I met. But it's not a matter now, I've got a plan to deal with it, your answer really helps me, tks.  BTW, a search data cleanup every 10s by HAPI would lock the search tables frequently, any possibility this will result in a performance problem when it faces an influx of a large number of search requests? 
Stacktrace follows.   
I also tested on Moto XT 1527 / Android 5.1, Sony Xperia S LT26i / Android 4.1.2 and HTC One Max / Android 5.0.1, it have the same issue. What is the workaround ? 
I do not have a vpn, will look into the mac address

Thanks for your fast response 👍 . This is my root `build.gradle`, 2.4.0-alpha1   
Yes. Other files in database are processed normally.  
I found the button and after deactivating and reactivating it, mark occurrences works now, but apparently it doesn't work by default. 
Cleaned at it worked fine, sorry about that.
@sormuras with which release will this change be published
@costin Yes, it works. Thank you! 
how do i get the log? 
I'm using default termux font, but it happens with all of the fonts included in styling package.

@jpountz , **Mapping** - Any Mapping with analyzer containing stemmer (generates two tokens for chinepe => chinep/chinepe)  **Documents Not Matching:** Document containing "chinese"   I cannot provide exact documents/mapping. Thanks for understanding. 
Thank you! It works perfectly now.   And thanks again for your great library! 
So since the 'save' only save locally see #8 and that the actuall way to send it to the database is not working for me #10 , the data is not showing up [here](http://world.openfoodfacts.org/contributor/kyzh).  I think the issue only occurs on first scan. 
I can't even reproduce the error with the exact setup i had. fail. closed for now.

I am running phpStorm 7.1.3. 
Downloaded zip with sources - I can do a checkout if that would have missed something.
That's too bad. We can't report this anymore since GLES10 is gone from libgdx. Let this be our last release for GLES10 and then users need to remove all references of GL10 in their project if they keep using the nightlies. 
#40 should be a new feature requests. 
The version used is 8.0.5. It do not use yet the last version because there is api change in it. Anyway we had a look at the source code and it looks that the problem can also occur in last version.  The problem appear sometimes during launching. Yes, we use a french locale.  I'll add full log next time the problem appear ;)

Hi @saudet , here is the code:  
External window
I test this with nightly version, it works correctly. After that, i will try to find out a stable version.
EDIT Just re-tested this with 5.2.1, same issue there /EDIT  Ok 
THX @sberyozkin    I can remove the Quarkus specific hack and share the same code with all other servers :+1: 
@chrajeshbabu   I have check the log, balance make the region close. 
The jstack command just hangs. Which is interesting in and of itself. A kill -3 gives the following output:   
@RomanNikitenko Hello. Yesterday we have been trying it with @rhopp on 7.10.0 snapshot and the behavior was flaky. Sometimes the exit code was returned and the task terminated correctly, sometimes it didn't but at least in 7.10.0 it didn't prevent me from executing different tasks, or restarting the same task.  I am currently implementing a periodic test for Go devfile, so I would get back to you once we have more data collected from running the same operation on the go devfile in tests and seeing how often the issue appears.

Hey Andrew...  Graph & config is here:  http://maps5.trimet.org/otp-bugs/osm/  BTW, looking into git update problem that's preventing an update from April 5th ... 
Hello Aurélien,  Sorry for the late reply.The search icon is present on both devices. About the versions tablet uses Android 6.0.1 as well as the smartphone.  The last execution was a false OK as I was just testing the test implementation and manual action was executed. Last TC executed on smartphone:  http://192.168.134.35/Cerberus/ExecutionDetail.jsp?id_tc=34772500  Thanks 
Hi, I think that the change should solve the problem.  I am using <a href="https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.11/cmd-review.html"> gerrit review</a> command to add comments and review to a patch. In pipeline there is a task which sends verification status via custom command, where gerrit review looks like following:  ssh myGerrit gerrit review --label Verified=$1 $2.   Parameters are set in custom command as attributes. As you can see it runs as ssh, not http. 
... I'll check the config file. 
@mrniko What do you mean by "UTF-8 for sources"?  Is it default encoding for JVM process? If yes, then it isn't a good solution - I don't want my software to depend on server locale :)  Actually, converting my string to ISO_8859_1 damages it, so client cannot restore it further. 
Yes. It looks like it actually never leaves the sign-in button screen.   Or maybe on first attempt I got to select Facebook account to use before returning to sign-in button screen. On sequential attempts I do not get to select Facebook account. From a user perspective, the Facebook button then appears non functional.
@benoitf I will try to reproduce it locally and will provide more info.  for now all I know is that @dkuleshov showed me that CLI failed and when I asked him to pull  `eclipse/che-cli:nightly` it pulled newer image (I checked he didn't use any skips or --fast it was only start command)
The scenario can be found in [SilverWare-PerfTests](https://github.com/livthomas/SilverWare-PerfTests/blob/devel/hystrix-perftests/src/test/resources/scenarios/hystrix-rest.xml) repository. The latest PerfCake 7.4 is used.
seems to be working. Thank you. 
When i long press on a image it shows save image option. But when i click save image option nothing happens. Normally the app should download the image when we click on that option.   I have reinstalled the app and check still same issue. All permission are correctly granted 
Hi, Thanks for the quick fix!  For the second point, if tai == null, we go to that part of code    in my case, i don't have a Status annotation and i got a deserialization exception. 
I tried many urls, it worked in 4.4.0, but not in 4.5.0. Just normal use, 
the device is samsung s6 and the bug disappeared for no reason. I query on multi thread,and write on single thread.maybe it occur with multi thread.
Zperms, same issue with PEX I believe. 
Just tried on a 1.15.1 server, and it is fixed for that. I imagine it won't make a difference updating my server to 1.15.2 but I'm about to do that anyway so I'll let you know if it works on that as well.
OK so i basically reinstalled vscode i think. It wanted to update then it did and i had to reinstall all extensions. So after I reinstalled the jdt.ls extension, this worked as you describe.  I think I might have pegged the v0.4.0 tag. Confirmed that with latest master and v0.6.0, it works.  Do you think using the tags is the right approach ? We're trying to pick a stable release as we head towards landing in ycmd.   I know there's a lot of movement on the project, so I think we can track master pretty closely if you recommend that instead. We're considering marking java support as "experimental" for the first 5-6 months or so.  Closing this as it is clearly fixed in later version. Sorry for the noise.
@ShamsUlAzeem Works fine now. thank you!
@eivantsov I'm using K8s and I allocated 8 gigs to the workspace, but the actual cluster has 75 gigs
Okay @swankjesse Sorry this came late. My case was this; I'm building this app that respond to shared URL. So part of my test was to make sure that all URL are return a success respnse of 200. I used OkHttp to make sure that I got a succes response of 200. For some reason urls with empty fragment or with frahgments seems to return error even though they where valid. 
The bug only happens when I go back to the material-calendarview by using popBackStack. When I rotate the screen the material-calendarview gets recreated(no bug), when I use popBackStack the material-calendarview gets reinitialized(bug).   When I rotate ss.selectedDates stays at 1 after clearSelection(). When I popBackStack  ss.selectedDates goes to 0 after clearSelection().

You need to have an external keyboard connected since the soft keyboard will be hidden when the popup is displayed. I was using an emulator that allowed me to use the host system's keyboard. 
Thanks for the quick fix!
Ah ok, haven't seen that call. Thx for the remark. I will try to disable this. I will get back on you tomorrow, but probably you are right. 
does this have any clue? (sorry, screenshot is in indonesian)  ![screenshot_20161104-144653](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7449857/20036062/787c0488-a42e-11e6-9721-dc5dbe966696.jpg) 
I have a lot of other mods so I'm gonna try to find out which mod is causing the conflict and I'll let you know
ADB logs as soon as I can reliably recreate the issue. It's sporadic 
 for fruit
umm, not sure it helps, the query service returns the client/server parts of the span already merged into one span:   
Unfortunately it didn't work, the same thing is still happening, exactly how it was before. I also tested with my other mods, and repeated this when it just MatterOverdrive and CLib, the mods aren't conflicting.
It feels like a Bazel error. The exception is   according to the intertubes, this could happen when using policy files from a different version of the JDK. Maybe it's related to the recent JDK upgrade?
Same issue with lock icon also. ![screenshot_2018-04-17-08-14-49-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38435441/38845993-b128f52e-4217-11e8-8a2f-2513c069ea2a.png) 
Yes, our home server hosted locally.
Thanks for taking a look at this! That makes sense in terms of precedence but I'm admittedly am not an expert.  I bumped to `3.5.4` in my `pom.xml` file and realized the difference is that this works:    Now that I know that, I can just change our imports to have `./` to keep prototyping, but it'd also be nice to have parity with node (although the `./` prefix is admittedly more explicit). Thanks!
Oh great! thank you for testing.  Yes, you can use the snaphot version, but I'm releasing v5.1 soon.  I'll keep you informed when it is published.  Kr Mahmoud
It is surely caused by Tough As Nails, it surely linked to this issue. https://github.com/Glitchfiend/ToughAsNails/issues/274 Anyway now I get this crash. https://pastebin.com/3x1aXQ9V

Here is the output from that command.  I also attached the full server log. [server.log.zip](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/files/682569/server.log.zip)   
If you want to send a message without opening the default intent, you have to set the intent value to empty (intent='').  So if you're sending multiparts message (more than 160 characters), we need to add the following permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />`  I need to understand now why the callback method is called multiple times now (1 time per part of the message) 
No exceptions or issues flagged in the console. However, checking I can see that get-all-project-metadata is coming back with an empty list:  `{"projects":{}}`
Looks good for me!

Hi @guikeller,  interestingly the file is still around, https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/idea/201.5259.13/java/debugger/impl/src/com/intellij/debugger/impl/GenericDebuggerRunner.java  Thanks, Simon
Nope. When I give this direct URL then it works.  public interface Service {     @GET("/search/users?q=location:india+language:java")     Call<ItemResponse> getItems( //            @Query("location") String location, //            @Query("language") String language     ); } But above case it's not. Why???
Yeah sorry about that. You're absolutely right. here's the method that builds the MergingMediaSource:  Hope it helps
Huh...it seems inconsistent, must be something to do with my system.  Linux Mint x86-64 with up-to-date master. 1. Run the game 2. Create character, recruit, named it "s" to keep consistency 3. debug 4. stats  Output as expected, now the following steps: 1. Exit debug 2. Save game 3. Exit to main menu 4. Exit game 5. Run game again (ant run) 6. Load character named "s" 7. debug 8. stats  Output: NullPointerException   I kinda found something while debugging this now, when I opened up the game the second time, it didn't load the player information (attributes,name etc) in the player singleton, the attributes are all "inherited", so it throws this error inside Player.getStats() when the program tries to recover the name with getName(). It somehow never initializes the player instance. I'm looking into this, but I'm trying to make sure this happens with other people. 
I cannot find a /system. All I have is a /home and a /usr. I found libmp3lame.so in /usr/lib. 
I can't parse any thing either.   Maybe `java.mail` does not have the ability to parse this file but outlook can.  
Sure. See attachment. One is in portrait mode (the bug) and the other in landscape mode.  I hope that you have a solution.

Thanks for the reply :)     I'd be happy to open an issue there, but am afraid that you first have to enable issues on your fork ;)
@rhuss Thanks. We'll try it in the next couple days and let you know. 
Only sometimes. 
Hey!  The specs are from a comp of one of our users: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2157566/23499482/9aba19be-ff2c-11e6-93fa-b1eadfafed1f.png) 
No, I just add the enchcracker.zip and the EnchantmentCracker-1.2.1.zip (Source Code) into the main directory but nothing else
Hi, I looked around and didn't find a peer with Windows 10, the install seems to works fine on Mac and Ubuntu. I don't know if the probleme is related to the Windows 10 OS in general or to my computer in particular. Maybe the issue will go away with the next SDBG release. 
Yes, that's wright. Channels can't be controlled and states are not updated.
yeah im using the dw20 pack, i guess ill have to wait for the update, thanks. :D  
It's requiring me to mount them. And my bad I didn't use full paths.  
Yes. I get the same issue when i tried to fix the InsufficientLevelException myself. Interestingly, there is a AcceptLevelUpReward message at login and this works. Currently I'm catching the InsufficientLevelException in the onLevelUp method of the PlayerListener and exit my bot. With the next login I'm getting the reward.
Thanks for taking a look @kevinushey .   Here is the sm package and my test package if it helps at all: [sm-packages.zip](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/files/2746314/sm-packages.zip)  Also, when testing again, the first build would succeed. Then after editing the `sm_fail()` function, the error occurred on the next build. 
My chunky isn't modified; I believe it is visible because the sunlight is coming through the roof at such an angle that it just brushes past the stairs. So no fog is rendered in front of them. 
> I see, it shouldn't be too hard to fix that. Could you give it a try and send the patch via a pull request? Let me know if you have any questions and I will help! Thanks  I've tried. But I can't even compile the code. It said there is missing some dependencies...
Oddly enough, the bugs only appeared while on a dedicated server- we have Improvable Skills 3 which has a max health skill and we also have Botania which has a ring capable of adding hearts- it was really strange where the text was still displayed and flashing colors but then it would also change our max hp back to 20 every other tick while every other tick had it going back to the other value. While in singleplayer the bugs didn't seem to appear.

You are right, is it ok after refreshing. So the cause seems to be the same as for #4472. 
The fix is required if you want to play an mp4-file (using the USAC codec), as well as for Shoutcast and DASH streaming. In those cases the AOT == 42.
It seems to be working fine. I really love the new worldborder. Thank you guys! 
Thanks for replying so quickly.  Yes, I need an aggregation without _id, for my development purpose. But I managed, to ensure with a real mongoDB that the code is working correctly. It is just a bit annoying not to be able to use Fongo for one test, whereas all others are Ok, for automated build matter.  I understand that it'll stay on the TODO list for a while, no problem. I know it is small use case ;)  May be I'll try to propose a fix, whenever I found one ! 
@riccardo-forina I've built via `syndesis build` let me double check
I use in composer on files from repo which downloaded today:  "zaproxy/php-owasp-zap-v2": "=dev-develop"  This problem is occure when i use connection to new ZAP 2.4.3. On Zap 2.4.1 is fine. 
  there will be an error: Unknown property "isSaled" in return type. if the @Mapping like this ,It can be work `@Mapping(target = "saled",expression  = "java(null !=entity.getIsSaled()  && 1== entity.getIsSaled())")` Why the target is saled but not isSaled? Sorry, english is poor, It's may be hard to understand ^-^

@asolntsev thanks for looking into this. No, our tests doesn't look like this. It's just a snippet, stripped down as fast as possible from a very complex test (testing the sort order etc.). The same for the html page. It's a html page (saved by selenide test case) stripped down from a complex and big gwt application.   Ok. The guys at selenium tell me its a webdriver bug: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/5994 So i will open chrome/firefox webdriver bugs tomorrow.  What i don't understand is that all the other elements outside the viewport (after this one element) will return a text...that seem to be wrong.  Would be great to speed up this code. If you want, i can send you a few other selenide code examples (working with the table) that is slow right now?
Updated Spigot, WorldEdit and SurvivalGames to their latest (dev) versions, still persists on a clean server with nothing else.   Would it be possible just to make a toggle the paper bandage off? (preferably backported to 1.9.4)

Hey @Flanker32 : To fix this issue. On the IDE (IntelIJ IDEA), I increase JVM memory :)
It can be reproduced with any version up to `Dalston.SR1` included. I created a simple application using the Spring Initializr by including the features `Web`, `Eureka` and `Actuator`. Here is a short excerpt of the logs:  Once the application is started, try to _pause_ it via a call to `POST /pause`:    The EurekaServiceRegistry simply update the InstanceStatus - but nothing is listening to these changes anymore since he EurekaClient is dead - and nothing will restart it. Nothing will happen anymore beyond this point: the application won't be registered with the Eureka server anymore nor any heartbeat will be sent. 
I use a resourcepack sorry but those are ender lily seeds in the GUI screen shot.

Ok. I was actually changing a few things before we hit 11am to make sure that it was running and everything was smooth. I apologize for that, I had been restarting Apache. I have it running now and did an upload over the web client. That worked ok. I uploaded a .wav file with out issue.

As different people think the button should behave in different ways, my proposal would be to let people decide what they want without (more) configuration options. I think changing the button into a dropdown with options may help:  <img width="1655" alt="screen shot 2018-01-30 at 11 37 04" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/716185/35561946-2b4e73da-05b2-11e8-998e-c09b23782424.png">  Any opinions? /cc: @lennartkoopmann

That is the current state. The IP address information is anonymized on the client before the mail is composed.  However, as we don't have _any_ value in collecting those data, we will get rid of them entirely.

Ah all rights, I need to type <kbd>space</kbd> after `toReview` before it's actually added in. The `toReview` already appeared on the list of selected labels (in a faded state) before that so I thought it was added in and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.  Another behaviour is that while the `toReview` is in the faded state as above, if I click on the `toReview` label, it will show as being removed (crossed out state) although it's correctly applied after confirmation. 
yes.
I can see it's prompting me for an update...cool...let me get latest and try again :)

Thanks Alexander,   I don't know, how can I check if both components are synchronized?
It's only sending text though, correct? I doubt the filesize can be an issue, otherwise I can only imagine games on a much larger scale, like MMOs being technologically impossible.  Honestly, I can't think of anything causing a timeout aside from a poor connection, temperamental firewall, or dropped packet. Is the timeout duration manually defined? Perhaps we should increase the time allowed before the application gives up?  This is only the second time I've heard of this particular error in the logs, the second one being on the sub earlier today. So I'm not sure how often this occurs in the wild. Sarah's internet has been so abominable that I haven't even attempted a game with her recently, though probably I should to see if the result is a similar log now that logs are more verbose.  I'm tagging @rayrobdod and @Purplemandown so we have all hands on deck for additional insight on this. These softlocks need to stop, ideally before the next tourney - I don't want a repeat of our 2nd tournament. 
Thanks for your response.  Yes, it requires. Is there any workaround for that? I tried different VPN servers in different locations, including the country I'm currently in.
When I launch a test on chrome, this is the result :  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44800518/48191365-2fdc1080-e345-11e8-8583-9659915c581d.png)  When I lauch the same test on firefox :  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44800518/48191436-5e59eb80-e345-11e8-8548-e37c5d2b6f7a.png)  I made some tries and firefox can't see xpath outside of the screen. In chrome, the action "ScrollTo" is automatic. Then I tried mouseOver action in my firefox test and I can only use mouseOver in a element displayed on the screen, not outside. And the action ScrollTo  is not supported for application type 'GUI'.

Link to OreSpawn: http://www.orespawn.com/  That's the mod that adds the entity that I want to add. I've found a mod that has this function, but this mod adds a lot more and I want to use this one; I'm not sure if commands clash, but I'll try it.  Four other things: Firstly, as I have previously said, I'm using this in place of SPC; it adds a noclip command which lets a flying, opped player go through walls and blocks. I'd love to see that in this mod. Secondly, there should be something in place that retrieves the unlocalised names of entities (just so that people don't have to post links to mods so that you can add them in). Thirdly, the input failures are happening with this other mod that I'm testing (see above if you skipped past that). Finally, if you lost the repo, then why don't you decompile the 1.6.4 version of the mod, and then work things out from there? I know that it's hard, but there are a variety of tools that are out there to help you; just search for some Java decompilers and you'll come across something that works. :)  --EDIT--  This mod, sadly, does not work with the other, replacement mod that I'm using (it's called server commands). I've been getting internal exceptions with commands (even with vanilla commands like /help).  Github link: https://github.com/chbachman/ServerCommands  Thanks. 
@Sunstrike to allow for iron ingots/iron blocks to be converted to their compressed variants (http://www.minemaarten.com/wikis/pneumaticcraft-wiki/).  @mDiyo  I can't replace it, as I'm hooking into the EntityJoinWorldEvent. But you're right, I shouldn't even allow the item to spawn, and that's what I did. I've used the EntityJoinWorldEvent#setCanceled(true) so it doesn't spawn the entity, and spawned my own entity in afterwards. However, because even if the entity doesn't get spawned, it is still being referenced by Tinkers Construct and added to the player inventory, it is still duping...  But if you don't agree, that's okay, I've fixed it on my side ;). 
Hi @VictorAlbertos  I made some animation + demo project. Please, see it: https://github.com/egslava/bug-report-rx-paparazzo-nested-fragments 
It is indeed a Minechem-issue. If you look into the log you see:    Obviously it does not crash with MineChem only, since the crash is caused by the ThermalExpansion Fluid Transposer trying to register its recipes.

This is the problematic table. One thing to point out - there are other tables in this and other schemas that have names and fields with with 'status' in their names. However, only using either of these 2 field names (status_update_timestamp, status_update_user) in an sql breaks the autocompletion.

I am using XP Teleports to move between dimensions and unless I reequip the backpack the server kicks me when I open the backpack using 'R'. I am not sure if it would help but I can send you a link to the pack and whitelist you on the server and you can see if it happens there. 
I don't, but I'll contact the guys running the server to provide one. Once I have it, is there a way I can give you the URL without the whole internet knowing? 
Thank you kindly.
Yes, to the contrary, it prints out a ton of stuff (in beta 4), example see below. What it prints out is all the successful and failing rule matches when you parse an input. This allows me to see which rules are attempted and in which order, and it tells me which rules match and which do not. This way I can see the grammar in action as it is being executed and that gives me the only real debugging functionality that works as I can see where my grammar goes the wrong way where I did not anticipate that.  I suggest you revert your changes to re-instantiate this functionality.   
I think @FadeFx is correct. Macrodroid and libtretask uses notification. Personally i don't like the notification service . But an optional settings is enough for those who facing issue like this . They can enable notification service to keep alive the app.

@80tf3262p8 after force-stopping the app, and starting it up again, it does indeed sync successfully. So this is another "workaround" then, similar to disabling wifi and syncing once over 4g, then turning wifi back on.
sorry for late reply...here the logs  http://pastebin.com/7kEPWdMK 
These machines are placed after that update 
Yeah, sure 👍  
with JDK1.8 Maven3.2.5 And when i set jmockit.version to 1.36 the error fixed，but jmockit.version 1.47 the error happend 
I see, the problem is the different names in Preferences, versus on Drawer:  On **Drawer**:    At this point I have no ****ing idea what is what... And if they are the same or different. 
Yes, photos autoupload only on wi-fi (so shouldn't affect that) and contacts/callendar which I had before. It seems now with background data disabled 'drain' stopped. Do I need background data for proper Nextcloud functioning anyways?

Removing the file you mentioned and letting it get re-created fixed the problem.  I captured the contents of the saveactions_settings.xml that was bad and compared it to the newly created one.  It looks like an exclusion was in there, but I didn't see it listed in the Save Actions settings UI.  Maybe it will help you determined what happened.  Either way thank you for your quick response.

No, using the servlet version under EAP 7.  Yes, all of the TLS settings are replicated in each component's settings.  Yes, I tried it with the self-signed certificate for Elasticsearch in APIMAN's truststore, and vice-versa. And I tried it with signed certificates and certificate authorities in the truststore.
@maxandersen that will kinda work, same with the discover remote debugging feature, but.. The general idea here would be to be able to provide the 'embedded' experience with non embedded JVM's. Automatic is key here.

I changed it to 5 seconds and it worked (stopped recording video automatically after 5 seconds). Then I set it back to maximum (13h 1m), and tested again and it stopped recording after 30 minutes (no change). 
I'm not familiar with VisualVM but I'll see if I can figure it out.  I assume it needs to be run on the server, not the client, yes? Or do you want both?

Thanks @agazzarini ...I don't know how I missed that version file.  Indeed setting it to the latest supported ES version worked.  I've been busy but am planning to open a separate issue with the report server.  I'll try to do that soon.  Also good to see you at Haystack, hope to see you again at future events!
`./gradlew test` will run tests.  It seems that tests fails occasionally.
Unfortunately we can't remove it since we have other code that depends in this library which doesn't compile if we remove it from the classpath. What version _should_ we use? 
@blfrantz indeed, this is a specific issue in SQL. If you used an SQL query in Canvas in your test and still see the issue, it's very likely that you are using a version of Elasticsearch that doesn't have the fix. The version labels in this github issue as well as the versions mentioned in my latest comment should be ones that will have the fix.
I know @dmillerw fixed the sieve but I don't know if it applies to other blocks.

That's an instance of crossed streams - I tried just that, remembering that I got a different error message when I had that before:

I found the error is caused by the optimization of  Obviously here is a buggy copy propagation that assigning an integer number 1065353216 to the float variable instead of parsing it to float.
In all clients and we have tried the past couple of versions, seems to be any version that has added the under ground sounds. I can try to turn on the debug if you think that might give some clue.

I upgraded to the latest forge, and I can now see the items! Unfortunately, I cannot click on the items and place them into my inventory on survival. I can only do this on Creative, but since this is a new problem, I opened a new issue, unless this is intentional?
I don't know. I did update every day except Friday and Sat. However, I tried to reset back to the version  on Wednesday, it still didn't work.  
Hello Kay Sure, I did import all default patterns. I did not check for those messages, but will do. It seems to be some misinterpretation of some characters. For example: a numbered field identified as INT is not recognized on gl. Changing to some string, it goes on. On the debugger, this doesn't happen. I'll get that error message and drop to you.

File/folder inst accessed outside. Alle files are writable for plugin. 
Yes. It works with Traveller's Backpacks, and armors from Tiny Progressions, Tech Reborn, Base Metals, Industrialcraft2, Actually Additions, Redstone Arsenal, Galacticraft, Cyclic, Immersive Engineering, Mystical Agriculture, Thermal Foundation, and Ender IO, and most armors from Mekanism: Tools, with the exception of the glowstone armor set from Mekanism: Tools.   The mods I play with that have armors that don't work with MPM besides Construct's Armory are Botania, Draconic Evolution, and Thaumcraft (Save for Thaumium and Void sets).   If it means anything, I tested mostly just the helmets from each of the listed mods (Exception being Traveller's Backpacks, since that's not properly armor but it's close enough). I tested a couple matching chestplates, and effectiveness did seem consistent between helmets and chestplates, so I'm making the assumption that that is enough.
Hi Tobias, how can I send you an encrypted email with your user credentials for my Nextcloud server? I searched for your public key on hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net to use PGP email encyption w/o success.  Please advice.
Sure @wilkinsona !  That worked prior Spring Boot `1.3`. The `MessageChannelMetricWriter` was declared in the `MetricRepositoryAutoConfiguration`. Plus the `metricsChannel` has been declared there as well.  That's why my old answer on SO is pretty simple: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29627061/subscribe-to-spring-metrics-channel.  Not sure that it was a good idea to declare a channel as an out-of-the-box feature with its own `TaskExecutor`. So, I don't see reason to reinstate it. From one hand we are already far away from `1.2`, from other the Doc clarifies what to do http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-metrics-message-channel-integration:  > If a MessageChannel bean called metricsChannel exists,   I think `MetricExportAutoConfigurationTests#defaultExporterWhenMessageChannelAvailable()` should ensure that `MessageChannelMetricWriter` is present in the `MetricExporters`. 
I saw this on both Linux and Windows.  Now I'm matching on this which should be fine for almost all cases:  `    p.getProcessID() + "|" + p.getName() + "|" + p.getPath()`  In fact, I'm only using this for calculating per-process CPU usage, so any errors in this logic will iron themselves out after the next calculation anyway.  Thanks :)
can not find tostring() method
I am attempting to validate/cleanup data provided by a 3rd party. The data is from 2 sheets of a XLS which I have imported as separate projects, they have already (poorly) cross referenced it.  Not sure where I might find the 'backend' info, didn't see any log files under: `C:\Users\swood\AppData\Roaming\OpenRefine`
@rnveach, Yes, I'm preparing a PR for `XmlLogger`. There is a problem with `fileStarted` and `fileFinished` methods.  `DefaultLogger` works fine, according to my tests. Seems like the `PrintWriter` synchronizes write operations, however, I haven't found a documentation for this behavior. I'll also prepare a PR for `DefaultLogger`, this seems to be an easy fix
Verified that the problem is now solved.  >You'll have to put a six-character long string into variable "Str" first, otherwise strlen will return 0, and it would still return false.  Yes indeed.
I just player around with @arun-gupta 's Docker integrations in [javaee-samples/javaee7-samples](https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples) (branch: `docker`). The configuration looks like    Changing `boot2docker` to the proper IP and specifying a `certPath` worked, though. 
Not my choice.  Dealing with some legacy Hibernate proxies.  I have a test case. How do you want it. There are three files and the test file itself.

Hello pimotte,  I have reinstalled the sftp plugin from the jar and there is the same error Here is the full error message : "Connecting to repo for folder D: \ ... ERROR  Unable to connect to folder (code: 501) The operation failed Entirely. An exception was thrown"  I have created the same repo with the ftp plugin. Here is the full message when I try with the ftp plugin: "Connecting to repo for folder D:\ ...ERROR  Unable to connect to folder (code: 502) Testing the remote storage failed. - Was the connection successful: YES - Files can be created: YES - Files can be written to: YES - The target folder/repo exists: YES"  My SFTP server is a Qnap TS-231. The OS is QTS 4.1.4 (latest) I don't know the openssh version and the authentification method. 
So that during the compilation of `module-info.java`, the Java compiler sees the packages exported by Kotlin (otherwise, javac complains on the first `exports` clause, claiming there's no such package).  However, in #99 and #101, we've established that we won't be changing the destination dir of `compileJava` (or any other task) at all. Instead, we'll add the destination dirs to modulepath (for compilation), or produce a special "merged" dir with outputs (for run/test).
Ah the classes end in `Tests` , will confirm if it's this and attempt a sample project 
I don't know, I don't have 7-10 unlocked.

Hi @amit6663 , I think @Grandolf49 has already put up a pull request that solves the issue. But still you can discuss with @Grandolf49 if any further changes are required 
Nothing of that, I don't use the Builder's job
Hi. Thanks for taking interest in this issue. Maybe the issue is bound to some other functionality (MediaSessionConnector or any other additional ExoPlayer classes i'm using). I managed to create simple reproduce project, that have this behavior (tested on API 28 Emulator and Nokia 8 device). In this project i'm using only ExoPlayer classes to play one online hls track. On call - playback doesn't get paused (you can see that on state textview and on notification). Let me know if i can assist you more [AudioFocus.zip](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/files/3434725/AudioFocus.zip) 
Forge 1.12.2, build 2501.  2.6 version of Dynmap.  I am using a developer build of SpongeForge, on the 9/30/2017 commit.
If you can recommend a Curse modpack with a server package, I can test it.
Sadly no .. but this is just a limitation by GitHub. This works different with organization repositories.  So noted: you are working on it. And thanks for that! :+1:  
Great, thanks. 
@kirwan, if I remembered, <a href="http://7xjqxd.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/image/201609/27/51091ebcf76d07f88ca20bf9832aa682.jpg">this picture</a> has the problem  And this is the request code in our project:    For ImagePipelineConfig, only the memory configuration is changed.   
We dont use any https url. Not intentionally. My Brower is Opera.  For this test case i replaced http with https and got this error: `[16:13:50] [qtp1916156132-550/WARN] [webapi]: Illegal character 0x16 in state=START for buffer HeapByteBuffer@79989b32[p=1,l=165,c=8192,r=164]={\x16<<<\x03\x01\x00\xA0\x01\x00\x00\x9c\x03\x03\x95}J#\xAf\xFd\xB6...\x0e\x00\x0c\x02h2\x08http/1.1>>>-Headers: origin,...\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00} `
Ah, found the actual cause. Marking a task as done marks the subtask as done as well, hiding it, but I had marked it as done then tried to remove the subtask, making it look like the task was deleted because of the subtask removal. The UI desync bug made this harder to see. 
If there are no ranks available then an info message should come up to say Mann-whitney requires ranks. Upload ranks to use this test.  OR if there are no ranks don't have the option in the drop down box.   Rank file missing some of the genes: Will a rank of zero be ignored?  I would rather we don't exclude the gene but by default put it at the bottom of the rank list Or in the advanced settings maybe have this as a setting to either exclude unranked genes or include.  
Oh this could actually be it. I will test it at differently signed coordinates.
Ok I will try to reproduce again and let you know the results. I'm wondering what's the expected value in the `error` property of the response. Is it the current error if the replicator could not reach the remote database? 
Created #1294. Travis doesn't seem to like me, so any help appreciated. 
My screen has 3200x1800 and it seems like RStudio only scales in integer  multiples.  The menu titles are not scaled correctly either. See attached. 
I am not familiar with jstack but will try to take a look at it next week.  Forgot to mention that some of my digging I listened to the okhttp events and most of those 8 seconds are being while it is writing the http body. Also I can say that it is trying HTTP/1.1 and one of my tests was with this portocol only.
Yes this works, thank you! 
Ok, i've checked. When i've tried to use FirebaseAuth directly with the same ActionCodeSettings — everything was ok. I've received correct sign-in link on my email.
yes, i do mean all adjacent blocks. but why would the sign also protect the block beneath it?, shouldnt it just protect the sign and the block that the sign is on only? and you mean that sign posts protect the block that the post is one, right?  sorry, will need to get back to you on the version i use.

I'm not 100% sure if this is the best solution, but as long as the thread is not chrashing anymore your fix is really great.  My opinion is still the thread should try to read it at least once (or 10 times) more, and if the value is still invalid then set it to UNDEF. Otherwise keep the old value. Main reason is that the Modbus connection/protocol and the data is not protected somehow.  But for now I'm really happy that you have fixed it so fast.  Thanks :)

If you get the Technic Launcher it makes things easier as every server with the issue is downloadable from there.  Searchable packs: APOC AS 3.1.4, APOC YCC Official Packs: Attack of the B-team (1.0.12B), Tekkit Main (1.2.9G), Voltz (3.1.2), Hexxit (2.0.1C)  The main suspect for the TE (Energy/item/fluid) issues is the AS, YCC, TM packs. http://www.technicpack.net/download

I'm not sure how to create a test to show this BUG. Should I go in the "/src/test/java/spoon/test" folder and I memo create a case with my tested files?
> Don't we win this for free once we need to store the job config in an index?  I don't think it's completely free.  For the support case that caused this issue to be raised _some_ `.ml` indices had been created.  So I imagine they restricted auto-create after having previously run ML.  The same thing could happen in the future - a user could create their first job, thus causing the `.ml-config` index to be created, then restrict auto-creation of indices leading to subsequent problems with ML.  So it would be nice to have some other checks that can report the underlying problem with restricted auto-creation.
I'm not sure if this is especially related to the new map. My new test case is as follows: - Open live map, scroll somewhere (such that auto-center is off). - Close and kill cgeo. - Restart the app and open live map.  I expect to be centered now, since my understanding was that we store the "auto-center" state with the user session and reset to "you are centered" when starting the app from scratch. For me that does not happen. 
Done. Which version of the app would you recommend to use at this point?  
Yes. Freestyle jobs work.
I've just implemented it for the level 13 icons and the major differences to the previous version are: - does not scan for any borders of the icon - starts investigating pixels at the centre of the assumed icon location - walks in a spiral away from the centre instead of taking a straight line to find matching pixels - does not rely on certain specific 32 bit colors but instead just looks for color ranges like a human would do  Nevertheless it is still only 30 lines of code and very fast. I've not yet looked at the level 14 stuff. 
@skabashnyuk  Share my workspace config. In order to minimize the configuration, I selected Blank Stack and removed codeserver, tomcat 8, tomcat 8-debug from Servers. The same problem occurs even if I do not delete the definition of Servers.      {       "environments": {         "default": {           "machines": {             "dev-machine": {               "attributes": {                 "memoryLimitBytes": "2147483648"               },               "servers": {},               "volumes": {},               "installers": [                 "org.eclipse.che.exec",                 "org.eclipse.che.terminal",                 "org.eclipse.che.ws-agent"               ],               "env": {}             }           },           "recipe": {             "type": "dockerimage",             "content": "eclipse/ubuntu_jdk8"           }         }       },       "defaultEnv": "default",       "projects": [],       "name": "wksp-test-blank",       "commands": [],       "links": []     }  I have noticed one thing in Che's source code. "che.infra.openshift.bootstrapper.binary_url" in che.properties is set in org.eclipse.che.workspace.infrastructure.openshift.bootstrapper.OpenShiftBootstrapper.      che.infra.openshift.bootstrapper.binary_url=http://${CHE_HOST}:${CHE_PORT}/agent-binaries/linux_amd64/bootstrapper/bootstrapper  "CHE_PORT = 8080" is set in the environment set to pod of OpenShift, but CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_BOOTSTRAPPER_BINARY__URL has no port specification. Try to access "http://che-<CHE_OPENSHIFT_PROJECT>.<OPENSHIFT_ROUTING_SUFFIX>:8080/agent-binaries/linux_amd64/bootstrapper/bootstrapper", "404 Not Found" was returned.  Is there a shortage in the setting? 
Ok I will try to write the test case today 
If quarkus.http.root-path is not set then by https://localhost:8080/swagger-ui works otherwise doesn't. As soon as that path has set, things start to break. This bug, and there are others related to it. Reported before.
Hi,  sure, I will.   thanks Chris   edit: credentials sent!   The thing is: I don't think the account makes any difference.  The first screen on the android app requires the server url.  I enter here something like https://my-domain/nextcloud (no username, no password) - is this ok? As soon as I enter the url, I get the error "wrong username or password", but I did not enter such info. I don't even get to the point where I must authenticate.  thanks for your help!

Im currently using Alpha Hack and Servicehack and I cannot reproduce too. This happened to me once. Im using the Sony Xperia Z1 compact(Android 5.1.1) 
I have International stock ROM 2.3.2.7 on the watch and Xiaomi Mi A1 with Android 8.0. In Amazfit (from Google Play) I login with Google account, not Xiaomi account. I don't know if this affects.
I'd be fine with that. Just as long it doesn't cause a stuck background process in my workflow ;)  
It seems to happen on any batch that you run. A matter of fact, after some quick testing more with my batches, it seems the xml file gets opened several time with in one execution. 
These are the apps where I started seeing it quite frequently:  https://github.com/kdvolder/chatter  > ...  `refresh` should not complete until the container is started and listening on the configured port(s).  That may very well be true. I don't know. But the issue is not whether the app is listening on the port, but whether asking what the port is from the admin bean returns the number of the port rather than 'null'.  Is it possible that the app starts listening first and then makes that port known to the admin bean asyncly?  
With 2.0.4.RELEASE:

Corrected in QA !  Thank you
yeah I literally just saw that in my test world after my edit. Spent all morning balancing chicken drops for my pack and saw it more on accident, forget that part I'm a derp lol.   Thanks for the help. Can't wait for the next release. love the mod and the amount of config work that can be done.

I solved it on my side by filtering away any "remote.php/webdav" from the server URL. However, my point with this bug report is that the library should not crash with a null-pointer exception if such a case happens.  I made the following change in `CreateFolderRemoteOperation`:               if (!result.isSuccess() && mCreateFullPath &&                      RemoteOperationResult.ResultCode.CONFLICT == result.getCode()) {     -            result = createParentFolder(FileUtils.getParentPath(mRemotePath), client);     -            if (result.isSuccess()) {     -                result = createFolder(client);    // second (and last) try     +     +            if (!mRemotePath.equals("/")) {     +                result = createParentFolder(FileUtils.getParentPath(mRemotePath), client);     +                if (result.isSuccess()) {     +                    result = createFolder(client);    // second (and last) try     +                }                  }              }  I.e. avoid trying to get the parent of the root folder and return an error message instead. I can send you a PR for this, but since it's only one line to insert, you may want to simply do this yourself. Or you may want to handle it in another way. Whatever. Just make sure there is no hard crash with wrong user input :-)  
Yes, sorry, there was another one right below it. For some reason the line numbers are not really interesting; they point to the declarations of the classes containing the methods in the stack rather than to the lines that are executing.  However, it's a NullPointerException that has MapActivity$GetGeolocationAndMapItTask.onPostExecute and then MapActivity.access$500 at the top of the stack, so it seems reasonable to assume setPositionAndMarker is crashing due to mMap being null.  I can test that hypothesis later today if it's not easy for you to do it :) 
I'm really sorry, I should check this in advance. Affected version is `9.1.6.v20160112` (and at least `9.1.2.v20140210`, so, I assume, all 9.1.x versions). In 9.3 everything looks fine.  I think, it was fixed in this commit: https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/30123607c66627f74c8e8f7bed372f6e9b99ec31. 
I updated to the latest commit - 7b106923e078ac2435e8c8ce9d615f9903106ed8. However, I cannot test whether the bug is fixed since I hit the following exception in a code path that is precursor to where I can reproduce the bug:     This is why I didn't directly file a new bug. However I don't think these modifications have anything to do with the SSLException exception above since I've only removed unused Java 7 APIs and an annotation. But I might be wrong.  Also, thank you for being so responsive! 
sorry, I accidentally pressed enter xD, fixed
  An additional option is to queue up the refs to be deleted and send them later on the same thread? 
Unfortunately, the error trace/crash doesn't show where exactly this happens and I use your text field in a few places. It does not crash on compile, and I can't reproduce but quite a few users on Android 7 and Android 8 have it.
@ritesh-singh read the issue description. 
Hi,  thank you for your fast response! I tried to start the demo without compiling directly from the pre-compiled jar with java -jar JNativeHook.jar, getting the same result. (I have to enable the accessibility features, then restart again). The First waring is:  jni_SetProperties [146]: Invalid result returned from hook_get_pointer_acceleration_threshold()!  then i will geh the Unhandled Darwin event messages for every touchpad movement. I can't see any response to keyboard or touchpad events in the demo. As far as i can see, the logger is set to ALL.  thanks in advance 
 Are there any plans to fix these race conditions in OH 1.x? Fiddling with the parameters in openhab.cfg is not really a long-term solution. 
Nope, I wasn't using any shaders at the time.

@ice1000 thank you very much for the reply   Sadly, still the same problem  code is now     
Hi Martin, thanks for the interest. Yes, I added `EXTRA_JAVA_OPTS="-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts=/dev/ttyUSB0"` into the `/etc/default/openhab2` file.  It wasn't there before but I added it after reading through the messages on the openHAB forum.  This doesn't solve the problem though. The error isn't wrong.  None of my RFXcom items get updated. I also thought about dual connections but that doesn't seem to be the case.   I was already running the RFXcom binding in debug mode.  Here's some of the log

Hi,  I have just been testing again and I've found out that the issue is not related to the specific faction claim land. Materials with one durability such as Endstone do not blow up in this occasion http://prntscr.com/7o04g8 (vertical wall). But, the Endstone does blow up when the the wall is horizontal: http://prntscr.com/7o05j6.  Server version: Paper-Spigot 1.8.7 ObsidianDestroyer version: 4.3.9-SNAPSHOT Factions version: 2.7.5  Thanks, Frozon. 
Yes, the services are deployed successfully and are running. ![capture3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26756696/26294053/a37568ea-3ef3-11e7-95c7-2bade5fa6e09.JPG)  And yes it is a regression issue. 
probably, theyre the same API so

Hi Rob,  Thanks a lot for this and I apologize for the delayed response!   This is all the stack trace available through e.printStackTrace() (earlier I included the stack trace from service to dao layer):    Please let me know if something is missing and more info is required. Thanks, Shubham.
The cache code is GC4A5Z1 and user name of person in question is Janko132. But this issue was found on another phone, so I can not send screenshot. On my phone it works as expected. But I remember I have seen this issue on my phone also, just don't know when (cache, user, situation). 
Oh, I forgot to mention that I had already checked that file. It saves the user what I created and the odd part is, that the file remains unaffected after reboot (it doesn't remove the user or change it's password hash). I also use Windows so there shouldn't be problem with the write/read permissions.
Hi,  thank for your attention on my issue,  il still looking for the issu.  so you can find my code below   
That's a valid reason to not change it.  What I can offer is a work around for others who are hitting this which is telling flyway to start its initial migration from the 3.3.0 sql script and run a modified 3.2.0 script (which just has that line omitted) prior to launching genie:  This way new users can keep taking future migrations and this won't break existing deployments changing the hash of the 1st migration on working non-AWS deployments.  as for my version of postgres, yes I am also using 9.6
I pass Activity to Glide.with(), no fragments involved.    I tried Glide.clear(imageView) on Activity close, no effect. Still rawData remains allocated.   I thought you're aware about the problem. If you're not I need to ensure I don't miss anything, could just be my fault.  Looks like some GifResourceDecoder.DECODER_POOL references GifDecoder. That's why GifDecoder is retained forever and huge rawData inside it.   Can't see GifResourceDecoder.DECODER_POOL in the latest sources, probably the issue is already fixed? I build against 3.6.1. 
this was a vanilla singel chest, (from rogue like dungeons I think) same happened when it broke a sun flower and a saw it a dirt block - but I think that block was dropped down when I was leveling the area at the top.
I have only found Mermaid and Sahuagin yet. So it is possible both.
I posted PR #1810 for review on my solution to this - I did the work in the symlink action (and added tests to that effect), additionally specifying the includePath domain to the action, cleaning up anything that was not in the manifest to be symlinked. 
che.sh has something like:    which I think is useful, so I'm thinking to use che.sh to run my own che image. I'm not sure if all the options are useful for images.  PS: my own che image is just a backup of `codenvy/che:nightly` some days ago, because the "nightly" of these days are not working well. I treat it as an official image without my custom namespace

Hi! Just tested it; passing `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1` as a second parameter for `LoopingMediaSource` worked. Thank you!
Those error messages I reported were from an older version of the code.  These are the outputs I now get when running aac5f (14 Jan):  For AS11_DPP_HD_EXAMPLE_1.mxf    I'll email details of how you can obtain these MXF files. I suspect the SD issue is to do with KLV Fill between the Header Partition Pack and the Primer Pack.

  This is a very simplified example with the same problem.
@carl-mastrangelo @ejona86 - from what I can tell we're only relying on this in tests right now.  Thanks for the prompt reply / fix nonetheless! 🙏  
Was singleplayer. What do you mean with if I don't want that interaction? I can pump directly from the fountain? How?  bucket iron AS 1.12.2-1.8.10 Forge 14.23.4.2707 modpack sevtech 3.0.8  So is the issue that the moment output chalice reaches 1bucket worth of water it creates an icecube? I thought it should primarily pump water and create some icecubes as a by product. Also what is the ratio for starlight to water?
Compliant or not, I used a tool that shifted times to match movie, and it shifted some times to negative range. It played OK on a video player and I didn't care about negative ones. It could play too in exoplayer by tiny fix:  (added "-?")
I don't think reverting is an option. Remember, prior to that fix HT was completely unusable for some users. The current problem is annoying but can be overcome by restarting. 
Thanks, Andrew! 1.0.1-rc.1 fixes the 'origin: not found' problem, but introduces a new one: the gradle build fails if no gradle-git-publish task is executed. For example, running `./gradlew tasks` fails because the plugin tries to access an uninitialized Grgit property in [its buildFinished closure](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git-publish/blob/ca1bcac7b289fda741d508907b92b8305e442ef0/src/main/java/org/ajoberstar/gradle/git/publish/GitPublishPlugin.java#L46-L50):

 what we see is the che server comes up successfully.  We can create a workspace.  the problem is the che server kills the workspace after a few minutes. This is due to agent not repsonding in time.  if i jump into the workspace pod using oc rsh and perform a curl against the local agent endpoint (http://localhost:4401)i  receive a 404 back from tomcat  I may be wrong but we suspect the workspace is not given enough time to start up and would like to know how to configure the che server to allow the workspace time to come up.   I came across these configs in the config map but as far i could tell from the entry point script they are not referenced and the entrypoint always initialize the server on the default vales   che-wsagent-ping-success-threshold: "600"   che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_conn_timeout_ms: "6000"   che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_delay_ms: "6000"   che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_success_threshold: "100"
Hi @vickychijwani ,  I have the Koenig editor disabled but I did have it on at one point.  I also had the default posts (reassigned to me) for reference but I've deleted those now too.  Their removal doesn't appear to have been the solution sadly.  I'm not sure how I tell which posts were created with Koenig, or how to un-Koenig them (if that's possible).  I'm happy writing in markdown but if Koenig is going to become the default (an assumption) it might be worth handling that.  My first post also had a ☺️ in its title. I've removed that but that doesn't appear to have cured the issue.  Is there any other testing I can do to help you?

Thanks for looking into this! I had a big argument with Eclipse IDE trying to start your test and eventually gave up (sorry, I'm an IntelliJ guy).  However, I cloned my openHAB VM, messed around with my config and found a big clue: the issue does not occur with a single items file. When adding a second file, the items in the first file are 'added' to the listeners again. When adding a third items file, the items in the first and second file are repeated.  Can you verify this? I hope this would make it easier to pinpoint the bug.
I confirm that I'm using the operation macro:  
gradle debug log is below. - project name is renamed myproject per my company policy. - MySQL username is myproject (same as project name)  Build machine config - gradle 1.12 - flyway 3.0 - Mac OSX 10.9.3 - Java runtime 1.7.0_51  DB machine config - MySQL 5.6 / linux  build.gradle (flyway code snippet): flyway {   driver = 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'   url = 'jdbc:mysql://replace.with.actual.hostname/?'   user = 'myproject'   password = ''   schemas = ['myproject']   table = 'schema_history' }  Related debug log running "gradle flywayMigrate": 18:42:36.049 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Found resource: db/migration/V20140519_1__script1.sql 18:42:36.049 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Found resource: db/migration/V20140617_1__script2.sql 18:42:36.049 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Found resource: db/migration/V20140623_1__script3.sql 18:42:36.058 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Scanning for classes at 'db/migration' (Implementing: 'org.flywaydb.core.api.migration.jdbc.JdbcMigration') 18:42:36.059 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Scanning URL: file:/opt/buildAgent/work/4ca2640a4c361d20/common/build/resources/main/db/migration 18:42:36.060 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.FeatureDetector] JBoss VFS v2 available: false 18:42:36.061 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.FileSystemClassPathLocationScanner] Scanning starting at classpath root in filesystem: /opt/buildAgent/work/4ca2640a4c361d20/common/build/resources/main/ 18:42:36.061 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.FileSystemClassPathLocationScanner] Scanning for resources in path: /opt/buildAgent/work/4ca2640a4c361d20/common/build/resources/main/db/migration (db/migration) 18:42:36.062 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140513_1__init_schema.sql (filename: V20140513_1__init_schema.sql) 18:42:36.062 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140519_1__script1.sql (filename: V20140519_1__script1.sql) 18:42:36.062 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140617_1__script2.sql (filename: V20140617_1__script2.sql) 18:42:36.063 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140623_1__script3.sql (filename: V20140623_1__script3.sql) 18:42:36.064 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Scanning for classes at 'db/migration' (Implementing: 'org.flywaydb.core.api.migration.spring.SpringJdbcMigration') 18:42:36.065 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Scanning URL: file:/opt/buildAgent/work/4ca2640a4c361d20/common/build/resources/main/db/migration 18:42:36.066 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.FeatureDetector] JBoss VFS v2 available: false 18:42:36.066 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.FileSystemClassPathLocationScanner] Scanning starting at classpath root in filesystem: /opt/buildAgent/work/4ca2640a4c361d20/common/build/resources/main/ 18:42:36.066 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.FileSystemClassPathLocationScanner] Scanning for resources in path: /opt/buildAgent/work/4ca2640a4c361d20/common/build/resources/main/db/migration (db/migration) 18:42:36.067 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140513_1__init_schema.sql (filename: V20140513_1__init_schema.sql) 18:42:36.068 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140519_1__script1.sql (filename: V20140519_1__script1.sql) 18:42:36.068 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140617_1__script2.sql (filename: V20140617_1__script2.sql) 18:42:36.068 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathScanner] Filtering out resource: db/migration/V20140623_1__script3.sql (filename: V20140623_1__script3.sql) 18:42:36.104 [INFO] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.command.DbValidate] Validated 5 migrations (execution time 00:00.076s) 18:42:36.125 [DEBUG] [org.flywaydb.core.internal.command.DbSchemas] Schema `myproject` already exists.

I have upgraded to latest fdroid version, the force closed exception is gone but it is still not working. You should check the upload feature maybe on devices with low ram (like my crespo) and some other background apps (threema, chatsecure, fdroid with many accounts) and a huge amount of media so that the gallery application is consuming some ram while it is sharing to owncloud.  Thanks in advanced 
thanks @piotrtomiak, its working now.. 
@tristaZero  For the first exception, actually za_blacklist_m and za_blacklist_s are different, one is master and the other is slave, I just hided the real ip in the post ^_^ For the second exception, I have an application responsible for reading and uploading that configuration to ZK by calling this code:  After running that code, my another projects referring that orchestration configuration will get the exception.
1702 makes, no joke..., my whole system acting weired.... still have to figure out what is happening...
Hi, here is a tentative solution, following the same approach we use in GeoTools/GeoServer: https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/pull/106  The version numbers need to be modified on release of course, but it's a quick matter of running something like:   
The PR is here: https://github.com/ninjaframework/ninja/pull/312. 
> did u see "OpenJ9 Compile Complete" message?  No, I did not.   It seems to be blowing up while building DDR:   FYI @fjeremic could you have someone on the JIT team triage this?  I can provide core dumps etc.
Cool, thanks for letting me know and updating the ticket. My apologies for not responding earlier.

@DarkSpyro003 Thanks for your patch, it seems to be working now.

@snicoll I implied it but am not 100% sure. When I tried the sample with 1.3.3.RELEASE, it didn't happen. To be sure I can check by downgrading my application tomorrow if it could help. 
I'm attaching a screen capture under RStudio 1.2.1511, but I tried in other computers with the same OS and RStudio version and did not experience the problem. Moreover, if I open a new RStudio window, the second window doesn't suffer from this problem either. For more context, this happens inside a project, with many tabs open in the editor, but these conditions alone don't seem to cause the issue either.  ![selects_another_pane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11860098/57755901-b578b880-76fa-11e9-891a-247dfecab161.gif)

I just writing over the binary protocol. version of OrientDB is 2.2.22.
`Task` has not a no-arg constructor defined and is included as a library in my application - I cannot add a no arg constructor.   The following class is **NOT** defined in my main application but in a library which I use. The library uses jackson but my main application uses json-b. By the way, the library creates instances of `Task.class` from json under the hood. But I do **not** generate these instances directly from my application code - it is created by the library.   Hence, my application code (except the library which I use) does not make use of the jackson annotations in any way.  
## I can indeed provide you with a plugin - I made a quick test-only plugin that houses the customdata and minimum code to auto-add it to placed tileentities and entities that meet specific criterion, and right-clicking them with a blazerod will show the data toString() , showing Optional.empty() or Optional[all-data-lumped-in-string-text].  Creative mode and specific info are displayed onlogin.  The version of the customdata included is one that a) spews the complaint about the builder not implimenting abstract something on startup  b) has a list of strings to store uuids  c) has a lot of other messy code usage.  Every time I ask for help with it, I'm told that I "should do x a different way" based on whoever is sharing info at the time about the way they like to write particular things, 'but that works too'  and much of it is cobbled from whatever snips I can piece together.  The strings-of-uuids originated from wasting a tonne of time with raw uuids back in the days when there was no native support for uuids, and when finally cobbling code from various helpful people, was botched due to byte-order switching, so I stuck with strings.   I planned to change them to UUIDs when upgrading to 1.10.2, but I've only done so with vanilla, so it may be a simple thing I did wrong, or a complex thing that doesnt work right, but a simple switch to lists of uuids resulted in the server spamming Future-task errors with stacktrace NOT pointing to lines in my plugin.  So while you may wish to criticise my choices and say "Why the fudge are you using strings, you should use native uuids, you just switch x to y its not that hard" I still wait for someone to provide a proven working example since I've exhausted my attempts at it, and can't separate my-bad from 'maybe-its-sponge' possibilities with certainty.  Criticising the rest of the custom data methods is fine, if some actual code is provided for "you need to .." that takes the guesswork out of getting the code to match what specifically 'needs to..', or to say "x method does nothing at this time, we just included it for future purposes, where you commented about "why return empty here? What is this method?" etc :smile:   That caveat stated, I did a LOT of backpeddling from making various changes thinking I was missing something, but it wasn't the various combinations of approaches that were the cause after all, and this version presented is the existing 'rollback' that was last tried, and does demonstrate the working-notworking after reboot DIFFERENCES seen between entities and tile entities and  EVERYTHING-IS-FINE working with SpongeForge  phenomenon described.  ---  Plugin JAR File  ==  http://www.ethicraft.net/CustDataPersistTester.jar  Pastebin of classes for this tester plugin: http://pastebin.com/E2atAaMu

It happens intermittently, but when it does happen that's pretty much how it is. Repeated presses of the back button navigate the page in the background back, but the overlay stays on top. Only a restart of the app appears to fix it.  The issue started after the mathjax update so it may be that. Also this morning my phone updated to Android 7.1.1 so that may be related, but I don't remember if I encountered the issue yesterday.

@edmundoa Thanks for the help!

Hi, if it can help, the method is implemented in a separate jar, which his not included in the compiler class path (this because the plugin has been plugged in the _API_ module, not the _IMPL_) so at generation time, non information, a part from declaration,  is provided to plugin. Anyway the implementation of the method can return _null_ if the resource has not been found.

Normal seek has no problem.  > and that the player does indeed transition properly into the ended state?  I assume ExoPlayer reports onStateChanged(ExoPlayer.STATE_ENDED) only when the transition to ended state completes. Do you mean it's possible that there is an issue in ExoPlayer that this event is reported incorrectly?  As for the decoder, the following logs should indicate that it's EOS state. The event onStateChanged(ExoPlayer.STATE_ENDED) was reported after this.

Similar to how a Train knows that it's being locked I suppose. Locomotives hook into the Train object to inspect the list of tracks locking the Train, the same concept could be applied to Tokens.

Hi, Yes, of course. I do think it very strange.  * For a **Empty** Rstudio which just started with no projects, click create new projects——Doooon, Crash, No reactions. Actually you can only "Open" a Project.  * When I already have a project working on, click New Project, also crash.  * When it went wrong in running a loop or building packages, if you click the red point(which will stop R running manually),  Dooooon, it crashes.   ----  Always, I have to stop the session by Windows Task Manager, because clicking the "X" of Rstudio on the head right, can only get a waiting circle forever. And never close the program.  Also, if it crashes, you can not save the file editing, but it just stays there, you can click buttoms of Rstudio, but nothing happens.  Quite strange.

Thank you very much for your response. I installed the FROST Server before this commit and hence, was facing the issue. This issue is OK to be closed.  Just a basic beginner question, is there any way I can upgrade to the latest FROST Server without losing my data in the database? Any link or reference where I can learn that?

Well, what else is supposed to be done when no structures are seen? Not one structure has been found throughout exploring for hours. I realize it's still in beta, but I would hope to still be able to see these structures.

This is what I have currently. More details will have to be investigated. Note that since this is more of a backlog issue than a user request, you don't have to work on this right away, Radu, I am just adding it to the backlog to track it.  http://office.runtimeverification.com:8080/rv-jenkins/job/k-framework-pull-requests/org.kframework.k$k-distribution/1415/testReport/junit/%28root%29/_var_lib_jenkins_jobs_k-framework-pull-requests_workspace_k-distribution_tutorial_2_languages_2_kool_2_typed_2_static/hello_world/ 
I'm sorry that I didn't see your reply recently. My  quartz.properties  is as follows: 
Given that OrdiniService implements PanacheRepositoryBase<Ordine, String>, I can reproduce with this method (using 0.12.0 and master):  @QuarkusTest public class QuarkusResourceTest extends AbstractTest {      @Inject     OrdiniService ordiniService;      @Test()     public void testFindById() {          assertThrows(java.lang.IllegalStateException.class, () -> {             ordiniService.findById("existing order");         });     }   Il giorno ven 29 mar 2019 alle ore 17:56 Stéphane Épardaud < notifications@github.com> ha scritto:  > This happens to work in my test.

I don't really follow the math within the carbon reduction handler, so I'm not sure if the errors derive just from the GameConst stuff or the internal math of the handler.   If it's possible to get it to output reasonable values for testing that would be awesome. 
c:\Program Files\jetty.  I’d have to set it to:  //c:\Program Files\jetty.  But I think it might screw up other places where ${jetty.base} is used.  The solution that I proposed (adding // after file:) should work on all operating systems.

If it is in windows file format then we may have a problem.  You should be able to explicitly set the value of jetty.base to work around this.  — You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

Hello,  I wonder if it doesn't have to do with the fact my phones have only 2GB of RAM.  I have sent the credentials to that email address, I suppose a workaround could be to split the folder into multiple smaller folders.  Thanks for the reply.
Not exactly, I should have stated it a bit more specific. The connection gets established again (as proven by the CONNACK), and should be followed by a SUBSCRIBE from the mqtt binding, like in this correct sequence:  
I used 3.0.6 and 4.0.1

(#1191)  Thanks for opening this issue.   The latest commit fixes the root of the problem, which is that a resource directory with invalid eml.xml file is left over when creating a new resource using an invalid imported file such as an .mdb file.   Would you have time to help test this fix?

Sure, the issue is that then I would need to jump manually to each entry and change it vs just pressing enter/tab but I guess I can live with that. Thank you. 
I tried several times to open GAMA with a new workspace, run the model (two or three times to get a correct display in the simulation perspective), and I have still wrong pictures for my ants. (I tried to change name of the project and model, but without effect)  <img width="254" alt="capture d ecran 2015-12-31 a 14 34 32" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1555274/12064771/d23e7f4e-afcb-11e5-8067-948cdade023c.png"> 
You can give a lamp object a wire by right clicking it. This won't cause the block to update if the only wire is another lamp with a wire in it, the two won't connect. It works fine if you feed it wire next to an ordinary cable on the ground because the other cable block updates the lamp but if the other cable is a lamp with a phantom wire, neither will connect.
Things are working again. Thanks! 
Hi @clintongormley - Please see the versions above. I get no suggestions when run against the 4 indices that are different.   
How about something like this? http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4218871  They break down polygon into lines and do simple point-to-line distance calc. This would require converting lat/lon coordinates to a cartesian (UTM) first.   Is this better or worse than converting circle into 32..100 point polygon with getGeometryFrom(circle) ?  For the most part I need to compute intersections on the scale of 1m - 100m in the US and Alaska.  
https://www.dropbox.com/s/pjvsrpygexvfpi0/SCR_20160428_082421.mp4?dl=0  I implemetd this the same way as it is done in the example app, however the issue is that the app closes in my case  
I'm looking at it from the perspective of a factory where I can generate a link to create the environment.  If I create a single mount for all machines to use, it will be shared.  Unless there is a way to customize the mount during creation?

@ArihantJain456 , yes you can proceed.
Yes I select "Without Site Skeleton", in that case, the categories are synchronized even if I don't check the "Include taxonomy" option. I will check that again. 
Well, the `Invoking 'Lucene Builder' on project 'xxx'` is gone. Anyway I got some new. So, here is my log of what I did:  Created a testproject, converted it to composer project. -> Right click on project -> composer -> initialize composer -> See issue #19  So, ok I thought hmm, lets add a dependency. -> Right click on project -> composer -> add dependency -> See issue #20  There were so many errors popping up meanwhile, so I decided to create a second testproject and converted it to composer. I reread the readme, go to facets and activated composer here.  -> Right click on project -> composer -> initialize composer -> See issue #19 (no change)  I created a composer.json on my own, added a dependency manually.  -> Right click on project -> composer -> add dependency -> Added some, nothing happened.  I remembered I reinstalled eclipse a while ago, so I added a php exe again because this one was gone.  -> Right click on project -> composer -> add dependency -> Randomly picked: symfony/form, symfony/filesystem, symfony/config. Choosed version v2.1.2 for each. Clicked finish.  While the menu item says adding (meant adding to composer.json to me), I was wondered, that they were installed automatically, too. Ok, no problem would be my next step, thanks to the plugin to think for me, here we go: The weird thing, I was seeing instead of v2.1.2 version dev-master was downloaded, huh? Ok, v2.1.2 is downloaded as well, huh? Finally an error popped up to tell me my composer.json was updated but I'm unable to install two different versions of one dependency. Well this continues for each dependency, I then cancelled that action.  A final positive note at the end: The dependency graph is working for me :smiley:  
I guess this depends on its visibility for 107 compliance verification purposes... my assumption was that it won't be picked up by those tests, but I could be wrong. 
sorry for delay, stepped out for a bit.  Here's what I see in my server. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10309346/35199225-5b47cd24-fec9-11e7-9365-328d5bc83641.png) 
The thing is I cannot recreate the failure in a sample case. I was hoping on you giving me an advice on when one would get this problem so I can fix it. Do you think this could be JMockit bug or rather my own code issue ?  
Yes, when the animation is complete, it gets redrawing and is accurate. I guess, it is because of integer zoom level and animation starts after zoom level changed. I think, If animation started with old zoom level it would be accurate animation
