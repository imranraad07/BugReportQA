Read-only Files: Files and/or folder reappear after deleting   ## Issue Checklist  Before creating a new issue make sure that you - searched existing (and closed) issues: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues - searched the knowledge base:After using FreeFileSync to sync files from hard disk to the Cryptomator vault, I saw that two temporary FFS files couldn't be deleted from the vault.When trying to manually delete these files from File Explorer, they disappear then reappear when the screen is refreshed.I tried closing the vault and re-opening without success.I then tried to delete the whole containing folder, but that also reappears.I have also closed FreeFileSync completely and there is currently no syncing to a cloud service.

orphaned ExecutorService blocks normal application terminationThe issue is, that after writing and reading Data to and from the database one active ExecutorService still remains in the JVM and prohibits the whole application for a clean termination, althoughtOne for operations like listing all graph names and the second when documents should be read from the database.The first ExecutorService is correctly shutdown due to the call ArangoDB.shutdown(), but the the second ExecutorService remains and causes that our program, or server will never end.

KafkaAutoConfiguration should back off when a bean of type ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory is foundWe have a Spring Boot app configured with `@EnableKafka` and multiple instances of `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` to consume from different topics that require different deserializers.With this configuration application startup fails with message    `KafkaAutoConfiguration` attempts to create a `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory ` bean due to the condition `@ConditionalOnMissingBean(name = "kafkaListenerContainerFactory")`.
I'm getting the following error when placing more than one line of text in a text area.This happens when using any font I generate.It works fine if I package my skin with the provided `default.fnt` and`default.png` though, so I'm guessing there is something wrong with the way I'm generating the font, since the `.hiero` file doesn't even specify the rendering type (which, by the way I deduce is Java, but I've tried them all).

The scheduler deletes the physical plan so that the TMaster will restart with a new packing plan, recognize stream manager registration requests and build a new physical plan representing the new packing plan.Since the executors all refresh their packing plans in parallel, a potential race condition exists if executor0 takes a long time to restart the TMaster (i.e. step 3b)The TMaster will generate a new physical plan that matches of old packing plan (if it can) and update it in the state manager.The scheduler will detect the new packing plan and complete the update, but the topology will still be in the old packing plan state (new scale-out stream managers will go unrecognized).Finally the TMaster will get restarted by the executor with new packing plan.It will load the old physical plan and reject registration requests by the new stream managers.

"Send to Interpreter" re-expands all tests   If you expand a combinatorial trace, and then right-click and attempt to execute just one test (using "Send to Interpreter"), all of the tests are re-expanded before running the single test identified - though the test does then run as expected.This isn't noticeable with small numbers of tests, but if a trace expands to 10,000 tests or more, there is a significant delay before a single test can be re-executed.This was wrong in 2.3.4, but I'm pretty sure this used to work correctly at some point.

SqlgGraph do not close data source in case of error in openWe have setup observers to notify when postgres fails-overThough, it is possible that secondary instance is still not ready to accept write traffic and `SqlgGraph.open(configuration)` fails.It can also happen when we are building the sqlg graph for the first time.So there are many paths in the code which can fail because postgres is not accepting write traffic.In these scenarios, we retry opening the SqlgGraph if it fails.Though we are noticing that after few tries, postgres runs out of connections and fails with following error.

not sure what was a root cause, but looks like there were problems at Apple side.Problem is that we finally got FullGC and at the top were pushy objects although we have limit on 10k pushes in delivering:    we use pushy 0.11.0.In `ApnsClientHandler::writePushNotification` notification and promise are put in map, but on `onStreamAdded` are removed.Have checked latest version, there is only `unattachedResponsePromisesByStreamId` map, but the rest seems the same.By briefly looking netty code, seems that there is no guarantee that `onStreamAdded` is always called, so looks like there is possibility that `unattachedResponsePromisesByStreamId` could grow without limit.

__ #### Short description: When I put an item card set to 'Biome Crystal: Storage Cell' from the Random Things mod into the 'Export Item' slot of an item exporter, the server crashes, booting me out with an error of 'server closed' and causing the server to reboot.The same thing happens when the Biome Crystal is the first/only item in a list card,  and happens irrespective of the exporter's settings for ignoring/respecting damage/nbt/etcetera.#### Actual behaviour: When placed into the GUI, the client freezes for a few moments before booting me from the server, with the error message 'server closed'.Upon reboot, any attempt to access the GUI of the offending Item Exporter will result in another crash, requiring me to break the exporter to get my card back.#### Steps to reproduce the problem:  1.but there's only so many tests I can do before the admin yells at me to stop crashing his serverThe server should crash.

If you pass in a filename with a .cram extension, makeSAMOrBAMWriter will create a BAM file with a .cram extension and return a BAMFileWriter, which is probably not what was intended.Using makeWriter instead will remedy this (as it will create a real .cram file) but makeSAMOrBAMWriter should check the extension and either redirect to makeCRAMWriter or reject the request.

I guess this part of the function is (more or less) useless, because (if I got things right) your field names always begin with a lower case letter, but the getters are in camel case.so for a field "name" (like in StructuredFieldBaseName) you would try to call a getter "getname" - which of couse does not exist because the letter after the "get" is always upper case.If not, I would recommend removing this obsolete part.

Abilities that grant potion effects stopped workingOkay, I don't know what got corrupted in my worlds, but while the flight ability still works, it seems any ability that grants potion effects no longer grants those potions effects.I've tried everything I can think of, but nothing seems to fix it besides starting a whole new world.I've tried removing all mods besides cyclops core and everlasting abilities and it still refuses to work.Attached is a test world I had where it stopped workingI'd love to know if there's some way of fixing it with an NBT editor or something, or if I'm doomed to either not use EA any further in my main world, or have to start a whole new one if I want to use it, and I suppose for that matter risk it happening again since I'm really not sure what caused it in the first place.Since it might play a role, I did have NotEnoughIDs installed, along with almost 300 other mods, but since it doesn't work even /after/I disable those mods I figure it has to have changed   something in the world itself in nbt or something, and at least if I can figure out what that is, I might be able to fix it in an editor.I've tried deleting dimensions, deleting the overworld, deleting a bunch of the player nbt.OK, I've tried deleting everything in the save folder besides level.dat, and I even used a nbt editor to delete the player data there, and it /still/ doesn't work.

ELK, in contrast to, say, HermiT, won't find an explanation for that entailment; However, simply make Peripheral Nerve and Nerve disjoint (causing them to be unsatisfiable), and ELK find a suitable explanation.While this may not be a super urgent issue, it is quite an important one for us; If I can somehow help chasing this down (writing tests, or anything at all), I would be glad to.
However, the byte count depends on the character encoding.When testing the serializer with a servlet I didn't immediately notice this, because the standard encoding of the output is ISO-8859-1 (one character is always one byte).It would certainly be better if the desired character encoding could be given to the writer.

I have been trying out the updated flans mod for Minecraft 1.12.2 and have encountered errors when playing the apocalypse.Survivors do not recognize players as hostile entities and will not attack me as they have in the past, thus making it less of a challenge to survive myself.I am not sure if this is intentional or not, but the egg used to be there in previous versions.I can not comment if survivors attack each other.I have not witnessed a conflict between survivors yet (maybe less spawning?).

Hello,  I am seeing an issue that seems to appear when using the database pool within OrientGraphFactory while using an OrientGraph from getTx on multiple threads.Then there is 1 final Future to commit the transaction and close the connection, releasing it back to the pool.It seems that if a pooled graph is not released on the same thread on which it was acquired it may not work as intended.but it certainly does not play well with the work done to allow the same graph to be used on different threads (i.e. OrientBaseGraph.makeActive and http://orientdb.com/docs/last/Java-Multi-Threading.html).

*Describe the bugWhen the jarClassLoader is used a ClassNotFoundException is caught.But instead a  NoClassDefFoundError is produced for which there is no catch and consequently the narClassLoader is not used.It is not entirely clear to me why NoClassDefFoundError is sometimes the thrown exception.The issue is that it is not an unreasonable exception to expect when a classloader is unable to find a particular class.The nar file does not have its sub-dependancies in the top level but in the bundled-dependencies.I expect it to not find the PushSource when read as a jar file and then process the file as a NAR.The following is a trivial (but repetitive) fix that has worked for  me.= narClassLoader;                         } catch (ClassNotFoundException e1) {                             throw new IllegalArgumentException({                         throw new IllegalArgumentException= narClassLoader;                         } catch (ClassNotFoundException e1) {                             throw new IllegalArgumentException({                         throw new IllegalArgumentException

MacOSXFsEventsDiffAwarenessTest is flaky   //src/test/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/skyframe:SkyframeTests has been failing on CI recently due to MacOSXFsEventsDiffAwarenessTest being flaky.The current theory is that the test fails when the machine is under high load.When we looked at the test initially, it seemed quite obvious why it would be flaky - it did some changes to the filesystem, waited 200ms and then checked that FSEvents reported them correctly.I'll disable the test for now, but we should look into this.

Qt build script fails to set RUNPATH on Qt shared objects   Here:  https://github.com/jmcphers/qt-gst10/blob/master/Dockerfile.x86_64#L77-L78The invocation fails because `chrpath -r` attempts to replace an existing RUNPATH.This fails if no RUNPATH exists on the object, which is true for these shared objects.Using `patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN'` would likely work here (it creates a RUNPATH entry if none exists beforehand).On Ubuntu 17.04 at least, this implies that executables which recursively depend on these libraries will fail to be resolved; e.g. `uic` depends on `libQt5Core.so` which depends on `libicui18n.soHowever, without a RUNPATH (even though those objects live in the same directory), `libQt5Core.so` will fail to discover `libicui18n.so`, and so transitively `uic` fails to see it as well.

Hey,  we want to use rultor for deploying our project when stuff gets merged to master.However for that we need some unique ID that is guaranteed to be higher than the last time the action was done, some may call this a build numberWe'd love to switch to rultor for such things, currently we're using CI which is very comfortable but lacks the "pre-merge-security" and simulating deployment steps on wip branches isn't really the same.
but it also happens with the ConnectSDK sampler app.

My Hue bulbs show an endpoint 242 - it's always been there, and it's a little frustrating in that every time the stack starts it gives this endpoint a different device type - I want to stop this!This is just plane bad news - in the case of the Hue, where the device isn't known anyway, it doesn't matter, however it means even if the device is known, if it somehow happens to come up with the same score when the factory is evaluating a match, then next time it might evaluate to a different device if it matches two devices with the same score.The other issue is that returning any device type when the score is 0 is wrong - it hasn't matched any clusters, so we can't really say that this is the device (well, not one that we know!).So, to resolve this I propose to return null from getBestDeviceProxyFactory which stops the device being constructed.

Now there are two separate things that happen inconsistently, when I load exactly the same network, perform exactly the same steps, and have no other programs running on my machine: 1.)I noticed the presence of a lock file in ~/.gephi/0.9.2/dev when the Overview loading appears to get stuck.If I delete that lock file, Gephi will render about a minute later.The symptoms I described above are characteristic of a threading problem: a bug that doesn't happen every time; that happens during extensive parallelization (as during the import of a large edges spreadsheet); and that seems to be resolved by deleting a lock file.Here's where the first bug appears: sometimes Gephi finds parallel edges in the spreadsheet, but most of the time it doesn't--even though I import exactly the same spreadsheet each time.

Ignore encryption data in mdatHowever, in the intervening period, we have found at least one player that is unable to read the encryption data from `mdat` and requires `senc` to be present.The idea being that if the player does not understand `senc` it will just read the data out of the `mdat` as instructed by `saio` and if it does require `sencFrom the log, I see that it tries to read the start of the `mdat` as samples, presumably because it encountered `senc` and thus does not know that there is going to be more encryption data in `mdat`.At least this is my current theory - have not actually attached a debugger but from reading the log, it seems straightforward enough.I would thus request a change to ExoPlayer to make it ignore this encryption data inside `mdat` even if it is already parsed from `senc` (detected by checking whether `saio` points into `mdat`).

Perform more startup consistency checks before writing anything to disk   Today when a node starts up after an upgrade it might write upgraded versions of at least these separate structures to disk:  - the keystore - the node metadata file - (some portion of)This can potentially get a node completely stuck in an upgrade:  - if the node metadata file is invalid (e.g. comes from a version that is too old to support an in-place upgrade)then we do not discover this until after upgrading the keystore to the latest version.This version of the node cannot start up due to the invalid node metadata file, but an attempt to downgrade to the previous working version will also fail because of the upgraded keystore.- if the cluster metadata is invalid (e.g. contains an index from an unsupported version)then we do not discover this until after upgrading the keystore and the node metadata files to the latest versions.Again, this version of the node cannot start up due to the invalid cluster metadata, but an attempt to downgrade to the previous working version will also fail because of the upgraded keystore and node metadata files.We can make this experience better by performing more consistency checks before writing anything to disk at startup, to avoid blocking a subsequent downgrade in cases where the upgrade is obviously infeasible.

It seems that when Python is embedded in C++ and then compiled into a shared or static library (such as how `sc` creates PEs), it can't read symbols from other cpython dynamic libraries such as the `multiarray.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` included in numpy.According to this (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/hJr-kfKFVNc) and other threads, a solution is to pass `-Xlinker --export-dynamics` to g++ when the bundle is being compiled.

After some time, the timeout of the fair lock queue gets set to a time many hours in the future, and no thread ever gets the lock.So far, we haven't been able to reproduce the issue locally, but it is happening daily in our production environment.We are suspecting the problem is happening randomly when one of the application gets killed by the operating system (kill -9), something that can happen quite often due to the way we manage the apps.We were using redisson version 3.2.3 before, and never experienced the issue.Earlier this year, we tried updating to version 3.3.2 and started seeing the problem within a day or so.We reverted to 3.2.3, and waited for an updated version.Two days ago, we decided to upgrade to 3.5.4 assuming the problem was fixed, but it happened again within a few hours.I will keep on trying to reproduce the issue, but any help is appreciated.

Redisson calls do not time out and very long cache times depending on ttl settingHi, while developing using redisson some problems with timeouts and cache times are experienced.Timeout exceptions are being thrown, but seemingly at random times ignoring the timeout setting of redisson.It is also somehow being affected by ttl setting as the shorter ttl yields lower cache times, as well as the frequency of hitting the cache.In all the cases in the end requests succeed to fall over to the database (either through a timeout error or through returning null).Regardless, the timeout is not being thrown according to the settings.Please let me know if you might know the cause of the issue.Let me know if you need more context

There's no way to only close a tab (and nothing else)I've already said it in #2350, but as it's not exactly the same issue, I open a new one:There's no option in rightest drop-down menu responsible for closing a tab without deleting its content from disk (in other words: there is a "delete" option but not a "close" option)*File-> Close and File->Quit do the same: they close the IDE...(I think former should close only active tab)  Tested on 1.6.1 and on 1.6.3

Today I updated the Groovy compiler from 2.4.x to 2.5.4 and I started getting this error.It doesn't happen when I build my project with Gradle (which also has 2.5.4).
It also seems to glitch out and lose my spot every time I open it and while I'm actively using it.I'm in the Puget Sound region and the app remembers that so it asks if I want to move there or stay in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.I see the new 'starred stops' option, which is great, so I'm using that but simply remembering my last view in the app is more likely to be useful than 'somewhere off the coast of Africa'.but when it's not turned on you need a better fallback.So, separate from the enter being able to enter a home zip code to set their position, we should revert to the same map position as the user last saw in the app when they do a fresh start up of the app.I think the behavior we probably want in #527 is that if the user enters a zip code and hits the "My location" button, we re-center over the zip code.If the user doesn't hit "My location," then we want to duplicate their previous view of the map when they last closed the app.Not certain, but I assume: 1.

When sent to the overflow menu due to the action bar being full, "From gallery" shows up with its icon on the left.Besides being the only item in the overflow menu with an icon, when the light theme is selected, the icon isn't visible due to being white.  !I think it might be a good idea to make the dark theme the default instead of the light theme, so that people start out with the theme that they are used to, and have the option to change it if they prefer light.IMO this looks okay in the dark theme, but rather jarring in the light theme.

When I opened a test page I saw the following exception: `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`  This exception can be fixed if common-codec dependency will be explicitly added to pom.xmlHowever, JoinFaces 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 have another issue that I can't fix:  `java.lang.This happens if the faces-initialization does not work at all - make sure that you properly include all configuration settings necessary for a basic faces application and that all the necessary libs are included.If you did that and find nothing, the mistake might be due to the fact that you use some special web-containers which do not support registering context-listeners via TLD files and a context listener is not setup in your web.xml.

We are using cassandra 2.1.8 and Cassandra lucene index 2.1.8.2, while creating a index we have by mistake given one of the field names as wrong, without realizing this has led to the corruption of the SStable and now cassandra is down.I have tried to use sstablescrub to clean up cassandra tables, looks like most of the tables are clean but still for some tables I get the following error.The name of the field had to be "CONNECTION_DURATION" but by mistake we specified as "DURATION".I really want to get my cassandra nodes up without losing the data, I do not care if I need to sacrifice this one table for thatbut for now I am at my wits end as to how to get it back on its feet.Is there a way where I can delete just this table and the Lucene Index related to it and bring up cassandra.

When building via App Bundle, Fresco fails to find "libimagepipeline.so"   ### DescriptionWhen launching an Activity that uses Fresco, which has been generated via [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle/), it fails to find "libimagepipeline.so" and crashes the application.Observe crash  ### Solution  I originally thought this might have been an issue with minify, R8, or Proguard, but I disabled all of those, and still observed the same result when building via App Bundle.I have tested other components of my app that also use native libraries, but they all operate as expected, only with Fresco struggling to load the respective binary.A temporary, but not ideal solution I found is disabling splitting of APK's by `abi` using the following configuration, but including all the binaries results in a significantly larger APK size.

*Describe the bug* Running a simple consumer on Windows using the `PulsarClient`, I notice that there is considerable CPU usage when the consumer is just idling.;`  A simple test with similar values show that a running HashedWheelTimer can consume CPU equal to 100% of one hyperthread:My understanding of the `HashedWheelTimer` is that it is indented to be used for a large number of approximated timeouts and not for millisecond precision scheduling, but I may be mistaken.For example, when running 8 consumers on a i7-8700 (4 cores 2 threads per core), TaskManager reported 100% CPU usage - when there was no traffic, no messages on the topics.An alternative is to use a plain old `ScheduledExecutorService` for batch dispatching/reception, tests suggest it will also be lighter on the CPU when millisecond precision is required and the number of task is not too high.When scheduling 10k tasks every millisecond, the thread was working 100%, but scheduling 10k tasksSo if a client is used to create a huge number of producers/consumers, it might be better to lax the batch timeoutNote that when using `ScheduledExecutorService` each task might not get exactly the same number of executions, for example when scheduling 1000 tasks run execute every millisecond for 30 seconds

Hi,  I was trying to use your library with AWS Clustered mode and figured out it does not work with SSL.Basically everywhere you create an address like "redis://" -- you need a way to know if it's SSL and put "rediss://" instead.Do you have in plan a fix for this, or I can do it if you point me to the right way.The simplest way would be to put a static public flag somewhere -- but that's also a hack I guess, and will only allow one type at one time, or pass a jvm property ...

A few days ago, our official pack server started crashing whenever someone is near a Mekanism machine (tested with a Metallurgic Infuser and Enrichment Chamber).At first we thought that it was all due to Mekanism, but today we figured out that it doesn't happen when the crafting recipes in JEI bug out, as it sometimes happens with the 1.11.2 version.Then we tried changing the JEI version on the client back to the version where all was fine, but it didn't help.#### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_
For example: "home/myzip/ziptest.zip" should be extracted to "home/myzip/ziptest/test/mytest1.zip", but it is incorrectly Unzip it to "home/myzip/ziptest\test\mytest1.zip", where "ziptest\test\mytest1.zip" becomes the file name

grew 20 crystals from tartaric gems, then the ritual appeared to kick in and start spawning secondary crystals which immediately broke and were burned to create more will.I set the area using the tinkerer, and crystals do break across the entire range.However, the Ritual of the Cloned Soul only seems to generate enough will to break even or often run out and stall the entire will generation engine as it were.At first I thought it was a chunk loading issue, but I idled in the same chunk for an hourand I'm still just breaking even on burned will with no excess.This does seem to work for 4-5 cycles, but then no crystals will grow for 30-60-90 seconds, causing any excess to burn up.Let me know if there's anything I can to help investigate.

It seems that the Samsung browser ("com.sec.android.app.sbrowser") on the Galaxy Note 4 and probably also the Galaxy Note 3 does not return to the app after the user has clicked the "Allow" button in the Google login web page.Instead it just loads "www.google.com", which is the fallback if the app cannot be started as far as I know.So the app does not get any login information and cannot proceed with the authentication.A workaround is to ignore that browser so that Google Chrome is used instead.E.g. this code has fixed the issue for me:However it would be good if it would work "out of the box", i.e. if the AppAuth library could handle (blacklist?)but it seems that it doesn't blacklist any browsers by itself.

Getting this crash after updating to v0.99.Looking at actions user took before the crash, makes me think the controls were not actually removed when app last terminated(or device locked), since app crashes right away when trying to play a new audio.I'm calling `MusicControl.stopControl()` when the specific component handling it is closed, but when app is terminated `componentWillUnmount` is not called.Not sure if that's related.

`--remote_cache`: optional, for a separate CAS and action-cache service (if not hosted at `--remote_executor`).Currently, if both `--remote_executor` and `--remote_cache` are set, it seems like Bazel is only querying `ServerCapabilities` at the `--remote_executor` end-point and determines compatibility using both `ExecutionCapabilities` and `CacheCapabilities` from that message.This is a bit surprising, and, even if the REAPI specification does not mention anything regarding this, expected logic in that situation, I believe, would have been to query capabilities from the two end-point services and use `ExecutionCapabilities` from `--remote_executor` and `CacheCapabilities` from `--remote_cache`.I'll fill a bug against the REAPI for better documentation about the expected behaviour once that behaviour is determined and agreed.

Unclosed MySQL connections when not using connectionTestQueryHowever, when we run one of our tests --which creates and shutdowns 1,002 different instances of the Hikari pool in sequence-- with such setup, we observe a growing number of unclosed connections (orange):  !However, if we run exactly the same test setting having set the `connectionTestQuery` property like:    ...this doesn't happen at all, and everything looks fine:  !The profiler shows to us that our test actually uses and _closes_ the same amount of connections in both cases (29,058), but in the first case many more connections are open and never closed.Also, the profiler shows that these unclosed connections are not strongly-reachable after the test has finished executing all the queries, but that a good number of connections are still weak and/or soft reachable (and forcing a GC execution doesn't change things):  !Note that, when we use `connectionTestQuery`, we also see a comparable number of weak/softly reachable connections at the end.The difference seems to be that the connections are closed this time...  !At first we thought this could be some kind of issue at the MySQL JDBC Driver, but the fact is, we run this same test using Commons-DBCP with its default configuration (no connection validation query), and we obtained no unclosed connections...

When i input fuel into any fission reactor for the first time it will consume the fuel without giving a depleted fuel or power output, also if i insert a full stack it will be completely consumed in a sec and there will be no power/depleted fuel output.redstone signal doesnt affect it, will happen when reactor is on or off.this really makes automation difficult since i cant change the type of fuel that goes into the fission reactor unless i do it manually, if i just pipe a new type of fuel into a reactor it will just be consumed without any output until i place one manually and reactor updates.

Refreshing access token may remove refresh token from AuthorizedClient   ### Summary  When a WebClient (configured with ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction) automatically refresh an access token using an available refresh token, the refresh token may be lost, preventing any further refresh.This happen when the authorization server doesn't return the refresh token on the Token Endpoint responseAnd with a custom OAuth2AuthorizedClientService implementation that can persist AuthorizedClient durably (in a file for me)  When a user authorizes the application to access its Google resources : an AuthorizedClient with an access_token and a refresh_token is stored in OAuth2AuthorizedClientService.Later (more than 1 hour), another access to its Google resources triggers a token refresh : this works but Google doesn't send another refresh_token (the old one is still valid).: another access to the user's Google resources fails because the WebClient doesn't have any refresh token anymore to refresh the old access token.Expected Behavior is that when refreshing the access token for the first time, the old refresh_token is saved (if no new refresh_token is provided), so that it is possible to refresh the access_token more than once after ( and as long as the refresh_token is still valid )  ### Version  Spring Security 5.2.0.M1

Fallback for with Feign does not works   Hi,
Currently when starting a nested transaction using  `runtime.getObjectsView().type("TransactionType.()` it can bypass the transaction type inherit logic, which ends up in nested transactions with different transaction types.This could violate transaction semantics, though in some cases, the type mismatch will be detected upon txn commit, but in other cases, inconsistency will occur without being noticed.
So the problem is when you reload Essentials with /essentials reload.The custom join message doesnt work/break.When a player join it show the default join message.It will work after a server restart but once you do /essentials reload, it show back the default join message.This only affect the custom join message, the custom leave does work fine although after /essentials reload.When they leave the server, it does show the custom leave message.
Failover logic appears to be broken   I am testing failover logic using the ExampleClient.This causes a TTransportException to be thrown.(4) Since isRetrySameHostAgain=true, we then try to create a client to the failed host again!This of course fails, and throws a TException which is caught in operateWithFailover() and ultimately re-thrown back out to ExampleClient.If I run it in the debugger and manually set isFirst=false to force skipToNextHost() to be called with isRetrySameHostAgain=false, the retry logic works as expected.

Aerial interface preventing functionality of rightclick-hold items   First discovered this while trying to shoot a bow.This was affecting vanilla and all modded bows I tested.This also affected the horn of the wild from Botania which uses the right mouse hold to break plants in an area around the player.Holding the mouse would start to play the animation and sound, but the sound would end without producing the plant break effect even though the right mouse button was never released.It also affected eating.The eating animation and sound would play, the food item would disappear from your inventory, and your hunger bar would fill, but shortly after the hunger would drop back down to the level it was before eating and you would find (if you sort your inventory with the invtweaks function)I dismantled my entire base trying to find the problem and realized that when I removed the aerial interface the problem went away.I can place the aerial interface and there is no problem, but once it reaches the 10.0 working pressure the right click problem comes back.Breaking the interface immediately fixes it.Unfortunately if I create a fresh world and attempt to reproduce the problem, I can not.Everything seems to work, but I can consistently reproduce this in my main play world with the exact same mod set.(not sure if they will help).If there is any other testing I can do to help figure this out I will.After additional testing, I am even able to add a new aerial interface in the main play world and apply pressure with a creative compressor and the problem does not occur.I am stumped as to why just placing and pressurizing this particular interface causes the problem.

the "inherit1" partial is not rendering the "inline partial defined by inherit1, called from base" content, which was defined in the partial block (if needed I can commit a change to the test that better describes the expected result, I believe it will fail though).I am assuming that this is because the fix requires to call {{>@partial-block}} in order to render the inner content of an inherited partial block, but this does not solve my problem since it requires to go over all templates that are being inherited and add {{>@partial-block}} to them.This is not so applicable since not all inheriting templates actually define a partial block when calling the base template, so you get a "[template] does not provide a @partial-block" exception.To my understanding the functionality that I am describing (inline partials remaining in the partial block context) is meant to be supported for without the need to call {{>@partial-block}}, as described in the second example of inline partials here ("Each inline partial is available to the current block and all children, including execution of other partials...").This will be really helpful as my application heavily reuses templates and to workaround this issue I need do define empty inline partials in order to "reset" the ones that were defined by a sibling template.

I already filed eclipse-ee4j/jersey#3670, but this issue hasn't been addressed yet.Currently it looks like a random provider wins and `@Priority` is being ignored.This leads to the following issues:The MVC parameter binding rules (i18n support + binding errors) aren't always applied correctly.If our provider is picked, everything works fine, but if the Jersey builtin provider is used, the binding is broken.We provide a default `ExceptionMapper` for `CsrfValidationException`, but the developer can also provide his own mapper to change the default behavior.The user provided mapper should always be preferred, but which one gets executed changes at random.For the latter case we already have a TCK test which sometimes works and sometimes fails:  ![https://i.imgur.com/N26A3sP.png](https://i.imgur.com/N26A3sP.png)
The migration fails because the AHM (Ancient History Mark) is out of date.When doing a migration, a lock is held on the Flyway metadata table in another transaction.But the Vertica Tuple Mover cannot advance the AHM Epoch until the lock is released.However, with the lock held open, this function simply blocks and does nothing, so it also cannot be used in a migration.This is probably not a bug, per se, but it does mean that projections cannot be dropped in migrations.
Sometimes syncany will forget the local folder.The green tick on the tray icon disappears and the folder is gone from the menu.Exiting syncany, everything looks normal, no java or other process appears to be running.But the problem persist until reboot - I can restart syncany, but the folder and the green tick are still missing.I have observed the problem on both machines, but it happens most frequently on the laptop.The log shows issues with a "socket", but I barely know what this covers in java-ese.The 25MB logfile is all about normal housekeeping, except this, which seemes to accompany the error.The samme message is repeated many, many times over, but I shall spare you the megabytes:  21-6-15 10:36:42.907Connection refused     at sun.nio.ch.

System UI crashed after plugin installed   Not running a custom ROM, phone is rooted.I managed to fix the issue, but this is a pretty crucial problem that might cause some people inconvenience.After installing, the Always On AMOLED app process crashed and my screen shut off.My phone was pretty much in a bricked state, but the notification LED would still blink.After calling myself from a different phone, the screen finally lit up, showing that the System UI stopped, and from there I could disable the Always On AMOLED service.

The plugin seems to have picked up all the old merge requests, even though they were closed and the branches removed....it correctly added comments to the merge requests "starting build" and "build failed".It went through 20-30 such merge requests, but then it seems to have got stuck at one and doesn't seem to be going past that.I tried creating new merge requests where the branches have not been deleted and the merge requests are valid and openbut they don't seem to be picked up.
The app will crash when trying to open a specific folder for any time after the first try (I can open the folder exactly once after I install the ownCloud app.After that if I try to open the folder it crashes).The folder is remembered by another app, but like I said it was working fine before.The folder should open every time without crashing.No, the demo site was broken (kept redirecting to www site) at this time.

Exception in NIO client when broker sends a large message over SSLThe piece of code below either passes or fails depending on where I set breakpoint.However if breakpoint is set to the next line, data from the network is not yet available and `else` branch is executed.so unlike the the "then" branch which exits with cipherIn(position=0, limit=4629) in my test, the "else" branch exits cipherIn(position=4629, limit=16921) - I guess it is still in "read" mode.That later fails on `sslEngine.unwrap()`.If I manually invoke `cipherIn.flip()` in the debugger, the packet seem to decode ok.

Kubernetes service gets deleted with the pod   Running ShinyProxy inside a Kubernetes cluster, the created kubernetes service gets deleted when Shinyproxy stops the shiny app's container.I figured out that it is caused by the KubernetesBackend's doStopProxy function as it deletes the kubernetes service:If Shinyproxy is used inside a kubernetes cluster and the service is created by the user during the deployment, it shouldn't delete the service.I guess it just needs to check whether the proxy is used internally or not and delete the service if needed.
When using JPA to create and run a native query, the call results in unloadAndKillPool from being called.When you have multiple threads doing this concurrently, then you end up getting ConcurrentModificationException from the JDBC Monitor, and if you fix that, you end up with NPEs when trying to access the pool, because another thread has just caused it to be removed.In that context the unloadAndKillPool makes sense, but obviously it's sub-optimal in the case were you're trying to execute business code.

I've just got a fresh install of R/RStudio on Ubuntu 18.04 and when I try to edit the file it crashes R.The reason I think this is serious is that when RStudio is next started, it instantly crashes.You can start RStudio in specific projects with `rstudio myproject` but if it starts in a project where the crash happens, it just crashes again, which could lead to some users uninstalling R.The solution I found was to delete the contents of `~/.rstudio-desktop/`.I think the person who mentioned the issue also did this.3.5.1  ### Steps to reproduce the problem### Describe the problem in detail  See above.RStudio should not crash 2.I guess there's something in the file that makes RStudio die.when the offending line was removed it fixes it.I've not merged that change because I think it may be useful as a reproducible example for others to test on.Thank you for taking the time to file an issue!

When user is not looking at the `ChatFragment` at the moment, we tend to display number of unread messages on the chat navigation icon.Since `ChatFragment` doesn't go to sleep while browsing other fragment, nor it gets destroyed, the `MessageListView` is marking all messages read as soon as they arrive.I'm not entirely sure about this one, but I think that `ChannelViewModel` is marking the messages as read too, even before `MessageListView` does. https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/getstream/sdk/chat/viewmodel/ChannelViewModel.java#L531It would be great to have some kind of flag on (possibly) `ChannelViewModel` that would block `markLastMessageRead()` from executing.

The code from https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/3302 has broken ipv6 support for `X-Forwarded-For` headers.The problem stems from the [HostPort change](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blame/051edc94d737456a59100d7814f4b13020d7fff7/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.java#L449), but it seems like a [previous commit](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blame/edf74a655473e5dda82c8e67e5c9ffea6ec0d025/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.java) tried to handle it.It might be a an idea to check if it is a ipv6 address, instead of just checking if a `:` is present (guess that was why the code ended up looking like it does now).Consider if `X-Forwarded-Port` is the proper way to send on the port, rather than `X-Forwarded-For`.

Mechanism is the same: equal operator is picked to be `$operator$EQUAL(real,real):boolean` but rewrites further on (in `Analyzer`) look only at the plan, not considering coercions, therefore `Real.equal(long, long)` is called with one long staying for `Real` type while another representing `Short Decimal` (also represented as `long` Java type underneath).

*Describe the bugThis happens because when we execute a statement in `InteractiveStatementExecutor`, we get to building the physical plan, the first action is to get the `queryId` from the `QueryIdGenerator`, create the Kafka Streams app, then set the next queryId in `InteractiveStatementExecutor`.If the Kafka Streams app creation exceptions out, then the QueryIdGenerator won't have a next id set and will be in an unrecoverable state until the server is restarted.* Create a query that will fail when creating the KafkaStreams app.(For example: set the monitoring interceptor configs for consumers and producers created by KSQL as part of executing a query, but the jar file can't be found).We fail to execute the statement due to the QueryIdGenerator not having any available id set.
We are having an issue on some devices (OnePlus) where if the app is in the background for too long, the app is force killed by the system for "excessive battery use".There doesn't appear to be a way to stop this, but the app being in the background is a legitimate use case.We have an idea to run a monitoring service to detect if the app has been killed, and simple restart navigation from where the user was up to.Is there anything that can be done to allow navigation to start in the background, or alternatively is it possible to look into the fact that OnePlus devices seem to kill the app after a while of navigating in the background (OnePlus 6, Android 9.Based on some quick research, the suggestion is that it's a OnePlus feature aimed at increasing battery life)

For some reason, the RCL refuses to enter a tank more than 300mb at a time.The smelter uses up 2 ores, then stops, leaving 200 mb in the tank above, then just stops.but I have to deal with tiny increments of about 200 mb in a series of tanks separated by fluid conduits from EnderIO.The only way I managed to get 300mb inside is using the creative fluid injector and even that stops at 300.Painstakingly getting it all the way through to the end of the process at the crystalizer is possible, but wasting resources at the laser section and very time consuming.Interestingly, when multiblocked with three tanks and filled up, then broken, each tank section keeps 100mb, then refuses to be filled any further after that amount.This leads me to believe that the RCL is refusing to mix with itself.

This simple inductor battery will work under almost all circumstances, however if the power gets pulled out from the power source (seen at the right) either by breaking the wire or cutting it off with a switch the inductor will instantly lose all charge.If the flow from the power source is cut off first (by flipping the switch)the power will properly flow from the ground diode into the load, and the power can be safely cut.

I dont know if this is the same as #365 because I am on 1.10 instead of 1.7.10, but with the 3.4.5 build and ender i/oso when ore (or dusts) go into my refined storage system they end up in this drawer set for processing, the finished ingots go back into the refined storage via interface and then get put into my large drawer system for final storage.I tested with putting a single ore into a grinder manually and say the normal output from it, but twice the amount stored in the small drawer set, then twice again was put into a alloy smelter which produced ingots matching the amount of dust, then twice as much was finally stored in my main drawer system.I think I noticed this in a prior build as well but did not confirm it till nowI'm not complaining, just thought you should know... :)

I figured if I'd try an automated way we might not be able to get the server running again, because every time it crashed, we had to run "Remove erroring tile entities" in order to fix it.So it seems to be only crashing multiplayer servers.so I just assumed it would be fixed in next updates, but since it still hasn't, I decided to finally address it.If you have any questions I'll try to answer them.If you need any versions please explain where I can find which versionsEdit: the Liquid XP Bucket is from Open Blocks, by the way, but since the Black Hole Tank is the only container (that I know of) not being compatible, I decided to address it here.

XPrivacy, in combination with the toggle, seems to cause certain roms to bootloop whereas others work fine.If I flash the new rom updateIf I don't enable Xposed after the rom update, the phone manages to boot.Then I can install Xposed normally through the Xposed Installer, which for some reason, does not cause a bootloop when I reboot my phone.In other words, the bootloops only occur during the first boot if the toggle (or a backup script) is used after a rom update.If Xposed is not enabled before booting the first time, there will be no bootloops.
Gate Address Access List (GAAL) cannot change Default Outgoing permissions at all.Changing the checkbox does not save state after hitting save; reverts to "allow" when next accessed via configurator.Any setting which involves Default-Deny fails.Hypothesis: When the Default is set to allow, the specific gate checks for denials run, and are set corrently.When the Default is set to Deny, it does not perform specific gate checks for denials, as they would be the same setting as the current default.Therefore, suspecting the bug lie in the default denial line itself, and could probably just be re-copied from the specific gate checks (as they are currently working).

Geo-fences are lost during Android phone reboot   Tested with AllView X3 Soul Pro running Android 6.0 and Domoticz appIf I kill the Domoticz app the geo-fences still work properly (thank God!)If I reboot my phone, the geo-fences are lost and they won't trigger anymore when I walk in and out of the geo-fence perimeters.If I open the Domoticz app after the reboot of the phone, the geo-fences still won't work.If I go to Settings -This is even worse than the reboot problem because obviously the data and Location cannot eb kept on all the time (because of battery consumption and data plan reasons).Going to the Settings/Configure geofences section of the Domoticz app seems to correctly restore the geofences (except for steps 19 and 20 where it seems that this failed too) D)One time after reboot it seemed that the geofences were restored, but they didn't actually work when walking in/out of the fence.there is just one major geo-fencing bug remaining: the geo-fences are lost when the Android location is turned off until the Setting/Configure geofencing section of the Domoticz app is open again, at which point the geo-fences are restored.

In short, if we are using `@EnableConfigurationProperties` combined with `@ConditionalOnProperty` for some beans, the new version is not respecting the conditional on the config part.If we add this component to any Spring Boot application, it will fail to start with 2.2.0.The bean initialization of `FooBar` and `FooBarConfig` should be skipped because `@ConditionalOnProperty` doesn't match.* `FooBar` is skipped but the `FooBarConfig` keeps initializing thus failed startup.

Dear felixjones i find an issue...The specified Android SDK Build Tools version (27.0.3) is ignored, as it is below the minimum supported version (28.0.3) for Android Gradle Plugin 3.3.0.To suppress this warning, remove "buildToolsVersion '27.0.3'" from your build.gradle file, as each version of the Android Gradle Plugin now has a default version of the build tools.According to [The Java Library Plugin - Gradle User Guide Version 3.5](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html): The compile configuration still exists but should not be used as it will not offer the guarantees that the api and implementation configurations provide.

So I noticed that when you add a component to an entity that's already in the engine, it adds asynchronously.But before modifying it, I have to check if it's present in the entity or not.If not, then I'm going to add a new component of needed type and then modify it.But I can't do it, because after i call entity.add(), it's not present in the entity's components array.The problem becomes really bad when you have to call the modifying/checking function multiple times.Every time the "is component present check" returns null on a given entity.

[Feature Request] Dimension blacklist for Animania spawning   ### Expected Behavior Animania animals should not spawn in other dimensions by default (especially when stabilized in the overworld so that returning to existing chunks isn't causing new animals to spawn), or at least there should be a way to stop them from doing so without stopping them from spawning in the overworld.(I turned off the options to force despawning of vanilla animals), yet after some work on building a grass field in the Nether, I came back to the portal and found that some Animania animals had spawned.Start building a large grass area (if not in creative mode, a few starter grass blocks can be used with torches to allow the grass to spread)

I'd like to start the discussion with a test class; tried to keep it concise:    This test defines four immutable models and eight tests, two for each model: - Two of the models are defined with direct `@JsonSerialize`/`@JsonDeserialize` annotations, while the other two inherit said annotations from a meta annotation.Four out of the eight tests fail, all because Jackson deserialization fails.I think the first issue can be fixed by making sure that `@JsonProperty` annotations are not only placed on generated accessor methods, but also on the mutator methods of the generated `Json` class.I'm not yet sure why the meta-annotation approach doesn't "just work".

, linking of extern symbols is broken when the external symbol is defined in one of the LLVM IR files (see #340).The current lookup logic (see `LLVMVisitor`) is as following:    Per default, external symbols are looked up by using the Graal NFI while they should first be looked up in the bitcode files.`) since space for all global variables is initially allocated, even if the symbol is looked up later and the allocated global variable space not used.Even if the redundant allocation would be fixed inside the `LLVMVisitor` it would not be enough to find global extern variables that are defined in other files.To fix this issue, we have to traverse all bitcode files, determine the unresolved extern variables and resolve them (with the Graal NFI).

Because Of Password Expired DateIf we create a user with expired password, Kapua reports (when we are trying to login as this use) that "User has been locked." although PASSWORD credential is not really locked and therefore user is not actually locked.If user sets Expiration Date for a Credential in the past, _Status_ (the "key" icon) or the _Lock Status_ should turn red.After the user would unlock the credential, Expiration Date would be deleted (set to null, N/A).Second option is to change the error message from "User has been locked..." to "User's PASSWORD hass expired." This introduces some security "risks" as potential attacker then knows that password has expired and user has not been actually locekd.User has been locked or password has expired.*Observe the error message from Kapua.If user sets an Expiration Date for Password (or API_KEY) in the past, the lock symbol should turn red or error message should be changed when trying to login with user whos password has expired.No. 2 ("User locked" error message, although only user's password is expired):Main component affected

Having a real world project (which I cannot upload), which needs about 4 minutes to be imported into eclipse, while a complete clean build (gradle clean testClasses) on commandline needs about 1 minute and importing it into idea lasts about 10 seconds, we cannot migrate to use gradle until this bug is fixed.you can even notice this bug.
but this seems not to be the case.However, other machines running the same project seem to have no issue, even on the same version of gauge and intellij.That said, I'm not sure if this would make a differencebut I'm running on an Ubuntu machine (18.04) while they were running Windows 10.In particular, where before when running each scenario in a spec was separated into it's own header which had it's own log, now all the scenarios are grouped into one log, often times causing most of the scenario logs to be lost due to the amount of lines in the log.
I don't know yet if this is possible, but if yes, than it will result in a pull request and would require a new release of Nodeclipse.(or if you would like to, from yours as well).Thus, if user tries to install our debugger, yours would be uninstalled and all the features would work with the new one.Since the initial release we've improved overall quality of the feature and added following features: - sourcemap support for both Node.js and Chrome - JavaScript code hot-sync to Chrome - connection to externally launched Node.js  Please let me know if you are interested in making such a change and we can start discussion about technical details if you are :)

loader.path failed to reference a windows folderThe problem occurred when using the parameter below: `-Dloader.pah=C:/MyFolder,D:/AnotherFolder,lib`  `MyFolder` is ignored as the source code of `PropertiesLauncher.java` is performing a check of a starting '/' character which makes sense under Linux but not under Windows.The effect is that launcher is looking for resource `C:/MyFolder` under the user home directory ... which does not exist.The effect is that folder is ignored without any notice...As Workaround I may use the `-Dhome=C:/` to customize the "user.home" folder, unfortunately this solve only the problem for `MyFolder` but does not solve my whole problem as I need to refer directories from multiple partitions ...`ClassLoader.getResource` returns URL while `getResourceAsStream` return null on the same resource ....

Non-transactional SQL callbacks failing after upgrade to 4.2.0Although I believe some SQL Server DDL statements support transactions, creating a database with other statements does not appear to be.Initially thought this might be related to #181 involving the flyway.group configuration introduced in 4.2.0, but after stepping through with a debugger it does not appear to be as essentially the same codepaths are exercised., so do not think it's related or a workaround.

I think it's really easy to understand why: - you can't see whats ahead when the tunnel bore stops (maybe the front should be a hexagon)   - or a vanilla/RC design that fits   - better fitting collision model would be great so you can walk in a 3x3 hole aside the tunnel bore   -*: if the bore head were removed the model will change into a smaller one (so you can see whats ahead) -the skin and the model are a little bit outdated -> if you look how the locomotives are designed* - enchantments:   - unbreaking   - Efficiency (it will increase the speed up to 40% but also increase the consumption of the fuel)

Elasticsearch backend fails to add value to list property if that property doesn't already exist   If you have an indexed property with list or set cardinality (in elasticsearch) and you create a new vertex without assigning any value to that property during the creation, then adding a value to that property lateron will fail on commit, because the elasticsearch script to add the property value causes an error (NullReferenceException) in elasticsearch.It should make a null-check if that property doesn't already exist on the vertex, like so: `if(ctx._source[\"name\"] =[]; ctx._source[\"name\"].add(\"FOO\");`  Note, that the "upsert" statement in the elasticsearch query doesn't apply in this case, because it gets used only if the document (i.e. vertex) doesn't already exist.

I've seen this issue on two users so far (out of many split across Android and IOS).I hope I'm not reaching at straws by placing emphasis on the Android version, however at the end of this post you'll see the error... which seems to be within the Android ssl subsystem.I assume this issue could be caused by my own nginx configuration, which I'll excerpt here:

Cluster startup deadlock involving Lucene static initialization bits   From https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-6482  > during startup of Elasticsearch nodes: From the last 2 stack traces, you see that there are 2 things happening in parallel: Loading of Codec.class (because an Index was opened), but in parallel, Elasticsearch seems to initialize the PostingsFormats.class in the class CodecModule (Elasticsearch).In my opinion, this should not happen in parallel, but a fix would maybe that CodecModule should also call Codecs.forName()(Codecs depend on PostingsFormat and some PostingsFormats depend on the Codec class, which then hangs if PostingsFormats and Codecs are initialized from 2 different threads at same time, waiting for each other).But we have no chance to prevent this (unfortunately).I cannot say for sure, but something seems to be fishy while initializing Elasticsearch, because there is too much happening at the same time.In my opinion, Codecs and Postingsformats and Docvalues classes should be initialized sequentially, but I have no idea how to enforce this.

Shard relocations keep failing after node restart   Hi,  We're running ES version 2.1.0.When doing yesterday rolling restart of nodes (glibc patching), the first server was restarted, shard allocation was set to all and all went great.When second node was restarted, after coming back it was stuck with some shards in 'RELOCATING' state for a few hours.When checked logs, they were constatly flooded with the exception below.I do not understand why to mapping problem appears, as the node was fresh and didn't have any indices / mappings.This went smooth - shards (primaries/replicas) were allocated fine on all three nodes and no exceptions since deleting old indices.Today we wanted to apply the security patches to the third node and repeated situation - restarted third node (according to procedure described on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/_rolling_restarts.html) -again, when node came back, some shards are stuck in RELOCATING state, which never changes and logs are flooded with the strange exception above.Not sure if it's a bug, but please check if this could be related to any internals of Eleasticsearch - the operation we executed was very easy rolling cluster restart, which resulted in unstability in two out of three tries.

Matter Registry not working for Modded Items   #### Issue Description: I used the Matter Register command (specifically Itemstack, due to the fact Ore would not work for what I was doing), it worked for a while, and the items are placed into the config and can be cloned and analyzed, but as soon as I leave the world, weither it be crash, computer shutdown, or simply clicking exit of MC, and come back, the items I had just registered no longer are registered , however they're still in the config.I've tried modifying the config, changing the numbers or anything really, but it does not work, the effect remains the same.The only way to fix it is to re-register, but that just repeats it all over again as soon as I leave.#### What happens: Anything I register will unregister as soon as I log out of MC, but will remain in the config  #### What you expected to happen: I expect that when I register an item, that it remains registered, even when I log out, so that I may use the mod on them  #### How to reproduce: Use the /matter_register command to register an item, and log out of MC, and log back on, also check config  #### Affected Versions1.12.2  #### Crash report, if relevent There is no crash to report  EDIT: I said it was modded items, but I editted it because it's also happening with normal items to, as I just found out sadly.

Eureka: eurekaClient shutdown on context /pause but won't restart on /resume   `EurekaServiceRegistry.unregister()` *shuts down* the EurekaClient when asked to unregister the current registration.The `EurekaAutoServiceRegistration` is a `SmartLifecycle` whose `stop()` method is invoked when the current context is closed.When called, it tries to unregister the application.Problem is nothing will restart the Eureka client when the context is (re-)started, during a `/resume` for instance.So its `shutdown` method will be automatically invoked when the application context is destroyed.--> we could remove the call to `eurekaClient.shutdown()` from `EurekaServiceRegistry` and let Spring invoke the destroy method when it feels appropriate.However, this approach is causing the following exception:  `Invocation of destroy method failed on bean with  name 'scopedTarget.eurekaClient': org.springframework.beans.factory.Singleton bean creation not allowed while singletons of this factory are in destruction (Do not request a bean from a BeanFactory in a destroy method implementation!)

In my opinion, this "feature" should be removed entirely from NewPipe, following the data protection principle of "Datensparsamkeit" (a.k.a. "data economy", i.e., reduce the amount of data collected to the absolute minimum).If there are good reasons to continue to collect this information, however, the implementation needs to be improved to ensure users' privacy (otherwise, one of our USPs, "privacy", doesn't apply):- implement multiple providers (I'd say at least 5) and choose a random one every time (round-robin like)   - ask user whether they want to share this information, maybe with a checkbox they can uncheck, and request service only when the user confirms they want to send a mail(i.e., don't auto fetch it when the activity is shown)By the way, according to https://major.io/icanhazip-com-faq/, the software is open source, but the requests are all logged and there is no word about deletion of logs.

This is mostly to reduce lag as nothing can handle the previous setup without serious lag.Also, I had an issue that when sorting my items into new drives, the BHUs on storage buses weren't receiving any items, even though they had a higher priority than the drives/cells; this wasn't an issue at all with the QSUs.If you want any more details, please ask here or on the ATM3 Discord as I see you there a lot too.
Sample projects stop detecting surfaces after some time (Moto G6)But after launching and closing them several times, suddenly the feature points are not shown, and surfaces are not detected anymore.The camera is working but it behaves as if there wasn't any planes in the environment.Rebooting the phone makes the apps work again, but then after a few tests, surface detection does not work again.

(start/stop in onResume/onPause)- FragmentTabHost in that Activity with 5 Fragments using SpiceManager to fetch data - Every of the 5 fragments has a call to SpiceManager.dontNotifyAnyRequestListeners() in onPause() so they won't receive any callback when they cannot update their UI - Fragments implement RequestListener and onRequestSuccessMy retry policy is set to 0 retries - if request fails, just don't retry anymoreSo when I am on Fragment#1, switch to Fragment#2 and then go back to Fragment#1This results in a fact that when I pass in 'this' (which is the Fragment itself) as a callback into SpiceManager asynchronous execute request method then swapping between tabs won't invalidate those callback listeners.What I do to crash it is that I switch the device to offline mode and try to jump between tabs and watch for the results.If I switch between the tabs with some reasonable speed, then everything works fine.Problems start when I speed up.I get a callback to onRequestFailure which tries to update UI that is not yet created resulting in a crashI think the problem might be with the fact that dontNotifyAnyRequestListeners is asynchronous as described in the docs/source code and that is why responses are able to get received nevertheless.Same thing would be for onRequestSuccess as it also did happen when being online (offline is just easier to reproduce the issue as responses come back quickly).however is the fact that response reaches the Fragment even though Fragment is in a wrong state and its lifecycle is not considered in terms of response delivery.

Test fails if trying to stop container that's already been stoppedBut, when trying to tear things down (I also have the clean option set), things blow up.What I'm thinking is happening is that the test tears down the container being used for testing (wildfly-docker), but the autoStart (or clean?) is also trying to tear it down.that modifies the `DockerCube`'s `stop` and `destroy` methods to ignore `NotFoundException`s.If such an exception is thrown, the container has stopped and is no longer accessible, so has effectively been destroyed.If you have another suggestion/idea on how to fix this, I'd love to chat and work on another idea!

``  If I create an explosion with a radius higher than normal blocks disappear on 1.13.2 (and probably lower) that are actually still present on the server.if a few TNT blocks explode it's pretty much guaranteed.I did not test with any other 1.14.x client because the protocol changes are minimal.
When replication resumes _active_tasks still returns a 400 error   When the app goes offline and returns online, the replication resumes and docs are replicated.But the `_active_tasks` endpoint on the listener still returns the error as shown below, as if the app was still offline.And the `error` property in the response can be used to show that sync is currently paused/offline.This can be reproduced with liteserv-android (kick off continuous replication, check `_active_tasks` response, go offline or stop sync gateway, go back online, check `_active_tasks` and replication should resume).
Factory.shutdown(timeout, unit) does not guarantee threadpool shuts-downThe following code at https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/blob/master/hystrix-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/hystrix/HystrixThreadPool.java#L146 ignores the return value from awaitTermination called on the ThreadPoolExecutor.There's no guarantee that the executor has terminated.The message in the RuntimeException that is thrown if there's an InteruptedException indicates that the intention is to make sure the ThreadPool is properly shutdown, so I think this is an exceptional state.Typically I would put this in a loop even though this somewhat changes the semantics of timeout / unit to be a frequency to check.BTW this particularly causes problems in tests (where Hystrix.reset is called a lot) and there are Hystrix managed threads that get put to sleep a lot.My use-case is a Hystrix command that wraps the HTTP call to SQS, which lets you wait up to 20sec for a message.

A child SpringApplication can cause SpringApplicationAdmin MBean to indicate that the application is ready when it's not   STS boot dash uses the lifecycle JMX admin bean (i.e by passing VMSometimes the app passes the 'READY' check, yet aparantly the port(s) are not yet set.This creates a race condition for STS (See https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/125728671) because STS waits until the app is 'READY' and then tries to determine the port its running on.But because of the slight delay... this means STS sometimes gets 'unknown' (actually 'null').I've addressed it on our end by adding a wait loop that polls the port after app enters ready state.I'm not sure its really a bug, but it seems like one to me because...If so then I would also expect that asking the app what the port is, should already work.Anyhoo... if you do not think its a real bug or not worth fixing, that is fine.But I thought I'd at least report it and let you decide what to do about it (if anything).Further useful info: I'm not sure this affects all versions of boot.But I only recently found a reliable way to reproduce and debug (and fix)In other words I have only really been able to observe the problem with Boot 1.4.

This map uses reference equality in place of the object equality that was used in prior versions, when the class used `HashMap`.For context, we have some tests internally that are failing in 1.8 as they were written with object equality in mind.For example, the following fails in 1.8 but passes in prior versions, which upon immediate inspection wasn't intuitive, as `InetSocketAddress#equals` returns `true` when comparing the two different objects:    I'm interested in the motivation for the change in semantics (talking with @lukaszx0 in person, he recalls some talk about this previously).Or, perhaps this wasn't the original intention and it would be possible to revert to using a `HashMap`, although the benchmarks seem to indicate this would be slightly slower than the current impl.

Inconsistent raw data in Row returned from BuffReaderFixedParser vs BuffReaderDelimParser   If a user chooses to keep a copy of the raw data in the returned row, both BuffReaderDelimParser and BuffReaderFixedParser add the parsed line to the row that is returned.There is a difference though in that if the line is longer than the metadata indicates, the line is first truncated to the specified length.In BuffReaderDelimParser, the line is first parsed to columns, then if there are too many columns the extra columns are removed from the array but the orignal line is left unchanged and set in the returned Row.I realize that this might create an issue with users already relying on the current behavior.

When opening a large folder (~1.5GB) on the Android NextCloud application on my phone, the application will load for a couple seconds, then crash.Removing a few files from the folder solves the issue, so I believe the issue has something to do with the amount of data stored in the folder rather than the number of files.Cleared data and cache for application.Deleted roughly 50 megabytes of data from the folder, which stopped the crashing.Folder causing issues: !
