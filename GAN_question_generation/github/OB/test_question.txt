Can you reproduce the bug every time you close SQL Developer? Could you try reinstalling and see if anything changes? 
Do you mind sharing the files you tried to run?
How are LUGARES-contador and LUGARES declared? I really doubt that there is a bug in sprintf, it's more likely a bug in your own code. 
Do you have any suggestions? There's no way to know whether you have specified a "bad" path in the classpath. We could perhaps bail out if we detect that we have spent more than X amount of time processing a classpath entry, or that the resulting JAR file has grown above Y GB. 
Do you use BungeeCord?
Does cancel not happen only for some particular long-running queries or for any query? You can test it by running query like "SELECT SLEEP(10);" 
Which clue?

Did this ever work? When did it stop working?
Can you please share a minimal example that reproduces the failure? Looking at the auto-configuration and your description, I cannot see why there's no bean of type `ConsumerFactory<Object, Object>`. It should have been created by `KafkaAutoConfiguration`:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/2c9cf6511efd8453b39e1c31d66996e8da9b1e33/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/kafka/KafkaAutoConfiguration.java#L82-L86

could you attach the image file? or add it as a pull request to https://github.com/nom-tam-fits/blackbox-images if we may use the image as a test for the future? 
Did you name this provider `TemporaryConfigSourceProvider`? Because the exception seems to be about a class that already exists in Quarkus: [TemporaryConfigSourceProvider.java](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/core/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/runtime/configuration/TemporaryConfigSourceProvider.java)

Can you supply more information? Not reproducible for me with current master. 
Do you have any other plugins that prevent/allow players to build in the world? It could be a conflict with one of those.

Do you have the example command that you ran when you encountered this issue? 
Can you confirm that you saw this on 0.13.0 (or earlier)? If you want to try out the latest 0.14.0 RC you should find you get a meaningful error message.

Could you try this? Move > inst = Class.forName(className, true, pluginLoader).newInstance();  out of lock control, it should work.
Can you elaborate a bit more, what does happen in this case? In the example, it looks like the value1 reference (or value) is reassigned to value1+value2. That does not modify any internal object, or am I overlooking something? 
Do you still have it with latest versions? 
Could you please provide me a step by step procedure that I could follow to reproduce it ?  Thanks Hervé
Can you do a Pull Request ? I will merge-it to the master version.  All the best,

Do we have tests to cover this case? 
Can you provide a screenshot of the loot with the corresponding config file that causes it? Thanks!

Would you mind sharing your default encoding and OS? To find your default encoding quickly, you can run `java -XshowSettings` in your system console and it will be listed as `file.encoding` near the top.  I should hopefully be able to fix this by making it explicitly write the files as UTF-8.
Could you verify that 2.6.1-SNAPSHOT fixes it?  
Could you link or attach a zip that this occurs with?
How often does it happen? I just tried the room about five times and audio worked as I would expect every time (I could hear the clip the whole time). I have seen audio issues on the quest that were fixed by a device restart. I also verified my device was running the current runtime (v12).

Can we test this specifically before we make a change? The solution will be a bit interesting too, since I'm not quite sure what to do here. 0x67 is hard coded onto Nanna, so she will definitely get the item. It's only a question of whether Leif will potentially take it too.
Would you be able to describe the problem in terms of the HTTP/2 spec, or where you are seeing unexpected behavior from Netty?  I'm a bit strapped for time :(  @danbev - can you help do a bit more digging?  Seems like you are the primary contributor to the aerogear project. 
What did you enter when you created the webcam? Make sure you don't have a trailing slash when creating the camera's IP address. We automatically append `/mjpg/video.mjpg` to the end of the URL if you don't do it. Alternatively, try using the address `10.17.36.12/mjpg/video.mjpg` and see if that works. 
Could you please try it out? For me, it works on the APK you have sent me and I'm pretty sure that it should solve the issue of nested try/catch blocks in general.

does this always occur, or only after doing a specific thing or asfter a specific amount of time? I am assuming it persists after restarts. Did you by chance use the /reload command? It is know to give issues with LoginSecurity. Are you using other non-standard plugins/tools (bungeecord, PerWorldPlugins, etc)? 
Can you think of a scenario where this new behavior would not make sense? 
What are example cards with search effects that caused it?  Can you explain more in detail what "gets stuck after passing priority back to you" exactly means? The problem occurs after you selected a card from your library or before?

Would you mind creating a PR for it? 
Could you give an example where it fails? Navigating to for example /root does not crash it, it merely shows an empty screen.

Does it work with chunk loading from mods other than FTB Utilities? E.g. ChickenChunks, Persistent Bits, Weirding Gadget? I've heard plenty of (admittedly anecdotal) evidence suggesting that chunk loading mods vary in reliability.
What is your 100% repeatable setup ? -How did you obtain the bow and bow enchantments (book ?) ? -Is it using anvil in creative mode / "battlemode" ? -Is the bow used/already enchanted ? 
Which version of Pi4J are you using?  If not using the 1.1-SNAPSHOT, then I would suggest giving that one a try.  The serial implementation has been completely re-written in 1.1-SNAPSHOT to be more robust and feature rich.   
What happened when you attempted it? At what point did you fail to get the expected result? What happened instead? Were there any errors in the log file? My best guess is that this is a bug that has already been fixed for the next release but without more information I can't know that.
Could you try that out and see if it helps?
Does it work compiled? 
Could you give that a go, rather than the hack?  Thanks. 
How do you configure it?

Could you provide a stack trace pls ? 
Can I push to the new Kapua repository? /CC @Coduz 
Do you have a stack trace? Is it one of these cases where it calls a potentially blocking POSIX call that, in practice, will never block with the way the sockets are configured? 
Does it happen always or only if you rotate the device while a notification is visible? I was able to reproduce this on a Note 3, but only when rotating. In my test, both sides were cut off. Is it like that on your device as well (if you compare the edges to the screenshots in the Play store)? 
Does this occur only on the specified device? Also, please provide a proper bug report (the issue template clearly says "a log snippet is NOT sufficient"). Thanks.
does doing that solve this problem without introducing other ones?  We're not supporting having multiple backends compiled at the same time, right? (it's not very hard to do though - I think we can simply have subfolders in `-kompiled` for each backend. like `lambda-kompiled/java`, `lambda-kompiled/maude` etc.

Do you have theses exceptions with the samples or with your own app ? How do you do multiple delete ?

How about we just blacklist redstone blocks? 
Why would this be a sponge problem? The block is already checking an event, and sponge is properly delegating that event to plugins, so I don't see the problem to do with sponge but more so with grief prevention.

Would you mind trying to reproduce this issue on `3.0.0`?   Also, could the permissions in `/var/run/neo4j` be such that the user neo4j is not authorized to create files in that location? 
Does that sound right to you? 
Maybe we could use **/rssetprices delindex INDEX** ? 
Can you confirm that it is neither of these? try using psychic (cannot aoe), and then check if anything additional that is attacked is breedable with what you hit.

Did you provide https in url and port in separate field? In my experience if I provide non-empty port (in my case I tried putting 443 there) it won't connect, but leaving port empty works just fine. I'm using similar setup to you - ssl from LE and nginx as reverse proxy. 
Would you be able to tell the SDK version of Instabug you're using?
Maybe we should ignore tokens that are just a number?

Can you explain this a bit mroe clearly? I have tried to set up similar tests. One side ignoring torches. one side set to only find truffles.   Both sides ignore truffles and mine things   ![1202](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/621529/63641615-0be48400-c666-11e9-9cf0-8ac1d01b513b.gif)

Did any message show up when you used plot auto? 
Do you need to just build jars or you want to execute JanusGraph tests? If you need jars use the next command: `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`. It doesn't resolve the issue but may help you build jars if you need them 
Could you post some sample query?   Note: I use ojdbc8 driver.
Can you grab a stack trace or use a profiler to help determine where the time is being spent? If it's several minutes, even jstack should catch it.

Don't we need to update master branch too?
Could you upload sample project (or code) which can reproduce the issue?   ---  **FYI**  While dragging, this library uses pre-rendered view image for dragging item. It seems something wrong when creating a pre-rendered bitmap image. If possible, try to debug the following method;  https://github.com/h6ah4i/android-advancedrecyclerview/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/h6ah4i/android/widget/advrecyclerview/draggable/DraggingItemDecorator.java#L411

Can you submit a PR to fix the problem? 
Can you try to remove the `type: opengl` facet from the display statement ?

does it happen with any process?
Can you replicate this with **only EssentialsX, PlotSquared and your plugin** (plus Vault and LP) installed?

Can you confirm if this is still happening in [snapshot 5](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/realistic-terrain-generation/files/2296032)? 
Do you have the log with the error ? For me upsert statement will be apply in your example, add on an element which exists : ([link](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/blob/master/janusgraph-es/src/main/java/org/janusgraph/diskstorage/es/ElasticSearchIndex.java#L573))

What do you get in response to this request? Which fields are not updated? 
Can you confirm if this problem exists with HABmin? 
Wouldn't the commands `/usb island remove Kissi` and `/usb island register Kissi` not work? Remove should clear the island name in the player file and in the island file, register speaks for itself then. 
Did you check the usage data for (dangerous) restrictions which are not yet restricted? 
What do your tests look like?

Which URL & which JSON? 
Do you have a slightly more complete project that I can have a look at that reproduces the problem you see?  On a sidenote. Instead of           .withFields(Arrays.asList(UserAgent.AGENT_NAME, UserAgent.OPERATING_SYSTEM_NAME))  this has the same effect          .withField(UserAgent.AGENT_NAME)         .withField(UserAgent.OPERATING_SYSTEM_NAME)

Does anyone have an explanation for those color differences? 
Can you attach the yaml or json for one of the configmaps containing one of these plans? I can see if I can reproduce quickly with that.  The second error is just broken error handling which is an easy fix.
What's your opinion @stefan-niedermann? I don't care at all :smile:   
Do you still have or can reproduce the corresponding logs?    b. What did you do to get these errors?    c. Does it happen only with synchronous queries?  Grégory  PS: In parallel, I will try to find a solution to avoid in the future this "Committed" error. But if you already have suggestion... 
Does the (real) test actually need to execute the real code of some methods, while others are mocked? 2) null is the default result for any method returning a reference type, so recording "result = null" for them is redundant. Or is there something I missed? 
May I know  is there any work around  approach to make it work ?  
Does it just crash after double-clicking?
Can you try again with snapshots?
What if instead of    ?

Does this happen if no other mods are installed?
Can you confirm if this has been addressed? 
Can you also mention CC and p++ versions? 
Did it produce any stack trace in the output? It sounds like maybe executors are dying and something isn't retrying correctly in some way.  
What was the scenario that this happened in which the exportFile didn't have a parent? Was it an output file at the root of the drive? i.e. `/myOutput.txt`?
Couldn't you just use regular string interpolation here?  i.e. 
Does the command line output show any errors or warnings?  If so, please provide them here.  If not, can you detail exactly what happens when you experience this behavior? 
Can you post the full stacktrace, including the nested one?  Also, how is what you are doing different from this test case?  https://github.com/objectify/objectify/blob/v5/src/test/java/com/googlecode/objectify/test/ValueTranslationTests.java#L266

Can you post an example album?
Can you please test with the 2.4.3-SNAPSHOP release?

How is the status of the stage file after the firs filescanner run? It may take a while until the core processes the new or updated files ... 
May I ask you to check whether this is the case for you? I change the type of this issue to 'question'. I'll put it back to 'bug' in case we can rule out the foreground service reason. LMK.

What OS is this?
Could you please include some logs from the Graylog server when the issue appears? That may help us to better understand the reason for it.

Can you please provide a small github repo which demonstrates the problem? Then we can investigate. Thanks.

What container are you using? Are you able to provide a sample that reproduces the issue? 
Could you get me logs of a startup please?
Which version of WorldPainter is this? Are you sure it's not because those objects have a negative y offset (either in the object itself or in the layer settings), causing them to be buried?  If so, could you attach the .world file (or a small test world which displays the same issue)? 
Can you check in your logs which exception is thrown? 
What are you trying to use this for?

Could you try again with latest release (0.1.2)? Thanks
Can you check if this is fine?
What version of OH? Have you refactored for the latest changes?  I probably won't have time to look at this until late next week, but please answer the above...
Does that happen allways? Something calls the "playerTick" twice at the same time. That should not happen, GT does not know how to handle that and crashes. I can somehow prevent that crash, but some random other mod is really at fault here. 
What version?
Does it happen with admin charge feeder?
What Android version are you using? 2. Do you mean it happens when you select a picture in the Android gallery and tap "Share" and then select the Commons app? Does it happen to you if you select a picture using the upload button within the app? 3. Could we have some logs if possible please? :)

does it work if you use it in english?
Can you please try the latest [dev build](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/hadoop/master/install.html#download-dev)? It provides a fix for this (the lack of mapping caused the Spark integration to be tripped off by the data as it did not expect it to appear because of the mapping).
