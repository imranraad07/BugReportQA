No I didn't found any as I tweaked the oregen with ThermalFoundation Worldgen options. I copied this file from the Feed The Beast Infinity PAck but the *.json file was not right formatted so there was no orespawn :D  But it's fixed now. 
I'll try to make a small example asap. Thanks! 
Confirmed!
As per the pervious link I believe this is a sam docker issue wrt storage where the class path ends up being broken due to failed mounting or scp. awslabs/aws-sam-cli#1092
Slight performance hit on island-load. It will sample the y=0 coordinate below the island, as well as the 4 corners. If any of these contain bedrock, it will wipe the lower 4 layers of the island (issue a warning, and do it after 10 seconds - giving players a short time to flee, if they are roaming the flatland). It will remove one layer at a time, starting from the bottom, and do this asynchroneous - to minimize server-load/lag. 
Hello,     The test case code I have created to provide is not duplicating the behavior like the application code. The only difference that i can determine at this time is the temporary HashMap that is used to store the bytes for the user before election to dump to a file.     Without changing anything other then the build jars, 3.8.10.1 to the current exempts the behavior described above. I will not be able to investigate further for a day or two. It may be a problem with the current code jar build created on my end. The environment is JRE 7.     I would not classify this as a BUG at this time without further work on my end.  danap.   
I can not even assign a name to a flow, not sure if it is what we wanted.

I don't. I didn't know that I needed to for a read operation. Should I be calling the read from a try/catch/finally block and shutting down the graph? 
@lbensaad, I feel like we had an issue for that already, but I can't find it. Yeah, open up a new issue.
I am fine with providing it to you personally to investigate, but do not want to publish it publicly. I'll see if I can provide a sanitized stripped down simple example.
So from your experiment we can conclude that a value was printed which had a different in-memory representation than the reference value. Hypotheses:  * an equals method which was implemented wrongly (producing false where it should have produced true)    * this may happen sound like something about annotations went wrong, but that would have been the inverse situation I believe. `equals` should include annotations (and isEqual not).    * we forgot to override `equals and hashCode` somewhere, like in one of those annotation or keyword parametere wrapper classes    * we have a rarely triggered bug in an existing equals method, let's say one of the locations or the datetime implementations.
These are (currently) necessary, because the file import has to continue even when the app is not shown. And there would be no other way to see the progress. A batch import of more files can take a long time, and runs in background. What other way would there be to see the progress? Suggestions?  
Yes, this seems to be an edge case around cluster sizing. It does appear that this will occur if one of the nodes is at capacity in the cluster (CPU in this case). I've deployed the same code on clusters that have worker nodes with more resources without issue. And, yes, this is on Mesos 0.25.0. 
Yeah, the /NPC name command toggles it on or completely off. What I mean is the name plate showing only when the NPC is being looked at instead of showing all the time. It used to be like that before 1.9. Currently name tags used on regular mobs give the effect I'm talking about 
Hi @eivantsov, still happens on 1.10  Ill dig into the script and see which part is triggering the issue then raise the issue with the appropriate repo :)  Thanks for the help
So far, no 403 errors. I'm kind of busy right now, but I will check again in the next few days and test out some users with gfys to see if I get any 403s.  I know this is for RipMe, but any idea why 403 errors coming up for Gonewilder as well? It's also having trouble with vidme videos. Downloading very slow or not at all. I'm wondering if it's similar issues that seem to have just been fixed in the latest RipMe patch you committed. 
Quite often...lets say 50% typically I am using this for new cache notification mails. The problem is it happens only once for each cache, because on every new click on the link it opens right away as the cache is stored in the cache. Maybe something got corrupted in my database. I will try a clean install with the current nightly. 
For example; I call a friend to see a car on the map and when I pull away it can have access to my username and password. 
Certain files within the BukkitAPI cause this to trigger. Specifically org/bukkit/permissions/PermissionDefault in this case, though there's probably others
I have it setup with default ( = different from minimal) security, and _SYSTEM/SYS doesn't work here; I have to use my own username/password. 
I make a check before any putToken if the zone is the correct zone for the token. If not remember the current zone renderer, change it to the one with the token (that will not change the UI), putToken with correct zone and restore the zone renderer.  Basically change every "putToken" to something like 3-4 lines, of course encapsulated in a nice method ;)

Apologies, I wasn't clear. In the example code I sent, the lunch break is given a small (20 minute) window in which it can be "delivered". This would, at least I think, make it more likely that routes are generated with the lunch break unassigned, thus causing the cost penalty override to be applied. You could give the lunch break a wider window in which it can be taken and the problem still occurs, though.  In practical terms, it is more important to insert a break than a job for legal compliance. The cost of a break not being in the route should be (and I think is in the current code) disproportionately high.  With the random component to the problem appearing, I'm trying to identify "special" measures the code takes which then gives the break location an identity. In LocalActivityInsertionCostsCalculator, you appear to have initially added some provision for breaks being handled differently, perhaps you had something in mind here as a problem? 
Checked it again with build #546. The form works now correct on all browsers.  Only the message "PaperUI works ..." ist not completely visible on Edge: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/616792/19492035/77426480-9575-11e6-8169-011f651c592a.png)

@hsz Unfortunately I have not seen this error repeat itself again, but I will see if there's any way to trigger it reliably. 
JabRef 3.7-dev--snapshot--2016-11-10--master--2441675 windows 7 6.1 amd64  Java 1.8.0_111  I tried the reset & import issue with the above version. Unfortunately still the same behavior. 
Ok, so I started fixing the Unicode errors, but after that I started getting more errors about the javadoc  and realized that all the errors I got are javadoc related event the Unicode one, so running `gradlew.bat setupCIWorkspace build -x javadoc` will not really fix the issues, but will exclude the javadoc.
used 1015 to patch. and copied all files/folder except server.proprieties . On my pc the patch works. after i upload it to ftp. they don't. and i get the first error if i try to repatch . will try the latest 
Dear Harald,  Indeed I verified that no PeptideShaker instance was running and even did a reboot to be completely sure. All seems to work fine when doing the search with SearchGUI, I am able to view, save and even export the project without issues. I only get the error when reopening the saved project. I have attached the full log, hope this helps.  Cheers, PJ  [PeptideShaker.log.txt](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker/files/349459/PeptideShaker.log.txt) 
yes I tried without any texture pack. It happens even without optifine. 
Hi @muffinjello  I did try the AndroidX migration just to find that Android studio detected no AndroixX usage so, that warning must be misleading from Flutter. Finally I have managed to make it work using the below approach and honestly I am not happy with this plugin conflicts with required SDKs etc. While I understand that Flutter is relatively new and these plugins are generous contributions from the Flutter family, they need to ensure that any Flutter version upgrades don't break things line this.  Ok, the core issue came down to 2 plugins(and esp. these versions) which I was using ...  flutter_webview_plugin: ^0.3.5 google_maps_flutter: ^0.5.16  so, if I just use the flutter_webview_plugin: ^0.3.5, I get the below errors and the APK build fails ..  > Initializing gradle...                                              0.7s > Resolving dependencies...                                           1.6s > D8: Program type already present: android.support.v4.os.ResultReceiver$1 >                                                                          > FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.                                 >                                                                          > * What went wrong:                                                       > Execution failed for task ':app:transformDexArchiveWithExternalLibsDexMergerForRelease'. > > com.android.builder.dexing.DexArchiveMergerException: Error while merging dex archives:  if I use just the flutter_webview_plugin: ^0.3.5 . ...

Yeah, `/tmp` is mounted with `tmpfs`, I should have titled this "when there's no space left for cache", since this necessarily doesn't have to do with RAM. I couldn't try the bug with regular disk space, there's too much of it. I didn't understand the last bit of your message though. 
tl;dr : it mostly depends on the volume of the tracks/song I'm listening to, some tracks I had the volume increased using easyMP3Gain, they're the troublesome ones, as lowering the media volume via the button on the side of the phone, will also lower the volume of the announcement by OpenTracks, with some other songs the volume of the song is similar to the volume of the announcement in OpenTracks so when the media player output is lowered it's  easier to hear the OT announcement, still I would increase OT's volume a bit if I could ( especially during rides ).  I did a few tests and realized in OpenTracks the volume of the media player output was only lowered not muted entirely, ( muted as no sound but the announcement, similar to Tasks or OsmAnd ).  I think I noticed a slight difference between Odyssey and VLC, to the benefit of Odyssey, but it's hard to tell because it change on a song to song basis as described above, in both media player volume is only lowered not silenced though.  When I poked around the sound settings in the parameter's menu of the phone ( four separate volume settings : Ringtone ; Media ; Notifications ; System ) , I noticed that in Tasks the announcements are channelled through the Notifications one ( in OsmAnd user can choose where they want the Voice Guidance to go to through in Settings>Navigation settings>choose a specific profile> under Voice select Voice guidance output and choose ) while in OpenTracks it's through the Media output thus I can set the volume separately for media player and announcements for Tasks but for OpenTracks the volume is changed for both media player and announcement through the media setting ( or the button on the side of the phone for that matter ) 
Sure, that would work, but is this a hoop that the user should need to jump through? Perhaps it's rare enough not to worry about?
1.13.2  Just downloaded it last night, and I use it via MultiMC to add the zip to the base image.  It isn't a big problem.  Sort of nonsensical usage.  But the world is full of dumb people (even me) :-) 
@dordsor21 I just tried it a second ago and it still happens :(
An example Rmd file that is long enough:  [MultipleRegExample.txt](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/files/3374654/MultipleRegExample.txt) 
Yeah, it doesn't show that warning to me, but asks for the fingerprint as usual.  I'm not really familiar with mobile dev stuff, where can I find the logs?
Yes the command works, only the sign breaks
Tried to stop it with CTRL+C.  It happened to me during the old game of starting the cluster in office network, put macbook to sleep, open it again in hotel/home network and having the funny state of stale IPs in non-existant subnets. Probably nothing that happens to production servers but some change caused this to happen in the current master it seems and I don't know what other ES cluster connection states can cause this.  Probably close the ticket until somebody else complains or it happens to one of us. 
It's OK for me, Thank you.
havent bothered to find their github yet, and i dont know enough about the API to know if returning null is valid or not
Now crashed when I add Pam's HarvestCraft 1.6.2 v1.1.2   - http://pastebin.com/Q9AEEGgD 
I don't unfortunately since it is a auto-reported crash.  It looks like it is incorrectly determining the maker note shot info which is a set of either int16u or int16s types.  I will try to get some more info on the  photo being processed.    However, the code path from int32u to setObjectArray() doesn't support this type of call.  This would at least need some checks to validate the array before use. 
No, I haven't. The rebar.config file has only one dependency: cowboy and it includes de lastest version already so, afaik, running `$ rebar3 upgrade` would have no effect. At which point should I've run rebar3 upgrade?  Thnx!

Yes spring retry is on the class path and @EnableRetry annotation is in place. I do see a retry if I introduce a network failure, however do not see a retry for the status codes that I define in my configuration.  dependencies is setup in maven as follows:  
Just update your version, a mute mic button is now available. 
@serge-rider Oracle does indeed have auto-generated columns, as of 12c.   See: https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1  Also, see my DDL above.  Notice the ID column is `NUMBER generated as identity`. When I run that DDL, and then use DBeaver to try to re-generate the DDL, it generates the following:  I believe DBeaver should always skip columns that are marked as `GENERATED ALWAYS`... Or maybe just `GENERATED`.  
I will try to organize such a device. 
nope. fixed. Thanks a bunch. didn't notice the update until I was told from the discord.

Hey @nezihyigitbasi , sure we can test to see if the new version has fixed the issue. For time being, we will increase the timeout for hive metas-tore RPCs to mitigate the issue.

@jpountz I didn't expect the numbers to be highlighted in the query. To say the truth, we only realized we were automatically including numeric fields in the "highlight" section after this error came up (it is an ID in the real scenario). Maybe this should be an error, but with a different message, like "numeric values cannot be highlighted" or something like that.

Wow! It is fixed in 1.5.3-SNAPSHOT. I will close this issue.

Yeah so if I set the config option to 4 and give donators the permission bskyblock.team.maxsize.20 with LuckPerms they can still only invite 3 team members instead of 19.
@skabashnyuk  Sure, I got it.
I did indeed use IMGT reference. These are column 10 and 12 of the full exportClones output:    For the rest, it seems to work fine - I didn't notice this until trying to parse it with tcR. 
The only entry in the bug report is the xtandem command. There are no errors. It looks like it sends the command and then tandem starts but doesn't really do anything. The window just scrolls "G" along the left edge and nothing else. When I run tandem from the SG folder from the command line, it also scrolls that "G" and never finishes.   I've narrowed it down to something in the parameter file. I started playing around with running tandem alone from the SG folder and from the tandem that I downloaded separately and using the tandem default_input.xml. Both ran fine until I used the parameters_searchGUI.xml file instead.   I downloaded a fresh copy of SG, created a very basic parameter set, and it seems to be running. And interestingly, there is no scrolling "G" as it runs. Maybe that is some way it shows it is in error?   Now I have to add back in my modifications and other settings and see if it continues to run OK. This time it finished in 18 minutes instead of sitting 3 days :-).  So the problem is solved, but I am still not sure what the cause was. Maybe something got corrupted in that parameter file and Tandem wasn't smart enough to send an error back so both were just stuck.  Angela

I mis-typed. I had this bug occur several times, figured out how to fix the units, did so, but attached a save with only one damaged unit when the bug recurred.   Gm editing the damage on the unit not appearing in the repair bay also causes it to reappear.

My bad:) I just migrated to 2.0.7 JS and expiriencing another problem described here https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere-javascript/issues/50 This issue can be closed 
I think they got disconnected out of some reason not related to BanManager. This might be an issue with ProtocolLib, but BanManager seems to have issues with that happening.  The first two lines are what happened before the actual stacktrace https://pastebin.com/zJ8G8N8a  So complete log would be Player connect, player immediate disconnect, BanManager throws this error once and Protocollib spams it's stack trace a couple of time. 
@gunterze, the problem still seems to persist when accessed from a private window. The specific installation I'm currently working with is running on a Vagrant VM, but I've also experienced the issue with installations not running on VMs. For the time being, I've still just gone through all Web Applications and removed the property, which seems to work.  ![Screenshot from 2020-03-03 08-15-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28839674/75751657-4a4eb000-5d27-11ea-8735-6de5cf950da3.png)

Here is a way to reproduce the problem :   On an empty database, create the following data:  CREATE (s1:Planet {name:"test"});  CREATE (s2:Planet {name:"test"})-[:MdxPath]->(p:Planet);  MATCH (s:Planet {name:"test"}) CREATE (s)-[:Attribute]->(net:Attribute);  And then here is the statement that produces an NPE:  MATCH (s:Planet {name:"test"}) WITH s OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:MdxPath]->(p:Planet) WITH [id(p),p.path] as pl, s MATCH (s)-[:Attribute]->(net:Attribute) OPTIONAL MATCH (s)<-[:Provided]-(c:Counter) RETURN collect(distinct(pl)), collect(distinct(net)), collect(distinct(c))

@neozwu Hi, I do something trick to bypass using appengine ThreadFactory  Then I will use java default thread factory and it works.  My repo has too many dependencies, I will give more info later.  Thanks ^
First, I got rid of those .()'s. I didn't keep the original java files and corresponding java.json files. So we don't know which programs produces these bugs. BTW, there are just so many of the programs having these .() outputs. This might be a problem of the dom driver.

OK, I had installed the wrong build. I have reinstalled 0.1.1 (without -jdk7) and now run into the old problem.    `~/.bazelrc` doesn't exist on my system. 
there is minor bug in Pagination - when you are on the last page, next page button is still clickable 
@mattjacunski Firstly, thanks a lot for you library!  Yes, I downloaded 3.1.5 version and tried it. On my Nexus 5 I couldn't reproduce this issue on your SampleApp, but I reproduced in my application. On Nexus 4 Android 4.4.2 I reproduced on your SampleApp and in my application. I made only one change - add  : scanIntent.putExtra(CardIOActivity.EXTRA_LANGUAGE_OR_LOCALE, "ru"); And then put date in expiration field. When I tried to replace date I could delete only 3 symbols except first. 
Sure!  https://github.com/rotilho/sleuth-feign-cycle

The user said the most of gifs, i will reply you as soon as i got the the confirm information from the users.  
My previous release was some months old, from July. At that time, the path was "/usr/bin:/bin" - anything else had to be explicity referenced with an absolute path or placed in the evnironment.  The "exec env -" shows the you are trying to clear the environment, but then you place a leaky definition of PATH coming from the operator's console. That seems like a problem, particularly in standalone mode.  This genrule should illustrate the issue:   
They do. They last permanently and do not remove themselves even after relogging.

Hi @bleskes! This is from Jepsen 4fdf509d82620ac59b4daf4e6a21f9495c73e68a--just `cd elasticsearch; lein test`. I've been breaking up the test suites in hopes of actually having Jepsen As A Library instead of a big monolithic hairball, haha. Slow going so far. ;-)  I've also switched to using scan scroll, but it doesn't seem to have any effect on observed data loss--I can reproduce it with both a `size: n` query or a scrolling one.

Of course, the Android Version is 6.0.1 (Stock-Rom) / Sony Z2 (last Patch from March 2016).
@tsmaeder hard to say for sure.
Nope. I was fooling around with some other machines in that world and it still was like that. 
I was using OpenLiberty 18.0.0.3, and profile `javaee-8.0`. Changing to OpenLiberty 18.0.0.4, it's working the way I wanted, thanks @aguibert.
Aha, more information needed to reproduce this. When running the zip I get the correct documentation. But when I apply the following enunciate.xml file that I use then it appear again. So if the default generation is used, then the documentation is correctly generated. This this is even more of a corner case than I realized.    
It happens every time. I just reproduced it on the current develop branch using Windows and Eclipse Proton. But it happened to everyone in the team project with Linux and Oxygen.   ![missing_connection_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/47085653-8e671080-d217-11e8-809c-9ba58c0e9b14.png)  ![missing_connection_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/47085656-9030d400-d217-11e8-9a62-9144a87755e8.png)  There should be a connection between NewFeature1 and Priorities.
I'll try to reproduce the issue, I already corrected everything.  For the record, so far 0.10 is working great, it resolved my endlessly spinning problems on 0.9.3/4 (why I was still using 0.8).  I'm still monitoring, but things look good.  I'll rebuild from backups into a test environment and re-upgrade and see if I can repeat the issue for you. 
Sorry, I can't replicate the error. I'll close the ticket!  Once again: Awesome app! :) 
Should be doable, let me have a dig

yeah, it is still running. I am not able to connect in remote mode using yourkit. Can you tell me the steps? 
Simply a service with a configuration:    will lose `/mycontext` if `@Client(id = "myservice")` will be annotated with `@JacksonFeatures`, as I wrote before I think the problem is how a new client is created in HttpClientIntroductionAdvice#getClient.      
Build 1344 
sorry, # 1858 from yesterday 
I currently only deploy one WAR and two EJBs (a local logger EJB and a "regular" EJB project for all my data). 
@dietzc Thanks for helping to reproduce! 
Well I use MassiveCombat in terms of keepinventory, but it should only apply if you have a PvP flag.  The duplication happens when the item is dropped on death, then there is an actual stack (they stack on each other) on the floor, which is then also picked up as stack in addition to the other items that already existed.  I already set the oversized-stacksize of essentials to one to stop such non-stackables vom stacking, but it still happens.
All launchers, and I've tested it much, display clone icon badge correctly. Maximum that I saw - icon mask cuts badge at border, and but no any more. 
@orhanobut same as @glocci here
4.0.2 seems like its going to work I am going to publish app now and see if it works in a live environment. Locally it is running fine. Thanks!
There are several ways of making it noticable: - Spawn a block and notice that it is way too small. - Connecting blocks, making the arguments change text and thus length - Carefully move the knot to the point (frame) where its index changes and the arguments aswell, in most cases the arguments are now larger then the block. (but if you keep moving it resizes sort of correctly again, this one is really precise.) - Everything where the total argument length suddenly changes. 
The exact ecid. Just paste your ecid into iCloud, select and copy it and then paste it into blobsaver
Apologizes for the late reply. For some reason, I wasn't notified by email about your messages.  I'm afraid the problem remains using JabRef-5.0-dev--snapshot--2019-07-15--master--e89d60370.jar.  My locales are in french.
Thanks to both Tyler and Eugene for the comments. I will try Tyler's suggestion and update this thread.  @eivantsov : I have opened the ephemeral port range (32768-65535 - both TCP/UDP) for the cloud server. I am not sure where to find the correct logs for workspace agent. In the dev-machine container, I see the following log. No errors as such.    
Yes. I get the crash every time i run it on mac either through eclipse or console. However, it runs fine on linux VM or emr.   The crash happens within 2-3 minutes 
Here are latest test results. This time it looks like stably reproducible.  This time, I downloaded the app from Play Store on a physical device with Android 6.0.1. Followed this procedure: 1. Initial settings of the app -> 2. Tap "Take photo" button -> 3. Enter title and description -> 4. Tap "Share" button. Saw a crash. File was not uploaded.  After the crash, I manually gave the app the "storage" permission. The next attempt (2., 3., 4.) went fine.  And then, I manually revoked the app's permission, and the crash would happen again under the same procedure (2., 3., 4).   By the way, I am seeing the same crash pattern on emulator (with the build of the current master branch) as well after I turned off the storage permission. 
No, it creates items, too Edit: Ah, no, PaperUI does. Sorry. 
Successfully replicated with only BuildCraft: https://paste.ee/p/06x5X
To execute: 1) Right click on the Stored Procedure name in the Projects tab of the Database Navigator 2) Select Execute Stored Procedure 
I did try it's the same issue. 
Because I tried to reproduce on a VM and I can only reproduce with remote caching. The same failure happened before, it was green for a while after I updated the cache key https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/commit/2e04e41a934a64e69473d2e80899d8c11958083f, now it appears again.
Yes, OUTBOX now survives export, clear data, import. However a new issue was introduced in the mean time: https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/commit/58717266c03d4a8290f9297b3eabe84f427d6f4d#r31767816
Indeed, seems the issue is solved in the preview version 1.2.747.
Ahh, so it needs to be added to OpenShift template also. https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/blob/master/app/deploy/generator/03-syndesis-ui.yml.mustache  I'm afk currently to handle post office. But I'll submit a PR, if someone else doesn't jump in first. :)  On Jan 4, 2018 16:28, "Pablo Deeleman" <notifications@github.com> wrote:  @dsimansk <https://github.com/dsimansk> A recent change on the way we manage Http requests by means of our new ApiHttpServicemakes all http calls depend on an entry in the apiChildEndpoints property of the config.json settings file currently in use.

Thanx for asking.  I did not block send2.cgeo.org cookies. I have 2 cookies (sorry for the dutch in image below) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1834022/56645754-939d9000-667e-11e9-8ef3-0a590b78ffde.png) 
verified. close the bug.
I just did not want to introduce another parameter that sort of serves the purpose of the topic parameter.  I think having two parameters with mutually exclusive rule is more complicated.  It just seemed that supporting a "variable" in the topic parameter is simpler.  In the future, if we do support allowing attributes in parameter for Java operator, the code changes required to migrate is smaller.  Once a parameter is introduced, it becomes an API.  I do not want to have to support this extra parameter when we support attributes in parameter in the future. 
Yes, it was when I was closing application and closing sip stack. It happened only in test cases when I do cleanup very soon after startup. I solved the problem by adding 1 sec sleep before cleanup. 
Awesome.  I'll wait until tomorrow and test the snapshot.  Thanks again!
I use iAnnotate and I confirm modifications are still ignored with 1.6.1. Workarounds (1) and (2) above work consistently, but (2) requires pressing "Refresh account" after another pdf in the folder was uploaded using "Refresh file" as in (1)... I haven't seen owncloud upload files automatically. Anything else I could test? 
The setup is a bit involved so I can get back to you on that if the dumps are insufficient.  I've shared three dumps that occurred while using GraalVM to run a JRuby on Rails benchmark: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11eTZOJvv2vL9e_wCWTaoz3ffqSJtSSvP?usp=sharing
I'm using Mariadb driver for mariadb and Mysql driver for percona, or else I have issues with percona. dBeaver 5.1.5 works fine with my current configuration.  currently in config for a percona connexion: zeroDateTimeBehavior=EXCEPTION  not sure if it was set by 5.1.6
Hm, there must be something else influencing this. When I tried in a separate project, both methods are ok. But I've confirmed again it's broken when I mix it into my other project.  In both projects I'm attaching it in the application's `didFinishLaunching`. I'll keep looking into it from my side, though the selector option works just fine, should this ticket be closed for now?

There seems to be no useful info in those logs :(  Tracing back the code on the `io.lettuce.core.cluster.ClusterTopologyRefreshOptions.RefreshTrigger#MOVED_REDIRECT` const we get to [this point](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/blob/af1dcad1028da5b51c4296255a2bb145cb207836/src/main/java/io/lettuce/core/cluster/ClusterDistributionChannelWriter.java#L79) in the code which does a `command instanceof ClusterCommand` check but the actual type is `AsyncCommand` - I see no similar handling for `AsyncCommand` type
from the same Jenkins run that produced the above stacktrace:    I missed when making the issue that the suppressed exception was different each time it occurred 
Yes, I do. I have external display connected to my laptop. 
I am pretty sure that I already updated this issue yesterday evening...for some reason my comment seems lost.  I try again.  For me this is reproducible with 2013.09.09-NB: - Disable static map download in settings - Save a cache (never opened/stored before) - Open cache details - Select Navigate -> Save static maps  BTW: There is no progress indication for this step. The screen just keeps frozen while maps are loaded - Static maps are shown - Return to cache details by pressing back - Select Navigate  Result: - It will still show "Save Static Maps"  Continue: - Close cache details - Open cache details again - Select Navigate - "Static Maps" menu option is shown now 
`string.char( unpack( loooong_array ) )`, I suppose. Can't test now, but will ASAP.
Those changes worked :+1:  I am now able to claim my USB scale and read values off of it. 
@TylerJewell the value for me is _simple_ human laziness :-)   I happen to have vagrant already installed, someone passed me a link and I tried the easiest route, that's all.    Nevertheless, the image from @humb1t is up and running OK.  
This problem resolved. ![zrzut ekranu z 2017-06-19 13-59-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23406555/27284112-ad668a0e-54f7-11e7-89ad-90ac86e25c6e.png) 
It doesn't work. This time, I bring you all the `flutter run --verbose` logs and my code. Btw, thanks for v2.1.0: I was really waiting for custom apk name.  *What happens*: When I open the app, a Dialog shows up asking me if I want to update. I tap "OK" and the code bellow happens. It shows my progress, logs `INSTALLING` an then it crashes.

Like i forget to add a attachment so i can make the thread, then when i add the attachment, it says "expired captcha" or something like that.
I don't know, what I do know is that it all worked fine on 1.10.. also they are located in the spawn.  Theres one villager moving a bit with his head, tho it doesn't move towards me and all villagers are frozen. Same probably for other mobtypes, you can see it on my server.. i'm not sure what else I can say to make it more clear
No, only with VisTextField. 
I built MapStruct from master and then the generated code is just fine :    Sorry for opening this issue. I guess it can be closed. Thx guys for this great tool :)

Yes, we might have more PR's about this in the future to fix outstanding issues.
Thank you for responding so fast. I am using 1.15.  I use the less secure `Hawk.init(context);` to initialize hawk.

I think, not entirely sure, that it is possible that one line of input generates multiple outputs (in case of multiple Alt allele's). But more importantly, we saw a difference in order before. A check was build in for this, but is now gone, probably after the switch to the new framework.  Furthermore in EMX we can have lines missing one of the required attributes, those will cause error's, but if you'll omit them the output VCF and input repository differ in length 
Hi, @purigarcia,  i use the built-in FileManager (cm-file-manager) in CyanoGenMod, wich has an built-in texteditor. -> http://www.androidpit.de/cyanogenmod-cm-file-manager - Yes, direct on android device. - The file update on the device it self works fine. (Therefore, I realized it until months later.) - The device uploaded the file correct (this says the notification). But a look in the file on the browser shows terrible old file content. 
I get it in `source/ceylon/test/assertions.ceylon`. 
As suggested for Retrofit 2 I am working with an Interceptor to change the url at runtime. There was something wrong with the Interceptor and it dropped it's scheme.  In case any1 is interested in the interceptor.  
Sadly, this is stock 4.1.2 (H3G).  I don't use a custom ROM.  What's the best way to provide a screenshot?  Is there a facility on Android/in cc:geo?  I'll try to find a webcam or something.

Hmm, most warnings aren't decorated with a stack trace. And it does say NullRefException... It does restart the new version, but this seems to be an error in some progress monitoring code?

I don't have this image on dockerhub, if you read the description I put the complete dockerfile to create it. I am just installing java, put it under the path, so java is there. Hope this helps you to fix this issue. 
I tried that, but it behaves the same way. When I use ldapsearch directly, as follows:  ldapsearch -b "dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxxx,dc=com" -p 10389 -h localhost -s one  I received the following  ecodev@mia-hq-jakku.mia.usa.sinvest:/opt/eco/ecodev/myvd-server-1.0.1/bin >> ldapsearch -b "dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com" -p 10389 -h localhost -s one # extended LDIF # # LDAPv3 # base <dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com> with scope oneLevel # filter: (objectclass=*) # requesting: ALL #  # groups, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=groups,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: groups objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole  # users, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=users,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: users objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole  # officers, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=officers,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: officers objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole  # employees, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=employees,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: officers cn: employees objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole          *# Affiliates, bsi.xxxxxxx.com <http://bsi.xxxxxxx.com>dn: OU=Affiliates,dc=bsi,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=comou: AffiliatesuSNCreated: 63578description: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxwhenChanged: 20160119190541.0ZobjectClass: topobjectClass: organizationalUnitstreet:: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*   and about 70 response more, all of them from the AD.

Hum, error seems to persist :/   
I did. Made a pack with just those three mods to be sure. Same result. 
Probably that’s the problem... When I attach the debugger to the emulator or phone the bug doesn't appear. 
Would we have to bump the grpc version in google-cloud-cpp?
Sorry, I just posted this, it was reported by someone on IRC, forgot to note down the name thou :( 
I don't recall what wave it was, but it should be triggerable around wave 40-45 if you use the cheapest turrets. Tower type was level one slowdown. A slowdown would be noticeable in a real game around waves 25-30 if you liked lots of towers. 
It may be something wrong with one specific situation, as I can't reproduce it generally.

Correct. Removed jar from couple of region servers and did a cluster restart. Since we are doing compatibility check for SYSTEM.TABLE RS, as a workaround could we split SYSTEM.TABLE in multiple regions so that it spans all available Region Servers? 
no error messing in the gui, and I can't see anything related in the server log. I'm trying to change the triggers selected altering which check boxes are selected but changes aren't being saved. Also As I now have 2 notifications I tried to delete one but it didn't delete.   I have tried editing from global manage addons link then configure, and also by selecting pull request notifier from repository settings page.   (I don now since seem to have been able to delete one of the notifications, but not sure which page it worked from as no change was apparent at the time I clicked delete, but after leaving page and then going back to it the item was no longer there, also now the remaining item I can see from the repositories page, but does not show up on the manage add ons configure page for pull request notifier

sorry.  i did not mention the Primary DataSource. It says Primary DataSourceProperties.  In my case, I'm running a multi-module project. And I have multiple data sources.  So, instead of 'spring.datasource', we use DataSourceProperties which receives 'app.datasource1' and 'app.datasource2' properties.  **A module**   Some applications use only a single datasource, and some applications require multiple datasources.  The application only needs to use the required Datasource configuration module dependencies and write the properties.  There is no problem because DataSourceProperties is explicitly bound to each DataSource.  However, the problem is that the DataSourceProperties cause a NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException.  So I have come to the two conclusions mentioned above.  1. remove EnableConfigurationProperties, and DataSourceProperties should be created with conditional beans. 2. all DatasourceProperties inserted into the Spring Boot Auto Configuration must be wrapped in an ObjectProvider.

Hi Bpolster, I have now run against: git checkout  origin/4.0.0_Performance -t git checkout origin/BroadleafCommerce-4.1.x -t Both are failing with the same error.

@eivantsov , some messages appear in the dev console when I load the initial page, but no messages appear when I double click  the file.  This behavior is consistent in both Chrome and Firefox.  Would the editor log error messages anywhere on the dev-machine?  Here is what appears in the log when I refresh the workspace tab in my browser.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1111057/38512478-183acb9a-3be0-11e8-990a-152d3460fc9e.png) 
After changing to user/pwd (it was API key before) and after entering the credentials in the history window it looks like the following screenshot after creating and modifing a ticket ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10806821/12579940/edada20e-c42b-11e5-8ac2-00fe327c889d.png)  You can scroll down to see the history in the window, but this is probably not, how it should work? 
Possibly.  Though this fix may benefit from someone who is aware of relevant code changes made between versions 1.0.0.Final and 1.1.0.Beta1. 
>Would you be able to debug the code? I can point to where you need to look.  I can try. Please do provide pointers, and I'll look into it when I have the time to setup Java dev environment on the machine where I can reproduce this (which is unfortunately not my main PC - that only has one monitor).

When I open the world, It may have something to do with other mods, but I'm not sure what it could be, as  those were the mods that seems to change textures when they were added or removed, I can give a full mod list if needed.
@twoseat The [CC API for updating a service instance](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/6.6.0/service_instances/update_a_service_instance.html) supports the same async behavior as create and delete.   If the request includes the parameter `accepts_incomplete=true` ([which it always does](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/blob/master/cloudfoundry-operations/src/main/java/org/cloudfoundry/operations/services/DefaultServices.java#L1025) with the operations API), then CC may respond with `202 Accepted` and the service instance can be polled for completion status. 
Thank you @jmcphers   I can confirm that str(x) does increase reference count. (a bit unexpected to be honest, not sure whether that is intentional)  At the moment, I have not yet installed Rstudio 1.2, since the compiled version is not yet listed. Will try that later. 
Please find a sample: [config.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/files/2090929/config.zip) Yes it was working fine in Edgware.SR3.

Hey, I made a repository with a sample app with which I have managed to reproduce the issue 100% of times provided I follow these **exact steps**.  https://github.com/AndreiHarasemiuc/Android-Job-Rescheduling-Issue-sample  1. Launch the app 2. App will wait 10 seconds (Handler.postDelayed) and schedule an exact job with a delay of 20 seconds. 3. At the moment you see in the logs that the job has been scheduled, close off the app from recent tasks. 4. In 20 seconds the job will run. The job will do 2 things. Show a notification & schedule another job with a delay of 1 minute. 5. When the job runs and the notification is displayed, immediately click the notification. Clicking the notification will take you to an empty activity. As soon as that activity opens, background the app.  Result: The second job that you just scheduled (with a delay of 1 minute) will run with a delay of 0 seconds soon after you background the app.  Please note that the sample app does not use _1.2.0-alpha3_ because I had some weird errors and couldn't buld the project and didn't have time to see what they were about. so I used _1.1.11_ **However**, I succesfully added _1.2.0-alpha3_ in my main project and I could still reproduce the issue just like before.  > 
I'll check to activate the dependency between iso19139 and iso19110 and if looks fine will remove point 3) 
Actually right now I am doing such a thing, but this results in the tokens gets small all the time, frankly it's not that beautiful,  ![screenshot_2015-11-10-11-30-47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8791318/11057217/8b98885a-879e-11e5-8e9c-1f5e92a19089.png)   what I think would be great is for the token to get re-sized on-demand (while it's bigger than the available space. 
Thanks @acogoluegnes for taking your time to fix it. :-)
Sure:    Thanks 
### Clarification  Ah, sorry let me clarify. So when I generate and run tests either with  - Intellij w/ default coverage reporting and the EvoSuite plugin  or by - Generating tests using [evosuite-1.0.3.jar](https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite/releases/download/v1.0.3/evosuite-1.0.3.jar) and running Maven w/ cobertura: `mvn cobertura:cobertura`  It gives me 0% when such an empty test case is in the suite.  ---  ### Versions  **Intellij Idea Ultimate Edition**    **EvoSuite 1.0.3** using [evosuite-1.0.3.jar](https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite/releases/download/v1.0.3/evosuite-1.0.3.jar) 
sorry . i will show you more details I want to break the logout request, and drop it by ZAP's API .  The steps is: 1. call addHttpBreakpoint (string* location* match* inverse* ignorecase* )  to add "logout" break; 2. call waitForHttpBreak (poll keepalive )  to detect if ZAP breaks; 3. if ZAP breaks, call drop () to drop the request. these steps is ok on ZAP UI mode, But it does work on daemon mode. The error is in step 2.  when the browse sends logout request ,  ZAP can not break it.

branch: master commit: 7653719a2a96236a60f76910aee2a6bc4355c210 (7653719a2a96236a60f76910aee2a6bc4355c210) 
Example :  This model is the one asking to the user to write a message and display it in the console. (The experiment works)    Normally, we expect the co-model to do as the experiment in the micro-model, which means that the user interaction contained in the micro-model, once the panel appears, will stop the experiment until the value of the user_command is set. However, it just continues to do the step, and doesn't even allow to set the value, as it is updates every cycle. I know that the ask within the reflex in the co model forces the step to pass, but so does the step by step button. But in this case, when launching the experiment in the micro-model, even pressing the button doesn't pass to the next step.  That's why I was hoping to "stop" all the simulations once a user_panel appears, just like for the micro model. 
It is the bool operator for the class. If you look in the header you will see it has not been defined. In creating an example, I also noticed that the example that comes with SoftwareSerial is also  not a good example since it is also using HardwareSerial   Go look at the SoftSerialExample code that comes with either 1.0.6 or 1.6.0 IDE. (This bool issue and example issue exists in both) In that SoftSErialExample.ino sketch you will see this code in setup:    That line boolean check is using the bool operator from HardwareSerial. if you change that to mySerial to use the local SoftwareSerial object you will see the problem of the missing bool operator. Using the boolean operator on a SoftwareSerial object will not compile since the bool operator in SoftwareSerial is not implemented.  It seems to be a poor example for SoftwareSerial to use the HardwareSerial class. The example should not need to wait on the USB interface to demonstrate the software serial in this sketch since it is only using SoftwareSerial which doesn't need any USB support. For sure, you shouldn't have to use and drag in all the HardwareSerial code to use SoftwareSerial.  This also brings up a somewhat unrelated item, and this is that there is no way to determine if a HardwareSerial or SoftwareSerial object has been properly initialized.  The constructor cannot return a status to return whether the constructor used proper parameters. The real problem is that begin() is a void. begin() really needs to return a status. It should return 0 if the begin() worked and the class is initialized and ready to use, or some non zero error status value indicating the error status. As a result, the sketch cannot tell if the begin() failed.  The only reason that I said that this other issue is related to the missing bool operator is because the bool operator could look to see if begin() succeed and return 0 if it didn't rather than always returning true the way it does in HardwareSerial. Doing this would cause code that is waiting for the interface to be ready tol hang which is very non optimal but without correcting begin() to return a status, the only other way for a sketch to detect the begin() failed is that all its serial output is either garbage or dropped on the floor. This is what happens when say an invalid pin # is used in softwareSerial or invalid/unsupported baud rates were chosen.  The real solution is to change begin() to return a non zero status when the begin() fails. However, that discussion is outside the scope of this SoftwareSerial bool issue.

See SingletonBeanFactoryLocator docs. I admit it's not so simple - I haven't cracked it yet. Try a simple main() app that creates an annotations based application context. Then try integrating it into your provider lookup machinery. http://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_java_based_configuration.htm.  I think it will all come down to finding a way to tell togglz what the id or name of the context is. Some apps use multiple contexts we want to bind togglz to a specific context avoiding any (java) singletons.  
Well, when I set the Probe Retract Distance to 20mm I expect it to hit the touch plate and retract 20mm.  I thought the Probe Distance was the length of probe travel before it stopped the action and produced and error message assuming there was a problem.  I maybe wrong but I thought these were two separate functions.  Is there a reason for them to be tied together?
just got a crazy idea while reading this. Chocobo "armour" for the player. made from Chocobo feathers, doesn't have any protection value, but will make the player "look" like a Chocobo and prevent Chocobos from running away :D This will need 24 feathers ... Right now that's a hell lot of feathers. But if we increase the feather drop after all and include untamed Chocobos in the feather drop routine, feather drops should be sufficient... 
@andrewlewis thank you for your help  after checking the code and the crash reports  the app doesn't call `ImaAdsLoader.stop` directly  is there anything else that might be related that I can check if the app is calling wrong?  and we could only find this assertion failure in the reports , not sure if it is related  
@billonahill  Is the user expected to configure ${HOME} in some config file? The path is getting resolved incorrectly:   
Done. Still same behaviour: - splashscreen - blank window Eclipse SDK - log file indicates same error
i cant it just freezes the game 
Default textures aren't patterned so you don't see the overlap, however in the interests of resourcepacks it really needs to be addressed. 
the craziest part is that i dont even have essentials.backup on my server at all either. just found plugin metrics tho. my server owner is looking into it more. tyvm
Maybe we can implement a thread-safe wrapper that extends PrintStream (or OutputStream?) and then put the AnsiOutputStream inside? 
I tried multiple things (not all at once obviously, all with the same result)   
That would require a migration or invalidation, but otherwise would be equivalent to the OSX route we employ.

Certainly! It has not been pushed to GitHub though, and I couldn't find Gerald on public GitHub. Can you follow up on this one?
@nikita36078 Unfortunately, I had lost my data, because of phone overheating, but I can confirm that this bug repeats also on KEmulator ver. 0.9.8 on PC (both 240x320/176x220 resolutions, same game version). So, it's probably the game file (*.jar) related problem.
I've now been able to reproduce this on my local whereas previously i was only encountering on our production server. It seems like the version is incorrect like it is somehow using the created date.     One other thing to note is that our schema_version table does not have a "State" column. This showed in the https://flywaydb.org/blog/flyway-4.0 but that could be Database specific or redundant?  
It appears to be line 17, as everything before that works correctly.
How do I generate this error log? Via google Reports?

@gastaldi thanks, 1 sec
This is the line where the redirect is built: https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/blob/master/web/utils.js#L416   I'm running 0.12.1 under Tomcat 7 behind a node proxy that I'm writing (because of Reasons). It would appear that I was having two issues: I had initially configured the proxy to follow redirects, so I'd get the correct page but the user-agent didn't end up adding the trailing slash. Once I corrected that then it appears that OpenGrok is redirecting to its internal IP, rather than that of the proxy. I shall have a dig into the code and see what headers I should be adding. 
@carlosmiranda added more details to the description.

Hi @mzelzoghbi, Thanks for investigation. In our case, we use a foreground service (that must have its own notification)(not really sure that there is a difference in this case). We are pretty sure that the problem is several processes because we started getting crash reports with this issue right after releasing an app version with the foreground service. It is 30 times more frequent than the next reason in our top crash reasons list.
One of these failing tests is like below:    Thanks!
It had to do with the `Connection type` being `Production`. By default that connection type has `Auto-commit` turned off by default. Checking that fixed my "issue".
Now it works. Thanks. 
Yes I first discovered the issue in Spring Boot 1.5.3 which uses tomcat-embed-core:8.5.14
@DariuszAniszewski the delay is not used in "production", it's more when I have to debug stuff with the actual device.  Here the core of the packet writer I usually use:    The operation goes farther, I'm able to write about between 6 and 14 lines but at some point, operation hangs and transfer stops hitting the timeout exception.  I know the transfer is happening since there is a LED blinking on the peripheral when transfer is in progress.  Just not sure why the operation hangs like this.
@eivantsov Thank you. Would you please consider to take a look at the issue in Codenvy repo.
I have now resetted the preferences and restarted JabRef afterwards. Then I created a new **biblatex** library with a new "misc" entry type. The "editor" field still does not show up.  I have then closed JabRef once again and removed the whole settings directory located in `~/.java/.userPrefs/org/jabref` and subsequently started JabRef. I created a new **biblatex** library with a new "misc" entry type. No "editor" field appeared.  For both aforementioned cases, JabRef shows the following:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987285-5ec79080-3dea-11ea-827c-8b29395372d4.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987309-6b4be900-3dea-11ea-9c30-02a133c2838b.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987372-8dde0200-3dea-11ea-9b84-13c5ed4f6b4f.png)  Then I created a new **bibtex** library with a new "book" entry type. No "editor" field could be found either (assuming there should be one, as stated in the bibtex documentation, attached below).  JabRef shows the following:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987174-21630300-3dea-11ea-9e05-5c34093b716b.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987466-bf56cd80-3dea-11ea-9ad6-b7c688e6d329.png)  **bibtex ([http://mirror.kumi.systems/ctan/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf](http://mirror.kumi.systems/ctan/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf)) states for entry type "book:**  "book": - A book with an explicit publisher. - Required fields: author or **editor**, title, publisher, year. - Optional fields: volume or number, series, address, edition, month, note
OK. Thanks :D

I m now working in the branch DEBUG_DONG.  You are right, it's null. I will try to solve it this week.  I have a question when we use @ManyToOne for a foreign key, for exemple, a foreign key Message_ID, in the date base, its type is INT, but in the code, i saw that in the tutorial it should be the type "Message" instead of INT. I'm trying to solve it now 
I have a feeling it’s because the `ceylon.ast` project is so big :-( 
Because it's public server, I even don't know where this molecular assemblers and how many of them there is. But I will try to reproduce this in new world with busses. And as temporary solution I just made Molecular Assemblers to ignore patterns in it. 
From a client perspective though, if it is not explicitly in the schema, you can ignore it exists. In the above example, I can do everything I need to do without ever using (read or write) the _id field (save/update without _id is fine). I would think it could be hidden from the client if there is another field in schema for identity.

Yes it ran when it was 1.8.8 only updated the other day when MyZ was finally updated to 1.9. I did try last month but server crashed many times. I even deleted the mywarp folder to start all over and it can't write the files error logs below. I thought maybe the database got corrupted that's why I deleted folder. I noticed this morning my backed was for my creative server so path was wrong (when I backed up I must of copied in wrong folder). I corrected the path and now it runs but I lost all my warps not a big deal since it was still under development, just my warps are missing. It still can't create files to do a fresh start.   
I'll see if I can set it up and test it.  Just 0.20 or also 0.90? 
I set {_player} using: set {_player} to player  and set {_player} to arg 1 (arg 1 being a player) I wante to use {_player} and define it at the top of the command to write less lines, but at first, I used player or arg 1. (the lines I posted in my first post)
Where would it be located? I can't find any other one.
So my current approach looks like this:  
Without that many blocks in the toolbox would it hurt performance that much to disable recycling views on the toolbox and shouldn't there also be a minimum height of the toolbox?

Thanks! 
As stated above, DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable CASCADE; is enough to trigger the error. You however need to put ANY statement or text after this row and see that the parser continues without breaking on the statement.  The comment also contains details of where in the code the error resides. The pull-request also gives indications of where to start looking.

Hi @hideki ,  I'm currently on couchDb 1.5.0, couches lite version i think is very close to master.  The ton of query to get document changes can happen even when there aren't many or any changes at all from the remote server. It can be the application running over night, and when resuming in the morning, the logs keep coming on changes. I have a few assumptions/guesses so far:  1) I have seen this logs like this before (not sure how frequent). But after this happens, i do see the flurry of logs after    Can something like this happen when you have more than 1 pull replicator on a database or recreating database object when one already exists?  Cheers Kien

It depends on the menu, but for standard menus this got worse by the introduction of the language select box into the menu.  Currently on molgenis01 happens for widths between 768 and 1127 pixels.  @Mark-de-Haan I suspect this is one of the reasons why the selenium tests are failing. 
Yea sure.  Thats what I do: 1. Load into Minecraft 1.12.2 Singleplayer /Multiplayer (none works) 2. Set two positions (/minebuild pos1 ; pos2 ) 3. Use command (/minebuild reverse test.txt) 4. Minecraft Crashes  5. Restart Minecraft and load into same world 6. "[Minebot] Output written to: C:\Users\.......\.minecraft\minebot\build\test.txt"  7. Crash Report: https://paste.dimdev.org/pikozuboba.mccrash   8. Test.txt file: https://paste.dimdev.org/uluvuquyaq.shell   If you want me to upload it somewhere else I can do that

Thanks for the accurate diagnosis and cure, Vlad! The Maven update fixed the issue. 
I haven't seen this in a while.
Ok great - was just about to upload the build log, but I guess not necessary now. 
Thank you for your attention @jknack, Yes, Jooby lacks the support of some media type but it could be implemented and easily solved, so here is the response and request headers for both Safari and Chrome browsers within a `<video>` tag:  ### **Safari**    **SO** setting the correct MIME type is of course very needed here but I have already tested it to see if it was the reason that made Safari sad but **NO LUCK** that was not the issue, [The Complete List of MIME Types](https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/mime-types-complete-list/)  Video and audio files that been used is from W3schools some stranded media files: [http://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4](http://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4) [http://www.w3schools.com/html/horse.mp3](http://www.w3schools.com/html/horse.mp3)

http://www.mkint.net/heap.bin i might be wrong, and this might be general behavior, but I don't see that handles are being destroyed here ?  Also I have replicated the same thing without any of my classes. I have setup on message received for the server to send "eventtest" string. Memory still builds up until eventually it gets outofmemory. So, here is the relevant code:         ServerBootstrap bootstrap = new ServerBootstrap(         new NioServerSocketChannelFactory(Executors.newCachedThreadPool(), Executors.newCachedThreadPool()));         bootstrap.setPipelineFactory(new AlphaPipeline());  pipeline:     public ChannelPipeline getPipeline() throws Exception {         ChannelPipeline pipeline = pipeline();                 SSLEngine engine = AlphaSSLContextFactory.getServerContext().createSSLEngine();         engine.setUseClientMode(false);     pipeline.addLast("ssl", new SslHandler(engine));     pipeline.addLast("framer", new DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder(8192, Delimiters.lineDelimiter()));     pipeline.addLast("decoder", new StringDecoder());     pipeline.addLast("encoder", new StringEncoder());     pipeline.addLast("handler", new AlphaHandle());     return pipeline;  handle:    I also have ssl part of the app, but i don't know if it's relevant for this problem. 
> Did you perhaps rename or delete a world recently?  no. Thanks for fix! 
All tabs had been opened at some time, but I don't know which was open when the error first occurred.  Now, I can never see the ExerciseViewer window - I select a file but the window does not appear.  I get the same error with any GPX file, including files that did work last week.  I have since tried some old GPX files and some sample GPX files from the net (see https://github.com/pytrainer/pytrainer/wiki/Sample-GPX- for example).  It is always the same problem.  I also just tried v7.1 - same problem.  It seems now the problem has happened once, there is some setting/preference somewhere that make it happen everytime.  Could it be that the window is off screen and hence giving errors when it tries to render?  Is there some other setting/preference that I can remove/reset? 
Not sure what happened on earth...but it's just working fine for me too...
Let me see if I am misunderstanding @yoosiba. My understanding was that the library manager lets you add dependencies that you use in your project. Your project should be tested against whatever dependencies you define, but the tests of the dependencies themselves should not be run in the context of your project.  In other words, if for some reason react used mangelhaft, we should not run react's tests because we are using that library. Or if online presence used stdlib, we shouldn't run stdlib's tests when we are testing onlinepresence. stdlib has its own test, own build cycle, own everything.   In other words we don't test the things we use, we only test how we use them. That is my understanding.
Using [this](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/object-storage/?expanded=create-or-update-object-metadata-detail,get-object-content-and-metadata-detail#get-object-content-and-metadata) I get:    I also tried it on a console app, outside my main project, and it still downloads a file.
yes i have gionee P4 having 4.4.2 and Le 1 having Android M sorry i don't have crash reports. you can check screenshot http://imgur.com/a/dCBtH  my device front camera is working proper

My mistake ... I've misunderstood exception message. In that case, I believe that only one loop will solve all problems:

Where can I download snapshot version? I'll try to test on Tuesday, but since I encountered these issues on our production server, I might not be able to repeat them on our QA server, where I would install the snapshot. 
no fluid pipes are attached only using the buttons. (probably I was not clear enough, sorry Englisch is not my native language) also for negative values to appear you need to get over 1630 xp 1640 the negative value -1636 will show but only on a server (singleplayer worlds work fine!)  did some more testing the exact value where it wraps to negative is 1639xp  also made a little video hope that helps to clarify :) https://youtu.be/8U-1RJjYXVs

In a fresh instance with only `CustomMainMenu`, `TBone`, and `MetalChests` installed, this issue happens. With only `TBone` and `CustomMainMenu` installed, this issue does not appear.
There are two places where info is recorded: there are the  sets of IRIs (one for classes, one for restrictions, one for each kind of property, etc).  These are only kept for the duration of the parsing. Then there is a multimap, which records guessed-at types, removing them if an explicit type is seen. This is stored in the format that is kept in the ontology manager.  The hack of  pretending that the cons cell is really a class or a datatype does not need the multimap.  This class and the triple handlers should be refactored. I believe it will have precisely two :-) 
Most info here: https://datadog.desk.com/agent/case/10658 
I cannot tell you the version number but no, not today's version. I shifted to the nightly build about 3 days ago. So it might be the version before the one you published today to the Play Store. 
Thats exactly my point, usually you switch over "e" (== a variable of the enum type) and not over "MyEnum" (== the enum type). 
@valgog no, not here. 
Basically it just felt like something was not right.  I banged my head against this for a while, and it would only work if I wrap the TimerTask.run() call in its own thread.  If I wrap any larger unit (e.g. the whole contents of the onTimer()) it would tend to block at the first call of synchronized code.  Even though that should have worked.  It is also possible, I suppose, that there was just a standard race condition that was causing it and didn't have anything to do with the generated code.

Well, the game starts up fine then when I go to load the world it pops up the with screen saying "Loading World" and it goes to a black screen after 30 seconds as if the world is ready to load then crashes.

sure 
@cammace will do thanks 
It is fixed, I close the issue. Thanks
The question is that if it happens with other primitives too. At this case right know, using InputStream or MultipartFormData would be better for file uploading, but this older project had byte[] :D Hope it will be fixed soon!
Yes i upgraded to 1.1.1 and it worked fine
No idea what he tried to say :S   Config folder has all config files, but no sub folders for me. 
Oh yes, that's a much more plausible theory indeed.  Did you push out a new version to the Play Store recently? I don't know how I can tell whether an update has happened recently - there's a notification about 5 updates having been installed but all different ones.  I have a 1.2MB backlog of adb logs, sadly first mention of k9 there is the exact crash above.  I'm trying to remember whether this was the first time I tried to use K9 today but don't know. My mailserver doesn't seem to log logins so I can't find out there either. :-/ 
No,i just place it. I do not know how to use it. 
it says the msvcp120.dll missing, and solve it, but is there a way to load webcams names using FFmpeg in javacv ?
@TheSnoozer   Thank you so much for your quick & detailed reply!!  Well now I'm baffled too. Because now it seems to be working!  I'm not sure what I did other than I made a few more commits of other stuff I'm working on.  After I got your comment, I tried again and voila!   I have one more question, if I could beg your patience ...  Where does the `git.build.*` information come from? Are you pulling it from Maven? Although I can see the convenience of including that info in the properties `build` information, building the project has nothing to do with `git`, per se.  I would think it might make more sense to label them `maven.build.*`.    Perhaps I am way off track here :)  BTW, This is one of the best documented maven plugins I have seen!  Great job!     
Currently 1.1.1 I'm check with the latest 1.1.2 and will update
Yes that is enabled and nextcloud is not on the exception list at the moment.

The IDE version I was using was 1.5.7. [Here](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/TFT/utility/Adafruit_GFX.h#L272-275) is the link to the file. After `} // end scanline` the file should be closed with `img._bmpFile.close();` on line 274. The issue seems to be present in version 1.5.8 too. 
Tyler:  Thanks for the advice. It helped find the problem.  I ran the "info --bundle" and generated the tar archive (neat, the way that works!). I looked at the various files in the archive.  I found that 172.17.0.1 is the IP of my docker0 "device", which is a bridged adapter created by the docker server. I also found out that che, as part of its network check, was running a curl command that attempted to connect to docker0 through port 32768. Since I am running a firewall on my system, that port was blocked. Once I unblocked it, everything worked.  eivantsov: FYI the OS I am using is CentOS 7 and, for various reasons, I need to keep my firewall enabled. That being said, I wish I had read your post before now, because it might have saved me some time.  A suggestion for the documentation: the Che folks might want to tell people about which ports should be open when doing a local install. That way, someone can know to either disable their firewalls or open the right ports before running Che.  One last question: how on Earth do you pronounce "Che"?

I haven't been able to reproduce since so I suspect it may be related to the matrix.org issues.  > It might also be the GCM registration.  Would this require a network request to something other than my homeserver or Google itself? Is it intended that this block the client from starting up or running at all?
I meant to say @version attribute value, not text. Sorry.  
Sorry. My mistake.  One of the migrations timestamp was in the future and I didn't see.
haven't added or removed mods, looks like i was in a plains biome. i ended up getting rid of the boline by going into creative mode and removing it that way. i think it had an issue with the tooltip when hovering over the boline, because using it was fine.
Found a solution by removing 'server.tomcat.background-processor-delay'. Finally found it in my YAML-file. Sorry for disturbing.
looks pretty good.  The only thing I saw different was "soapenv:Header/" in GwtTestCase vs "soapenv:Header/soapenv:Header" in gwt-test-utils. Thats something I can live with though. The xml is none the less the same structure.

I don't think this is enough. This enables scrolling with the keys (up & down), but not with a touch / mouse move. 
I would publish the library only in the category where it's more recent version belongs, so to allow for corrections, still delivering all versions in one category.... Would that fit? 
I've pushed what I _think_ should be fixes for the shading problems to a separate branch (shade-dependencies) as I was a bit worried that it might not be totally correct. If you can try that just as a sanity check (I.E: that you don't get wierd classnotfounds), a 0.9-beta1 sounds a good idea.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to reproduce this exception after I restarted Eclipse. Therefore I'm unable to test whether it is fixed. 
Any long chunk of code in the console would do. I notice that scrolling when hovering on the scroll bar works too, so I think that the scroll event is not catched in the console panel.  I attached a video showing that I can't scroll if the mouse is not on the scrollbar.

@stuartwdouglas did you run it also with `<reuseForks>` set to `true` (which is default if you remove that line)?
Hello Peter, thanks for the quick reply. I did further tests: it does not work on: Samsung GALAXY TAB 2 7.0 (GT-P3113) with Android 4.2.2 Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 (GT-N8000) with Android 4.4.2 Samsung GALAXY S3 mini (I8190) with Android 4.1.2 see attached pictures.  It works fine on: ZUK Z1 with Android 7.1.2 HUAWEI nova with Android 7.0  No, network is OK on all tested systems. A SAMSUNG related problem?

Hi, Setting the limit to 1 is already a good workaround, as there is no need anymore to restart Eclipse to free memory.  Setting a sliding window seems a good solution, since I usualy only dive into the latest lines of (TRACE) logging. If there is a need to dig into all other logging, a logging file is a good idea, however in most cases the test has stopped at an error, so that is usualy the latest logging. Besides that, there is also the possibility to do debugging, so an external file is not a must. Thanks for the quick investigation, Regards, Evert Huijben
world.step(1 / 45f, 6, 2) each draw call.  I tried different approaches from here: http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/  Its every time the same and only occurs in release build. I also thought about that its maybe because the CPU/FPU have different behavior in floating point calculation.   But as you see in the video, thats a huge difference. Maybe a bug in Box2d JNI Wrapping? I try to debug trough  NDK to examine, where it comes from, but im not familiar with debugging with NDK and JNI.   Maybe important is, that it seems working sometimes the first 10 seconds and only affect rotation forces -> if something is tilt. 
Yes, here is the test:   `myCreateRemoteThread` works fine while `platformCreateRemoteThread` fails with `0xC0000005` (EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION)

> Which one of both composites is cached?  There is only one composite and it looks like that the caching works but when returning to the component, that was shown first with this composite, the composite on this component is removed. The composite is then only visible on the page that has last shown **initially** the composite.

@SevaSafris no particular reason, we saw it in the README and felt it was more appropriate to use it because we use Spring Boot.
@timtay-microsoft  Hi.  the first questions:  Can you confirm that you are providing the intermediate cert to the Device Client instance in Java?  I checked the DeviceClient code, there is just one construct method , the method signed is this:  DeviceClient(connectionString, protocol, publicKeyCertificateString, false, privateKeyString, false);  so, I suppose there is no where except this one.   I compared the  intermediate cert according this document:  https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md the item #4 (which I already point out in the original issue description ): cat new-device.cert.pem azure-iot-test-only.intermediate.cert.pem azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem > new-device-full-chain.cert.pem,  then I put this file into that construct method like this: DeviceClient client = new DeviceClient(connectionString, protocol, "/home/ghw/test/new-device-full-chain.cert.pem", true, "/home/ghw/test/new-device.key.pem", true);  so, I suppose I already did the right thing, which is mean: I  guess I already  providing the intermediate cert to the Device Client instance in Java.  did I do it in a right way? please correct me if I am wrong.   about the secondly question:  yes, I did that by Java control panel.  please checked the  picture:  ![java](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/145199/42068093-838792c6-7b7c-11e8-972c-7dcda7e3e010.png)  but I am not sure I did the right thing too. would you help me about this issue?   thanks    
It does, sorry about my poor testing.

Sorry I should have included that from the beginning! The dev was responding to a comment on the Multi Mob Library page on CurseForge...  "So I just checked and this seems like something on Tropicraft's end. They should take the result of the CheckSpawn event into consideration for their spawn system so my mobs do their proper checks. Now everything just spawns willy nilly."

In my mod OMT I use 2 systems, one that tracks all listeners (on the server inventory container, detectAndSendChanges()) and just distributes a custom network message (simpleimpl) to each listener per tick. Explanation for the other is down further. They both make GUI information that is not inventory (since minecraft handles that itself) super smooth and doesnt impact performance nearly as much as block updates do.  For the first system that can be used for GUIs that have an inventory container: https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/openmodularturrets/client/gui/containers/TurretBaseContainer.java#L140-L149 https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/openmodularturrets/network/messages/MessageTurretBase.java   And I have an additional system that works for GUIs without inventory containers. It is a tiny bit more complicated and uses my Library mod. Basically the Tileentities that use it need to implement an interface, and have a list variable that gets updated through that interface. In their update() method they send a message to each member of that list containing needed information and additionally they scrub that list every 20 lists or so (checking player distance from block) in case a crash occurs or the gui did not close properly.   https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OMLib/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/omlib/network/ISyncableTE.java  This interface is then used by 2 messages that get sent during init of a gui on the client and on gui close: https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OMLib/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/omlib/client/gui/TrustedPlayersGUI.java#L75-L80 Those messages are really simple, they simply grab the listener list via a function on the interface and either add or remove a listener based on the contents of the message.  Sounds a bit complicated but this solved all the sync issues / performance (due to block updates/ unneceesary information flow) issues in my mod(s).

@jexp In our use case we have 2000 nodes.  Query example:    So. For each iterator object new frame is created. And when we have `Pattern` node with 2000 `PatternPart` child nodes we end up with `StackOverflowError`. 
Hi!  It seems like it's not happening with every player. I asked a different admin to take the screenshots but nothing changed for her. For me, though - this is right before and after a death by lava btw, I can try a /suicide later, here's what happens. (See attachment sorry I'm on mobile)  So I had dropped off my shulkers, used some cobble, and also lost lots of durability on my armor. When I respawned, it was all back.  Let me know if you need any more info!

Thanks for getting back so quickly! Just tried it in `2.0.0.M8`.  I think mapping to `SingleRootFileSource` will work in the scenario where the subdirectory is directly under `src/test/resources` (as is the case with `root` in the `AutoConfigureWireMockFilesApplicationWithUrlResourceTests`).  However, when pulling in stubs that come from a `jar` dependency, the resolution from `UrlResource` to `File` is causing this exception:    which appears to be happening because of the `jar:` protocol in the URL:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/b2f900e518eeb5aabf57a6deb8f267256af7b22b/spring-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/util/ResourceUtils.java#L216-L220  Should the mapping actually be to `ClasspathFileSource`? It looks like that class is doing the proper parsing of the URL and extracting the `jar` portion:  https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock/blob/d36516bb76b3b7b8fb84fe2254fc2597b3fce11c/src/main/java/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/common/ClasspathFileSource.java#L68-L72  I put together an example demonstrating the external `jar` behavior:  https://github.com/reillylm/scc591-consumer https://github.com/reillylm/scc591-dependent-api-stubs  `scc591-dependent-api-stubs` contains the WireMock stubs and `scc591-consumer` contains the test with `@AutoConfigureWireMock`. You'll have to run `publishToMavenLocal` on `scc591-dependent-api-stubs` first to make the jar available for the consumer project.

We use an AWS S3 bucket to host the actual cache artifacts. And then use S3 pre signed urls to redirect bazel clients to the S3 bucket to get the actual artifact.  This allows us to run a very simple and small remote cache cluster while leveraging S3 to actually serve all the artifacts.   The remote cache service still needs to handle writing to the S3 bucket. But all cache reads are handled by S3.

Sorry I'm too busy at the moment and installed back to 3.2...  I only can say that the database properies UI is buggy: If you do a  change in any field (in our case we changed the standard file path) the sort order of the primary criteria is applied (standard = "abstract") although we have activated "sort by original order" (its not YEAR as I claimed false before).  I have no capacity for more feedback or tests, hope you can reproduce the bug...I'm happy with 3.2 at the moment and we need it working at our institute. I might be able to help later this month.

The `IDatabaseConnector` and `IConnectionService` interfaces of the `com.neXtep.designer.installer` plugin were not consistent with the corresponding interfaces of the `com.neXtep.designer.core` plugin in terms of thrown exceptions. So I changed the `IDatabaseConnector` and `IConnectionService` interfaces of the `com.neXtep.designer.installer` plugin to throw `SQLException` exceptions instead of `InstallerException`. Which is besides more logical too.  Connection failure to the repository database is now correctly detected again.
Hi Benas, Yes I agree, that this situation possible only if user use NullRandomizer. But this situation is still possible for me. And yes, I agree, to not put null keys at all for all maps. I will change my PR. 
The snapshot fixed the issue. Thank you !

Same thing happened with the .lfa files. Where the file sizes were different, the files from the bagger transfer understandably did not work. Where they *were *the same, they did. I haven't done a systematic review of the files, but considerably more often than not, something, perhaps bagger, nicked off ~1-2% of each file. Bagger was the only thing knowingly added to the process.  Basically, rsync, then bagit.py worked fine, but using bagger to create a bag in destination was a disaster. I'm not ruling out that I might have made an error, but I'm reluctant to try it again. Do you have any pointers?  I attach screenshots of the following: -"get info" "general" metadata for each of the 3 main folders from the original drive ("Dance Forms App," "Merce DanceForms Files," and "mercecunningham") featuring each of the 3 versions, from top-to-bottom: original, rsync, bagger -"get info" "general" metadata for an .mov file in the same manner as above (original, rsync, bagger) -a screenshot of the results from the rsync transfer of the .mov file side-by-side with the failed bagger transfer -"get info" "general" metadata for an .lfa file in the same manner as above (original, rsync, bagger) -a screenshot of the original .lfa file (the rsync file looked the same) side-by-side with the failed bagger transfer  Best, Ben   On Fri, Jun 16, 2017 at 8:47 AM, John Scancella <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Hi Ben, > > There is already a open issue regarding the file date modification (#16 > <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger/issues/16>). > > Does this still happen if you copy the files using rsync and then bag in > place using bagger?

Would it be possible to make the fishing rod knockback mechanic more of a projectile similar to snowballs instead of standard player hit? As it throws out Failed Combat Reach violations with NoCheatPlus and assuming other anti-cheat plugins when outside the standard sword hit range.

Hello, the helmet is on my inventory. I try to do /pet show   after I pass the portal: [EchoPet] Your Pet is not currently hidden. 
I import a RGB image as a mask, select one-to-one (the only option that actually works, has something to do with worldmachine), so it gets imported as annotations.  I then use a brush or global operations, using 'only on yellow annotations' as a way to select (or any annotation). Then if I click on an area with any sort of annotation, it covers those as well. So if I have an area with red and yellow annotations, and select to affect only the yellow, it will still affect red

Hi,  Here are the steps I did.  1. I downloadedmybatis-3.4.2.zip <https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/releases/download/mybatis-3.4.2/mybatis-3.4.2.zip> from https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/releases <https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/releases>. 2. I unzipped the zip. 3. I extracted mybatis-3.4.2.jar to jar folder. 4. I ran the following command and it said it was a Java 8 class.  Z:\Downloads\mybatis-3.4.2\jar\org\apache\ibatis\io>javap -v Resources.class | findstr version   minor version: 0   major version: 52  But when I did same thing with mybatis-3.4.3-20170117.233125-7.jar <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mybatis/mybatis/3.4.3-SNAPSHOT/mybatis-3.4.3-20170117.233125-7.jar> from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mybatis/mybatis/3.4.3-SNAPSHOT/ <https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mybatis/mybatis/3.4.3-SNAPSHOT/> It said it was a Java 6 class.  Z:\Downloads\mybatis-3.4.3\jar\org\apache\ibatis\io>javap -v Resources.class | findstr version   minor version: 0   major version: 50  The both have same target and source JDK 1.6   	X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.6 	X-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.6  But the build Jdk is different.  mybatis-3.4.2.jar was built by JDK 1.8.0_111  	X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.6 	X-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.6 	Created-By: Apache Maven Bundle Plugin 	Build-Jdk: 1.8.0_111  and mybatis-3.4.3-20170117.233125-7.jar was built by JDK 1.8.0_31  	X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.6 	X-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.6 	Created-By: Apache Maven Bundle Plugin 	Build-Jdk: 1.8.0_31  I guess there are some changes on JDK 1.8.0_111 and it caused the issue.

So I'm curious as to how that error was even encountered. For one that would mean adding at least property values to switch the compiler to use java 8. The profiles don't matter at all in this case as that is for test only.

**"Would you be interested in submitting a PR to resolve this?"** Yes, iam interested.  Also, i have another concern which isn't related to this issue raised here, but the concern is related to the  spring security namespace configuration while setting up custom authentication provider .   i just started reading the documentation for spring security namespace configuration.  i'm facing difficulties while implementing  custom authentication provider, could you let me know the link to the article that describes how to implement custom authentication provider?   i have uploaded a screenshot of [the documentation that summarizes ](http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.2.x/reference/htmlsingle/#ns-config) custom authentication provider topic, but i'm looking for spring documentation details on how to implement the custom authentication provider. i'm not sure whether i missed reading it in this article itself. kindly help me out.  ![untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10482177/28703606-ee4077f2-7382-11e7-8b18-a829ef16301a.png)

Attempting to use the laser to increase the stats of fluid does work. However, it destroys a significant portion of the fluid each time a catalyst is used. This is a serious issue because it makes making decent crystals basically impossible unless I want to spend hours trying to do it. REAL world hours! The catalyst was nether stars to note.

Yes, of course. Three reasons this makes sense: - it's currently guessing invalid credentials and hurting the user experience; - using the provided root credentials is what the OrientDB console does when you create a new database (see the resolution of #6564); - it's consistent with the existing behavior -- the existing behavior was to log the user in as an admin, and the root credentials have admin-level access to the database. 
I just added hardening.

Hello @sijie , while this is a perfect technical explanation of why the issue happens; this is not how one would expect a regex pattern based subscription to work. A regex pattern based subscription should allow the topic-list to grow when new topics are created. Similarly, the regex pattern based subscription should allow the topic-list to SHRINK when new topics are DELETED.  Please do let me know if you believe that this is not a valid business requirement. 
Hi Goran.  Here you go. https://gitlab.com/uros.kristan/multi-select-field-test  I found out that the problem occurs in conjunction with app-layout addon.  To reproduce the problem please follow this steps: - run project - click on Multi Select in menu - select some items - refresh browser window  And another question: Would it be possible to implement onItemClickListener for selected items. Not on x sign to remove them, but directly on item?   
yes, but there is no exception

hg38 from bcbio: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/GRCh38_reference_genome/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa  Here are the SAM records for two sequences with offending alignments, which I note are both supplementary; I've included all alignments for the sequences in question. In this case the positions are 0, which causes the same effect as a negative position.   
What I wanted is a behavior as an e.g. when you have gdb or firefox or any program running from the console or command prompt. Unlike say torbrowser-launcher which detaches the window and doesn't allow any sort of debugging, the command prompt allows for knowing what is happening. Something like this -    This is a partial thread from a gdb instance running some program. I am more comfortable when things are attached to the command prompt rather than having a swing terminal window. It just feels more natural and probably is more easier to understand/debug. Does that make sense ?

I use the spring-boot:run goal. I can see that IDEA adds the argument  -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=127.0.0.1:33945,suspend=y,server=n  to the java command.  Had not thought about starting the main class directly, I will do that instead. Thanks for your fast response!  You can close the issue if you want but perhaps it would be a good idea to add some description on how to get it to work on:  http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.1.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/maven-plugin/examples/run-debug.html  if you can figure out how to.

Here are some video clips showing the problem.  1.

[Server 1.2 Preview with Edge browser](https://youtu.be/r97R-Tf56iE) Inputting Korean characters is ignored, except first element of character. And broken characters spoil the cmd line.  3.

[Terminal tab of Server 1.2 preview, with Edge browser.](https://youtu.be/ZGMYDrwFeNU) There are very weird actions. Sometimes the inputted characters are ok. Somtimes the characters are splitted as element. It seems to be influenced by what precedes it.     The website - Ace Kitchen Sink, shows similar problem. With Firefox, inputting Korean is flawless. With Edge browser, there is weird actions. [Firefox](https://youtu.be/V2CxQ3HMGEg), [Edge](https://youtu.be/A01RhDYAw84)    I hope these videos are some clues..

MOTD does not work when the server switches can not see it 
Hi, Sorry for the delay !  Here's the stacktrace:   
Tested manually as well, works as expected. Closing - cannot duplicate manually or through automation.
Paper (Spigot) with the universal SLP jar. 
  I can put up a demo project later if you like. 
Links should be stored in the persistent entity NBT data and point at the other entities persistent UUID.  This is all handled in LinkageManager.java. 
I can confirm that I can create a file with path length > 260 from `cmd.exe` using the `\\?\` prefix.
Sorry, platform was windows 7 using the 4.0.2 install. I tried to duplicate again with a fresh install but no luck - both dropping and creating the index worked. Ran through a number of exercises using pgadmin and qgis but still not able to duplicate.   Closing. 
send it to the support mail or how should I provide it? 
@rohanmars that approach sounds right to me, but want to look at the prototype to have deeper understand.  w/r/t COMPLEX, I think we currently stick to not use COMPLEX as a final field type. For UI COMPLEX field is a container of fields, not a mappable field. UI never creates a mapping using COMPLEX field type. So having COMPLEX as a field type of converter/fieldaction is a bug. i.e. DateConverter has bugs. In the initial code drop, date/time related classes were mapped to COMPLEX, and mapping them into atlas primitives like DATE, DATE_TIME_TZ was a TODO. Now we've done that, so DateConverter also needs to be changed to use that atlas primitive field types. Changing this COMPLEX as a container policy causes huge impact through UI, and I don't think we have enough feedback gathered to decide if we should do that or not. I think this was the conclusion in our discussion @mattrpav ?
Yes I'm using the v2.1.1, downloaded from http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/loginsecurity/  Where am I get the 2.1.2? the link you post don't work now 
That's exactly it.  The message isn't indicating almost success, just success. 
I tried to find anything about pattern of path parameter in OpenAPI spec but find nothing :(

I seem to have less issues with battery drain! I'll check CPU total this evening when the battery is drained some more (it's been three hours since the phone got off the power grid).

I haven't tested vanilla, will do right now. By restart it, you mean #cancel and then doing it again? I've done that, and it starts fine and then does it again.
I thought about the charging station being already taken so i made sure it was not the case. The farming drones are two, and they have two stations (each one is close to its assigned drone, and both drones are in range for both stations if one of them fails).   The drone placing block was alone and i was nearby so i can confirm the station was full, empty and not blocked in any way.   As for the digging drones, they were two for a single station (it was a short work sequence) but i was nearby as well and neither of them even tried flying back to the station. As stated above it's hard to replicate, it definitely doesn't happen in a regular way. So far i noticed it once a day, though i'll do more tries with my block placing drone (i remove it with the pneumatic wrench when he runs out of blocks to place as i'm short on blocks). 
Hi there,  actually I found out this: smalot/bootstrap-datetimepicker/issues/277 Looks like the proposed Fix has never been contributed to the project, what a shame.  The project looks quite dead. I`m in doubt that this will be fixed ever. ;( 
The problem is that pumps don't recognize it as a valid fluid and won't pump the oil geysers. I tried Buildcraft and Immersive Engineering's pumps.
It is in my previous post: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/commit/9130635fa1b9ba7b18a08cb54177c2924c2a8d8c#diff-84fb62e1c8a8f1b095012858ba4dc95dL266  and the snippet in question is: <service android:name="com.evernote.android.job.gcm.PlatformGcmService" tools:node="remove"/>  and it was in src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
Yes, but the odd issue is GLOBAL_SUBJECT doesn't migrate properly if I attempt to do groups directly after. If I ONLY migrate GLOBAL_SUBJECT, it works fine. I messaged you on discord with more information including test files.
Ah sorry I somehow read the stacktrace as reading the javadoc, yeah its a general error.  Its using XMLBeans 2.6.0    To build and see if it causes this error.  Or maybe you can just grab any standard Spring Boot example and add that xmlbeans 2.6.0 JAR as dependency, and then the xmlbeans-maven-plugin ?

They both definitely produce output, it's just that the output is incorrect. The second link shows the details for RP1, correctly, which suggests that the GeneNameService does indeed know about it (it's a valid gene, and it exists in our system). However, the first link doesn't include RP1 among the autocomplete suggestions. Here is the output I get from the first link: `{"numReturned":10,"docs":[{"symbol":"ABCA4"},{"symbol":"ADAMTS19-AS1"},{"symbol":"ADCY10"},{"symbol":"AHDC1"},{"symbol":"AMER1"},{"symbol":"APOBEC4"},{"symbol":"ARID5A"},{"symbol":"C1orf167"},{"symbol":"C1orf174"},{"symbol":"CA4"}]}`  RP1 is sadly not among those results, even though it is an exact match. 
Hmmm, not really sure. The bug was due to a malformed uri, which shouldn't really affect the cells, but it did anyway. I do remember that restarting the app fixed them, can't really confirm because both all branches are now completely different from master. 
Thanks @rhuss doing this change, I get a different error. Seems like it wants to read a `artifact-with-dependencies` file from my file system.  Here is the entire output from my shell.   
Hi again,  thanks for your analysis efforts. I added some logging to our test environment and this is a stack trace of when a new connection is added to the `nodeConnections` map:    So it doesn't seem to originate from the SentinelConnectionManager really - I thought so because all the connections in the `nodeConnections` map were for the sentinels, but apparently it's just from normal client usage, I guess? Then the question would be why the connections are not re-used, or rather, why they are never removed after usage?
@katre the most simple case is this:   and WORKSPACE file is empty.
@dadoonet I use golang elastic.v3 client to build the DSL query, at some cases there is no 'should' clause under the bool query, I know I can check the query first, then, set "minimum_should_match" or not, but I think maybe elasticsearch service can do this itself. in elasticsearch version 2.3 this is fine. 
This is a VERY large file. Here is the output:  <details><summary>Log output</summary>   </details>  It seems as though the output is different! This is strange since the build runs the same each time. I can execute the build manually ten times and a smattering will fail, guaranteed. However, it seems as though instead of printing `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: Started`, it printed `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: jetty-9.3.z-SNAPSHOT`, and I should look for `org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.ContextHandler: Started`. What an odd thing.

@C3C0 I think I actually want to be able change the loading priority manually in the installer app. Currently the priority seems to be determined by the hash of the package name 
I am using version 0.5.2. The view in xml looks like this:   
In fact, I never used windows explorer for this. I have big data files synchronized over a few machines using an encrypted USB key.  To handle the files offline, I use 2 tools: Beyond Compare for manual operations and FreeFileSync for automated local syncs. Payed: http://www.scootersoftware.com/features.php Free: http://www.freefilesync.org/  I can definately copy the long file paths in different locations on windows using both tools. Long paths can be synchronized to my Linux NAS, my NTFS USB key, and my local NTFS HDD with both tools. They can handle properly hidden linux files and long path names under windows. Explorer and most apps cannot.  However, both FreeFileSync and Beyond Compare cannot copy the files to the webdav server.  Windows allows long path names to be managed by dedicated tools. However, it seems the webdav server cannot support it.  What webdav server you suggest, as I am looking for something robust and reliable ?  Many thanks for your input

I don't have to do anything in SQL editor to reproduce it.  Just opening a new empty SQL editor is enough.
There is always in principle a `Span` available when you ask a `Sampler` for a decision. I see no harm in adding it to the parameters. 
I'll check soon. 
Previously, it reported as following: WARNING: Stripping enabled, but '--copt=-g' (or --per_file_copt=...@-g) specified. Debug information will be generated and then stripped away. This is probably not what you want! Use '-c dbg' for debug mode, or use '--strip=never' to disable stripping.  Then I tried both "bazel build -c dbg source:all" and "bazel build --strip=never --copt="-g" source:all", but it didn't work either. 
is it maybe possible to do something for that case?
I am still seeing this on my laptop.    
I'm playing on the 1.10.2
I installed it after; is possible add a check if the playstore is present, and if not show a warning about it, and maybe a link to download a safe apk?  Not all have installed the playstore :)
@jakewins Error repeat over and over for first time, when I start master. After restart everything is OK. 
Hey Robert,  Not a problem, thanks for the quick reply! I tried to add it with both the XML editor and the JCR properties view.   Eclipse Version: Mars.1 Release (4.5.1)  I'm also using the latest version of the AEM plugin 
Yes. Please close. 
@clevertension I opened the issue with no description so i’m not sure why you are asking @mbhave to clarify things rather than me. We opened the issue as Madhura and I identified a bug while reviewing another change. It’s a tricky problem and the issue was opened as a reminder to us more than anything else. Madhura’s comment means that it’s not as easy to fix as we had hoped.  A property source is a Spring Framework concept that is described in some detail in [its javadoc](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySource.html).
I just did => my bad, didn't thought to send a crash report !! 
I have a custom theme based on tweaks of Darcula. Seems like since it's not a recognized name, it's defaulting to Default colors? Is there a way to get it to use the Darcula-compatible colors?
This happens also when editing an existing note. Steps: 1. create a note in Roundcube 2. note shows up in Roundcube and (after sync) in the app 3. edit the note with the app 4. after sync the note is invisible in Roundcube, but visible via IMAP (i.e. Thunderbird) 
No, I don't even have americium yet. Both controller and casings are MK2. Maybe the recipe is registered as mk1 by mistake? 
What's interesting, I noticed that some folders would sync while others did not. Last night I tried the same thing on my wife's phone and all worked as should. I reinstalled the app on my phone with no change. I cleared cache and reinstalled. Same issue. I did that about half a dozen times, rebooting the phone hooping that some small piece of install remained that was preventing the app from uploading photos/videos from the main folder. Changed to a new folder on the server to upload to. Nothing was happening.  Then, not attributing to anything that I did, the files were uploaded on their own.   Now, again it seems to have stalled. Force rescan does not change anything.  Yes, I am on the latest stable Android APK.
Always connected to WiFi when this happens, I don't have other type of Internet access.

Opening a command line interface my launching `cmd.exe` makes no difference. The `-d` parameter does not help.

I am using Mockito 2.042-beta and mockito-java8 2.0.0-beta.  But I also tried with 2.0.44 and it still is an issue.   
@jiazhai no problem, I'll do it. Thanks for the tip about pulsar-manager.
There's more to the fix than I mentioned, you are right `_State` is serialized (I think) but I work around it.  When declaring the topology `_State._state` gets set to `None`.  Now we only attempt to import the C++ module `_streamsx_ec` when one of the methods is called (from a running topology). Thus when we check to see if the module is supported (only Streams 4.2 and Python 3.5 currently) the first time we see `_state` is None so try to import `_streamsx_ec`.  Based upon the success of that we set `_state` to reflect supported or not, and if supported set up the additional state we need.
the mod version is 7.2.1 (the latest, according to the wiki page). I have found that the returned coal has a data value of 2, but it should be 0 (1 is for charcoal). That small change should be sufficient to solve this issue, I think. 
yeah i can get you a test world... but i dont have access to that computer right now, and yes i'm running about 40 other mods but this didnt start happening until i got a more up to date version of your mod though iirc
It reproduces on any repo for me.

Thankfully, I backed it up before deleting it, so I'll send it over. 
It is the explicit NULL on "Notes" that is causing your problem. Firebird doesn't like the use of explicit NULL keywords, on NOT NULL.   The solution is to use another tool until it is fixed I feel. It's too much of a faff to go edit he generated DDLs manually each time.

Hi @damienmg :  The last error is solved after I did:    Thanks again,  Jian  _Note_: Edited for formatting 
nope nothing in the slots but for me block reach broke the armor hmm
I have verified that this issue has bee resolved. 
it is version 7.99.12 and let me get a video recording. Will also try 7.99.17.
I've checked out this repository: https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui and imported all projects (excluding nested test bundles). I've not set any workspace preferences or project properties for CogniCrypt. I have only installed and run it (on all projects of the workspace). Basically I was just doing an initial evaluation to see what kind of warnings I might see with CogniCrypt after watching the Eclipse.org channel Youtube video about it.  I'm not exactly sure anymore, but I think I had several closed projects in that workspace. I opened the first, which triggered a workspace build, including CogniCrypt analysis. While that build was still running, I openened further projects, thereby triggering further workspace builds.
Yep, errors appear to be gone. Woot :-) 
I didn't get the `ScrollPaneTest` to show the issue without major changes so I provide my code as a separate test instead. Note you have to resize the window for the issue to actually show by making it thinner and thinner.

I got no Tomcat window on startup neither on restarting karma from karma window.  
I change the location and started building it, now I faced that server is starting but nothing on that host and port.  `docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /c/Users/cpra/tmp:/data -v /c/Users/cpra/che5.2.0/che:/assembly eclipse/che-cli:nightly start`  `but on http://192.168.99.101:8080, I don't get che up.
Yea, but I can also only test it on an emulator. I had a real KitKat device, but I recently updated it to lollipop..  
Based on v1.0.3 DW20 pack Buildcraft version in pack 6.2.6 Was added IguanaTweaks/ThinkerTweaks, removed Hats , all which i assume cannot interfere  Added pollibly interfered mods: RotaryCraft(+etc Reika mods, e.g ReactorCraft etc.), GregTech, LogisticPipes 
@tomtargosz sure, I'll post an update tomorrow, thanks
Delete route with weight setting (-Weight), GroupWeightConfig will not delete, causing the route conflict with the same weightGroup, causing 404 error
I can verify that the latest snapshot works fine. Both in our real service and in the sample application above. Great work and many thanks for a super quick response!
@anandtushar111 Sure. I'll assign it to you. Note this issue is for [Codeheat 2019](https://codeheat.org) so be sure to register first and make a PR once Codeheat officially starts to get your PR counted for the contest. You can even make a PR now nevertheless. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. I´m making a pull request right now!!!

I built new images tonight from current develop branch and I still have this issue. I verified that I have elasticsearch-2.3.4.jar in lib/extra. I am building and using docker images in Openshift, but I wouldn't think this should be any different from the regular Docker images. Let me know if there is something else I can try to help troubleshoot this.
no. the circle.jpg was request by an preset. in the distribution directory existed a file call circle.png.  i converted it to .jpg and saved it to die pics-dir, to prevent future error-messages.  i think, this filename comes from a default-preset an must be checked...but cant find out preset-nr.  (by the way: this was not the reason for my stalled pixelmatrix. pixelcontroller is running perfectly 24/7 since months. i check it running and it is correctly sending data to my artnet client. i think the client stalls. because pixelcontroller outputs the data to an itead iboard 1.1, on which an art-net client-sketch is running. i think the board shows after a productive and errorfree year now sometimes temperatur problems... i will investigate that board) 
Sure, here's it: https://github.com/ceefour/lumen-kb/blob/e50b8fc0690c078fcec1c037be9496f1dc10937f/cli/src/main/resources/id/ac/itb/ee/lskk/lumen/yago/yago.gridgain.xml  If I can find reproducible steps I'll let you know. 
I emailed you some of the logs from the help@inat account.
Hey @deadok22  I'll create a pull request in the next couple days if everything goes well. 
Not a template, but someone else's app. My guess is there's no difference though.

@mshaposhnik As far as I understand you propagate your own InternalInfrastructureException. To be sure that it is a client-side issue it is needed to reproduce original steps when there is no free docker network. P.S. You can create networks with `docker network create anystr` command.
It freezes, and I can't do anything no matter how much I wait. And when I check the crash logs it doesn't show up. As well as the server crashes
I have no idea why it would be `null`, but this is happening long after server initialization.
Trying now 
Thanks for the quick reply.  Okay the problem is a little bit more complicated. We use the WebFlux API with Mono and Flux, but run in a servlet context. With the latest update (2.2.0.RELEASE), the reactive health check classes are no longer registered because the entire structure has changed. What i have tried now is to create the auto-config. I think i miss a bean. I am currently working on a project.  
@spencergibb  Attached the projects to replicate the issue, In this zuul routing order is not consistent for the same routes defined in embedded config (in zuul app) and config server yml configuration.  Toggling the above property in zuul, provides different routing order.  Please check and let us know how retain the routing order when the routes are served from config server.  [zuul-routing-order-issue.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/files/4001387/zuul-routing-order-issue.zip)
IDK, has 2.0.4 been released? 2.0.3 is what I got when I followed the download instructions in the DHF tutorial, so I assumed it's the latest.
@kchodorow Ahem I think you missed the first `load` statement in my example 😉  
You can review all of this part of saving users the cache and database? It is completely full of problems. I'm having to use a modified version on my server. 
It does, yes. 
> what for? Why should they survive Driver?  `SqlTaskManager` keeps information about ended tasks (`SqlTaskManager#tasks`) for a while (default 15 minutes) so that they can be queried by coordinator.
I thank you for taking the time to analyze my humble request and respond in-kind.  My goal was to suggest or provide myself, a slight enhancement to your very rational approach to a rules library - keeping things simple, not trying to boil the ocean.  I'm buried right now, but I will submit a pull request and examples for you to consider, within the coming weeks.  I think the deep hierarchy issue requires more analysis - I'd love to know the more complicated use cases engaged by library users - my intuition says it's probably not as big of a problem as one might think, especially if you manage expectations up front; a user of the library who cares to decorate an abstract "rule" class gets the responsibility of implementing their solution(s) correctly.    BTW- I'm using your library for an IOT project at a fortune 10 company, and I've noticed that the division of code implementing the when()/then() methods is seldom 50/50 but more like 90/10 or 80/20 in either direction, so that might factor into the deep hierarchy analysis.  Best wishes, Dave

Maybe the launcher update changed something?
> Thanks for your report @neomatrix369! It's possible that the merge code assumes that the two fields are covered by `allDeclaredFields` without considering that this discards their `allowWrite` attribute. Can you provide command lines and source code or a JAR file to reproduce (ideally a minimal example)?  I'll try to provide some example. Quite possible and shouldn't happen since `allDeclaredFields` and `allowWrite` are two different levels of abstractions if I understand right, one if read-only and the other one allows writing.
The annotation is shared, in a shared package. `ceylon.net` is also a shared import, so I think the visibility is correct. Also, the CLI seems to build just fine.

To create a tileLevel the user must supply an image of the map. The map is a one pixel to one tile ratio. The mapColor is the color the developer should use in the map image to represent that specific Tile.  So if the user uses #000000 for the mapColor than any place in the map image that the color #000000 appears the tile defined mapColor will appear 
1. A) It happened after I made acc cosig #1 a cosignatory of acc multisig #1  B) You enter the account, everything is displayed normally, I scroll down to the bottom and back up. This leads to the msg of the wrong tx get shown in the wrong place.  If I go back to accounts and back in it, its normal, but happens again if I repeat B...and so on 2.  In this example, pls look up how "dona" gets displayed for two different tx. It should normally just stand with the 1000XEM tx.

I agree with you about even malicious data should never trigger such an exception.  I have a TCP Input with two extractors. The first extracts data with grok pattern and extract the field localtime. For example, localtime : "05/May/2015:07:00:00 +0200". The second extractor is a Timestamp Extractor that copies the field localtime and convert string to date type with the pattern "dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z".  I think this is correct because the message have a correct timestamp when I search it :  "localtime" : "05/May/2015:07:00:00 +0200" "timestamp" : "2015-05-05 05:00:00.000"  The timezone on the system running the graylog server is :  $ date +"%Z %z" CEST +0200 
That's true! (thought it was stored but it was my browser). Sounds to me though this is a bigger issue and requires a notification to an email or something to say hey login again. Will have a think. 
 > Are they dropping a lot of packets? Are the packets sent but never arrive? Why isn't TCP's guarantee of delivery being met? Those are questions that a novice/layman will likely have difficulty answering, unfortunately.  Good news! Neither of us are laymen. But, per the but report, the trigger is that the Linux system running the client is being suspended/put to sleep while the client is still active. So the server is probably ending up with a half-open connection.  MapTool in this case is being used to manage the maps for a PbP game, so these aren't real-time game sessions. I recognize that is not the typical usage model, though it is interesting that the 1.5.4 server did not exhibit this behavior while 1.5.5 does.

4.1.0, the latest available. The pack is Mythic Novus [Kinetic]. I am on SP.
@SecUpwN  He he! I was thinking the same thing (about the alignment), but was afraid to say anything, as I could come across as very ...you know. Anyway, I agree with all your comments.   Regarding the Ciphering indicator as shown on slide window. In all honesty, I have little frekkin clue to what it is actually telling us. I posted about it in the XDA thread, but never had any constructive response to my speculations. Thus that functionality is still purely speculation, but has something to do with the current enciphering status, which surely/probably depend on the current network you're connected to. (I started a [new thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2744850), to properly map out SM.)   What we would also need is the CI that is set in the SIM by your service provider.  This require us to use either:  (a) the AT command entry (my preferred way), as we had in the first versions or (b) the internal SIM related API/IPC commands, for reading the SIM EF files.  @xLaMbChOpSx  Would it be a problem to re-implement the AT command entry possibility as we had in the earlier versions? (Before I was able to test.) If so, we could use another slide page for this type of entry. I really promote the ATCoP entry, over the API stuff, because it give you complete and direct control without weirdness.  I know people probably think I'm a pain-in-the-.. for always talking obsessively about the AT access, but few people know that it allows for close-to full control of the Baseband, including completely reprogramming most RF-related main functions, as I have tried to document elsewhere.   @SecUpwN I forgot to mention that the persistence bug is an old one where the logic is reversed. Just check it and it will close down nicely. 
I did update to 1534 but the error message is still there. What I did:  - Thing removed / Binding uninstalled - Cache & Tmp Folders cleared - Reinstalled Binding  I have to correct myself here: _...as soon as I add the thing "Tracker Device" to my system..._  It doesn't matter if the thing is added or not. It's just related to the binding installation. Can I help somehow with a debug? But most probably it doesn't help to debug the gpstreacker-binding?
I have no idea, maybe it's something that maven surefire does? But how would the debugger know to open that file? What might I do to debug it further? 
The log was the first thing that I checked. Nothing. Also I can't reproduce it, it's random behavior. 
Sorry for the delay Serge, I didn't get notified when you commented. My OS is Windows 10 (Enterprise) 64-bit.  
Here you are.  Yes, I know I should have used JMH instead of caliper, but somehow my mvn got borked, thus JMH doesn't run ATM. Still, the results are so far off that I think there must be something amiss & it should be easy enough to reproduce.

Yes, I do.  I select an item in the git tab. Click on more - Revert... in the menu and nothing happens. Then I click more - Revert... once again and the item is removed from the list in in the git tab. Both times I do get the popup asking me whether I want to continue and both times I click "yes"
Definitely the latter - I had a 'wound slaver' with 28 burn who just wasn't taking damage or having it tick down
@yegor256 it seems that using an isolated repository for the integration tests (as far as I understand, this is the case) is the main concept of maven-invoker-plugin. But I see here an option to set `localRepositoryPath` outside of the project build directory, e.g.    In this case `maven` downloads (actually copies from the local repository) all the artifacts only once and reuse this new isolated repository in future even after `mvn clean`. 
Works great. Thanks! 
You're right, it was fixed. Sorry, I had been assuming that master was the last dowloaded version, I can see I was wrong :).  By the way, I am considering writing a Clojure wrapper for this library; however it seems the API is evolving rapidly. If you have a precise idea of the direction it's taking, please shoot me an email! 
Looks like 4.1.5 (thats the one published after 4.1.5 - Inv bag fix!) 
I prefer the "throw an error" approach - `{}` already denotes nothing.

Hi, thanks for the prompt response. I've been trying to connect for dozens of minutes without success.  The thing is that `autoConnect` flag works perfectly fine on the same device when: - using android-BluetoothLeGatt sample from Google - reflection based method in the library is replaced with the regular API  I know this issue is weird especially because: - it happens only on one device among many I have used - the reflection based implementation seems to be identical to the inner Android implementation  Anyways I've changed my app implementation so that `autoConnect=false` but still it would be cool if you could address the last part of my comment regarding why the reflection based workaround is used in the first place and which Android versions / devices are affected.  thanks. 
Yes, if it's for Dart I think get rid of it.  Any absolute positioning stuff will break with this flag running and the kind of people that need it will know how to add the arguments themselves. 
When you right-click a block you select the creature in the GUI and it disappears. I assume this is a latency issue -  For Clarification.

@marcingrzejszczak Here it is.  Created directly with spring boot initiliazr, just added the redis settings in application.properties. I tested it against a redis/sentinel running on docker, Redis 3.2.5 (I could reproduce the same behavior with 5.0.3)  [sleuth-bug-demo.tar.gz](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/files/2733161/sleuth-bug-demo.tar.gz) 
Apologies, I didn't explain my intention clearly. What I am proposing is that the default header pattern simply be "*" when constructing a SimpleKafkaHeaderMapper with the parameterless constructor, e.g. 
If you try the following:    on a HTTPRepositoryConnection with and without a transaction(comment begin and commit), you will see the issue.  Sorry but I am not sure how to simulate a remote repository application in sesame's testcases. Otherwise I am happy to write one. 
I've only tested it with Spruce so far
@dennisoelkers, nice tip.  Clearing the browser cache fixed the issue. Thanks!

Welcome @UltimaBGD! Feel free to work on this issue. Also have a look at our [contribution guide](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and feel free to drop by in our [developer chat](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref) if you have questions!
@jkandasa Updated to latest snapshot. Tried to purge with condition = >60 and all dates and when I select "Year" graph it still shows values of 90+. So purge is still not working.  Also the latest snapshot gives lots of errors and is incredibly slow for everything. So I have to now revert back to the previous snapshot version I was using. For interest I have attached the log file showing errors with latest snapshot which I downloaded on 25 Oct 2018. [mycontroller.zip](https://github.com/mycontroller-org/mycontroller/files/2520234/mycontroller.zip) 
I mean, its clearly a bug...it should be fixed once and for all.  That said, if you have any advice on how to mitigate it in a clean and java friendly way, I'm here to listen and to learn. 
Here's one that takes forever.  It says it is to big to upload. Let's put a filter on it and try again, 3605 records out of 19855. This is considerably smaller than the one I want to use but is still slow.  Now it is saying the file type is not supported. Suggestions please. 
Well light is set only direction setDirection(0,0,1); so its away from camera. Plane is set to 0,0,20 with this settings plane gets nice light as it should, but if i rotate plane on Z axis for 180° then it looses the light. 
Sadly and somewhat embarassingly, no. The problems went away with the new installation, and we couldn't think of anything that might have caused the issue. I thought some indices Xtext builds in the background may have been corrupted, and that there is some way of causing them to be rebuilt. If that could not be it, feel free to close the issue. 
@divs4debu Thanks for your input. I have solved the bug and initiated a PR for the same. You are also welcome to review it. :)   Now, we use only one field `id` in Session class and table which matches the incoming Session IDs in JSON. The unique constraint in maintained. I have removed the ServerSessionIDMapping class and table because it was making things a bit complex and redundant.  @the-dagger @mananwason Please review.  
yes 
i was gonna say about2:wkerror=N but I'm fine with anything
I am using 1.2.0. converter attribute is not recognised. I am trying to migrate an already existing code. This will be lot of work. It is better to give support to native <h:selectOneMenu> and add features as PF. Thanks.
@librelioniv can you answer this question?  > @eprat We checked this in 2 device as issue #96 and can't reproduce crash too. How often do you catch app crash after wakeup during download? How much apps executed in your device in this moment? Is this issue still actual? 
Show number of elements is off. Toggling Show number of elements and then automatically generate groups generates also Latex code groups, but these Latex code groups are now filled with elements. Strange! 
 
Looks like there's something wrong with it:    BTW I'm in the NY office if any of the Bazel people there want to debug hands-on

Thanks for the quick resolution. I'm looking forward to the next release.
I emailed you a test video. 
Well, I'm at `1.4.5b` now, but problem exists still. Now my project almost same as your ViewPager activity (https://github.com/suwhs/wATL/blob/master/app/src/main/java/su/whs/watl/samples/ViewPagerActivity.java), so you can use your own code to reproduce it if you need. I need to set text size programmaticaly (`mPager.getOptions ().setTextSize (25)`)
Thanks for the tip @mtbadi39, but It doesn't feel right to me having the javax el-api in the classpath without the  implementation. The starter artifact should be 'ready to use'. That's the philosophy behind spring boot starters 
Yes the architect table has an area selected (as shown in the pics) which has diamond pipes, iron pipes, lenses, golden pipes, chests and signs inside the architect table area. There are a bunch of lists in the chests. These lists have BC items, vanilla items and BCA items on the lists. 
Hi!  It is hard to see what changed with #337 because of the code layout change. But, as I am using the git head version from yesterday and you committed that patch approx 15 days ago I would say no, that did not fix my reported problem.

I get this result whatever the way I goes on a stream (top streams, features streams, followed streams and so on). I have the static image of the stream but bottom shows "Stream is no longer live" message everytime and I can't play it within the app.  Even more strange: I can use the three dots and ask to play it in an external player, and in that case it works. So it's only stream within the app itself which is broken (and status check resulting in the display of this message).  No useful information can be obtained from the `adb logcat` above?
Ok thank you very much!  When should it be released?
All these alignment options in 608Decoder are based on assumptions what the content provider intended to achieve by adding whitespaces around the text. As the negative value is caused by incorrect content, we should probably not trust the values and the safest could be center alignment for Pop-on captioning mode. But other modes cannot be center aligned, the only other common mode is Roll-up, always left aligned. So something like this:   Note: also added the condition suggested in https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3533
I am using Marshmallow in my mobile device so it has to be a case for <N as well. No idea how it will work on pre-Marshmallow devices.

Hi Philip, no proxy in my case. We send DESPATCH_ADVICESs or INVOICEs and we receive ORDERs. Yes, the use of httpclient could help. Starting from your code, I would like to create a simple As2 client (prototype), with only this functionality. i will share if you want.  Fiorenzo

I think "playNotificationSoundURI" does not consider the case of "x-rincon-stream". I can try to fix the issue. 
I don't know whether I have push enabled in any way. But at the moment I only receive my e-mails by manually refreshing my accounts or folders. 
issue tracked down: something is messing with the config files, the modifyWorld property was set to false thus dissabeling oil generation, the default is indeed true in the code but it was off without me ever opening that config file before

Sure. Seems like ready https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv/pull/871
@serge-rider Ah, those columns are `datetimeoffset` and I'm using jTDS. I've just tried it and `datetime` does work correctly, the problem is with `datetimeoffset`.
Ok, you're right about the fact that the library is part of the app. That went through my mind and I didn't understand why the strict mode policy was thrown.   I tested the sample app with the same emulator and I don't get the exception, so it must be something i'm doing wrong in my code. Note that I'm extending `com.nononsenseapps.filepicker.FilePickerActivity` and `com.nononsenseapps.filepicker.FilePickerFragment` to provide file/folder thumbnails, maybe it has to do with that. I'm gonna have to investigate and try some things.  Sorry for the false flag! 
I can confirm that the busy bar is correctly rendered in the latest snapshot.  To be honest, it would be nice to be able to modify speed and movement direction through widget properties, but it's such a niche actor that it's not really necessary.

I think I figured it out though I'm not sure if this is your problem Brayferd. i really like this mod a lot and wanted it to work so i re downloaded it and switched over to the new file, and then tried it worked. come to find out though if your looking at a block even if its right outside your range it will try to place to backpack. Try looking at something really far or in the sky. How ever i had some problems with taking the backpack from the "TooManyItems" NEI and i could not craft with them. but for reference i was using: Too many items. - Marglyph CraftGuide. - Uristqwerty Minions mod. - AtomicStryker Balkon’s WeaponMod. - BalkondeurAlpha  I did uninstall TMI and everything is working wonderfully. its an awesome mod. 
@AlexGilleran I've figured out why it would fail. I called `getRequestXML` directly after the request instance is created. After moving this line into the observer of the `execute` method it works perfectly.  I used to think the XML should have been usable after the request is created. :(

Or is the build waiting in a quiet period?  It's running, I didn't check with the quiet period. I'll look to update all the plug-ins and try it again, just in case the bug was somewhere else and it was fixed in the last few weeks. 
@meincs The specific cron specification (Quartz, etc.) doesn't matter as I believe all of the cron dialects supported by cron-utils do not support nanosecond precision. Thus, comparing Cron schedules with nanosecond precision would be wrong, which fortunately, was easy to catch.  Here is the link for the Quartz cron trigger: http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/tutorials/crontrigger.html 
Yes, I have no trouble connecting to his backend. And after this failure, I can go to another screen and get other downloads.  Just to be clean (re-reading my original comment,) when I said "after a few hours are collected" I was referring to hours of Guide data, not that I had to wait hours for it to start syncing again.  I've also used my browser and done things like Myth/GetHostName as fast as I can press ctrl-r e.g. refresh and had no failures.  I suspect this is a result of TCP RSTs that I've discussed in the past. But without being able to capture protocol, I can't prove it.  I would suggest that the test for backend availability might be enhanced to make more than one check. If all is well, there would be no impact on data transfer. If GetHostName failed, maybe it could be retried. Or, could calls to that function be passed with an argument(s) for how long to try  and/or how many attempts to make? Just tossing out ideas.

Hi @manuquentin  I've gone through the demo and I'm using the same configuration as given in Demo. Everything is working fine with RNCallkeep other than remote hangup. After remote hangup, I'm calling `RNCallKeep.endCall(_uuid)` but it's not invoking `RNCallKeep.addEventListener('endCall', this.onEndCallAction)`. That's the only problem I'm facing with callKeep.  PS: Same functions are working perfectly with the Android device  **PPS:** This error is not consistent. Sometime `RNCallKeep.endCall(_uuid)` works perfectly  Thanks, **Ajay Kumar**
Hi @hideki, I have log every changeevent that arrives to changeEventListener, but I dont receive any 403 nor 401 change event. For example, when my session is expired, I can see in the logcat a lot of 401 errors:  But I don't receive any changeEvent with that error. I do receive other change events with different replication status (IDLE, STOP..).   I'm using 1.4.0 version.
Hi Timo,         the article refere to default timezone and use it to convert values, so that the result conversion (i.e. in UTC+1 that is my time) give you something like 01/04/2014 01:00:00. but in joda LocalDate should be converted always in 01/04/2014 00:00:00 by don't care about timezone, this is by definition of the joda LocalDate so in jdbc type conversion that is something that I'm concerning about.  We are using oracle 11.2.01 with querydsl-sql (no hibernate). The fields on db is of type Date (that is Date + Time with no locale support afaik)  Below the example code. The insertRsaRTariffe method add a date value (from another select, but is the same if I use an insert from a bean with LocalDate) in the right way (01/04/2014 00:00:00), but the select +where filter generate a value 01/04/2014 01:00:00 (see SQL) so  there is no match non filter.  Please feel free to ask me others details.   
Unfortunately no, I cannot.  After spending some time with `org.jaxen.test.ArithmeticTest` and digging the docs (JLS, Java API Doc for `Double#compareTo(Double)` and IEEE 754), there are only two cases to consider: 1. `0 >= -0` (or `-0 >= 0` respectively) 2. `NaN >= x` where `x` is any Number  *NaN* is handled correctly by `org.jaxen.expr.DefaultRelationalExpr`. What's left is the comparison of zero and negative zero. But this is also determined correctly since the relation says *greater than or equal* and this is the only difference between `Double#compareTo(Double)` (treats 0 greater than -0) and Java comparison for the primitive type double (treats 0 equal to -0).  Long story short, it seems that my suspicion was purely based on the 'partially consistent' implementation (`DefaultGreaterThanEqualExpr` is the only class that uses `Double#compareTo(Double); all others fall back to Java comparison for double primitive values).  Hence, you might close this issue as there none. Of course, in case you want to re-align the implementation of `DefaultGreaterThanEqualExpr` to have a fully consistent implementation for comparing numbers - just in case anyone else stumbles across this - I won't object.  Thanks, H
I can't share the project, however I can reproduce it with a barebone project, which I've pushed here :  https://notabug.org/zsombor/che-test  I can't see the exception, but the error message about the missing classes are there.  
Unfortunately, Oracle makes this very difficult because of the way it  implements remote links.  Oracle will only create remote links in the  logged in user's schema.  There is a very nasty workaround which involves creating the link from a  dynamic sql statement inside a stored procedure in the correct schema.   This only works because the stored procedure executes as the schema  owner, meaning the link is created in the correct schema.  My workaround is to implement a FlywayCallback that alters the current  schema in the beforeMigrate method.  I understand the need to change the session inside the Connection that  manages the metadata table. However, it seems more logical to keep the  default schema in the Connection that performs the actual migration.   Perhaps a property in the Flyway class would allow this to be configured  by the user of Flyway.

@maggiolo00 , I'm talking about the Web Front end to Orient DB, which you call Studio. In Studio there's a "Graph" tab, which allows one to visualize a graph returned by a query and also to manipulate it. In that view you can click on an verticy and get then click on a "link" icon which then allows you to connect an arrow (edge) to another verticy on the graph and by clicking on it. Once you click on the second verticy you get a dialog to choose the type of edge you want to create, then it asks you to enter rids for verticies, but it should already know which verticies I clicked on. This si not a question, its a bug in the UI.
Sorry for the late response. This was tested with forge 1969 and BQ 126. I'll confirm that it's still a problem, and if so, get back to you. 
I just tried and Cryptomator doesn't actually seem to work at all.  I click to run it and nothing happens.  I see nothing in the process list either (for cryptomator.exe or Java).  Any ideas? 
Here is the reasoning for this. There is a chance this may be wrong. That's why I am keeping the issue around. 1. A quick preview of how HDFS leasing works: The namenode creates a temporary file for the client. If any client is trying to open the HDFS file again, this lease is checked against. The lease file is deleted which the owner closes the stream. Continuous heartbeat ensures that the owner is still alive. In case the owner has not closed the file and some other open call is received for the file: the lease is broken. When the lease is broken, the namenode waits for the original owner to send heartbeat for designated time and if it is not received, breaks the lease. (There is a pending discussion to be had for using this behavior for HDFS locking).  Now the interesting part is the waiting period. In case of a different client than the current owner the wait period is 1 minute. If the owner is same, the wait period is one hour.   2. With the second stacktrace - something bad happens in the container which is running one instance of everything HDFS. The datanode (and maybe the namenode) is not accessible after this error in the second stack trace. Because of which the owner can not write to the file as well as close the stream. The lease is not released in the usual way. Now the namenode/datanode recovers and is available. Any further attempt to open is a lease breaking operation. And as we are doing it from the same client - the wait period is one hour. In case of multiple datanode the assumption is that a bad datanode is replaced and namenode ensures that the lease is maintained properly. The writes and close never fail the way they are failing here and we will never be in this situation.  I recommend keeping the issue around as there are multiple places where this explanation may be wrong and the issue may still appear in case of a multinode HDFS deployment. 
I did not @vmax. The most ideal solution is not to have to run these "initialisation" commands at all.  In Python, do we have a similar situation where we have to do something like `bazel run //:pip install`?
No, they are not shown as stored. 
we have tested with new release, but those failing chests still exists, I tried to /qs create and /qs removed again, but it still told me that I'm bypassing quickshop lock. I talked with some players and they told me that this bug happens after they create a shop and removing it, then it starts to fail like I said. we have further checked the paste link and the database, the failed block pos is not in either of these. This is very weird. PS: the failed block pos is (x,y,z): (128, 73, 202) and (128, 73, 200). and we somehow fixed 1 chest yesterday by creating and removing the shop again(with some random trys like placing a block at the original pos or using /setblock) which it haven't gliched again until now, its pos is (131, 73, 202)
Fixed in 806c2a75883ac477a3e09a9bd8075e88b0fc4cfe 
Can confirm, this doesn't happen in spectator mode
@kumy I just try it (uncheck GKM) and try to reload related cache: I always got an empty inventory :(
I just checked, the issue does not appear with Optifine removed.
I woke up to see both of these responses today. :D   I'm glad you got it sorted out, can't wait for a release.  Thanks!  That is weird with the Mekanism cables though, but yes, I did update that as well about the same time.  But like I said, all of the other machines (TE4, Mek, IC2) on the line were still getting power so I figured the problem wasn't in the cables.  I was using Mekanism 7.1.0.87 when everything was working before...perhaps he also changed something slightly that made the rounding error you just fixed more noticeable?

Hi, yes android_alarm_manager is on android x. I will try and track down the issue as well.
The good part is I tried to use Glowroot with another application but in this case the admin.json and config.json files were created, so forget the missing files. But the web error is the same. Log attached. [glowroot-log.zip](https://github.com/glowroot/glowroot/files/1054965/glowroot-log.zip)  Thanks! 
Sorry for late reply I was using 720  have just updated will let you know thanks for getting back to me 
We use the client certificate to login to Liima and don't use passwords. Also it only happens sometimes.
I will upgrade and let you know
I can see people wanting both behaviors but my instinct is to use the current value for the `cycleCount` if the parameter is omitted.  After all, what is the point of using `editStream `to set the values if you just have to repeat the values again when you call `playStream`?
Done  Here was a mistake on my part. I was in the folder of the test server, not the one of the regular.  "Bug" fixed
These are my settings:    Thanks for the hint - I'll have another view on the Samples. 
I'll have to try the track kit/crafting. I just was able to get MC back up after fixing a crash in BuildingBricks and getting a fix for TConstruct. 
Just managed to solve it last night.  Was going through the PHP API forum and someone quoted a command with "value-name" parameter for unset functionality.  I tried it on the JAVA API and it worked.  Therefore, the command must be as follows:  `/ip/firewall/filter/unset .id=*9 value-name=time`  Thanks for replying.  Rgs Etienne
AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.9.1, the latest release. Nothing out of the ordinary from the latest log. shows me spawning it in, nothing about when i opened it, then closed it, saved and quit. 
Purging dhcpcd5 helps with this issue. What I also noticed outside of test NET-ETH0-006 scope is that search domain is neither added to `/etc/resolv.conf` nor stored in Kura configuration.  And while we are at it (configuration), there are a few configuration parameters values of which are not trimmed, namely: net.interface.eth0.driver, net.interface.wlan0.firmware.version, net.interface.wlan0.wifi.capabilities, net.interface.wlan0.driver, net.interface.wlan0.driver.version.
Hmmm... Seems inconsistent, I made a simple mock setup with 2 slime generators, the RR gets stuck on one of them, but not the other... I was however, able to completely tear this system down and rebuild it and get the same issue.  Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UMdkniotE&feature=youtu.be  
Yes, i have verified this on 3.1.x branch and it works fine. Thanks @grainier

There must be a problem with header, but how can I overcome it at the moment.  I'd like to use 0.25.0, but for now it's a deal-breaker.

In  installed 2017.03.29 in this device with following results: - This version is working normal without SD  - I cannot(!) find any `/.cgeo` dir on the accesible storage `/mnt/emmc` still e.g. pictures for offline cache seem to be stored somewhere - I cannot create a DB backup:   Seems there is at least any kind of fallback in the market version for the geocache data storage?!
I'm using 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT. Here is what I got, I don't think it is a helpful stacktrace.   
Hi Marco,  After import on a new device the notice from the original device is inte fielnd name. how can sent screenshots and gpx to you? 
Sorry if my explanation wasn't clear enough. I use swift_library rule in my own project which is located in a different workspace than Bazel. I build it with pre-built bazel 0.4.0 from Homebrew. To load the rule I use:  but when I use it the build fails with error from the first post. If I add `xcrunwrapper` binding to my project's WORKSPACE file the build succeeds. I'm not sure if it's the intended behaviour that user should provide the binding or just using `load` should be enough.
of course, I start the  “docker-compose.yml” in "\sitewhere-recipes-masterr\docker-compose\infrastructure_default" first. it seams that the infrastructure_default starts successfully. the log file is attached below. [docker compose up-log - infrastructure_default.txt](https://github.com/sitewhere/sitewhere/files/2065713/docker.compose.up-log.-.infrastructure_default.txt)
I didn't experience this crash on my device, so I don't know what really happen before crash.  The app is an music player, which can stream YouTube DASH audio, HLS live video, and local music on user phone. No clue to know which source user was playing.  I use `HlsMediaSource` for HLS video, `ExtractorMediaSource` for the rest, compose with `ConcatenatingMediaSource` and `LoopingMediaSource` as the only one argument to call `prepare` .  This error didn't happen on previous `ExoPlayer` version that I used: `r2.4.3` 
Hi!  I updated to the latest version (version 11) and unfortunately the problem still exists. Here's how the main screen looks now on my same phone.  ![screenshot_2016-11-17-17-07-32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22891293/20396076/ad2ffd3e-aced-11e6-9046-15593689246c.png)  As can be seen, the screen looks a little bit different (better in my opinion), but still only 4 checkboxes can be accessed. I'm not sure if it's a new feature or a bug, but when the first serving is checked, it checks all servings. If it's a new feature, I think it is pretty cool. :) Anyway, with that feature/bug, all 5 servings can be checked (although you cannot uncheck the fifth serving once checked the first time). So it's possible now to check all servings, although the original problem still exists.  Also, I believe I can't reopen the issue, perhaps you could do that? 
@mangrish  The problem lies somewhere in `session.context().getNodeEntity(mappedRelationship.getStartNodeId())`, which returns null (on the line linked above).  Unfortunately I could not reproduce it in a small scale (couple of nodes). I will give it another go later today..

Yeah /authme email exists. I think it had this bug a long time ago – I must have tested with an old version once and confused the commands 
@davidfestal the only result I get is in `testUtils.ceylon`. The other results don't show up. 
I have not updated to bukkit yet, but I have plans to within the next week or two. I will close the issue based on transition to bukkit. Thanks for looking at it. 
im not sure... it just does it all the time... in the beginning it had time periods where it randomly did this for like 5 min then it stopped for a while then it started and so on... but now its all the time... Im using something called spigot the latest version 1.6.2 
I don't think it's related to item textures for my router blocks specifically - the bug affects *all* held items (e.g. an RFTools block).  Other than chests, which seem to render fine - but I know they have some special rendering...  I don't think it's relevant, but my routers do use a custom baked model because they can be camouflaged.  But under normal circumstances, that custom baked model just returns the parent model (i.e. the router's real baked model).  Only when camouflaged does it return the model of the camo block being used.  No, I'm pretty sure it's down to that ``bindTexture()`` call I make in the particle rendering code.  If I comment that, all your rendering is fine (but my particle rendering breaks, of course...)
The caches are not accessible, only the images are kept stored. For consistency, they should be purged at the same time as the caches.  What you are asking is something else (do not expunge old caches) that should be raised in another issue. Maybe an option could be used to set/clear this behaviour (but most people will expect the data to be cleared, they don't even know the data is here as it is in a hidden folder). 
You've described that correctly, but for example even if the report "every 7%" does not hit exactly 100%, I think that the framework should always report 100% status in the end of measurement (when it terminates executor). In my case the most often used measurement is just the last measurement, which is used for comparisons. If this will be fixed, I think I would get a bit more consistent numbers. 
I did some quick tests and my assumptions that pmd/checkstyle/lint would be faster if run alone is incorrect.  > time ./gradlew clean pmd checkstyle lint findbugs > BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3m 17s  > time ./gradlew clean testDebugUnitTest > BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 16s 
yes,just press keyboard shortcut will meet exception. press button works well.
Thanks for investigating. I guess I cannot do anything myself about it - any idea when you can resolve this? 
I already tried to switch to every single version of citizens and bukkit/spigot, In my web host and in my computer. They usually disappear when I join another server and come back to mine, it's not an issue with any other plugin too, because I already tested citizens completely free from any other plugin in the server, and this still happens. But my server is currently running spigot 1.8.8 R0.1-SNAPSHOT, but I can ensure it's not an issue with the jar server or my client.

Yes it is reproducible for the CPU view only. With large 4-5 minutes traces, I get it for all CPUs, but to see the problem faster, I get it from the os-events benchmark trace (http://archive.eclipse.org/tracecompass/test-traces/os-events.tar.gz) for CPU2 only.
@michaelzangl Yes, definitely. It's not high terrain, like in #215 . It's steep terrain, probably the maximum amount of height difference.

Hi   Thx for the quick replies! I already applied this trick as a workaround (stripping the double quotes and any whitespaces within before passing the header on to SubscriptionStateParser). Therefore I registered my own version of StringMsgParser, which works pretty well.  Unfortunately we are not producing this subscription message on our own and I can not influence the messages sent by the remote party (in this a case a 3rd party integration). I was also surprised by the text param :-) Unfortunately we need to verify against this param value somehow.    FYI: My company is Frequentis AG Austria We are currently using it for an in-house integration testing software where we have to integrate with several SIP / RTP interfaces.  Thx for your support. 
Yeah, I know, I even downloaded that `.aar` and tried it locally, still nothing, can't recognise the `Logger` class (or `LogLevel`)

No problem, I will post a new EnderIO issue. Sorry I thought it was a problem with BC...
Hi @eivantsov after those warning messge I'm receiving the following popups:  Unable to initialize IDE Workspace agent is no longer responding.

Hi  mqtt-spy: 0.4.0 (build 12) java: 8 update71 (build 1.8.0_71-b15)  Regards 
For your convenience, I have [generated sample certificates](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-plugin/files/107507/docker-internal-certificates.zip) for 1 server and 1 client.  Those certificates were generated with `OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015` on Mac OS X 10.11.2.  I have production certificates which were generated by `OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013` on CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core).  Both seem to replicate the issue.  I'll attempt to write up a test case though my Java skills are pretty weak.  I'm a lot better at reading Java than I am at writing it (if that makes sense).  ---  Additionally, your hypothesis about "caused by multiple docker-java libraries from different plugins in your jenkins installation" is likely incorrect.  I newly provisioned Jenkins today (and yesterday).  The only plugins installed other than the built-in are: git, github, github-oauth, docker-plugin.  There's no other docker-related plugins installed. 
My output base is _not_ itself inside a git repository and `//src/test/shell/bazel:skylark_git_repository_test` passes for me.
@jeenbroekstra below are the test cases and code change required to fix it. If it looks ok then I can signup and do proper PR etc.    
Not at least. But I was wondering about the fact, that ganttproject tries to read directory C:/windows/fonts, which is not available on a macOS system. Maybe it would be better to ask for the system instead of try to read it.  Obviously it took a long time (2 seconds or more) until the tooltip is shown.
Hello @langsmith , thanks for the reply.  Yes, I am running the global flavor, I also tried the china flavor too. I have generated an access token on my mapbox dahboard, and I am using it in the app. I am trying to display a default map, and also looking to explore the offline maps capabilities of mapbox.
I made a mistake. It's not `ObjectStorageObjectServiceImpl.getMetaData(ObjectLocation)` throws NPE, but ObjectStorageObjectServiceImpl.get(ObjectLocation)`that throws NPE for non 2xx. I haven't tested it yet with`getMetaData  I have updated the title of this issue. 
Hi Sure, I have tested locally and updating the `bundleImportPackages` seems to be working. I'll submit a PR.
The bug was from an older version of Pet Buddy. I have got a new version set and now it's working fine. If you still want the crash report you can ask me.
@TonyLo1 These issues are related. I am not quite sure about the technical details - I would prefer to write and experiment with the interpreter. Just to see if this is a better solution to the issue which I am seeing here. It's just a suggestion.
Yes. I think there is a connection between editing the old photo and opening the owncloud app. I just edited a new photo and right after i opened the owncloud app three (old) other photos were reuploaded the sixth time.

It's this plugin: https://ore.spongepowered.org/blood/GriefPrevention They were working fine together until a chestshop was made in an admin claim. I saw the console started just spitting out errors so I tried to restart it, and I could no longer join. This was the first chest shop that was made so I don't know if it's just them in general or if it was because it was in a claim.  I've stopped using Total Economy in the meantime, but I kept a backup of the files from when it was last on so I'll try disabling the chest shops now.  EDIT: Same results with chestshops disabled. Also tried deleting GriefPrevention.
I'm on (Arch) Linux, so this seems to be some sort of universal problem with rstudio.
> What does not active by default mean? Do you have a pointer to some doc on this?

This is because the relevant modules are [not present in the runtime by default.](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/261#EE-modules).  The end result of this is that running the enRoute examples with `java -jar app.jar` blows up due to missing XML packages (needed by JAX-RS). There is no resolver warning about this because bnd expects these packages to come from the platform, which they don't without using extra launch arguments.

Hmm, looks like it's been tweaked in 1.8.2. I'm going to retest it.  Ok, haven't tested yet, but I have a theory. Does the code take the /current/ speed of the horse and multiply it then set the /base/ speed? Because I had a mod giving nearby entities slowness 3. So if it took the current speed modified by slowness, and then set the /base/ speed to a certain percentage over /that/ it might effectively reduce the speed stat, since the decrease from the slowness effect would be more than the increase from the carrot. I'll have to test as soon as I can get minecraft finally booted up.  YES!!! That does seem to be the problem, when the horse is under slowness it decreases the speed, when not, it increases the speed. BTW, the reduced speed increase in v1.10.2-1.8.2 makes it require a lot more carrots. Especially since I started at a low speed stat after it decreased it initially. I think I used 2 stacks just getting it up to 2.7x. from like 0.5x or something, I can't remember. Edit: Then again the lower the value the lower the increase and vice versa for higher values. Since it's a percentage based increase. You could maybe just make it add a flat 0.1X increase to the speed stat by I think just adding 0.01 to the base speed.  Apparently, it also works in reverse with speed splash potions, greatly boosting the speed increase granted by the carrots, of course I think I was using speed 2.  So until it's fixed the work around would just be to make sure the horse isn't under potion effects that effect speed when using the carrots.

Correct, if it is less than 8 chars then account validation function gets confused. As long as it is equal to 8 chars it is fine. It does not even needs to be POSIX compliant.  Though having it as POSIX compliant would help in case of integrating it with an LDAP server or federated authentication in future...

1. Open the app 2. Tap the plus in the lower left corner to create a new task. Name it    "crashing test task". 3. Tap done, then re open the task (otherwise the task will remain with the    name "new task") 4. Tap the add more button 5. Tap file 6. Tap photo, audio, or file. 7. Depending on which button you picked, take a picture of the wall, gibber    into the microphone and press ok, or add a file from your downloads page. 8. When you try to add the file, the app will crash. 9. Reload the app and try to open "crashing test task", the app will crash.

My reasons to use Lux: - in lowlight conditions (mainly at night) the screen is too bright for me, the (black-transparent) overlay reduces the brightness further - i can create sensor-reading/screen-brightness pairs and control the auto-brightness this way  I understand the tap-jacking concerns. For me I found a solution now (~~actually I found two ...~~):  1. ~~In the Lux app there  is an option to use an "alternative overlay", which does not cause the unresponsiveness in the Owncloud-app. I dont know, if that alternative overlay works for me like the standard one, but I will see.~~ (Alternative overlay causes the same issue) 2. The Lux app has a list of apps, that cause the overlay to be deactivated while one of these apps is in the foreground (this list contains the android package installer per default, which seems to have a similar tap-jacking protection). So I added the Owncloud app to that list.  
It's probably not exactly the same as the UMS one, but I'm only using a FileAppender (see [logback.xml](https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/files/45903/logback.xml.txt)).

Yes, I can confirm this. The two jar libraries I use come from the sonatype snapshot repository and are: - quasar-core-0.7.4-20150921.123502-3-jdk8.jar - quasar-kotlin-0.7.4-20150921.123715-3.jar  The Kotlin version I use in my project is `0.13.1514`.  Removing it will probably result in it not being instrumented at all, but I will test that and get back to you.  Adding a Kotlin annotation would probably be the best way to go - it leaves the Java annotations as-is which is working all good but if a new annotation would be able to hint the instrumenting then that would be the cleanest solution I think.  When there's anything I need to test furthermore please do let me hear. 
Yes. the problem occurs every single time. One more observation: I had added a calender widget before and every time I start OpenLauncher now, it starts with the calendar widget selected and the resizing arrows active. Even if I delete the widget and the select "all apps" leading to the crash, the calendar widget will still appear the same way when I restart OpenLauncher. Weird, isn't it? :-)
@DavyLandman, no module import, just the syntax definition standalone, thus I don't understand where the Rascal grammar comes from.
It's difficult to explain, the behaviour changes at each execution... Example of problem :  - In advanced user control mode :    I change the value "Kill cells" to 5, then the value "Create cells" to 1, when I click "Kill cells", only one cell will be destroyed instead of 5.   Then I relaunch the simulation, and the behaviour is totally different :    I hover the 2 fields "Kill cells" and "Create cells", the two fields change their values to "nil".  The search field is focused with a simple mouse hover, that is not normal. - In non advanced user control mode, I have to quit the mouse focus of the button "Kill one cell" and regain the focus for each click. A double / triple click on the button will activate the function only once.

@tomwhite Sorry!  I wasn't thinking, we keep hitting this issue in different places and I was assuming you had seen it before. The issue is that there was no spec for contig names, and when they made hg38 they allowed contig names like `HLA:1-3:52-*:6+` which are terrible because they are ambiguous with the format for specifying intervals.  Everyone in the world who wrote software that parses contig names and intervals was using the implicit assumption that `:` and `-` didn't appear in the contig names and write intervals as `contig:start-stop`.  So we had to modify all the code that parses intervals to first try to understand it as a complete contig name and if that matches a contig in the sequence dictionary stop parsing it.    I will track down a file that triggers the issue.
Files are fully accessible from both stock and nonstock (FX) file managers - renaming, deleting and other modifications work.  And yes, there are files present in regular media library and adding them to the playlist works normally - I am able to play them.
Thanks! I've made a local build of the latest master and the NPE no longer occurs. :-)

Using the Query to do the prepopulation will work very well.  This resolves my issue, but a couple more thoughts on the original issue.  Concerning which methods I would recommend being abstract, It appears that all your methods are performing necessary functionality. Although if a user were to be implementing their own QueryView, I would imagine the points of customization would probably be in initialization, on refresh, adding an item, and removing an item. However with all the functionality the methods that perform these operations contain, I would only want to override them and make sure I called the super method in my implementation.  Maybe the real issue is that the LazyQueryContainer accepts any implementation of QueryView, but it seems that your intent is to enforce the LazyQueryView? Maybe it would just be easiest to remove the final modifier on LazyQueryView and tell users it's their own fault if they extend it and don't call the super methods. :)

No.  v0.30 fixed for me the skype problem, but not at all this one.  
I've called Stage.show(), but that stage has been closed. The app is still running in the background and another stage may be shown in the future....but when the notification needs to be shown, there may or may not be a Stage present.
The version is structr-3.2.1-201904081513.bb967. I do not remember exactly how the situation was created. Now I tried to reproduce thing by remembering:  At the time i had no clue how to use the Pages tab. I didn't know about the tree view and tried to delete a page via the "Properties" menu.  There i clicked a "x" which was probably the "x" beside the name. After doing this the name was set to null and the behavior described above set it. I think it is reproducible this way.
Reproducible all the time with arbitrary class names and differing and equal short names on all clusters.

As expected, this works perfectly : the @class and the SELECT results both have {firstname,name}  This is the workaround I use to import my data, renaming name to lastname in the orientd database afterwards with :      ALTER PROPERTY Member.name NAME lastname;     UPDATE Member REMOVE name;  (btw, I wonder why I do have to remove the 'name' field, which is still present in data after the ALTER PROPERTY...)

@michaelwittig `condrestart` would restart the service if it is already running, so it would have the same effect as a `restart`.  What would be better is a `reload` (SIGHUP to reload configuration by a running daemon) but OpenSSH re-execs and daemonizes itself on a SIGHUP (which is what gets sent by a `reload`). So that wouldn't work, since the way it treats a SIGHUP is equivalent to `restart`.   This should cover the CloudFormation use case.   I'm also going to package together a .deb since I'll need to use that for my company (our setup scripts for AWS pull down deb packages from a private repo to install and configure our apps). Out of curiosity, are you manually packaging the RPM or using an authoring tool like FPM (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm)?

I have write fanart and poster, overwrite fanart and poster, write actor images, and write extra fan art when writing data....., and rename movie file. I already have most of my stuff scraped from data18 with the xbmc data 18 scraper. Your scraper brings in a much better poster image. higher resolution. And I use it to rename the folder to movie name with year. So if I scrape a movie with the standalone scraper it pulls in the better image but when I click write it doesn't overwrite the old image. It does everything else. Like change the folder name and overwrites the .nfo and the actor images. Other than it being the old crapy poster when I go back to the movie, I notice that the file size is still very small and the modified date is from the previous xbmc scraping.

Ok, I've tried something different: I changed the mapping etc. to have the same set-up as in the documentation.  new Field:   Just for clarification: There is no suggestion missing. I'm looking for "bohrer" which is returned for confidence=0.  What I noticed is the following: When I create a fresh index and start to index data, at the beginning everything is working with confidence="1". And at some point (which seems not really deterministic), I have to adjust the confidence value to "0" to get any result.  I don't get it, in my opinion the set up is the same as in the documentation. Is there still a weird configuration? I will try to distill a dataset that reproduces this behaviour, but this seems to be difficult.

@geoand: right!   Some of the examples include integration tests. There are other cases, that might not justify an example and those cases are handled directly inside the the annotation module (see #66).

_UPDATE: I was testing a lot back and forth while writing the below and now I can't get it to work with websockets/chrome anymore either, but I have no idea what I did. Anywho, if this persists I guess I'll have to workaround using cookies sicen that works now as per issue #485 (thanks!) and fetch the object manually from cache - I still think it would be fantastic if it was possible to access the attributes on the wrapped request, so I am leaving the description below. :) Thanks!_  Sorry if I was unclear: I already have an object stored on the request, that I want to fetch using request.getAttribute(). The object is set using setAttribute(), earlier, on the regular HttpServletRequest object by a regular servlet serving JSPs and I need to retreive it inside the Atmosphere handler servlet. This works when using websockets, but not when using long-polling. As I understand it, the HttpServletRequest is wrapped by the AtmospehereRequest and this is why this works, but perhaps the wrapping is incomplete in long polling version?  I never got Atmosphere test code up and running properly, but the minimal testcase would be to have a regular servlet doing something like:    And make sure that ws is actually fetched properly. In my case it's not a String, but a custom Object, but should be the same. This already works in websocket code, like I said. _UPDATE: as said above, now it doesn't but I don't know why. I "should" be back on the code that works now before trying to work out IE issues, but it stopped working._ 
my friend did not crash, he disconnected meaning there was no crash report to post for the bug report. Disconnections will take you off the server and bring you back to the home page. disconnecting does not provide crash logs. 
Hi @JeanRev I'm on 0.3.3 (Docker Cloud Plugin Cloud Agent Plugin for Docker containers 0.3.3 (build 27fa717e5e02a9bbc9dc43bb154a2d2b9378e412) - from your previous issue link looks like it was fixed in 0.2.3?  I downloaded the plugin directly from here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9306-docker-cloud.  Should I build from the repo instead
I tried it with `[PagedContacts.displayName, PagedContacts.phoneNumbers, PagedContacts.emailAddresses]`.
> However isn't this brittle because a writer of a SAM may expect that they get back their custom principal or am I missing something?  It's may be brittle indeed, but the entire construct is already a bit brittle in the spec itself.   The question is what the guarantees are when the SAM does `request#getUserPrincipal` without having invoked the handler yet. The SAM developer knows this is not a "normal" user principal. I.e. the SAM can't use the normal logic `userPrincipal == nulll -> not authenticated, userPrincipal != null -> authenticated`. The != null means here "there is an object available that can be used as signal for the container to restore the previous saved identity". Note that at this point `request#isUserInRole` is not expected to work either, since the SAM hasn't actually authenticated yet.  You _could_ perhaps speculate that the SAM has to treat ``request#getUserPrincipal` as an opaque object only used to signal the container and not as an actual principal.  I admit, I don't know if this is correct, but that was the original reasoning behind the suggestion ;)  I quickly looked at the current fix:    Would that make sense? 
Hi Simo!  I will commit the fix soon (hopefully in some minutes). Github recognizes the comment and adds it automatically to the issue. 
yes 
I already put that in the JSON file, see  https://github.com/raphaelm/opacclient/blob/master/src/de/geeksfactory/opacclient/apis/Pica.java#L893 https://github.com/raphaelm/opacclient/blob/master/assets/bibs/Mainz_Uni.json  but it does not help for some strange reason 
It is possible that it wasn't shutdown correctly though this instance is running on one of our cloud servers. We have a policy of not using kill -9 unless there is no other choice. Due to the fact that the instance is running in the cloud, nor does the machine ever experience a sudden loss of power. I'll try to get the db. Andrey, I think you know this already, but it needs to be stated. A general problem with Orient DB continues to be that the database is brittle, and over time information is lost. We see this behavior on pretty much all installations.
The second part of my example shows 'escape' format: `val c = cp.queryAwait("""set bytea_output to 'escape'; select E'\\001\\007'::bytea as b""").next().first().getBuffer(0).bytes` It changes format of select to 'escape' and tries to read it. This causes errors.  In my opinion best way is to give option to execute custom SQL on connection creation or option to handle event of connection creation (afterCreateEvent)
Generally, what would be needed in the case of those bridleways would be for people to tag them on osm with the relavent information. so when they are bare earth, they should be tagged using the surface:earth or similar. In general, the way type just says whether the way "could" be used, but then the other information is used to actually determine if it is useful for that particular user.  I think we could do yhat you suggested and limit the bridleways to be only if they have been tagged as wheelchair=*, but I believe that tehre are very few that would be tagged that way
I tried it with the latest version. Fixed the issue! Great! 
That is the primary use case I have seen sofar.  
Sure, for example:  目に立つ  Actually, as I just noted, the bug also occurs when one doesn't edit anything. When exporting the 目に立つ for example, the Kanji / Readings field becomes 目[め]に立[た]つ (which would have to be changed to 目[め]に 立[た]つ in order to have the furigana centered correctly), but the flashcard only displays 目つ then, which wasn't the case with the older version of Aedict.

Sorry, I forgot that.  http://hastebin.com/eyegibahid  I wasn't able to provide this report right after the time it happened, I had to restart the server. But I'm available to provide extra info or server logs to fix this issue.  Thanks for your attention and quick reply. 
Hi Martin,  I'm fairly new to this, so how do I do the debug in order to provide you the necessary information? As far as I can see it was working on 2.2.0 Build #1099. Then I started to have some problems with another binding and then I switched back to a backup RPi3 with the former stable release 2.1 where both was working. 
VSCode
Okay.  Only here I've used the library    
Oh sorry, I meant to add the version.  Anyway I had the bug in 2.1.2 & 2.1.3

Yah i can send you a screen shot but may take a minute.
Not yet, though I would not object going for no. 1 first and maybe find a better solution later.  
I fixed the link. Also, I have just verified that this problem occurs only on a linux box but not on a Windows box. 
3.6. However this was happening with 3.5 and maybe previous versions. 
I don't think it's a good idea to alter the index name automatically (e.g. to lower-case it), as it may be quite surprising to the user. Could you perhaps create the index upon first arrival of a source record from a given topic? Then you'd automatically apply whatever name transformations have been configured.  If that's not viable, I'd question the decision to deprecate the old mapping option and suggest to un-deprecate it, as it can safely be applied eagerly to create the index(es) as well as when handling individual source records.
@swankjesse I am not explicitly closing the cache, its probably getting closed by Retrofit.  I could catch the exception in `chain.proceed(request)` but then I don't know what to return in the `intercept` method. Would returning `null` be fine? 
I tested it that way. Because that link is shared on other apps too and it works well. only email on ios is having problems. the link is a dynamic link. so it has several params to open needed page later when app starts
It's github.com.
Thanks a lot for the fix. Works fine in plain react-native + 9.13.3
Not a problem. I am running version 3.1.3.
I did sent the right one and the problem was present before, but I can't reproduce it now. Closing this.
@wvpaf ok, thank you. We will try soon.  @fredgc yes, of course we can play different content on our Nexus Player. The same stream (but not encrypted) is playing good.   
@AndyScherzinger No, didnt report it on the device. I'm sure the issue happened only on Android 8.0, everything worked fine on Android 7.0; I just upgraded to Android 8.0 last weekend.
The problem is the deserialization process of the regionData.   ### Reason  When restoring the region from MonitoringStatus.restoreMonitoringStatus(), the method CallBack.readObject() is not called if the CallBack class is minified  ### Complementary Observation  Looking more in detail to the code to understand the reason of the bug, there is a strange Callback initialization for the regionData.  While in the BeaconService.startMonitoringBeaconsInRegion, there is a callback object as parameter, it's not transmitted to create the regionData. In fact, the MonitoringStatus class is reacreating a callback...  #### Actual code  **> Beacon Service**

Here you go: https://gist.github.com/duritong/0b4092bef52725f25e99 
i had this with the previous version (fully buggued :) ), now i can't reproduce it too
Here is the expected behavior   
I restarted the server, so the problem is temporarly fixed. I'll post the full stats once the problem reappear, which it will in 12hours or so :)  Thanks. 
@AlexIIL I have tried with both and the bug persists/ed with both.  @turbodiesel4598 Thanks for patching that so quickly, I'll have to call it a night though because I'm rather true to my username. I'll have some feedback on this in ~15 hours
@hollingsworthd yes, that's correct. Sorry I forgot to mention that. 
@alexbegt sorry I deleted it
Hi @ilayaperumalg ,  Yes we saw this fix, we are currently using it (we cloned the yesterday's spring-cloud-dataflow version).  Can you  specify  the way to retrieve some debug level log that can help you (for the ModuleLauncher side) please ? thanks 
Oh sorry, yep I mean the Workspace root. I had to reduce it because my file paths were getting too long for windows. I changed the workspace root in P4V, closed P4V, moved the folders to match the new root, and re-opened P4V. Everything was fine in perforce, but now I am getting this error in Android Studio. Somewhere the old root path is being saved. I checked the registry and couldn't find anything. P4V and p4 cmd both say the root is correct.  Thanks for the quick reply :) 
I'd completely forgotten about it... only noticed as I'm updating my example projects that use the plugins for a talk and forgot to include the other dependencies and thought to myself how is it even baking a site without them being declared. 
Sure I can do that. It looks like the Restriction object already does the optional check in the constructor, so only the parser should need to be updated.
Jose, thanks for looking in on this.    I've created a branch https://github.com/edlunde-dnastar/biojava/tree/mmcif-seqres that incorporates (1) the fix for the finding all chains in all models, and (2) disables the `replaceGroupSeqPos()` method that causes mis-numbering.  A unit test for 2KSA is in the TestDifficultMmCIFFiles.java.  The first listed residue ASP in chain A, should be residue 2.  This is correctly specified by the _atom_site records, but made incorrect by later changing again in `replaceGroupSeqPos()`.  I think trying to renumber by the _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme is actually incorrect/unnecessary here.  Take a look.  The first change would fix the bug (1) only. 
I tried on my test case and found it working with no problem, following similar test cases in _spoon/src/test/java/spoon/test/path/PathTest.java_  now i guess this issue might come from minor differences between spoon and gumtree-spoon-ast-diff

The code sample includes comments for what output I get. I would maybe expect both System.out.println(datastore.find(TestEntityB.class, "entityA", a).get());  and System.out.println(datastore.find(TestEntityB.class, "entityA", a.id).get());  to return the correct result, rather than no results and the correct results with a warning, respectively? 
@kseniiaguzeeva I did (but this tracker does not support hosting it).
Restarting the phone didn't help (I assume this would close all old syncthing instances). Any Idea, what the error code 11 is about? I would check the syncthing source, but I don't know what to look for, I never worked with go.

Yes of course.  It was during a game of EDH with 3 players. One of the players casted his Gonti Lord of Luxury targeting me. He got the wurm and then casted it. When the wurm died and went to my graveyard, I then returned it to my hand. After this was done, the wurm was not castable. It did not appear as a castable option as the rest of the creatures in my hand for the rest of the game.
settings->protocol unfortunately does not include any entry for the crash
Like ensure R8/Proguard rules are correct. From this https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/22877, it looks like something is broken.
I'm currently using OpenSans.
i tried to test it but .. im doing it wrong.  i downloaded your code via zip file from github.  i changed the version in your pom to 0.3.3-SNAPSHOT  then made mvn install and copied the resulting jar to my project folder.  then i tried to reference the local dependency like that:          dependency-             groupId-com.github.koraktor /groupId               artifactId-mavanagaiata /artifactId               version-0.3.3-SNAPSHOT /version              scope-system /scope              systemPath- /myprojectdir/mavanagaiata-0.3.3-SNAPSHOT.jar /systemPath         /dependency-  then i got this error:  [WARNING] The POM for com.github.koraktor:mavanagaiata:jar:0.3.3-SNAPSHOT is missing, no dependency information available  how should i proceed? 
If you are testing this through the Twitch Launcher, Twitch has the tendency to enable/disable other mods related or at least dependent on the one you disable/enable. An example is disabling JEI will disable Just Enough Resources and Twilight Forest (theres more too, but that's not important). Re-enabling JER will re-enable JEI, but re-enabling Twilight Forest does not.
Thanks @bsideup - I'll try to get some time whilst I still have a Windows machine available (one more day....).   Actually when building `testcontainers` current `master` on this same (Windows 10) machine I was getting several test failures, so may be more things to investigate / fix than I thought (related, perhaps).
Sure.  1. Built and deployed app module on my device 2. Open the app while connected via wifi. 3. Pull down notification area and switch off wifi 4. Close notification area 5. Result is as in screenshot  I'm afraid that's all I have. I just now noticed when there is a small delay between losing wifi and connecting to the mobile network it seems to recover. Of course there is a short time where it's disconnected and then correctly reconnects. So this might only occur if the switch is instantaneously? Maybe some kind of race-condition.
Okay, I tried again today and huh? It is working now!  No idea what went wrong before. Your question came in quite late. During these 2 weeks an update must have fixed it. I see no errors in the logs which is good.

1. Java used in both (5.0.7, 5.1.1) cases: `OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_171-b10)`, haven't tried others yet.  1.

Reproduce this behavior only with TConstruct (and it's dependencies) and PlusTiC is impossible, because there's no way to charge laser (even in creative). After adding some mod with energy (Actually Additions/Thermal Expansion or any other) it can be simply reproduced with any laser. Where is Ender Dragon when I'm shooting? It can be anywhere - from pedestal (portal) in center of End to far regions. It can look like this: laser shoots but Dragon doesn't get any damage. (As you could see, damaged entity colored in red, but on these screenshots Dragon isn't.) ![2017-10-03_07 01 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14104815/31109586-95c1bd00-a809-11e7-85c8-66cc405e8196.png) ![2017-10-03_07 01 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14104815/31109587-95cd1e2a-a809-11e7-9282-2085585ec3d7.png)

The Arduino environment is used to control a sanguinololu board with ATMega1284 processor at 16 MHz. The application is the control of a 3D printer : Geeetech Aluminium Prusa I3.   The firmware for the printer is here : https://www.geeetech.com/forum/download/file.php?id=1651&sid=d8b76b9ece6689ff9c7b818f4a38e637  The sanguinololu environment is downloaded from : https://www.geeetech.com/forum/download/file.php?id=3604&sid=d8b76b9ece6689ff9c7b818f4a38e637  I have changed the speed in board.txt to set it to 57600 bps. In the Arduino environment, I select the sanguinololu board and the ATMega1284 processor with 16 MHz.   When I try to download the firmware, I got the following message from the IDE: Arduino : 1.8.5 (Windows 7), Carte : "Sanguino, ATmega1284 or ATmega1284P (16 MHz)"  avrdude: Version 6.3, compiled on Jan 17 2017 at 12:00:53          Copyright (c) 2000-2005 Brian Dean, http://www.bdmicro.com/          Copyright (c) 2007-2014 Joerg Wunsch           System wide configuration file is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr/etc/avrdude.conf"           Using Port                    : COM3          Using Programmer              : arduino          Overriding Baud Rate          : 115200 avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 1 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x3a avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 2 of 10: not in sync: resp=0xe1 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 3 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x71 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 4 of 10: not in sync: resp=0xb0 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 5 of 10: not in sync: resp=0xf1 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 6 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x3a avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 7 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x26 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 8 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x98 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 9 of 10: not in sync: resp=0xb0 avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x49  avrdude done.

Then why does it have the settings? You should take it out if it doesn't work.
Absolutely.
I'm not sure now, I don't get it yet, but it seems like HaxeReferenceExpression, has bindToElement, which create new reference to file/package, not sure about class  I think it might be close, basically it changes reference to point to certain file or package, but should it do it for class

@laa I sent it to you in an email. Did you get it? Is there another way you would like me to send it to you? (I noticed that this is still flagged as "waiting reply".)

1No, it is 2 separate transactions 2 LINKLIST. Im trying to index blob (stored as a list of ORecordBytes) by Lucene, not sure it is a right way  For Lucene index, isNullValuesIgnored() is false (really?), but OLuceneTxChangesMultiRid doesnt support removing null value 
I had `min_native_version` set as 1, and I'm not sure what `CFBundleVersion` would be. In my `config.xml` I have `version = 0.38.0` 
In the 5.0.0.-M4 version can not reproduce

@eivantsov I know that if I refresh the tab ,is can works. But I do not want to refresh it ! Is there any resolutions?
It was with any .mp3 via network -- I can't provide additional detail, as I've already moved forward with a different library :( 
I found an instruction file `centos6-quickstart.txt` in the 'doc' directory, with the help of this file I finally launched the project.   New Question!!! It seems that zipkin can not find the services. I open the `localhost:8080` and see the zipkin UI, the `Service` droplist has no items. I open the localhost `localhost:9900` and `localhost:9901`, I can see the hello text.  I think it is the problem of zookeeper, it can not find the servers, right? When I launch the `bin/collector` and `bin/query`, I find some WARNs and ERRORs.   
It is Jenkins ver. 1.531.  Regards,  Daniel 
On 1.11.2 it don't works, just on Russian too, but it works on 1.7.10
I'm using 0.13.7, the latest version that appears via F-droid.

Steps to reproduce (Android Studio 2.3.3): 1) Run ADBWiFiConnect, selected desired device from list of saved devices 2) Run and load app 3) Select attach debugger and select process 4) Press stop 5) Select attach debugger again  Observe there is no process to attach
@stychu it's not that it doesn't start, it simply hangs in the "initializing hot reload" doesn't always happen but when attached to debugger it happens way more than not.
Oups! I looked at the decompiled result of the 0.14.1 binary distribution but did not pull the last sources. I'm sorry for the disturbance ... 
Yes, I call that from activitie's onCreate() method 
@michel-cf -  My theory here:  > The connection information in my display is a single line, whereas yours is two lines that looks like it wrapped at the edge of the pane. This is probably why the positioning is off by more.  Maybe this will help... here's his screenshot: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1266318/18108614/e1999770-6ec1-11e6-994b-b24367f211b6.png) 
It's ok now, thank you :) 
@tinwelint  
I think the easiest path would be to ensure that we use a random temporal File by getting one with `Files.createTempFile()`. I'd try that before trying more complicated stuff...
The `DoubleComparator` returns false. I think the problem lies in `NormalizedKeySorter` because the support is checked in the constructor but in `write(T record)`     is called anyway. Would it be ok to simply remove the thrown `UnsupportedException` in `putNormalizedKey` of the comparator? 
@gabizou @kashike   If Vanilla singleplayer behaves as @gabizou describes for the latter point, we will not be changing that functionality. 
Everything is working fine. Nice work btw.  Greetings Andre  
I'm using version 0.7.3 in 64-bit Eclipse Kepler on 64-bit Windows 10. The original graphs that throw this error are massive. I can extract it if you wish, but the code below reproduces the NullPointer as well.    Edit: I noted before that the above code did not include the stacktrace. It returned after restarting Eclipse. Three cheers for turning it off and on again. 
Let me pull out a simplified dataset and code example that reproduces the issue.    The key hashing is consistent and immutable and the transaction is disabled. The value isn't immutable.  But I can make it be.  I will also give it a try with the cacheDisabled 
Replace `ReadConverter.makeRead()` completely, copy `ReadBAMTransform.getReadsFromBAMFilesSharded()` and associated code to hellbender and add tests for it.

I was using the ones listed at the [placeholderAPI wiki](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#pvp-stats), but as i see those are outdated, the one you said now just worked. I suggest adding them to the plugin page and updating them at the PAPI page
It had something to do with trying to start successive scripts (either after the last script-run threw an error or some other trigger)

You are right. My problem comes from the fact that with GAMA 1.6.1, the reflexes of an experiment were executed at the end of each simulation (i.e. each repetition). Now, it is only called at the end of the each parameter set (only once even if there are several repetitions). I don't know if it is the expected behavior of the experiment reflexes, but it poses some compatibility problems. 
No worries, i was loading the list items before and everything was near identical to the sample. I've since decided against AdMob altogether, please don't concern yourself! :) 
No.  I think any of the other mods come into a conflict with your mod, but I dont know wich other mod apply this bug. Thats why I post it here, maybe we can find the issue.
        mLottieView.setImageAssetDelegate(new ImageAssetDelegate() {             @Override             public Bitmap fetchBitmap(LottieImageAsset asset) {                 Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(GiftUtil.getJsonFileDir(mCurrentZipName , mGiftType) + "/images/" + asset.getFileName(), options);                 if (bitmap == null) {                     LogUtils.e(TAG, "GiftType: "+mGiftType +"  FullScreenGiftView Lottie 加载json图片资源失败：" + asset.getFileName());                 }                 return bitmap;             }         });  I dynamically load the resource pictures in the way above. I suppose there are two JSON files A and B, they all need 3 pictures, when I first went to use this way to load A, asset.getFileName were img_0, img_1, img_2, but when the second time I use the same LottieView and reset the setImageAssetDelegate to load B, asset.getFileName return img_3, img_4 so, img_5, error loading, I think when I use the same Lottie (different JSON files) again when loading the B should return img_0, img_1, img_2.  thank,
After some extra testing, we wrote down these:  When both the gapples and regen are enabled, it's broken. When the gapples are off and the regen on, the hunger part works, but ofcourse the gapples aren't cuz disabled. When gapples are on and the regen off, it doesn't work. Hunger goes down quickly. When both are off, the hunger part works again.  After some more testing, we noticed it's only broken when you've lost health. When it tries to regenerate, it drains your hunger, even right after you gappled. After you eat anything else, like steak or fish, it does fill your saturation however. So it's clearly something with the gapples / regeneration.  Hope this helped :)

### To fix:  To avoid loading chunks, any time you check a tile entity or block in the world that is not at your position, you should check `World#isBlockLoaded` or `World#isAreaLoaded` first.  The way I would solve it in your case would be to have `setSide()` check that the area around it is loaded and return a boolean like this:  https://gist.github.com/mezz/c9569dafd5c11d30b3a6316faaaf3b20 In the `update()` logic you can return right away if `setSide()` returned false. When your turret is on chunk boundaries next to an unloaded chunk, entities and other things are inactive so it will not need to handle updating when it's there.   ### To detect:  The way I found that the turrets are loading chunks was by using Player's Sampler mod. It's a utility mod that's available on [the same page as FastCraft](https://forum.industrial-craft.net/thread/10820-wip-1-7-10-fastcraft-1-25-note-all-posts-of-new-members-need-to-be-approved-firs/). It has a command (`/sampler loads show` to start and `/sampler loads hide` to stop) which create console logs with stack traces any time a chunk gets loaded by something.  The server I tried it on has some turrets right on chunk boundaries, so they are loading each other in some situations (along with some other mods with similar issues, I reported a few!). It is not very easy to detect in development because it often involves multiple mods. The best way I've found is to look through the code for places where you are looking at tile entities or blocks in the world.
Simply right clicking the chisel to open it again will essentially rollback the inventory of the chisel to before you chose and removed a chiseled block, but will keep the chiseled block in your inventory therefor duping it.

Hi Harald,  Thanks for the quick response. I'll add the bug report in attachment.  Best,  Tim [PeptideShaker 1.16.9 log.txt](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker/files/1031964/PeptideShaker.1.16.9.log.txt) 
so i've been doing a bit more testing and break and re-placing the crafting altar block worked but the problem seems to be in the neutral nexus since it always happens with that but never with the other nexi. i don't know about the battery cause i don't know how i would test that. but i found something else you might wanna have a look at: http://youtu.be/14_Yq6EJM8Q  Anyway thanks for the help, i hope to see more awesome stuff and less bugs in the near future :D i'm gonna go play some more and i'll let you know if i find any more bugs  o/ 
I think perhaps an artifact per major findbugs release. So perhaps a new tdd4b2 to support findbugs 2.x. Most new minor or bug fix versions of findbugs will not require changes to the testing framework. On Jul 4, 2013 3:25 AM, "Graham Allan" notifications@github.com wrote:  > Hmmm.

The problem seems to be with the bazel in the docker image gcr.io/cloud-builders/bazel.  That version of bazel is release 0.17.1.   (Found by adding a build step that does `bazel info release`.)   As it happens, 0.17.1 is what I have installed on my local machine, so I can easily provide reproduction instructions that don't use cloud build. 
The same thing happens with the nightly.  A few things that might be helpful in tracking it down:  - It is reliably triggered when I start or stop moving my mouse. - There is sometimes a less-strong baseline level of flicker (not captured on the video) with a semi-constant frequency of about .5hz.  This flicker doesn't last as long as the big long flickers you see on the video.  I get a similar type of flicker when scrolling with the scroll bar.

Thanks Ron for your prompt response.  In response to your questions: 1. English 2. Tried all of the suggestions. Results: a. they slowed down the system even more ( in some cases slightly) b. also tried a clean boot - but that did not help; also reduced screen resolution to 1440x 900- but the slowness persisted c. visual studio improved the speed (to normality) but is not preferred IDE :-)  3. https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/au/en/products/tablets/thinkpad-tablet-series/thinkpad-10/20c3 is the version that I am using.  Sorry for the slow response.
Hi Kay,  I checked it now, and the problem remains. The Browser in use is firefox, and the page is reachable when I put the address direct in the browser url-field - so no firewall rules stop the access.  How does structorizer calls the browser in Linux? Did you try "xdg-open http://help.structorizer.fisch.lu/index.php", which is the current method to call the configured default browser with the given URL. I tested the call in a shell window. HTH Fine regards Rolf 
Just for the record, our workaround was to extend the "ref" and the "on" references to generate a unique ID to each listener on the JS side and manage the callbacks inside our application. The problem was that every callback function had the same ID, so we included a generated hash on the prototype of the function, allowing the firestack to know which listener to detach on the "off" call. (:
I see in `<p:messages />`.  When I load page first time the message not happens. But, if I try login with wrong passaword, I show the error message for user.  With my error message appers: `"Error: Unable to find resource bsf, css/default/icons.css"`  If I remove the BootsFaces, the message not occours.  PS: I have not tried without Maven.

I confirm this is fixed in RC3. 
I could post the logs as well. I'll will get a video of the bug today... With verbose. 
It looks like the problem is that remote posts have an ID similar to `tag:null@channels.buddycloud.org,/user/github@topics.buddycloud.org/posts,092f2389-38e8-445c-a347-6e1bd3308add`, and local posts just have `092f2389-38e8-445c-a347-6e1bd3308add`. So when you prepend it with a node name, for local posts you have node,id and for remote posts you have node,tag,node,id. Right ?   So why are remote posts stored with a tag,node,id ? Wouldn't just storing the post ID (without node and tag, which can be found elsewhere anyway) solve this?   (Spoiler alert: I'm not a fan of parsing IDs, which are supposed to be opaque strings. I had to add it in the node server for requests that return results from several nodes at once, but I didn't like it...)  
I can`t find how to post pic on github-issue.Today my app keeps running for 10 hours,also the "native" memory increased from 8M to 139M including to the profiler. "Other" 0.68M, "Code" 12.81M, "Stack" 0.43M, "Graphics" 0M "Native" 139.59M "Java" 13.95M  I click into "Memory" and record memory allocations,find that there is a ClassName of"byte[]",shallow size is biggest,it has many instance of  "byte[]",its shallow size is 460812,it looks like near to the param "byte[] data" of the Camera method "onPreviewFrame" (460800 perhaps). It is the "allocated Java objects" you mean?
Need to think about this a bit more. I think the difference might be that we call loginSilent on each API call, allowing the underlying auth client to decide whether to get from cache or make a network call. In your example you call getSession() which I think would always be static.  The pattern we use is based on the pattern for ADAL recommended by @vibronet - call acquireTokenSilent every time and let the lib decide what to do.

@marcbaechinger it does not freeze just the video. The entire app becomes unresponsive and after a while it crashes. Next week I see if I can get my hands on the device and create a report
http://pro2.com.au/8857 I guess it's a clone of the many WMR14 you find on ebay.  Note that DSub plays sometimes one or two consecutive tracks fine and than it hangs. While it's hanging it plays up to three seconds (0:03), jumps back to 0:00 and and plays the next 1-3 seconds, jumps back and so on. Note it doesn't really play, it's just the time display.  I also noticed that at the end of a track DSub plays sometimes 1-3 seconds beyond the displayed track-time.  I tired many other Android DLNA players with that device and they all worked fine. AirPlay from an iPod touch works fine. It would be great if I could control the volume on the DLNA renderer (via AirPlay this is possible).

It has happened twice now, the third time there was an internal server error and the portal dissapeared. This is on the Nuts and Bolts modpack, on the Breakin' Blocks server. 
Currently using 27.1.1 for all support libs. 
No, I didn't realise this before but it seems like left and right margins work differently and /do/ limit at least CUF, CUB, LF. Try this for example in xterm: ~~~~ printf '\033[?69h\033[10;20s\033[1;10Ha\033[3Db\r\nc' sleep 10 ~~~~ CUP and HPA are not affected.
If I do not turn off the method of drawing icon，dataset doesn't have any data. The program reads dataset's data and will reports the array subscript's transboundary.
@smillidge The default would i.e. be the logs/server.log file configured in the logging.properties by the GFFileHandler.file property. If you change this to a different location/file it will result in the above mentioned formatting problem.
Screenshots are taken with T-UI launcher, this happens with Telegram also.

Hi,  No, it is not. The offending files arent in the github repository. They are downloaded at build time. But once download, you can build arduino, even if there are changes in the tree at the condition the changes are not for these files.  I've this problem since several weeks now.  This morning once again because Bridge-1.6.0.zip has changed its version. So I've downloaded it directly with the browser. And everything was fine.  I've set the `ignoreerrors` parameter to `true` in untar-unzip-download:  However,I don't know the value the `trustAnchors` parameter should have.  Regards Jean-Luc

My server is the latest spigot with patched. I bypassed this problem by cutting and pasting entire mine structure around and moved them far away that the coordinates don't overlap. But it is not the solution i was hoping for.  
The actual output looks like this:    I am not sure why there has to be the exception stack trace at all (for this specific case).

Just enable the run-all-correct test, according to todo tag it should correctly start jetty, but will hang because it can't stop it. Actually it just fails without starting jetty. 
It happens with directory icons. See video. When I scroll down and after scroll up, icons have changed.   [bug_in_folder_icons.mp4.zip](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/FilePickerLibrary/files/60426/bug_in_folder_icons.mp4.zip) 
Very simple example. Test it on desktop and ipad/ipad simulator. Resolution is the same, but on ipad it's filled on the screen and on desktop it has black bars on top and the bottom. Also try to tap the screen and check the logs. You will quickly see that touches work only on area, which stage should be drawn, but somehow it's stretched (ipad ofc, desktop is all right).  Here's a link: http://www69.zippyshare.com/v/82635937/file.html Using last nightly robovm and the same for libgdx. 
I've been trying outside the actual environment :) I'll update this when I succeed. It may wind up being something stupid, like calling `unregister` twice, possibly in different contexts, possibly simultaneously.
@spencergibb Yes, I am. I've provided you my dependencies.
I decided to do a bit more testing with a more minimal setup to try and see if it was a cross mod interaction.  I created a new instance which only had: CommonCapabilities-1.12.2-2.4.5 CyclopsCore-1.12.2-1.6.0 IntegratedDynamics-1.12.2-1.1.1 IntegratedTunnels-1.12.2-1.6.10  I then repeated the above setup but instead of the charged light collector I used a flowerpot with a poppy inside. This resulted in the flower pot being duplicated. So it appears to be entirely this mod causing the bug.  I was also able to use a more complex setup to duplicate lapis.  On a separate network: 1. Add an inventory reader to the chest from the above setup (chest 1), and store the variable inventory count. 2. Have another variable set to an integer with the value 90. 3. Construct a variable using the "==" operator with the above 2 variables 4. Attach a variable store to store the first 2 variables. 5. Attach an item interface to the chest (chest 1). 6. Place another chest (chest 2) with an item exporter on it. 7. Set this item exporter to export 1 item and have it use the variable from the comparison set up before. 8. Place 63 lapis in the first slot of chest 1. Then place a single item (not lapis) in every other slot. 9. Place a lapis ore block in front of the world block importer.  The world block importer then places a lapis in chest 1, which triggers the second network to export 1 lapis to chest 2, and then the cycle repeats, with more and more lapis being produced.  The same also works with redstone ore.  While I haven't tested every possibility, I believe this results from any block which drops more than 1 item when it breaks, and is easiest to do with blocks which drop 2 different items as then the first slot can be entirely empty.
No anr, no crash. I'm fully unable to unlock screen so maybe something pops up after a while however that is just thinking out loud without any proof.  I'm not able to compile kiss. I'm user/tester so i gathered no knowledge to set up android studio plus my os is freebsd so i believe there would be extra troubles.  I will try to put catlog into some use, maybe i could get some info from the device. Maybe i can also use adb in this case to retrieve some logs. 
Yes, just a plain black ink sack.   We also tested with wool once, but it was just white instead of colored

With 'develop' code, for the XHTML output the table of contents contains highlighted to entire subtree of topicrefs under the flagged topicref. Maybe somehow I expected that the actual topic content would have that color applied to it... For the PDF output neither table of contents not actual topic content reflect the flagging conditions.
You mean `ref`, not implementation, right? So the second example, yes. I just tried it again and got the following: First example (directly specified `@RequestBody`):   Also note that the second one says content type `*/*` instead of `application/json`. This changes to `application/json` after you annotate the method with `@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON`

Decouple means that validity for a platform shouldn't be checked on data entry but only before upload, right? If so, either  - the upload button should be greyed out and the message in red below or - the message should appear in a popup when pressing "upload"
It works fine in most of the standard scenarios, but in my case, I am adding a countdown to the switch and updating the text (which is the remaining time) with a `CountdownTimer`. The switch is part of an item in a `RecyclerView`, and `requestLayout()` doesn't make it redraw the view. I could obviously call `notifyOnDataSetChanged()` / `notifyItemChanged(int i)`, but I don't want to do that in this case because it would crash the app if the user was to toggle the switch at the time the view is redrawn, or cause artifacts.  Basically, I want to refresh the text of the `SwitchButton` in a `RecyclerView` without requesting the View to redraw the item entirely, I would like the switch to update itself and it doesn't work because `invalidate()` is not called. I would add that it works fine with a standard `TextView`, because TextView's `setText()` calls `invalidate()` after updating the text. I made a workaround by calling `invalidate()` after `setText()`, but I think it belongs in the `setText()` method.  Concerning the second issue (text not centered if different from the initial one) here's a screenshot of what it looks like: I set the initial text o an empty string, and then  updated the text to "0:00 left". You can see that it is not centered anymore, because the text keep the same initial positionas when it was an empty string.  ![switchbutton text cutoff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7110330/17709479/13ce746a-639e-11e6-8e22-4d6e8e7cafd8.png)

Ah, of course, you are right, I didn't think about inheritance/recursion. There are several dist folders deep inside node_modules (didn't know about the ctrl-click btw, nice!).  So I guess it's not really a bug, only confusing - though I don't know how that could be alleviated. Any word on the strangely named severity level? 
@gaobinlong I think it's fine to treat them the same. I wish we had an easy way to distinguish when it's automatically set versus when it's not, be we don't really so let's proceed to treat them as the same.
@gashcrumb  before: SELECT * FROM CONTACT / INSERT INTO TODO(task, completed)  VALUES (:#TASK, 0) after: SELECT * FROM TODO / INSERT INTO CONTACT (first_name) VALUES (:#TASK)  (I cannot reproduce it on current syndesis master, there is probably some other(#2064), so that I cannot complete integration.) 
Yeah I'll make a video soon
So... question 0) Perhaps this is the simplest solution - as this is all I've done to get it to work and it now works like a champ. question 1) aapt is the only tool that can't be found upon update. I do like the idea of defensively checking that the required tools are available before launch. The error message only told me that aapt was missing. I wouldnt have known to look at my path without realizing that Android has moved the locations of it's tools in the past and this cluing me in. question 2) I had both of these in there. My path now looks like `$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/17.0.0` 
It keep happen for users that use Android 7 and above. Here is my guess.   UpdateManager call the CheckUpdateTask -> CheckUpdateTask is bound the app activity to HockeyWeb server -> Asynctask in hockeySdk got execute -> but when the input stream got close the activity or the firebase instance in the acitivity is not alive anymore -> crash happen.
Yes, here it is: 
i tried but my pc cant handle it. The fps are lagging more than the skeleton doing weird stuff ^^
the status is that they will not be moved until we have decided how to build them:  1. Manifest-first (Tycho/PDE) 2. POM-first (maven-bundle-plugin)  how to include them in the user workspace zip archive (if this still makes sense). As all the examples are still in eclipse/kura I'd prefer if they all built the same.
I would not know where to look as I have over 290 mods in my pack @LumberWizard 
I assumed /p debug only debugged permission actions for the player who issued it.  Didn't realize it sent ALL permission debug messages to the player. 
I have just build the QKSMS 3 and i noticed that the design changed and the search works differently (no need to go back to the parent anymore). However, i have also noticed that the keyboard newer closes if i switch from chat list view to new chat view and vise versa. The keyboard is always there. Is that expected behavior? It looks like you want the keyboard to be always visible in the chat list view and the search onfocus, but when i decide to close the keyboard than switch the views the keyboard is there again. Not sure if that's a bug or something you have consciously decided to implement.

The grid is a RecyclerView with a GridLayoutManager. I don't exactly remove the view, I merely hide it by animating the alpha of the RelativeLayout (that has the BlurView inside) to 0 and then setting the layout's visibility to gone.

No, please not! Keywords should describe the content of the document and not some state in JabRef. They are understood (although often not printed) by biblatex, so I would even vote against making keyword synchronization the default option. Special fields can be easily filtered out by biblatex, but modifying the keyword field to not contain "prio3" etc. is very difficult. What was the reason to introduce the sync with the keyword field? 
@jasontedor I know that the number is insanely great, and I doubt it can be reached in regular operation. Still, the exception clearly indicates a negative value, and assuming that `scrollTimeInMillis` is always positive, I can give no better explanation than a numeric overflow.  This is the stacked Grafana graph of `scrollTimeInMillis` of our 12 node setup. The overflow happens at 292 years (approx at 9222842861407 ms).  ![Grafana Metrics ES5 scrollTimeInMillis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1222566/24157363/77e62342-0e59-11e7-8d90-caf54b915e2c.png)  The metrics are polled from the first node which is still able to return the negative value. But the inter-cluster communication to sync the local stats between the nodes is obviously broken by the exception thrown in `SearchStats$Stats.writeTo`.

By adding a dep to JCommander things are able to work.  I didn't have Jcommander defined in my pom previously and wasn't able to see it with a mvn dependency:tree  Maybe just wasn't getting called before? Should it really be optional? 
Sorry for the belated reply. We are having problems with updating at this point. Will do our best to fix them ASAP and get back to you, or try to create a quickstart of some kind to test (and demonstrate if the problem still exists) with the latest version.

@Invictum  Oh it seems I forgot to mention in my original bug report - I have reproduced this issue using latest serenity dependencies  for serenity-core, serenity-maven plugin, etc.(1.8 .20)  + latest serenity-cucumber (1.6.10)
@mokun I can answer some of the questions, some I'll need inputs from you to seek and do -  As far as OpenJFX8 and OpenJDK 8 are concerned, I have both . In fact I'm in the midst of upgrading both -   It took an inordinate long time for the menu to appear. Clicking on New Sim seems to not go anywhere.   Is there a way to limit memory or something ? 
This behaviour is a bit strange, I don't understand the logic behind it. can you please elaborate? 
@TylerJewell, the root folder that you mean, it is call "share folder" from VBox?   i think all folder can be mounted on hyper-V (after 8 hours of google-ing around), i found out that when i  set CHE_CONF_FOLDER=/c/Users/thomas/cong, the file che.properties are not copy/created inside the folder that i want to set as custom folder.  And it is different from CHE_DATA_FOLDER, data folder look like it copy the json file into the folder that i want to be set, but it is not the case for CHE_CONF_FOLDER.   very confusing but i have fun of it...hahaha  
It comes up even if there's no `.git` directory, even after a brand new installation. It also up when I choose `Open Project` and `New Project`. It's the same behavior as if I run `/usr/bin/git` from the terminal. But what I mean to say is, if I have no interest in version control and never chose to do anything with `git`, I still keep getting prompted to install it and Xcode because the Git executable is (correctly) set to `/usr/bin/git`. So I effectively have to tell RStudio and MacOS that I'm not interested in version control by telling it that the `git` executable is something incorrect.

I'm gonna make a new issue with the new problems
You're right, even the new link is wrong, and now when looked at it again I see the problem: the leading `http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/` part is static and the rest is completely predictable but depends on the username.  For example, suppose your name is - `higglytownhero` => `http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/h/i/higglytownhero.gif?6` - `rautamiekka` => `http://a.deviantart.net/avatars/r/a/rautamiekka.gif?5`  It takes your first letter for the first folder, then the second letter for the second folder, and your whole username with the `.gif` extension for the filename. In the case of `higglytownhero` his name is capitalized as `HigglyTownHero`, so the **usernames in links are always lower-case but the case matters in only filenames**.  Notice that the trailing integer parts are different from the links in the OP, and quickly checking around (opening up many avatars in succession) it appears the integer is an avatar type indicator since the integer is same across users with similar avatars.
OK ... thanks for help. After command: `java -jar MEP_1.35.jar`  was automatically created a directory MEP at ~/Documents/MATLAB with the following content:    according your suggestions on wiki. But after all that, when I start MATLAB I always get open editor, see attached screenshot.  ![screenshot_2018-12-03_11-02-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2698803/49366975-036ca780-f6eb-11e8-8be2-79d2547562a6.png)   Is that normal behavior? Is possible to suppress opening editor window with  `MEP: Sorry!`  text ???  Will be possible to create automatically the javaclasspath.txt file in a case when it does not exist at default MATLAB directory /home/kva/Documents/MATLAB and add some generic content to startup.m file at the same directory (+ in a case of no startup.m file)?  It would be really very useful, if the installer solve all installation steps fully interactively and automatically. 
It was not working without KryoSerializer as well and was throwing similar exception as with spark.serializer as kryo.  I have getters and setters in my actual code for all the fields but i haven't pasted that here .  Is this because of array of objects within an object ? Is that supported with default serializer ? 
**Update - didn't see filiphr's explanation. yes the source and destination names are identical. ** I will give it a try. Thank you both. 
I believe it is being picked up because if I remove the configFileName property and leave the default one of **/src/main/enunciate/enunciate.xml**, but without having the actual file on the path, it complains it doesn't exist, like it should. As soon as I move it inside the folder, the warning disappears. The config still doesn't work, even while using this default file location. Any ideas what could be wrong? 
Yeah hang on, I'll reproduce it.

Thank you for your reply! My app is for Japanese so the crash is occurred by picking a Japanese named file.

I have verified what seems to cause this problem.  If you go to strip feeder and select the starting hole and second hole with camera on a previously configured strip feeder (where Z is no zero) you will notice the X and Y change but the Z remains.  Now if you do not hit apply but instead try to run machine it will have set the Z to zero internally and run with Z of zero.  If you go back to screen and hit apply it will then  apply the Z value and run correctly.

Hello,  Sorry i didn't write a more comprehensive report i was in a hurry. After I upgraded nextcloud the android app started complaining about E2E not being installed on the server. So i installed E2E and it fixed the problem on my phone, but then the webUI stopped working with the "permission denied" error in the files app, i couldn't find a fix for this other than removing the E2E  plugin. After i removed it webUI was fixed but the android app was still not working. I uninstalled the android app on my phone, cleared all the data and installed the app again.  I logged in via the QR code, it didn't ask for E2E plugin and it seems i can access my files. But now it's crashing constantly.  Thank you! Kind regards,
Done!
I am using Firefox but I also couldn't reproduce it now. 
FWIW, I like the proposal outlined in #10249, it makes a lot of sense to me.  But, failing that, I'd 'expect' the meta fields to be the ones prefixed with underscores (and always, not just when conflicting), and 'my' column names to remain untouched.  But then there's nothing to stop me from indexing something with a field name of `_ip` (as far as I know?) and then all that's been achieved is making the conflict less likely? And prefixing the meta fields with underscores would be a breaking change? 
My apologies @Yserz, not sure how I missed your message.. Would've checked this quite a while back if I'd realised you had a fix. :)  @bennyn, I don't have this issue any more with `0.0.9-beta`, only tested with `.java` files, but since this isn't something that's file specific I doubt that will make much difference. 
Yes, sure. Do a `mvn clean install` and then `mvn clean spring-boot:run`. Then:  1. Go to `http://localhost:48080/admin/storages/storage-common-proxies/group-common-proxies/update` 2. Reorder the repositories in the `Group repositories` tab 3. Save (and remember the ordering you did) 4. `cat strongbox-web-core/strongbox/etc/conf/strongbox.xml | grep -i -A 8 'id="group-common-proxies"'` - result will be the old order.   I just noticed that if you create a new group repository - it preserves the correct order. However, if you're updating an existing one - it would not update the order of the repos in the xml. 
I use Java 6, though we plan to upgrade soon. Thanks for the fix. 
Hi, thanks for trying to solve that. I am not sure to understand what I can do for helping  ...  1) create a new empty category  (OK, understood) 2) I add only items that are already in my other categories (Notepads)  ? 3) I do that for plenty items and check if some can be erased or not ?

I am using 2.9.0, the only other change I had to make was to up the version of Jackson core to 2.8.7.. I can post a full list if required..
Hi @luigidellaquila  I'm doing the insert from PHPOrient, Studio and Console. All have same issue. Unfortunately I don't have a database to replicate the problem since the problem is associated to the `lh_item` specific Class and if I make a new database with same structure It works.
Thanks for reply :)  In my application too many sprites and (if I run it on my old "shitphone") phone memory is quickly filled with instances of objects. ![bullrampdump](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4895253/22746865/54352aee-ee36-11e6-847b-dd4adc0be959.jpg)  Happen very often calls the garbage collector. 
I tend to prefer `xcollection()` over `collection()` whenever I know that the relevant documents can't be in subcollections, so I do not have to bother about whether subcollections are actually present or not. Defensive programming against changes in the database layout :)  It is not relevant for the bug, though: The error is triggered with `collection()` as well as with `xcollection()`. 
Technically this is not in production since the generated tests are not running in CI, but it fails when I run them manually on api-client-staging repository.  Regarding `write`: that's fair enough. In that case maybe we want to switch the design back to the original one -- I remember that originally `mockStream.write()` was placed at the end of the each test case but I recommended to move into the common `mockServerStreamingGrpcMethod` in a PR.
I am using v1.11.2 of Minecraft and v7.99.6 of BC. Also, in the GIF, when I found the bug before, it would go back up to the top of the water and slowly make its way back down again. Although, that may have been another issue.  (The GIF does not represent my MC framerate) ![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30223844/28271909-f1d40cf2-6ad7-11e7-8407-f0e79ecfabd0.gif)

Hey @keshcreations, it does not occur in the preview app.   We see that the rendering of the buttons is sometimes working fine and other times it isn't.
@pongad Our application is trying to dump millions of data objects to other system as part of migration. We use pubsub to publish all such data objects . If the application crashes the only thing we can do is to restart the dump , because the data migrated is very important and not even a single record of this data can be missed , considering the amount of data (over 50m ) it becomes impossible to read delta from database (as it becomes really slow with where clauses) , thus only option is to restart full dump . !   But good news is meanwhile i tried some new approach to put some brakes to messages being posted to pub sub  and give it some breathing space. Basically we maintain a count which is difference of messages posted and messages delivered ( success or failure). Whenever that count is greater than 800 we sleep all incoming threads(for 12 seconds as RPC total timeout is 10 seconds) to allow pub sub to clear its outstanding messages. As of now i have processed around 30M records and it performed well with 0 failures vs earlier (10% of messages failed).  Can something similar be added to pub sub Out of the box which recognizes when pub sub is overloaded and gives it some breathing space until outstanding messages clear  ?
Good point, although could there be a feature to unbind a key from a car, while keeping the owner of the car saved? (So that you could rebind it, and so that when you unbind it, nobody can run up to the car and claim it as their own)
It still happens. Opening a link in a browser, closing it via return oder going back, you'll sometimes will bei pushed back to the start of the posts

Actually my video card is a AMD Radeon® HD 6370 ,512MB DDR3 VRAM ;)  As for dumps, in the game folder after the problem there are files like this http://pastebin.com/6yu4v70f  What happens is that during the creation of the world, the loading bars stop loading, the whole computer freezes and after about 20 seconds the Terasology window closes and it shows up a message (i think) from the JVM that says it cannot send a report (to its developers?) because there's not enough memory to do it.  If there's some kind of test i can do, or if it's possible to debug the program, i'm glad to help 
Michael,  Yes, I meant the query frame. I am using Chrome. I shared the zipped version of my 2.3.1 database in the issue specifically related to performance tuning. No, I don't see any error messages in messages.log. Sorry, I have trouble locating console.log.  Also, as I indicated in the other ticket, my 2.3.1 installation is really misbehaving now when I have 2.2.7 and 2.3.1 versions installed. And I dont even attempt to run them at the same time, I always make sure one is shut down.  That may be a separate issue.  Thanks. Gene. 
This is the third party statistics, I'm trying to reproduce
Is this no longer slated to also be fixed on 1.12 then? I admittedly should have replied earlier, but since I am working with 1.12 currently, that's a little unfortunate.
Hi @swankjesse , I can get a test case ready sometimes . But I can give you quick response payload with bunch of Set-Cookie from which I would like to construct a request payload with the same set of cookies from the earlier given response. Sample of payload with cookies from which I would like to construct a OKHttp request object as mentioned below.  ### Response Payload  ---    At the moment when I use JavaNetCookieJar to construct the OkHttp object it's only adding ASP.NET_SessionId and ignoring other cookies to add to it.  In Summary, I would like to construct the cookie for the request like  `Cookie: <name>=<value> [;<name>=<value>]...`  Where the each pair on the request being returned from the response with the multiple "Set-Cookie"  I hope it's quite clear.

Well, seeing that only your CT support broke (out of the 15 mods in my pack that have CT support) and knowing that Soot had to change its CT support, something ID uses in its CT integration has surely changed.
I am not sure what the problem is, I just tried out JavaMail to see if everything would work properly but the same thing happens a class is having issues being found. This is weird, I am using Java 10 that might be the issue?
As far as I know, iron and gold are the only two that have rendering issues. What's funny is the diamond and emerald connected textures utilize the same method and work completely fine. So do the stained clay textures.  Forge Multipart microblocks did have errors with the wood textures, but I don't know what exactly caused that, and I can't remember if that was solved before or after I removed BuildCraft from the testing environment.
yeah added.  
No it started occurring with the version you released yesterday titled "Plenty of bug fixes." Last night I updated to your latest version and it is still occurring. 
Suggestion: How about defining a system property that the developer can control, without having to rely on a GAE property which may change in future? e.g. if the 'wicket-webjars' property is set then check value to toggle between URLStreamHandler and ClassLoader.getResourceStream alternatively default to current version? 
I guess we need to add something like this, somewhere.    PS. I have no idea what the correct exceptions should be there...  I'm trying to track down where the download is done, and have reached an enigma. There are two places where I think this can happen, either in: 1. [Helpers.java](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/3a5039efb6f4c7e13627e422d972657179d0de2e/app/src/main/java/com/SecUpwN/AIMSICD/utils/Helpers.java#L117-136) or 2.  in [RequestTask.java](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/b06b791d049e74ac7163b18dce14028886ea3c63/app/src/main/java/com/SecUpwN/AIMSICD/utils/RequestTask.java#L63-174).   But in (2), and at first sight, it seem that it is used for uploading data to OCID, but then it is immediately followed by a download from their servers.... ??? If that is what is actually happening, then that is another bug, as we should not attempt to download data we just uploaded. Also, OCID take at least  a few minutes before adding new data to their servers, and by even attempting to do this, we're corrupting our own data with potential fake BTS data. Any upload should be done by careful user control, if at all...   I would appreciate some enlightenment and a few code comments. 
I meant that I was only looking at the code for `Try`; I assumed wrongly that if the methods there contained `Class<X>...` parameters then that would cause issues - I didn't actually check. However, all those methods have a `@SafeVarargs` in place already in the 2.1.1 I'm using. So, again, the problem seems contained to `FluentFunctions`.
Have not tested that in a while. Will try it out. Found out chromecasting the same content to a Nexus Player does not work either. These are both x86 devices. Maybe same cause? Will work on debugging the nexus player as well.  
Downloaded and manually installed 3.7.4 from github.  Unfortunately, no change with 3.7.4.
Testing from this morning revealed these also dupe:  Venus Copper Ore Venus Tin Ore Jupiter Tin Ore Jupiter Iron Ore Jupiter Nickel Ore Saturn Iron Ore Saturn Tin Ore Saturn Copper Ore  Jupiter Red Gem Ore does NOT dupe.  Jupiter Palladium Ore does NOT dupe.  Saturn Magnesium Ore does NOT dupe.   I will have time later today for more testing if that is helpful to you.  
No - this issue was opened after that commit. 
M7 has new config for docker launcher right ? I couldn't find the new config. i tried M7 and codenvy/che-server failed. can you help me finding the right setting for M7 codenvy/che-server 
Here is a pastbin file of the config - http://pastebin.com/HkD3EZUQ  If is definitely not working properly. Whenever I attempt to fix it by removing the duplicate spaces and text it reverts to this upon restart. Then on the next restart another copy of the top is added. So every time the server restarts it duplicates everything in the config file.  
I think it is a bug...  Think about the following request flow:  You make a request for adding an user and expects that it forwards to users listing adding an user uses the POST method, and listing users uses the GET method...  It doesn't work! You have to accept POST method in listing in order to fix it.  In redirections it works... but I think that redirections work only to GET methods..

@mswertz In the future using exception logger! But right now, no real measure. I encounter it occasionally myself in docker and I sometimes hear data managers complaining about missing bootstrap 4 styles in the VMs.
Hmmm... yes, if I change my code to use the parameters then everything works fine... So why not to do it because... because the JSF supports it :-) ...also b:button supports it so I'd assume that adding this functionality into the command button won't be a big challenge. 
.log  
Thats my first impression, yes (looking at the decompiled sdk makes that seem very unlikely, admittedly).    We have a wide range of devices this is affecting according to fabric they are all running 4.4.4 and below (that may be incorrect, though):  * Note 2 * Galaxy S5 * Tab Pro 10.1 * S4 * Droid Ultra   The stacktrace may not be as helpful as we use an internal array that takes the first two cameras retrieved from `cameraManager.getCameraIdList()`.  This is returning an empty list, causing the Index Out of Bounds Exception.     
Where can i find the version? 
Yeah, I'm looking to extract the map data from the [Rust game](http://playrust.com/) I could send you the asset files, but uploading is obviously not possible. 
that just bubbles up the exception, I want the player to ignore this error and continue playing the ad until it finishes and then play the underlying content, right now it just calls this error and finishes the ad and plays the content, if I switch out the content stream for another one it finishes correctly. I am kind of looking for a way to ignore this 8 second time out
The full query would be something like select top 10   'smth' + dp_id + 'smthelse' as thumbnail,           'this' + access_url+ 'that' as download from ivoa.ObsCore  where dp_id is a varchar (a custom column not part of the obscore standard),  and access_url is a CLOB.

Jade is a typo, supposed to be "Jadx". I learned about this bug due to the following situation: I had classes in the same package, one is called Z and one is called z (only difference is lower-upper case). when running Jadx decompiler (not Jadx gui) on the apk file on a case insensitive file system, I found out that only the file z.java exists, and it holds the content that the file Z.java should have held. I tried to do the same thing using a case sensitive file system, and found out that neither of the files exist in the package, instead appeared files calle C001.java and C002.java, when i opened the files there was a comment at the beggining: `/* renamed from (package name).z, reason: case insensitive file system */`  the only way i could make Jadx decompile the apk successfully is to run it on a case insensitive system, but have the output folder be mounted on a case sensitive volume
I can't. Because it was an immediate situation. So, I changed the iap package. Now there are no crashes in +3k users. But, thank you. I will try it in my next project.

LGTM. I see the missing handling of `detach(close=false)` is part of a different ticket now (#467).
On that day, I got it to happen twice, but I haven't been able to reproduce it since.  If it's okay, please keep this open a bit longer and I'll provide more details if I can get it to happen again.  One thing -- I've ran into weird race conditions with the Sopho's AV and apt in the past.  I imagine it's possible Sopho's could be the cause of this issue too.

Thank you for the reply.  1. Yes, I am seeing the issue only on Galaxy Tab S2. I tried it also on Galaxy S5 (Android version 6.0.1) and Nexus 9 (Android version 7.0) and just noticed that selection of higher video tracks are disabled (2560x1440 and 3840x2160) on these devices. On Galaxy Tab S2 these video tracks are available and I see same issue when selecting one of them manually.  2. I must have tried reproducing the issue with unprotected short video before because I just managed to reproduce the issue with shorter Widevine protected video: {         "name": "DASH GPMFv6 H264 Encrypted",         "uri": "http://media.axprod.net/DASH/GPMFv6/H264/Encrypted/Manifest.mpd",         "extension": "mpd",         "drm_scheme": "widevine",         "drm_license_url": "https://drm-widevine-licensing.axtest.net/AcquireLicense",         "drm_key_request_properties": {           "X-AxDRM-Message": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJjb21fa2V5X2lkIjoiNjllNTQwODgtZTllMC00NTMwLThjMWEtMWViNmRjZDBkMTRlIiwibWVzc2FnZSI6eyJ0eXBlIjoiZW50aXRsZW1lbnRfbWVzc2FnZSIsImtleXMiOlt7ImlkIjoiN2YzYzE0NTUtOWE0ZS00ODc4LTgyZDEtYWQ3YjYyYTYxMDZjIn1dfX0.Qgt0I2HzmntyFQ9tk3p2u2s1PruyGb12RsB3g6EBBLQ"         } }  I did not find any default demo app videos to match requirements (protected video that would have several video tracks, one of which would need to be higher than device resolution). Therefore I could not reproduce the issue with default demo videos.

The big ints are random 128-bit wide. I'm now trying to commit and compact every 10 million, but the compact and commit are scaling linearly, is this expected? 
@malikm I don't think this is necessary for now. Just make sure that during the build of `distrib` Windows specific bundles are not copied to Linux based distribs. 
I've bookmarked two videos that I know it happened on for sure, so I can keep testing.  It JUST happened to me again on one of them. This time, it was after unlocking the phone and pressing play. Audio went out of sync. But then I tried it again and it didn't happen. So I can't reproduce it reliably yet.
Yes, I would. :)
originally I observed the problem on a more complex circuit. I have reduced this circuit to its simplest expression to test this problem. There remain only three inputs connected to three outputs with the test vectors file as shown in the figure. I added "Not" gates so that the outputs are in error with respect to the vector file. I could also edit the vector file without modifying the schema. This problem arises as well for 1/0 errors as for E or X
The numbers I mentioned above comes from Taiwan Diabetes Association at [1], their whole site is in Chinese. However I can find different suggestions from many local hospital/associations/doctors over the Internet, some just take ADA's suggestion while some takes from epidemiology researches.   So maybe we could check if this standard range would be different for people from place to place, if not, we can simply use ADA+AACE+NICE+Custom, and ask users to consult their physician for their optimal ranges. Would this way better?  [1] http://homepage.vghtpe.gov.tw/~meta/hospital/teach1.htm 
Hello, I've tried that and it makes no difference. After about 40 seconds of the video playing, it started freezing every 2-3 seconds again.  
>  >  > Do you export it directly to Google drive from andOTP? If yes that could be the problem, try saving it locally on you phone first and then uploading it.  Yes, I did it directly. If done locally first, the file can be restored. But my problem is that I've got a backup saved directly and cannot restore it now. So I guess I've lost it, or is there a possibility to recover from this? 
it was a dummy implementation that returned null (misconfigured server), either way doesn't hurt to check for null although it's not critical. 
This option is disabled, it's not just redstone related stuff, spawners stop working too, basically the chunk does not reload a few times and then buga, and only comes back when it reboots ... :(
You are right, the Combined Hover is also present on Oxygen, and I don't know what changed, but now it doesn't work either in my Oxygen installation.  Do I need to configure something in order to have the documentation provided by a DSLD shown in the tooltip ? I have to explicitly activate the "Groovy Information Hover" with a key modifier and press this key to view this doc.

Thanks for your interest @garagatyi A good documentation for motivation of nvidia-docker can be found here. [nvidia-docker github](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker ) It does not use any special image. It uses same image as native docker but it helps us to deploy GPU based application on specialized hardware i.e. NVIDIA-GPUs. So basically nnvidia-docker helps in containerisation of GPU application while native docker only capable of containerisation of CPU based application.  In the eclipse che, I am trying to create a runtime stack in order to run the CUDA C/C++ programs. hopefully, this feature can be added to eclipse che for the other users in the later versions.    And currently I am using [kayush206/cuda-devel](https://hub.docker.com/r/kayush206/cuda-devel/) image to create the custom cuda stack. 
I'm going to reference the discusion that we had related to config-server, although this issue seems more accurate: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/186#issuecomment-121228661 
I'm running GHC 7.10.2 and ghc-mod/ghc-modi at 5.4.0.0 (BTW, I'm watching the thread about 182 keenly. Great news about the upcoming update).  Thanks! 
A modal would be better than the current behavior, but I think it'd be much better to be able to edit the form while viewing the definition. That's why a frame feels better to me. 
For consistency with the other stacks which are also opening in "/projects".
I'll checked example that i'm sent to you before and there are this line looks like: `public delegate bool Function<T>(T value);` T - there are any class, struct or anything else. 
@GhostFlying i am use full version, but now i will try tiny version! 
> Hi @chufgard, > sorry for the late response, now I am going to investigate your issue now. Could you provide more details? For example, your WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter config, your properties(except sensitive data). And if you can provide a sample project, that will be better.  Sample project will be difficult - at least since the whole stuff works like a charm if I deploy it on my local machine. Only running in azure it breaks.  We are assuming that the problem might be caused by a federated AD scenario plus a conditional access policy (access only from company IPs) bound to the ad where we are federated into.
Oh... Interesting, I did not know that was a new feature now!  Ok, well that does change things a **little**, but I'll explain the most basic method of how we would create an item with a recipe in the _old_ RPGItems 3.4 (aka 3.0.4)...  /rpgitem furball create /rpgitem furball display &6A &eGross &7Furball /rpgitem furball lore The result of NyaaCat's excessive preening! /rpgitem furball item firework_charge /rpgitem furball damage 10 15 /rpgitem furball recipe _<place recipe items in a pattern, close menu>_ DONE  What is of note is that the command we used was **/rpgitem <itemname> recipe**. When I attempted to use that command on v3.5.100, it kept coming up with the Help text, and that is when I noticed it would display the "CHANCE" option. So I figured I'll just use 1 (since that generally is 100% in RPGItems), and the Recipe Menu showed up.  _However_, the key here is that we never used the Chance option before, and so it seems that 3.5.xx is imposing its own Chance of 0% if an item lacks a Chance % previously.  **ALSO**, I don't know if this is related or not, but I just received word from one of my Admins that the Quests plugin had delivered the reward (which we have set as executing the RPGItem Give command) as a vanilla item. This item is only obtainable by completing this quest, and so it has NO recipe. 
Here is a demo project using TextMeshPro. I think it will be already in the project, but if not, in Unity, you should go to Window -> Package Manager -> Select "All" tab, search for TextMesh Pro and install it (in the right panel).  [TextMeshProConsuloBug.zip](https://github.com/consulo/consulo-unity3d/files/2374231/TextMeshProConsuloBug.zip)  For the AVPro plugin, I can't upload a demo project because it is a paid plugin. I'll look a way to send you the demo for this.
hi , the entire database is not possible. i will see if i can find additional infos for helping you 
Sorry, my fix is only a quick patch to make it work on Windows, I don't have a Linux environment at the moment.  I will get back to you shortly.
I used the version 2.0.1
It has to be "debug from & to". When The component gets "fresh" data, not from "debug from & to", it works normally.
I observed in 3.1.15
OK, I've set that up. But the problem normally takes hours to develop. That means it will take a few days to be confident that it will not develop again with the new settings. 
Thanks for looking into this.  It was failing very reliably for me and I've rarely seen Object.wait(...) go twice as long before, but it certainly can be unreliable.  You'd think in this day and age we would have computers and software that could count reliably. =)  Thanks again for looking into it.
@javanna you are right - this is a Perl issue.  It silently converts `23.0` in the JSON into an integer (which is why it logged the integer in the trace logs).  Apologies for the noise - I'll probably have to work around this with a range check. 
Ok nice ty ! I will try this tomorow morning ! Did you update the docker container in consequence too ?
It's there now. Google drive had an error syncing.

I had done the DEBUG thingy before... but there doesn't seem to be anything that helps.     Does that help? :)
@mbhave I added a sample application here: https://github.com/dkroehan/webfluxtest 
If I use AtomicInteger then I have to make reading, comparing, incrementing, and setting to zero as one atomic operation. It will end up in something like that  Doesn't look good. So I decided to make method synchronized.
That was what I expected, so when I changed the Kapua settings it was the child account's settings and the sysadmin settings cannot be changed, right?
Well. I'm not completely sure `pyramid` is actually necessary at all, but since we are offering it as a way to build 3D shapes, I would expect they are all treated the same way with respect to their various possibilities. And being textured in the display is one of them. So, yes. Either we remove `pyramid` altogether, or we implement its `textured` display... 
i'm on 1.4.7 :P 
66 for sure.  Both because it matches the IO menu and because *everything* isn't another level down.  It does make the 74xx->Basic collection strange in the Component Tree because it breaks them into 3 levels.  Maybe build separate organizational constructs for each to take advantage of their differences.  Even when the menu is too tall I can still get to the items via the tree in 0.18release.  Is there a way to remove the icons from the menu items?  Maybe only show the last 3 or 5 selected parts in a menu so it has less of a growth factor.  Then there could be more items before a sub-menu is needed.
I have global updated to 15. As I've added another template, it seems there are only 10 instances allowed for that template. I didn't have any instance of original template running at that time.  Globals work fine if there is just one template. Is that clear enough or do you want me to attach screenshot or such? 
With Nextcloud dev version 20170515 the issue still remain. I have tried the various scenario: 5 minute recording leads to about 1GB video file.  Nextcloud storage on internal SD with both video recorder internal or on the external SD card. Nextcloud storage on external SD with both video recorder internal or on the external SD card.  Both solutions (4 different configuration) fail. Transfer seems to start about 2 minutes after the movie has started recording. Out of the few video trials, the files uploaded would range between 8MB up to 148MB. I am not able to send Log file has the app is crashing trying to do so.
I doubt because I have several frames in my sitemap and only two of them which are similar are failing to load. I can tell you that this frame is attached to a group item and this group has 30 items including a Player item. I have another frame with more items that can be displayed. And I have another frame with a Player but less items that can be displayed too. 
yes the request is sent immediately on keyup.  i will try with the delay attribute and let you know
Yes, it does. But I can no longer resize the client. 
Tried to replicate on Single player, but it doesn't happen there. Seems to be an issue only on the server.
I believe so. Why? 
@zackm0571 I've managed to reproduce this by modifying the Quickstart example with some code from the ScreenCapturer example. I've got it on a branch of this repo. I don't have permissions to push to the remote so I've just zipped up the modified VideoActivity.java file.   [VideoActivity.java.zip](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-android/files/2388718/VideoActivity.java.zip)  To reproduce with this code: After accepting the screen share permission, two devices can connect to the same room in the same way as the standard quickstart and their screens will be shown to each other. One device can then turn off sending their screen by tapping the Video floating action button so one device is just viewing the other screen. The bug is illustrated if both devices then rotate to landscape and you can see that the transmitted screen contents are only a small slice within the video.  Let me know if it's not clear! Cheers 
@lulf yes youre right service catalog works, it was problem with my deployment. So Im going to close this issue, all bugs are fixed in branch.
I think this might only be an issue when creating the very first script window.  Once I had a bunch of script windows open I was able to select the database normally.  I forgot about this open issue until I saw jeisoncp's reply.  In testing it I did a few things that brought the issue back. - From a new instance of DBeaver with multiple scripts and table editors open (restored from previously closed sessions) the selection of database and server works.   - I right-click on a script tab then select "close all" - Double-click a database connection - Press "new script" - It seems to open an arbitrary database on that connection - Mouse clicks don't register around the selection object (can't drag it anywhere, open the dropdowns, etc.)  Here's an obfuscated screenshot ![dbeaver](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8485770/15029593/3f4e9c60-121c-11e6-8a89-38450d1bcc63.jpg)  I'll do some more testing on this.  Is there anything else you would like to see/know?  I realize the screenshot looks completely normal but I have limited time at the moment and can't produce a full series of screenshots. 
Ok you can make the bug work right away. No filtering needed. Just get the second page and click on the item's icon. The recipe shown is the one from the item in the same place on the first page.
Just put together the latest spigot and skript stable release for 1.14.4 still nothing with either code blocks and to be clear I'm am expecting this name to change  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39572468/70873294-08726100-1fa5-11ea-87be-1beb29684118.png) 
I have tested this on master and it's still not working. If I control an artifact and answer “yes”, Yawgmoth Demon becomes tapped and deals damage. If I answer “no”, I have to choose an artifact to sacrifice. 
Yes restarting and restarting with invalidating cache doesn't fix the issue 
Generate the above barcode, using: https://barcode.tec-it.com/en/EAN13 Go into edit mode, on the first page, expand all the section, and look for the magnifier glass icon and click on it.
You are absolutely right, with 0.8.1 it works! Thanks for the lightning fast response btw.
Sorry but the only information that we have is that JSON, the server receive it from a reporting tool, we don`t  know what action the user has done, or in what step the error occur.

@mikepenz Thanks a lot for your quickly reply. I tried     it works. Thanks for your help. BTW, It's my first time to use Android Studio. The reason is your library is using it. 
sry youre right! i created it with multiworld, `/mw create end end default` i use the latest dev builds crash log:   
Because this behavior looks very ugly and leads to mistakes and misunderstanding especially in case with multiple projects. Any suggestions?

I guess the complexity is due to the fact while Ticks are removed from the TimeSeries, the CachedIndicator's value list is not touched and we rely on the beginIndex, endIndex, and removedTickCount to square up the two.   On CachedIndicator.java Line: 87, `result = calculate(removedTicksCount); ` looks like it causes the stack overflow. Should it be `result = calculate(0);`?  Just let me know if this is the direction you want to go and I'll create a pull request. I already have the fix in my local "fork" and it works without issue.
@yegor256 can't we use `PMO` for that? We can update it's balance on each Zerocracy fee for closing task and then send bonuses. Also we're using `FkProject` to pay debts:  it looks not correct, maybe it would be better to send transaction from one project to `PMO` on new debt and then pay debts from `PMO`?
it was set to default, Square wave, and even on sine it was skewing the waveforms! And would you be willing to rename the Rednet Historian to RedNet Oscilloscope?

Not the notified HTTP header, but the header within Flume events. Remember: a notified NGSI event is transformed into an internal Flume event that is composed of a body and a set of headers; most of the headers are copied from the HTTP notification, but many others are proprietary by Cygnus, and, even, others are altered from the origianl one (as is the case of fiware-servicePath).

Yeah, I instantly deleted my derpy msg, I just woke up, head wasn't turned on.  I moved the test up to 1.5.1 with the latest build 23. unless the fix was only applied to the 1.4.7 release?  but in 1.5.1, there is no change with allowEdits or perms.  Still have to allow FE.P.overrideProtection, but it only works when applied to a specific user, not the group they are in.  and the same thing occurs with placing blocks as in my video.  I wonder if there's something about the Priorities I'm missing. because I haven't touched them, are they required to make this work?  I'll test 1.4.7 now, back soon! 
It's still the same in 1.2 alpha, but I doubt it's primitive mobs fault cause when I tried the imprisonment tool from Industrial forgoing, it was working just fine.
Switching to row mode did not seem to address the issue. I will work on getting a repro setup.

This morning on the first attempt the app crashed, on the second one the position was stuck at starting point as previously described - with kalman-filter on routing works, even if it (always) asks to switch on GPS even if it's already active....  hope this helps you. Do you confirm to try the above attached app or do i have to wait for some other modifications? Some other random comments:  - translation of kalman-filter toggle should be improved: now italian translation is "legare il movimento", quite confusing.. would it be possible to modify it in "movimento fluido"? - speech synthesis is always in english. Not a big issue, but it would be nice to have it according to device language - the app keeps on creating a "pocketmaps" folder in the download folder even if map location has been moved to another position. Again not a big issue...  Many thanks! Francesco

@andreasschroth Sure that would work in this case, but it's still a bug isn't it? If you for example want to make one of the parts conditional with an if statement there is no clean way to do that.   For example: ``` $messageFormat  = 'text'; if(true) {         $messageFormat .= ' text %s text %s'; } else {         $messageFormat .= ' %s text %s'; }         $messageFormat .= ' text %s.';

my code is below whithout  setting colorfilter,it works fine. after the colorfilter applied, the corner show with color.   
Yes. There's one sentinel cluster managing many redis masters. Each master has a slave.  Masters (and their slaves) belong to different projects, have different passwords, different configuration and should have nothing in common.

 I've upgraded to the following versions and the bug is still occurring:  Integrated Dynamics: 1.12.2-0.11.8 Integrated Tunnels: 1.12.2-1.5.4 CyclopsCore: 1.12.2-0.11.5 Forge: 1.4.23.2.2629
I just did a bit of testing and renaming of profiles isn't a problem (sorry for claiming this above). But renaming of used scenarios makes Easer crash every time! Here a simple step-by-step example:  0. Install Easer 0.6 from F-Droid, grant permissions and make it run. 1. Create a scenario named foo (Time 6:00) 2. Create a script named bar that uses foo as a scenario and leave everything else blank. 3. Change the name of the scenario foo to test.  After hitting save Easer crashes with the message "Unfortunately, Easer has stopped." and then crashes every time I try to start it with that same message.
Hello Tobias,     It seems that my phone does send such error reports to Google directly (see attached screen shot). I have no option to change this nor do I see this message in any „Sent“ folder or so.     As the crash message was popping up several times when I work with the phone, I uninstalled the app from my phone. I’ll give it another try in some weeks or so and use M$ OneDrive meanwhile.     On my tablet (Android 8.1), things work fine, though.     Best Regards,  Gabriel.     Von: Tobias Kaminsky <notifications@github.com>  Gesendet: Donnerstag, 8.

It happens on most files. Maybe I wasn't specific enough with the extra info, but the data in the bug report is for one file, that crashed in around four minutes. However, the one I called the "Original problem" the MKV file playing on the Xperia tablet, played for a little less than 30 minutes one time, and more ore less 10 minutes on a second try.  There is also the case I mentioned about the 70MB files, that are 20 minutes long give or take, and they play without issues consistently.  Thanks, Fernando
yeah i tried delete it thats how i got on last time, this time it kept say that almura was offline and could not download the mod pack. what ever they did fixed it again, if it happens again i make sure to get logs n screen shots up straight away. 
Yeah, after I'm done with some tasks I'm currently working on that's what I'll do  I'm using version 1.0.1
Sure @bsideup. I'm using DockerComposeContainer and BrowserWebDriverContainer and looking for the way to land them on the same docker network.
I am using postgresq 9.4 and the driver is the one from the confluent 2.0.0 package, i.e `postgresql-9.4-1206-jdbc41.jar`.  About the use case, I am using the jdbc connector against an existing table in the database, for the first time. The table has got around 10 millions rows, even though I rather care about the future updates rather than the data already in it.  I am using the `timestamp` mode.  Leaving the sensitive information out, here's my properties file:   
I'm not sure if it is SaveActions or EclipseCodeFormatter. EclipseCodeFormatter is triggered by SaveActions

yes just did same in the version **0.12.0** got `localhost` and in **0.13.3** got `${HOST:localhost}`
Must have done something wrong when I tried code fences.  Thanks for edit.  Yes it is similar I need to install on a test box to test one more time and capture details.  I remember lots of Java error issues though.  I am ok if you want to close mine referencing the other as I am fairly confident that once you guys dive into the code it will all be resolved.  I can follow the other one and even test builds since they sound similiar.  
It belongs to root:root.  BTW, I installed using "$sudo ./bazel-0.1.2-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --bazelrc=$HOME/.bazelrc" because it copied file to /usr/local.......  So, it might be better to initialize the cache when first run bazel but not during the installation. 
Hi @laa , We are already calling commit() before calling shutdown(). 
It does not fix the problem: gradle -Djdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes="" -Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes="" dependencyCheckAnalyze --info  :dependencyCheckAnalyze (Thread[Task worker for ':',5,main]) started. IO Exception: Unable to tunnel through proxy. Proxy returns "HTTP/1.0 407 Proxy Authentication Required"  java version "1.8.0_144" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)  I'm wondering why this is prefixed with jdk since the release notes indicate it is set for the runtime environment. 
It works on single node cluster for me and it recreates it consistently. I tried on 2 and 3 nodes cluster but it does not recreate it. Please use single node only. 
I'll test this out here soon. It may take a few hours before I can do so. 
> if someone could provide some pointers on how to fix this, I would be willing to create a pull request.  You probably only need to wrap the logic performed by `serviceDestroy` inside a `session.accessSynchronously` block: https://github.com/vaadin/spring/blob/3.0/vaadin-spring/src/main/java/com/vaadin/spring/internal/UIScopeImpl.java#L260  Then you'd also have to figure out how this could be automatically tested. With a little luck, it's already covered by a test, but the test isn't run with assertions enabled.  
@wdullaer I cannot select 10:30 when my current selection is 11:00, despite 10:30 being a selectable candidate. I can only select 10:30 when my current selection is 9:30 or 11:30. Same issue as before.
yes the directory also exists and writable for anybody 
@ingmargoudt  I've had it happen twice during two different EDH games.
well behavior is the same for string, integer double. Array has size=10;  In this case it was string but I'm testing it with integers. I believe it might be a problem with resolution of source field:  `Unexpected exception is thrown while reading source field: null:` 
I will see if I can repeat this. I noticed that the times it happened it was on night mode, after sunset and before sunrise. Could be coincidence.   I will record what I can the next time it happens. I've used it multiple times in day mode today and have had no issues. 
I can reproduce it in our environment, so what we could do is enable debugging and attach an IDE with the orient code in it to the server to see where it goes wrong.  But I'm guessing this will need a restart of the node that goes wrong and that could potentially fix the problem as it gets a fresh db from another node. Or is there another way to enable debugging without restarting?  As for an online session. I can do that monday, preferrable in the morning. 
We are using default helm chart that configures basic auth. The command i tried was: app default processor:app-name --version [the new default version to set]  Also, some additional info. I have setup CD to always do [-force] on installation of new version of the app. This might be causing some problem when existing streams deployed are using current version and new version is installed and forced to become default but it cant since existing stream using current version and etc?!
Sure. Will let you know and post full logcat after a clean flash. Btw what is "noral" ? Kindly add Power Menu tile.  Thank you ! 
When I query the tables separately i.e., do a select * from <table_name> then it shows the column descriptions for both tables and it even shows in table properties or column definition window whatever it is called.

As i said about the plugins, It does not matter what for plugins are on the server. With an Fresh config where **only** the force login is turned off it workes fine. But after i also change other things to false the plugin decide to be annoying.   Servert version: Spigot 1.12.2  But sure. If you still wnna know the plugin list: https://pastebin.com/imfpuY6r  And so i tested it now. Even if you only have AuthMe and Protocolib, You have still the same issue.
I've updated the full back trace - I originally managed to remove some of the helpful parts of the exception.  I'm also struggling to build the 8.1.2 docker client source code on Windows/Java 8.  The CompressedDirectoryTest.testFileWithIgnore test fails saying "java.nio.file.InvalidPathException: Illegal char <*> at index 10: !subdir3\\*.keep".  I apologise as I appreciate that isn't very helpful.  I'm running my development code using the 8.1.2 jar binary against a remote Azure (Docker for Azure) hosted docker host.  Using "docker service ls" does appear to work fine.    My guess from the exception is that the docker client doesn't deserialize the Driver section properly.  Using the Docker Engine API directly this looks to be typically:   My fix was to make Driver.java look more like Mount.java which seemed to fix the issue I was seeing.
That's great. Easy fix? Do you think it will make 1.6.1?  
I'm using spring-cloud-stream `Horsham.SR2` (3.0.2)
Since movement from JabRef 9.10 to 3.4 resulted in massive loss of information, I reverted to the former and recovered the jabref-meta: groupstree for each database. While I lack any expertise, it seems that the hierarchical structure of group names could be readily preserved. For example, here is a hierarchical group tree:    1    -A     -- a  2  -B  --a  3   -C  -- b  So a bibliographic entry that is associated only the first "a", and with "C" and "b" would have the field:    groups = {1,A,a; 3,C; 3,C,b},  If this could be done, I recommend it. 
LiteLoader is not installed, just Forge, so it's not related to #9.  I tried a clean installation with Forge-14.23.4.2760 (also tried the last and it's the same) and the latest release of mouse tweaks and [it's still happening](https://youtu.be/8E4fhfcHCGA).  PC Specs just in case: I5 6600k @3.6Ghz 16GB RAM (8 allocated for the game) GTX 970 W10  
Hi, I reloaded.   
Thanks. I'll have a second look and logcat tomorrow. (Friday night busy...) 
Steps are in the ticket copy/paste one more time: 1. Start ORIENTDB WORKBENCH Enter new server: localhost 2. Stop ORIENTDB WORKBENCH 3. Try to start again. 
Maybe, `h2c` is not enabled by default. But if I add `h2c` to the `OkHttpClient`, every **http** call add `Upgrade` to the http header. If the server support it, it will go with `h2c`. If the server does not support it, it simply ignore it, and it will go with 'http/1.1'.
@hhclam I haven't .bazelrc file, all the options are listed in the command line
The codes mentioned by @alan666notb are working fine for me.  Still another two users on support mail. Each of them logged into gc.com normal acc. to sysinfo. And problem is persistent even after reboot/relogin.  The new code looks kind of straight forward to me...what can cause this?
Yep, looks good. 
1. I am using HTTP and making lots of batch SQL queries, mostly "create vertex..." and "create edge...". 2. See below   
That's a good question. Fixed.
Hi,  My nginx config is practically the same as what's documented other than   * using `/gl/ ` as the subpath instead of `/graylog/` ; and * adding `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;` (the problem existed without this line)     As said earlier, the other parts of the application appear to be functional for me when using nginx as a reverse proxy.  I do not see this behaviour when I access the application at http://127.0.0.1:9000 directly.   ![not_found](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8793762/74431017-c5c6eb00-4e66-11ea-98b5-0cc7b0521992.gif) 
Haven't been able to test that yet. But just looking at my spawn with 4 merged plots, it happens.

I _guess_ it is in the hope of avoiding memory leaks. 
There are no errors in the log anymore. All steps to reproduce are as follows:  - remove all saved data (`~/.local/share/DBeaverData/`) - install DBeaver - run DBeaver - when asked for a database, just close the window - click `File > Properties`  If I set up a db connection, it works, so what I'm suspecting this to be, is that the button should not be clickable, if no database is set up.
It may take some time to find what script can reproduce the problem. Of course, a quick script I tried could not reproduce it.  DSRoot extends V DBTable extends DSBaseEntity which extends V None are abstract, they are using 8 clusters with Round-Robin algo. At the moment, DSRoot has 1 record and DSTable has 460 and DSBaseEntity has 9213. V has 12,545 and E has 22,045 records.  The DSRoot, DSTable and DSBaseEntity have no index. As far as I know, we are not using indexes anywhere. The web console shows only dictionary, OFunction.name, ORole.name and OUser.name in the indexes list.   I'm still look for a repro script. Do you have other ideas that could help pinpoint the problem? 
Sorry, let me rephrase that. That line, which I referenced, is not able to find the `spring.jmx.default-domain: myDomain` property in my bootstrap.yml.  Just did a quick re-check, and it's not really a snakeYaml issue, it's that in the `environment.getProperty("spring.jmx.default-domain.")`, the name has an extra dot at the end.  The property is found if I use `environment.getProperty("spring.jmx.default-domain")`
Steps to reproduce: 1. Open transactions list. 2. Scroll down. Scroll is working as expected. 3. Try scroll up. Refresh spinner is drawn instead scrolling.

Hi, following your comment at Play Store I redownloaded the app today, so yes, it's 1.6.  The abbreviations and numbers for my phone: Model: ALE-L21 Android: 5.0 EMUI 3.1  I guess the problem might be with the fact that Huawei P8's come preinstalled with EMUI add-on, but it's a wild guess. 
SBA version is 1.5.7 ， Spring boot version is 1.5.12 and spring cloud version is Edgware.SR3 
Yes, Git Shell does indeed use the Linux bash emulation. I have run the command in question using Git Bash quite a number of times in the past, and I do not remember ever encountering this error.  Could this be caused by some recent changes?
@skabashnyuk, yes seems page is not available.
Copy is needed only if file given from other app. But i think, there are some streaming solutions for all  sources. Browsers does not copy files got from document api. I was able to upload 900mb file using aosp browser, but nextcloud client failed because no much free space.
my data is obtained from an api, this is related to the local server?
Tested against 0.6.0 beta 52 and verified as resolved. 
Apparently, this is also a known issue in Java map implementation, keys can also leak if they are mutable.   I guess its the users responsibility to be careful.  
Yes 4.4.2 (Paranoid) :|

I used 0.3.9 before. {"version":"1.202"} is the output from the above link.  Ubuntu 12.04 - Server with the ownCloud PPA. Appframework und news-app get updated via git.  What else do you need to know about the server?  
Nothing except the time taken ...
I will test web service as soon as i find bad signal area. Using OC with a stable and fast connection looks pretty good, so i'don't think it has anything to do with perfomance problems.  The point is: of course it can take a while to load the file list, but it shoud show the "loading" animation, or "pls wait" message, or "connection failed" message, instead of freezing and crashing. 
Yes actually, good catch.
Hey @dariuszseweryn, thanks for taking a look at this. For us, yes, receiving the indication is important to the transmission.   Our use case is that when we subscribe to the characteristic it fires a characteristic change event with a value. We then write to another characteristic which causes us to receive another characteristic change event with another value that we combine into a key.   I have had better results when writing the client descriptor myself while starting to observe the change event from RxBleGattCallback.  
Hi,   thank you. "eclipselink.weaving.fetchgroups=false" fixed it for me. Since we do not use the fetch group feature it has no negative side effects.  A side note, this bug is very old: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/glassfish/issues/16164  It would be nice when this behavior would be documented somewhere. I can imagine that other users will run into this issue too and spend hours for debugging.  Thanks.  Greetings
It seems to work fine now, haven't had any issue so far. Great job you're doing by the way :+1:  
@dsyer The request grant type used was custom `c_password` which extends the `password` grant type. I'm using the Oauth Client setup to make the request. I was posting the incorrect credential and noting what gets return in the body from my API (secured by spring oauth).   Now the response header, I get back from the API is `401 Unauthorized` however, the response body is empty. As you can see from my first post, I get that JSON response when making the request using my Advance RestClient however, using my RestTemplate (through Spring Oauth Client configuration), the response body is empty (HttpClientErrorException->getResponseBodyAsString is empty  though simulating the exact request through Advance RestClient, return a JSON error response body) 
sorry , i am a Novice .  i  will not  send a  pull  request.... 
So basically it won't be possible on KISS?
I chose the solution that initialize lastMousePressedPosition instead of "returning if it is null". 
I did not think of that. I'll try to make the gradle plugin use this for x-compilation. Not sure I'll be for the 2.6 release, as I'm swamped. But maybe.  I guess we can close this issue. Thanks! 
Sorry, should have specified that. I'm seeing it in the repo view while trying to scroll the readme.

@stephanj see comment above. Does the new CFP backend contain an endpoint to retrieve sponsors?
I am running 3.6.7(by the plugin/yml) but i feel like i just updated it yesterday. Yes they respawn back to the main spawn, but with whatever item they had in creative inventory when they joined. 
Sure!  Here you go:   [test.txt](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/files/1494546/test.txt) 
Actually, I should have said that the favorites get emptied. After that, there's no other way then to manually add every favorite again.  This happened two times, each time at the start of the app, when the app queries the server for station data updates. The first time I  thought it could have been a memory error (device related issue), now I'm trying to understand if it has happened to anybody else. The second time I could actually see the favorites there for half a second, but then, after the update, the tab blanked out saying "no favorites". Il 17 mar 2016 19:05, Bruno Parmentier notifications@github.com ha scritto:Can you provide more details? Does it appear and then disappear or does it just never appear?

This was on RC3 the windows install version.  Great i will build my own version. 
@crakiMDH   1: Dude, it also mentions Phorusrhacos' size in the paper... 2: Honestly, if we use the proportions of other phorusrhacines, then a 3 meter tall Kelenken is likely. 
@SUPERCILEX yeah I can't repro either ... maybe I was just tired and enabled smartlock by accident.
I'm using Chrome version  21.0.1180.60 - and Play authenticate 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT. I don't have any extensions installed, and even in incognito mode, it doesn't work. I will submit the issue at Twitter Bootstrap. 
Let me try to explain how views actually look: 1. Video Texture fits all the screen, but actually rendering may not cover all it's area (for example: screen 1080x2220 and typical video 16:9 is rendering like 1080x608 and other area is just black). It's necessary to have such a big texture to be able make animated transitions/scales/crops/etc from one screen to another. 2. If SubtitleView measured like 1080x2220 then we have a huge size of text and it's not I'am expect.     If it is measured to video frame size 1080x608 and located in screen center over video then there's a bug when cues rendered somewhere bottom outside subtitle's view. 
It is tested. Work like a charm. Thanks
I updated and the error is gone. Feel free to close.
Hi @DaveCTurner ,   Thanks a lot for your answer.   And is there any command like `elasticsearch-traslog trim` for translog merge?  Because before merging all the translog ,my ES node recovey very slowly even can't start (too many open files.)
Ah, I was unaware of that endpoint. I had been doing GET /_rollup/job/* to list jobs and was seeing nothing. This list however is a bit big and includes data from a bunch of deleted jobs. The rollup indexes are deleted too. Is there a way to clean these out?

I downgraded to 3.4.1 to avoid for now, so not seeing this again for now. I am actually seeing this still, it happens occasionally when I just open my app, but not everytime. I am initialising the stream client in my main activity, the log doesn't show me where this error originates from my code, so it makes it difficult to point out the origin from my code, but I'm initialising the stream client in my MainActivity, and other times in my channel list and detail views in case the stream client is destroyed by the system.
Hi @erikandre  I uploaded a zip file containing three of the test images.  [images.zip](http://6d0dbc33a6c02.cdn.sohucs.com/foobar/images.zip) Please download and unzip the file, then put the images into SD card, and call setImageURI(Uri.fromFile(file)).  Those images are test cases of my project, to test corner situations. I can reproduce the issue with those images in Fresco 1.7.1.  Hope this post may help, thx!
I mean that 3 finger swipes to switch desktops is extremely laggy if it exists at all. 2 finger scrolling is almost unusable. As soon as I stop the hook thread all of those problems clear up.  
Yes, maybe the server was unavailable. Unable to reproduce the problem again.
Side note: [Apparently](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases/tag/v1.2.1.2000) the Dokany library can return the version number, so perhaps Cryptomator could display it under its own version number?  `Dokan1.sys` is at `1.2.0.1000` and hence outdated. I assume that this is the version that got installed alongside Cryptomator `1.4.15`, which required a reboot by the way, so plausibly Dokany was updated then. However, Cryptomator's `dokan1.dll` is at `1.3.0.1000`, so weirdly that one is up-to-date.  I uninstalled everything (Dokany + Cryptomator, of which there were two entries in the control panel), restarted as Dokany asked for, installed Cryptomator `1.4.15`, which now installed Dokany `1.3.1000`, so I don't really understand how I ended up with `1.2.1000` yesterday despite having to reboot yesterday too.  With the newer Dokany version, the **issue is resolved**! Thanks! So I guess if anything, the remaining question is how to get Dokany to update properly along with Cryptomator.
While player holding a teleporting skill, it creates a blue human shape image particle in front of the player, right? And once released and teleported, the blue human shape particle is still remain.
Just installed Version 5.3.4.201902031804.  With the same schema if I insert a row with cons_id = 1, failed_attempts = 1, time_locked = null and then right click in the cell for time_locked and choose Edit -> Edit Cell I get a dialog box. In that dialog box I click Set Current where it fills in the Time text box with 2019-02-05 14:23:04. I then click Save. I get the NullPointerException.

Got a lot of errors like that:

Oh I understand the view extends LinearLayout, I think it would be best if you force vertical orientation in code, otherwise other developers might forget to add the attribute in the xml.   Great lib thanks
> Have you checked the connection parameters?  Yes I did. PDU is phone-dependent, MTU is always 250.   Connection params on connection:  `onConnectionUpdated(), status=0, interval=6 (7.50 ms), latency=0, timeout=500 (5000 ms)`  First update (immediately after connection):  `onConnectionUpdated(), status=0, interval=36 (45.00 ms), latency=0, timeout=500 (5000 ms)`  After a transfer:   `onConnectionUpdated(), status=0, interval=24 (30.00 ms), latency=0, timeout=500 (5000 ms)`  After each transfer (when the unsubscribe from the NOTIFY characteristic happens), the above connection update happens.  Based on this, the message interval should be 30ms, which roughly correlates to my previous observation of roughly 10-20ms between messages (which technically was rather around 18-28 after doing some proper math, instead of rough estimate). However a longer transfer still increases the interval from this 30ms to around 150-200ms by the time 4MB is transferred, and even higher if a transfer is ongoing. Connection updates are not present during this.

@laa, what version of OrientDB did you use? I will try to understand what executed inside which leads to the highlighted effect. Probably some OrientDB cache or something.

Sorry tested with NB from 17.10.2013 I just notice it with NM. Before the Cache have just NM make owner maintenance so the Cache have no attribute more in c:geo the attribute still stay after refresh. Add a attribute on page, cgeo refresh it correct. Will try it with other attributes. 
When reading `ViewColumn`  from view  declared in 312, I see `row(.... , table varchar)`. When view is defined in 323+, it's `row(.... , "table" varchar)`. This makes a big difference when we use parser to get the type.
I am running the server of Direwolf20-1.10 pack version 1.2.2, and then I added Mekanism myself (built from latest master as of a couple weeks ago). So it's just forge, I think. Not any of the things you listed as far as I know. I downloaded [the server files](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-presents-direwolf20-1-10/files/2361694#additional-files), unzipped them and ran `ServerStart.sh`. It looks like FML is doing the unloading:    It might be ok to turn unloading off (might eventually cause memory issues), but I have not yet found how to tweak this. There is a `forgeChunkLoading.cfg` but it only sets limits on number of chunks loaded by a mod.
I'll send you STR asap 
Thanks Luis. I'm facing a problem though. The project that contains the `ParamFineGrainTest` depends on the parser so I can not use the `ParamFineGrainTest` in the parser without introducing a dependency cycle. Now Maven is complaining. Can we do something about this? 
Removing more player models fixed the issue for now (would like to use it), still though here is the [image](http://imgur.com/a/CDiGu)

Clickhouse server has a specific option to set the user as "readonly" which users delete, create etc. queries are ignored. That user will have read-only access. (Please check related clickhouse documentation page: https://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access_rights.html )  When I try to connect a with a readonly user from DBeaver to Clickhouse server, DBeaver tries to set "extremes" value as false. Due to that query clickhouse server gives error (because of readonly user)  So there should be an option on DBeaver connection settings. When its enabled (means readonly), DBeaver shouldnt send any query related to writing (create, update, delete, set etc.)  Makes sense?  P.S. I'll also try to get the exact error message.
Thanks for confirming.    +1 for (evil) default silent credentials

I tried the new code with the same result.  Do you want me upload my data file? 
turns out it possibly is causing some inconvenience. Players have been saying items have disappeared from there inventory, if they re-login sometimes they will get those items back. As for when the player logs in ill keep an eye out when it it next happens but i have tried logging in in all dimensions and cannot recreate it.
Hi, I'm very sorry, I'm new to SpringBoot and was going around in circles for a little while trying to work out where the dependency problem was. I downgraded jadira to version 5.0.0 and it works. Thanks.
I use dbeaver 6.2.1.201909221630.  It is easy to reproduce this problem.  You can create two table and then create virtual foreign keys between the two table.Save it,Then reopen the project and you can find the virtual foreign keys lost.
Excuse me. Sending a video with the playback bug (https://evmezentsev.wistia.com/medias/bc86gf7n2y). If in words, when copying the selected text, and then later deleting this text, after the space this text is not inserted, after the text it is inserted normally.
I am using Orientdb-Enterprise 2.2.4.  
yes
Thanks for spotting that! That will teach me to re-use one of the examples without fully understanding it :)  Just a suggestion: perhaps the code could emit a warning if there are multiple sections encountered and only one is supported?  Removing the included content does indeed get my bits working. 
It's actually a bit worse than the current build on F-Droid for my set of devices, unfortunately. It's getting stuck in with the buffering circle for about 15 seconds then plays like 4-5 and repeats.  > If possible, can you please also use a network monitoring tool, such as this, to see if the extracted stream url is rate-limited during on-demand?  It displays 2.6M/sec downstream continuously. No matter if playing or buffering. Not sure if you can get something from that.  > If so, can you please check if the video streams better on-demand (by enabling "Use external video player" option in the "Video & Audio" settings, and open the stream using VLC/MX)?  VLC has issues, MX plays choppy with dropped frames, but displays buffering to be ahead. I'm a bit confused on why it's choppy then. 
@kruegers I agree. Can we implement it like this?
1.10 and im not sure how to check for error 
@hsyed yes I am fully synced up! I tried on two difference machines and experience the same issue.  I have no issues with the dependencies it is just the Run/Debug button in the gutter not being enabled.
The pom.xml provided in the sample project contains the minimum archives required to compile and run the tests.  Each one of the archives was added because of a compiler or test run issue in which a needed class was not present.  Comment out the archive for testng lines 65-69.  Running the test  "mvn test" displays the following msg. [ERROR] org.jboss.resteasy.test.core.basic.ByeTest  Time elapsed: 1.082 s  <<< ERROR! java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/testng/annotations/BeforeClass  To resolve this I had to add the testng archive.

I have made a minimal project to reproduce the problem here: https://github.com/gsurrel-orange/boot-liquibase-dev-tools. On the first launch everything works fine but when the app is restarted by the dev tool module, there is a problem re-running the import script.

The Content Pack is WWII, the vehicle is SU-1-12, this is the line. The date was May 3 2019   And I'll keep it in mind for the future to report bugs separately. In terms of the crash, again, it wasn't I who caught it, my staff reported it to me. I'll eventually go back to check the logs and find the error when it happened and paste it in full. Using the teams command to set despawn timer to 0 (never) fixed the issue.

@yogevbd, no I don't. We don't use sideMenu at all.
Seems to be working fine now, thanks!
Parenthesis dont work either (updated to OrientDB 2.2.4):    Same result with added "TRUE" after "MANDATORY".  BTW parser shows wrong place of error and gives wrong error message (points to "ALTER", which is obviously ok).  ... spent about hour last evening splitting "ALTER PROPERTY" commands ;)

The mod psychedelicraft had shaders that were effecting them, so I uninstalled it and now they are fine. 
@krharsh17  I was able to fix it. The issue was with `Constants.java` file in that the colour resource was not preceded by '#'.
I made a simple database example, plz see entached file. So there is one budget on category: Food 50€ And two expenses, on sub-categories:  - Food:Dining Out 20€ - Food:Groceries 10€   The total is 30€, but the displayed value for Food category is 20€, which is the first sub-category.   Hope this helps to understand !  [Example.zip](https://github.com/moneymanagerex/android-money-manager-ex/files/498865/Example.zip) 
The code works with the BootsFaces-0.8.1-SNAPSHOT. Thank you very much for your efforts.

I'm afraid I've got no error, and as for the code, I don't have any piece ready.  I can try to make one, but can't promise, I've got lots to do currently.  Concerning the gwtupload problem with gwtbootstrap3: it actually works, but wait until the end of its retry policy to call `onFinishUpload`. This leads to 2 to 3 minutes waiting before the download shows as finished (even though it could have been done in less than a second).  Downgrading GWTBootstrap3 fixed the problem for me. But I don't see why it should be related.  Does GWTBootstrap3 overrides some of GWT's methods? 
As an investor in both Mycelium and Steem, I'd like to insist on this feature to be fixed and not have those coins ignored.
I import it through the tools --> import font method, as I read that had fixed some ligature issues in the past (and I also struggle to get PolyGlot to recognise the font through the language properties screen).  I certainly can send through the font, what email address do you use.  Thanks very much for the prompt response! Ben.
Initially there were 184 errors but they disappeared on retry. Now I see only 2 errors. All error were in the TodoActivity. AuthenticationActivity builds fine. 
This crash is the second one. The falling sand one seemed to have left but still sometimes happens  On Mon, Aug 3, 2015 at 7:08 PM, Simeon Radivoev notifications@github.com wrote:  > When did the crash happen.

I don't see the ability to disable Syntax Highlighting through the Syntax menu.  Only see Auto Detect, Plain, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML.  I changed it from Autodetect/JavaScript to Plain, but it only applies to that one JS response.  Is there another way to disable application wide (not seeing it in Options)?
`jme3-bullet` has 2 options for threading (`SEQUENTIAL` and `PARALLEL`) and 4 options for broadphase collision detection (`SIMPLE`, `AXIS_SWEEP_3`, `AXIS_SWEEP_3_32`, and `DBVT`). The two sets of options are orthogonal.  This issue happens only with `SIMPLE` broadphase. It happens with both `SEQUENTIAL` and `PARALLEL` threading.
Hi,   This subscription:   
With accurate you mean something like a warmroast? Unfortunatly I only have/had timings with paper. But these don't show exactly where the problem lies and instead just showed PlayerUpdateTask as cause.   Maybe I can organize a warmroast next week, but I can't promise it, as I never used it before and it seems at least somewhat complicated to make it run.   (PS: I do understand that the task is just calling some default minecraft code and is not really at fault, but it would be nonetheless nice to be able to disable it if the features needing it aren't even used. ) 
I did some more testing, here are my results: - It's independant of the shaderpack that I'm using. I tested it with SEUS and have the same issue - It also seems to be independant from the instruments or HUD. Disabling any of them or both does not help - It occurs in first- and third-person mode
oracle.jdbc.xa.client.OracleXADataSource
You can reproduce it:  Join to arena, leave arena. Join to arena, leave arena. After that, arena start writing "Teleport to lobby" 
After some more investigation, the comparison is actually against the `ref` field of the push object. The value of that will usually be a git ref, like `refs/heads/master` for pushes to branches. I think the proper solution is not to match anything, but testing for equality with `targetBranch` prepended by `refs/heads/`. `refs/heads/` is the only prefix that makes sense, because we do not care about tags that are pushed or other refs.  I will give the fix a try and test it out on our server. 
@dualspiral So it does not crash, Lantern and Nucleus both continue to work. This is on start-up though as Nucleus is registering its listeners initially.   It seems Nucleus may be registering these listeners more than once somehow or Lantern may be doing something wrong(more likely and I cannot see it). See the registration code:  https://github.com/LanternPowered/LanternServer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/lanternpowered/server/event/LanternEventManager.java#L172
Don't know exactly how it happened.Maybe during a parsing or typechecking.  
I just tried it and it provides a crafting recipe, however the totem crafted is empty.
It works! You are amazing! 
Sorry for the delay, tasking switched. We are using version 3.0.1. I believe the 3.0.1 version also has the dependencies you mention. I was saying I added the dependency to my module to skirt the Jaxb context exception, but my workaround doesnt solve the following issue.  I'll be working on this the next week Thanks, Josh 
Glowroot version is 0.13.1 and i checked master branch. But i didn't match the branch with version sorry for that. Link provided in below.  https://github.com/glowroot/glowroot/blob/master/agent/plugins/executor-plugin/src/main/java/org/glowroot/agent/plugin/executor/ExecutorAspect.java
Sorry I just updated the issue. If you create a **zip** bag, the issue is reproduced. When I tested the standard bag with no zip, there is no issue there. **Expected behavior** : inside the zip bag, the "data" folder content would have their original creation date either 1) when opened as archive, or 2) when extracted.  
Hi Michael  Thank you for getting back to me. Here is a screenshot of one of the devices. We use 8 different ones and crushing happens inconsistently on all models only on long audio sessions. All devices were installed with the latest Oc version. The app is on all the time with no other action on the background. As far as I see the device doesn't go to sleep, although the screen shuts after a minute or so. By the way the app on iPod touch devices runs faultlessly.

@mkouba I've tried it again, and it fails for me as expected. Let me try it with current master, I am on 0.11.0

Yeah, it's only mentioned in passing in the javadoc for [EntityTransmuter.java](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/blob/master/artemis-core/artemis/src/main/java/com/artemis/EntityTransmuter.java#L48).  
Like @ahendre2010, i think a button to manually update pictures could be a workaround
Sorry @philwebb I was on vacation. I am trying to understand how this whole stuff is working. I will let you know details.

@lorthirk today I was not able to reproduce this issue as _**Login**_ button freezes after first click (which is OK) so I am closing this issue. 
He doesn't have this permission.  
rest of the docker commands are running fine. This is happening with instruction provided to up eclipse/che. Below is the instruction.  $ docker run <DOCKER_PARAMETERS>   eclipse/che action list-workspaces   when i run this without Docker_host i get below message.   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10115913/21927720/f50078a0-d9ac-11e6-8e03-f447351b5ef7.png)  and with  docker_host i get TLS issue.    
I do get that message, but what confuses me is this: I try to set their homes in my own, dead center. 10 blocks any which way, and the ceiling a good 10-12 up, whereas if I try to, for example, set it in a 3 wide alleyway it somehow works. That's where my confusion lies. 
If I pass the whole item it's the same, it's a matter or parsing not of what I'm sending to the bean. Why would I want to decompress an item in the bean when I can get the inner key and value from an entry already from the loop? I couldn't get ui:repeat to work with the collection I'm working with.
OK, fixed in the current build, thanks. 
Nope. The Windmill is dead in the water. 
The right-click exclude from.., Proxy is being done from the Sites tree.  They vanish from the sites tree after I do this.
I was running carbon demo in both of my devices (Sony Xperia S and Huawei p9) , in p9 things are really smooth but in Xperia S EdgeEffect is killing it, I mean when ever it poops up it gets nasty.   But in the same device I was using usual android recyclerview with EdgeEffect but it dose not seems put any issue at all.
Yes, the count on the homesceen. For the [NUMBER]-template I filtered , and . out. 
Sorry, I'm not sure where to look for that dir, I don't have it anywhere in the project after clean build.
Ah. That explains it.
Thanks for your investigation! We have added the classpath to the client script (it was left out to speed up pure client operations, but obviously the igo library is also needed client-side to parse queries using the Japanese tokenizer. Closed (feel free to reopen) 
i suspect :     Les Simpson - Le film as Professor Frink / Comic Book Guy / Moe / Chief Wiggum / Lou / Carl / Cletus / Bumblebee Man / Male EPA Worker / Dome Depot Announcer / Kissing Cop / Carnival Barker / Counter Man / Apu / Drederick Tatum / Sea Captain / EPA Passenger / Robot / Dr. Nick / Wise Guy (voice)  role  involves with this bug , to bypass i had to set the status as DONE for Hank Azaria, which stop the loop.   if you don't want to enlarge the role column, 255 characters seems enough, perhaps could you truncate the role to 255 characters before sorting it. 
Ah, that's a nice solution to the problem. Still allowing swiping but making accidental swiping harder. Cleaner solution than clover. 
Hello, no it always happend then nextcloud crash and need to stop. The pdf could open and then application stop few seconds later but if i select a pdf file but i don't chose the application to open with and wait few second the same error happend .. At the beginning i was thinking the problem come from the pdf app but i tried with different one and same problem :(  please find attaches the log but sorry its a full part log as grep command not working on my windows 10 maybe you can find what you want.  Thanks a lot for your help [log.txt](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/files/3166811/log.txt) 
It's sanctioned now that we fixed the null pointer.   It takes the money.   There was a fun bug where the first time a country was sanctioned for cheating, instead of taking any money from it, it just rounded its availableToSpend to the nearest dollar.   I've fixed that though, so this all appears to be working. 
We switched Roborios and its fine now I'm not sure what was happening.  
Yes, that's the issue i was referring to, sorry for the bad wording :/  I am using DASH content, and i agree that it is usually not a good idea. However, it is necessary when you want to get down the latency by shortening the segment duration (fractional seconds in my case), while avoiding a bad compression efficiency through frequent usage of keyframes. This way you can end up starting with a number of consecutive segments without keyframes when tuning into a live stream. 
Can i stop it programatically?  Actualy the video has not started because i have set property  player.setAutoPlay(false);

@sobychacko A basic app with a single binding should do the trick. We're using Spring Boot `2.0.5.RELEASE` and `2.0.1.RELEASE` of `spring-cloud-stream`. To reproduce we've configured the application to connect to a local Kafka instance. After booting the app with the Kafka stopped, producer creation will eventually fail with the following exception:     We were expecting this to be reflected in Actuator but it's still reporting the binder as "UP". An app with just a consumer (`@EnableBinding(Sink::class)`) and no available Kafka seems to constantly attempt to connect to the broker while also reporting as "UP".    
Ah, sorry, I didn't look into where the actual code came from.  If it needs to be updated in htsjdk then it should be updated there.  
 
I configured those ip according to the OVH docs: https://docs.ovh.com/es/dedicated/network-ipaliasing/ And the error logs are in the spigot servers https://imgur.com/a/31Hud
Thanks for your reply! I was not accurate enough, sorry.  In fact , buttons in flow layout is working very well, as your sample app does. But when we use other custom views (like Cards view from CardsLibs in FlowLayout) those views are not displayed on 4.4 KitKat. But works well on others version.

happens all the time its permanent as long as i use the new version of EBWiz also happens on all mobs and i noticed it also happens to the text that apears when i use the feature from quark mod that makes mobs randomly talk nonsens (quark and neat are made by vazkii so probably using the same overlay tingy)
Bam looks like `@GET("./")` works perfectly!  Looks like this is an easy close :)

### ConfigServer  _bootstrap.yml_   
Hi jbax, i was testing very normal case:  file1.csv --------------- a,b,c d,e,f ____________________ file2.csv --------------- a|b|c d|e|f _____________________ Java code: ---------------         `List<String[]> allRows = new ArrayList<>();         CsvParserSettings settings = new CsvParserSettings();                  settings.setDelimiterDetectionEnabled(true);         settings.setQuoteDetectionEnabled(true);          CsvParser parser = new CsvParser(settings);         // print format before parse         System.out.println(settings.getFormat());         try {             allRows = parser.parseAll(new FileInputStream("D:/file2.csv"));             //print format after parse             System.out.println(parser.getDetectedFormat());         } catch (Exception e) {             System.out.println(e);         }` Result If i using file1.csv (delimiter comma), everthing file If i using file2.csv (delimiter pipe), the output is wrong, and CSVFormat still showing delimiter=, (comma). So version 2.5.2 cannot detect delimiter. THe old version 2.1.1 does not have this problem . 
I'm using 148 mods. I think the problem is within EE3 specifically since everything in the chain has emc and the recipes in question are standard shaped crafting. So the problem is likely within EE3s DynEMC system, perhaps something to do with an item belonging to multiple oredics? 
ok with  passLimit=0 the server seemed to survive the 15 minutes idle. wierd thing was that when chopping the first tree it took some time 3 blocks for the physics to kick in. 
I can't reproduce it now. Perfect! Thanks. 
That happened in 2.1 rc5. Almost sure that it can happen on 2.1

@Lineflyer It looks indeed very similar to the issues you referenced (bit this time with at least a chance to reproduce. 
Just a way to disable this sound could be fine until you find out how to fix that bug please.
Hi @eivantsov, thanks for trying. It is consistent for me, tried today 5 times with different workspaces and every time I face the issue.
Dear lodici,   I was actually trying them simultaneously. However, I did try relaunching 1.60.770 and only downloading the playable cards and it still crashed out; I just retried it with the same result.  The crash logs are below; in both cases it seem to be the "~Azorius ?thermage”.  The playable cards “downloads-remaining" counter is at 8610.

No, it's pretty much without logs. The game crashes, and on my MacBook (because I'm away from my desktop) macOS reports that it's a critical java error, and the logs do not say anything. It's odd because I got it to work with the GUI *once*, but as soon as I re-opened it it crashed per-usual.  [Logs](https://gist.github.com/c8eaa4e8bc5794ce7dd607f429505de7)  EDIT: I'm a dumb  I just found this in the log - I haven't seen it in the past when hunting for the stack trace but this time [I've found it](https://gist.github.com/oitsjustjose/c8eaa4e8bc5794ce7dd607f429505de7#file-latest-log-L74-L96)

I found it on 3.0.1. master branch still has same issue. 
@tonihei -  Here is the test url - https://content.downlynk.com/channel/29e9c85c070f413fb71a3b2a39eed208.mpd?xtest=end30&prettydash=1 I don't see the playback state as Player.STATE_ENDED on end. 
I have been trying to do this... seems to be hard to get a small example to fail, my complete multi project build where I use git-p4 fail pretty often but in a simple gradle init project not so much apparently. If I run the failing command in my /usr/bin I get the same output on stderr and sometimes this error seems to be forwarded to the gradle output and sometimes (mostly) not... This line  https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/176466ed281f85f2ba92ae8b605fb43eb3e010d9/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java#L639 seems to run such a command and spotless/lib-extra/src/main/java/com/diffplug/spotless/extra/GitAttributesLineEndings.java seems to be using these config classes so I guess it originates from there. It seems if there is a CommandException, it will do a Log.warn() so I guess this is forwarded to gradle.  https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/176466ed281f85f2ba92ae8b605fb43eb3e010d9/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java#L515 indicates that it is not certain that stderr will always be read, but rather readpipe() will more often continue with it's work.  For me this indicates that there is some kind of race condition here whether the error will be logged.  Sorry I can't supply I proper reproducible example at this time. 
Yes. That's perfect. After reconnecting and disconnecting again, the no internet would pop up again.  If there are no connection changes, than just one notif 
First of all, Thank you for you support !  The tutorial MzIdentML you provided passed the OpenMS integrity test.  However while processing the MzIdentlML file I get the following error:  RuntimeError: the element 'Glu->pyro-Glu (E)' could not be found  Probably resulting from this line :   cvParam cvRef="UNIMOD" accession="UNIMOD:28" name="Gln-&gt;pyro-Glu" value="-17.026549"  I suspect that OpenMS itself is responsible for this issue, and will inspect this. I will update you when I find the source of this issue.  Thank you again for your outstanding support

Sorry for poor informations   ### Log4j2 Appender.  class: **org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.log4j2.AmqpAppender** line: **718-720**  `else if ("headers".equals(this.exchangeType)) {` `	x = new HeadersExchange(this.exchangeType, this.durable, this.autoDelete);` `}`   **Correct Code** is `else if ("headers".equals(this.exchangeType)) {` `	x = new HeadersExchange(this.exchangeName, this.durable, this.autoDelete);` `}` 
How can I check if the sockets use NUMA?  I checked the affinity (Task manager -> details) and there's a dropdown menu for selecting a processor group. Only the cores in one processor are selected. If I select the ones in the other and press ok, the ones in the previous group get unselected.  I don't quite understand why this happens.  From the documentation I do understand why there's two processor groups (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/procthread/processor-groups) as the total number of logical processors is > 64. However, I don't understand why it appears that a single process can only be running on one or the other, not both.
if the -z param is used wrong the help states:    So i assume it is the client who does not support https (ignores it and always uses http).

This is consistently reproducing the problem on my windows machine:  1) Open the CardiovascularDynamics model into a Project tab, click the Dependencies view. 2) Select the following codewords using the node selection tool: VrestRAd, VrestRAs, EminRA and EmaxRA (note these are all constitutive codewords) 3) Right click on one of the selected nodes and select "Extract Selected" 4) Name the new model and attempt to visualize its contents.   Hope that reproduces it on your end.  Might have something to do with all the nodes being constitutive.

Hi @Siedlerchr, you are right, whenever I create a biblatex library, I usually set up the user-specific library for the respective library (instead of one single library location), and I also click at the Save actions - Enable save actions > Recommended for biblatex.  This last action automatically enables the all-text-fields: Latex to Unicode option. While I can disable it, I think it is a useful conversion, and it should be rather Latex to UTF-8 instead and not firing an error mentioned in my 1st post. 
I used the KMLViewer.java example to import, exception text attached.  [Exception.txt](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/files/604472/Exception.txt) 
v5.1.3, but it happened with the last 2 versions too.  It happened to me right now again. Maybe it's because the tab is a duplicate sort of? Notice how the first 3 have Script -15, Script-18, Script-21 and don't have errors, while the last 3 have just Query and an error.  ![selection_290](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12811206/43380212-963e7f4e-93d0-11e8-8412-c31982f66adc.png) ![selection_296](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12811206/43380210-960ac8f2-93d0-11e8-9808-2a6aa0ad60cc.png) ![selection_291](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12811206/43380211-96245c0e-93d0-11e8-8c04-49ffe1355245.png) ![selection_288](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12811206/43380213-96578fde-93d0-11e8-8c00-b08120bcf2cc.png)  I really like the feature that it reopens the tab, it keeps the workflow going from day to day, it's like sublime2.  I have upgraded to v5.1.4, which mentions upgrade and linux fixes, let's how this goes.  
Yes it's still a problem; this is what I had done to move on: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/8fd4337ee1160ace2aec3c1f4f61377a3db96213/extensions/hibernate-orm/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/hibernate/orm/deployment/HibernateOrmReflections.java#L111-L114
Thanks @mikecroft   However need a clarification  We updated from glassfish3 to payara some time back For glassfish3 we used to disable chunking on the http-listener and not admin-listener  Is there any specific reason for change in functionality ?
> can you describe how to reproduce this problem?  Use the select for update statement to query a record that does not exist, an exception will occur.
That's strangs. I still receive a StackOverflowException. On two different PCs, eclipse Oxygen and Neon. Both with the current develop branch. I attached the correct log again. In the mean time, could you please send the imported model to me? Thank you!  [log.txt](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/files/1217184/log.txt) 
I think nothing special needed to reproduce the issue. "OpenIABEventManager" GameObject is on the scene with appropriated script attached. All event listeners subscriptions inside OnEnable() and OnDisable() also includes restoreSucceededEvent, restoreFailedEvent and transactionRestoredEvent.  I also checked this list of events and they raises as expected: - billingSupportedEvent - queryInventorySucceededEvent - purchaseSucceededEvent - purchaseFailedEvent 
You mean something like Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.0.4; de-de; GT-N7000 Build/IMM76D) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/534.30  Or just to use another API? 
after trying again and changed to 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:24.0.0' it's seems pretty normal, so I thinks the bug is on 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:24.1.0' sorry  
I installed it via https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/playonlinux5-git/ which uses phoenicis-dist.zip. 
Oh I will. I just forgot that I am only using 1.7.10 for you mod.
STOP! Let's not get into any new triangulation schemes. These location problems have already been seriously thought about before. I am sorry I have not had time to catch up on all these old docs as of today, but hope to do this within next week. If you are interested in this, please have a deeper look in the various documents provided by @He3556.  
The log I can access does not state anything about the GUI crash. I dont have root so I cant backup my current config. I wished the config would be in the same directory as the log file (emulated/0/Android/data/...). After a crash, I open the app, the GUI is shown ("Loading...") and after loading the GUI crashes. But Syncthing runs normally in the background/foreground and my PCs connect to it. Anything else I can do while having no root? I can use ABD.

Will do in a bit, quite busy. 
Thanks. That info is helpful.  I'll see if I can track this down. 
@timtay-microsoft thanks for feedback. At Client side, I defined DeviceMethodCallback (in Java SDK):  Therefore, the parser (at Server) cannot parse this payload due to the backslashes. While the correct message should be: {      "status": 123,      "payload": {"abc": "xyz"} }
I'll submit a pull request with a test case (no fix, I'm affraid) next week. 
Thanks for the quick reply! Here is the code I'm using (sorry it's in Kotlin):   
Great. Thanks for looking into this! 
First, thank you for the quick response and the test case.  We could reproduce the problem by slightly modifying the test case in the pull request.  You just need to run update view after the 2-x objects are saved and before the 3-x objects are saved, which is what happens in normal syncing with the server (first, get the conflict state, update view, then get conflict resolution, update view).  We have an idea for a fix as well.  But that comes later...  Please re-open this issue after reviewing the new test case.

Some "Präsenzaufgaben" in the PGdP course are of the type "File Upload", but explicitly rule out submissions in the task description (ex.: [here](https://artemis.ase.in.tum.de/#/overview/37/exercises/789)), as the solution will be discussed on campus in the relevant class.  Thus, file submission is ruled out/disabled by the description, and the file type for the upload is set to "NICHT/MÖGLICH" (see [screenshot](https://pasteboard.co/IFjy9JB.png)). However, the file selector and "Browse" button are still available; clicking that button triggers the crash.
I don't recall if this happened when it was set to HTML or automatic, but it was definitely not plain text.  Thanks. 
Still the same error with newest commit.  i created a schema: "Test" i added a new attribute with type: double  created a new entity via ui-data-tab write NaN in the double field  (create a view for this attribute and then curl) 
> @svkr2k how are you creating and starting the workspace?  @tsmaeder , thank you for your question. I was able to open http://che-che.ip-address.nip.io and see the che dashboard. In the dashboard, i selected a stack from the list and clicked on Create workspace button to create the workspace.  Hope this helps. Thank you for looking into this. I would really be happy if i get a solution for the issue. I see the same issue described above using the version 7.0.0-rc-3.0 too. (Also, kindly add this to 7.0.0 milestone)
Thanks for your response. I am not sure which line of code of my program causes the exception because the exception stack trace doesn't show it, however, there is only one SELECT statement in the program. This happens only when the following line is present in the program: sparkConf.set("es.read.metadata", "true")  You mentioned that the document id is read anyway since the returned RDD is a PairRDD, but the result of SELECT statement is SchemaRDD[Row]. Can you please clarify about the PairRDD?  Thanks, Dmitriy Fingerman 
I"m using the default camera app (com.lge.camera).  The path that I am currently using for the SD card is: /storage/6264-3033/DCIM/Camera.  The path that is used by the internal card - and which Owncloud originally picked up automatically - is: /sdcard/DCIM/Camera.  I've tried both with no success.  It originally shipped with Android 7.  Thanks!

The game needs more and more memory, I don't know fixing this issue will completely fix it or if it is just contributing to it. I found the issue through a memory snapshot however, so it's not something minor. (view distance moderate = potentially `13*13*13` chunks = about 2000 = chunks, 50 frames per second would give 100000 entries per second. Each entry say 4 bytes would give 400 kbytes per second = 24 mbytes per minute = about 1.4 GB/hour, of coures maybe not all chunks may have reflection but still). 
@mhlopko As the first screenshot shows, 4 lines below red ERROR sign, I think gcc 5.2 is used.  How can I check which gcc is on PATH?
Oh really, I didn't dig any further, so I wasn't aware of this. Someone else in Discord was mentioning that they didn't want tickets overwriting their train properties, so I thought this wasn't a thing yet.
All 3 of those options sound good.  **A (very poor) example of the implementation in the configuration file:** 
Definitely a duplicate. Sorry guys! I reproduced it on my Windows 10 1903 VM after stumbling across this behavior on my production machine.

Oh, it works. Thank you! ;)
@tobiasKaminsky I did some further testing with a dedicated test account and found out that the root cause seems to be related to the use of an external WebDAV share. As soon as I mark files or folders as a favorite they got doubled. If I use a local file system everything works as expected. I'll send you a test account to android at nextcloud dot com asap.
No database selected is the error I get @serge-rider: "Query execution failed Reason: SQL Error [1046] [3D000]: (conn:187) No database selected Query is: Select * FROM ..."  At the dropdown to select a database there is one selected. If I open dropdown and click on same database again I can run the query. DBeaver seems to forget to call 'USE < database>' on startup.
     what field type did you have on the data in ES?  Most are keyword, but the source field is {"type":"text","analyzer":"analyzer_keyword","fielddata":true}      does that happen always on all fields or only on that single one?  I'm seeing it with every field I try. I first saw it with my top hosts widget, which is using source. If i do a 5 minute search and try doing quickvalues on various fields, all that I try will have random duplicate entries and the majority won't be sorted correctly.      is this reproducible at any time?  So far it is. 
Ya, looks like refreshing works.
That's great news thank you! Unfortunately have to wait for Spark to pick this up but at least it's fixed now.  If anyone is interested, the work around was to just convert to a hash set before passing over to Java. A HashSet immediately implements Set.  It's Nicholas Gates and nickgatzgates@gmail.com<mailto:nickgatzgates@gmail.com>.  Thanks again! 
You mean that the extension will not work with all the recent eclipse che versions, right? So only with 4.0.0-RCs (4.0.0-RC4-SNAPSHOT being the last commit on this repo) ? Are the releases versions synchronized? 
We've been running our patch :) I'll try yours and get back to you 
Yes, I'm aware of the Whatsapp and Gmail limitations with quick reply, but the feature disappears after a reboot in cases were it shouldn't (never in Textra and when a single message is showing in Whatsapp). Everytime I reboot the phone one of those apps will lose the QR functionality from your mod, sometimes is Whatsapp and sometimes Textra, seems random which one it is.  Sometimes rebooting again without doing anything restores the functionality in both apps, but most of the times it doesn't. I have to disable Xnotification, reboot; re-enable it, reboot. And sometimes even that doesn't do the trick. I often find myself rebooting 6+ times in order to get it to work.  I haven't found a pattern and it seems to be happening to other folks in the XDA forum as well. 
@heiko-braun I was not sure if they are related or not, that's why I posted the sencond issue just as comment and that led to creation of #4848. Anyway, tried to reproduce this issue (#4791) with todays install of syndesis and the exception is no longer there. Edit: the server pod is exception free, but when I tried to edit the integration and edit the OData connection in it, it just loads the connector forever and the whole syndesis is broken from that point.
Nope, it was all on 7594. I was testing it due to the calc being fixed. I'm back to 7378 again.

Deadly World generates a lot more spawners that do a bunch of things; one of them, for instance, will shot tons of arrows all around the place, and another one has got a "ghost zombie" standing on it. When you get near enough, the zombie "comes alive" and gets a primed TNT head to blow you up. That's how I died the second time ç_ç it also adds a crapton of silverfish nests everywhere, and that's how I died the first time...the pro to all this is that you get a reward, usually there's an interesting block in every silverfish nest and a chest under every spawner. Maybe I lost it in the darkness of the cavern, or in an adiacent cavern hidden by a wall. I'll test this further, although I'd rather not die (lol).

Can't easily tell as we can't go to version above 1.1.x without breaking the build due to the `ObjectId` been made final so we are stuck here until we find a work around for our `class EntityId extends ObjectId` thing or the Morphia devs _un-final_ it ;-P, in any case the offending line from `Mapper.toMongoObject()` is still there [now in line 616](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia/blob/r1.3.0-rc0/morphia/src/main/java/org/mongodb/morphia/mapping/Mapper.java#L616) and so is the `Mapper.getDBRefs()` which is unchanged so it would be quite safe to say it still happens.

I am not blaming spigot because all the other plugins managed to find a way to cancel event without it leaking somehow. I think this can be fixed in skript by trying a different method or changing the code. As for the items breaking, it is really easy to reproduce but just not clear exactly what causes it. If you cancel event of 2 items and then put 1 in your offhand, spam click both, then they will stop working properly and ignore the trigger. It will cancel event on these items for other irrelevant clicks. I think that's the easiest way to reproduce the second bug, all though I've done it without using offhand and sometimes doing nothing at all. 
@sunix I added error to the description.

Thanks for the quick response.  The thing is I love muCommander, and trying to make it fit my needs.  Where is the Jira page? Clicking "Report a bug" from muCommander (nightly build) leads to [this broken page](http://www.mucommander.com/bugs/) which redirects to the broken trac subdomain.  I encountered several issues, not sure if bugs or misuse on my part, like: - I was unable to make anything in commands.xml work. For example I tried making F4 open Sublime Text as editor with many variations on this line `<command alias="edit" value="C:\Program\ Files\Sublime\ Text\ 2\sublime_text.exe $f" type="system"/>` - On my Windows machine, right clicking a file has "Open With" which is always grayed out. Wanted to know how to add commands to this submenu - SFTP does not work for me. Using a passphrase protected private key. I am easily able to login using another client (WinSCP) but with muCommander I get invalid credentials. - Wanted to read a little more about commands.xml in order to add more commands to it (since muCommander suppresses the native Windows right click menu) - for example, wanted to add `Ctrl+Shift+V = send to VirusTotal`, and `Ctrl+D = Dos Prompt Here` - Wanted to suggest to add a "Cut" operation on a file in addition to copy and move - Wanted to suggest a preferences setting to suppress the Move dialog (always move to the other panel). - Wanted to suggest a "Duplicate File" operation, or even better, simply allow `Ctrl+C then Ctrl+V` and paste the file as `Original Name - Copy` or `Original Name (1)` or similar. Right now, copy-then-paste results in an error dialog.  And some more...   Footnote:   For now, I have solved the hotkeys / commands.xml problems I have above by simply writing a AutoHotkey script that overrides the commands I want - so F4 sends Alt+Shift+C to muCommander to copy the selected file path, and then I handle it in AutoHotkey. 
Thank you for your replying.   First, I checked error logs on my server after UltraSonic got errors. But there was no error but there were access logs like normal.   Next, I tried to access the url written in the logs.  Opened the album named in japanese (文化).  URL: `https://[address]/rest/getMusicDirectory.view?id=200000022&u=[username]&c=UltraSonic%2520for%2520Android&f=json&v=1.11.0&p=enc:[encoded password]`   Response:    Ampache returns results normally. But UltraSonic gets error. (I can listen songs named in japanese.)   I set artist, genre and other information on browser. So I think mp3-tag is not cause.

Well, I have the editor open, putting the cursor to arbitrary position reveals the outline to the right node. Thus, the locationmap must be valid somehow. But when I right-click and call getElementsAt it's empty for some reason. In other EMFText-generated editors the same scenario works as expected. With "between two parse runs" you mean just right before another parse run? I assume a parse run is only initiated as a consequence of ocurred changes, isn't it? In this case I must answer with no because I'm just selecting some text without changing something. 
@jdeolive Can you assist with ant-related issues? (I can help with the Windows-specific part.) I think a (quick) real-time troubleshooting session might be the most efficient way forward with this.

Hi Dejan,  I just tried again after a new full build of the workspace and I still have the same issue. I’m using plain docker. I double checked the containers and Artemis is running fine. Maybe i'm using wrong docker commands  These are mine docker commands: docker run -td --name kapua-sql -p 8181:8181 -p 3306:3306 kapua/kapua-sql docker run -td --name kapua-elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 elasticsearch:5.4.0 -Ecluster.name=kapua-datastore -Ediscovery.type=single-node -Etransport.host=_site_ -Etransport.ping_schedule=-1 -Etransport.tcp.connect_timeout=30s docker run -td --name kapua-broker-service -p 5672:5672 enmasseproject/activemq-artemis:2.2.0-1 docker run -td --name kapua-broker --link kapua-sql:db --link kapua-elasticsearch:es --link kapua-broker-service:service -p 1883:1883 -p 61614:61614 kapua/kapua-broker docker run -td --name kapua-console --link kapua-sql:db --link kapua-broker:broker --link kapua-elasticsearch:es --link kapua-broker-service:service -p 8080:8080 kapua/kapua-console docker run -td --name kapua-api --link kapua-sql:db --link kapua-broker:broker --link kapua-elasticsearch:es --link kapua-broker-service:service -p 8081:8080 kapua/kapua-api   P.S. I wasn’t able to build Kapua in the service events branch since maven was complaining about the path of the projects. The assembly broker is under assembly directory but the parent project was Kapua. I switched parent project to kapua-assembly and it built Kapua. I’m going to push this fix.

The previous issue is gone but now a new issue exists. The message states, "No '.java' file or non-empty source folder was selected in a valid module". I appreciate your development on this project. 
I tried both the following options:  1) **soot-trunk.jar & soot-infoflow.jar & soot-infoflow-android.jar** 2) **Up-to-date sootclasses-trunk-jar-with-dependencies.jar & soot-infoflow-android.jar**  And this is my config: Options.v().set_src_prec(Options.src_prec_apk); Options.v().set_output_format(Options.output_format_dex); Scene.v().addBasicClass("java.io.PrintStream",SootClass.SIGNATURES); Scene.v().addBasicClass("java.lang.System",SootClass.SIGNATURES);  It successfully instruments many apps and they work. But for this Wikipedia app, none of the buttons in the first screen of the instrumented app work.
@Valodim Sorry I haven't been keeping up; I haven't been getting GitHub's emails for some reason. I've forwarded it now, and thank you.
Uh oh, didn't try that, will keep you posted by tomorrow. 
No cache, and of course I waited. Apps like side bars (home flip, side bar etc.). For those apps it's not a big deal since they need to know which apps are installed in order to do their work, but if they can do it even if they have been restricted some others can as well. 
Correct me If I'm wrong. Each sticker or filter is added to the rootView as a layer. Then when I'm changing the source bitmap in order to for example change bitmap contrast, it won't be able to make changes to the rootView and this will cause the error I'm facing. Anyhow, I want to save all changes together. Any solution?
Upon logging into that Windows 10 machine directly, I was immediately able to reproduce the issue without Remmina being involved.  The issue only happens with one of the tabs I have open, as though it was somehow corrupted at the time of tab-initialization in manner that persist this behavior for the life of that particular tab.  Right now, as I create new tabs, they are not exhibiting this behavior. But I have not yet closed that tab shown in the video, and that tab still exhibits the same behavior as shown in the video (even now -- logged directly into the workstation with physical mouse, keyboard and monitor).  Perhaps this is just a rare-weirdness, but I thought I'd report it anyway in case you might be able to conceive a cause of this strange behavior.

I got this error in android 4.4.4 
David, so far I didn't see this problem in simple projects. I will examine the project structure of the projects I've seen in detail tomorrow and will try to distill the relevant settings into a small test project.  What struck me as strange here is that obviously Infinitest manages to actually run the tests and displays the correct result color in the Infinitest bar. The trouble only seems to begin when it tries to propagate the test failure information into the marker view...   These projects (and their structures) probably have been touched by dozens of developers over the years and I would not be surprised if they only work by accident :-o So I'll try to investigate a bit further on that end.

Yes, I can confirm that this fixed the problem with the Oregon rain sensor. Thanks! 
Hello Thomas,  Thank you for your answer. Yes, you were right, "just" start-order issues, but unfornately Binding is still unfunctional. I have cleaned all items and sitemap files. I left only relevant items to this binding in items files:    I have had no error in openhab.log in debug mode. With tcpdump between asterisk and openhab server I still saw communication, bud no state change happened if I had a call in Asterisk.  Do you have any advice where can be a problem? 
The String with '_' is creating at this line https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/16b72a55a451f796222a2828f9a27dac39c1802f/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/utils/Json.java#L994  "type == String.class"    I tried to reproduced but dint work because its using the first compiler. I guess it happens when its using the 2nd compiler that reproduce '__r' variables.  Edit: is there flag to force 2nd compiler only ? 
in the second screenshot we can notice that there is a little thunder icon added close to each transformation. If I click on the mapping, there is an empty transformation field.  but... I cannot reproduce today 
Interesting. The CPU waste seems to be reduced, but there are still too much increase of *_seconds_count counter. Before (with default settings) the increment was too high by factor of 5k, With your settings there is only 5%.
There is no crash log. Additionally, it happened again. 
I haven't looked through the enunciate code, but I would think the parameter type (InputStream) would be the most relevant thing to look at.  Can you read the method signatures or just the annotations? 
I wonder if Spring Boot could do more if there was also a programmatic way to receive those events outside of just logging them. Perhaps then if the `ActionMovieRepository` bean can't be injected we could check for those evens and provide a failure analyzer to point it out.  I imagine one reason that the log gets missed is because it's superseded by an actual exception. My initial instinct would be to start with the stacktrace, rather than to think about hunting backwards in the logs for other messages.

This was just with the recognition tab. I tried with various images/traineddata. The program window just disappears without any dialogue. I later found the error logs in the directory where the jar file is.  I will test again later and report. 
After further testing I've found it happens when legacy mode is enabled.

No, I didn't. How do you think these things are related? 
something like this: milestone(V1.8.x) ~status(closed) btw, I never defined which status labels are considered open/closed for this repo. May be this repo doesn't have a label that HubTurbo expects to see? 
I pulled the lasted commits from the master branch, so I'm guessing 1.2.7.  
Thanks @lilgreenbird , i will be updating the version to 7.4.1 and observe the system for 2 to 3 days and let you know the status back.

Hi,  I don't know how to reproduce it as it just happened.  I wanted to fix  the embedded newline issue and downloaded the latest source but run into  a number of failed test-cases.  I run on a windows 7 system using  cygwin.  There is no locale set that I am aware of. System is dutch.   Cygwin probably englisch.  I fixed it by changing the line to: Assert.assertEquals(DateFormatUtils.format(Calendar.getInstance(),  "MMMMM dd, yyyy",new Locale("fr","CA")),  localeAndFormatNowFunction.replaceByValue("{@function:now('fr_CA','MMMMM  dd, yyyy')}"));  The error I got was that the date: "avril" didn't match "april". April  is the same in both dutch as english.  Hope this helps.

No, I was on the go. I suspect there was some problem downloading, or maybe some momentary down time. Should just catch and retry a couple of times, in my opinion 
That was the first thing I checked, and they were set correctly. The guest users are actually coming from another Azure AD Tenant which itself is configured to do single sign-on with an ADFS directory. I'm sure that I don't expect you to be able to fully support this, but wondering if there's a way that I can capture the claims coming back to send to you for investigation?
This was only a backup restore issue. d8aa5dc01a299008b88da22785ef8ae4660e79ce correctly fixes it. Indeed I regained access to all coins. Cheers !

Try to move the map and wait a few seconds. Inside a building (without GOS connection) it's ok.  Try it outside with GPS connection. If you move the map the text changes to "send selected location" now wait a few seconds without touching the screen.  The text changes to "send my current location".

I am running Android 2.3.7 (Cyanogenmod 7) on a Motorola Defy. It has an SD Card.  I have many other feeds on my list and all of them work. This one used to work but some months ago it stopped. I think it is something related to AntennaPod because I have another Android device (an Acer tablet) and I installed AntennaPod and inserted this same feed and it worked fine. I have already tried to remove the feed and add it again but the problem remained. I still have not tried to uninstall AntennaPod and reinstall it because I have a lot of downloaded podcast episodes.  I saved a logfile with aLogcat and posted on http://pastebin.com/KeUVdnJ4  In this log, I tried to update the feeds, and after that, to download an episode. I think this caused the errors on lines 907 and 938 of the log.  Thank you,  Renato. 
Yeah, it does. This examples does real time updates http://www.flotcharts.org/flot/examples/realtime/index.html, it could be modified and use to test this bug by adding more points to draw (doing 300 points at 818 px).

Yes it does 
yeah that's what i was looking for... or perhaps maybe the error message could just say that ('use /tardis home to update the "home" destination")  Anyway that's not one of the things I''d have tried, I tried all sorts of variations of "set" or "remove" as the command to get around to this, I would not have suspected "/tardis home" would have been a command to set the home... but more likely to access a home.  And while it may have been on the command page, that page omits so many of the commands I'm usually needing or looking for, it doesn't even occur to me to check it anymore. 
I am new with docker, so I am still exploring the world there.  I just finished some tests, and when you use [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/) if the VM crashes, boot2docker will destroy the folder somehow and we loose all data that was in it.   For example:    The doc has some line written about it, but it doesn't say that is not persistent so I didn't think at that moment it is was important, maybe an explicit warning for the windows7 users on the doc would be useful ? Something under "Usage" or "Start" section ?  Thank you for your help, %userprofile% gave me a hint that made my day.  Next step, Rule the world (of Eclipse Che at least)  :)
Thank you for the update to the PGT definition in the GATKVCFHeaderLines.   If the possible discordance of the GT and PGT in at least 1 genotype in  7%  of the phased variants  is a feature and not a bug then I am not understanding the PGT field correct.   For example why is GT and PGT concordant for the genotypes of  93% of the phased variants? Anf if PGT  will only ever be heterozygous, then why are there PGT fields with the value 1|1, both concordant and discordant with the GT field?  Thank you for the extra clarification. A link to documentation describing the PGT whould also be very helpful.    PGT 1|1 concordant with the genotype field

(actually, it's your OAuthManager that's starting the AuthenticationActivity, not WebAuthProvider as you stated).   We have not yet figured out the steps to reproduce the crash. There must be some condition in restoring the activity state that's leading to the NPE.   Regardless of how it's happening, your library should handle the error - not crash. The fact that your launchAuthenticationIntent() will do "nothing" if the bundle is null is another problem. It's called lack of error handling. It would be preferable if you could properly handle the null bundle and recover gracefully, otherwise a simple NP check would at least stop it from crashing.  BTW, the crash is happening across all devices and Android versions 4-7  Lastly, telling customers that their efforts to identify and fix bugs in your software is 'nonsense' is pretty unprofessional. 
嗯，demo那边做不出来，代码片段大概如下 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16357470/57667415-f955ba00-7635-11e9-8026-160c1d57d035.png) 
Its on tags.put(parts[0], (parts.length == 2 ? (parts[1]) : null)); For example: String line = "@color=;display-name=Gamerboy2424;emotes=34:0-8;subscriber=0;turbo=0;user-type= ";  When there is no value for a key, we gonna add null. Wich is normaly right for the value, but Google doesnt't like null value ;) Normaly @color should result in value =null  Example Stacktrace [main] INFO org.pircbotx.InputParser - @color=#FF0000;display-name=Elosatandoxy;emotes=;subscriber=1;turbo=0;user-type=mod :elosatandoxy!elosatandoxy@elosatandoxy.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #grossie_gore :merci [main] ERROR org.pircbotx.PircBotX - Exception encountered when parsing line @color=#FF0000;display-name=Elosatandoxy;emotes=;subscriber=1;turbo=0;user-type=mod :elosatandoxy!elosatandoxy@elosatandoxy.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG #grossie_gore :merci java.lang.NullPointerException: null value in entry: emotes=null     at com.google.common.collect.CollectPreconditions.checkEntryNotNull(CollectPreconditions.java:33)     at com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap.entryOf(ImmutableMap.java:135)     at com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap$Builder.put(ImmutableMap.java:206)     at org.pircbotx.InputParser.handleLine(InputParser.java:309)     at org.pircbotx.PircBotX.startLineProcessing(PircBotX.java:388)     at org.pircbotx.PircBotX.connect(PircBotX.java:337)     at org.pircbotx.PircBotX.startBot(PircBotX.java:187) 
It does always happen, I've tried multiple times on the same world and multiple times on multiple fresh saves. I cannot reproduce without any other mods installed.
File -> Recent editors  I just have database navigator. Closed project explorer view and dont use anymore.  Connect to a database from database navigator by expanding it. Then open editor as said above
can i use Utube? I'm going to make it 我可以使用Utube 视频吗？
I don't think so unless you have changed anything. It was Java language, clean Sonar without additional plugins. Docker version with H2 database migrated into container.
Yes. Add a @MapperScan to your main application class pointing to a dummy interface. That will register a MapperFactoryBean:    If a MapperFactoryBean is detected autoscan is not done. 
When creating a new plot, the selector says at default: Height dependant: False; but it still goes based on height and isn't bedrock to sky, which is what I assume it means.

Hey @ilayaperumalg Let me clarify a little bit.   When viewing the Job Executions via the UI or via the shell it shows a `Step Executions Count`. So when I create a composed task and launch it, for example :  The `Step Executions Count` for both job executions will be 4. Hope that clarifies it a bit.

Hey, we tested with `4.2.2-Snapshot` and got a NullPointerException:   
@machour you can go ahead and take care of it if you dont mind.
Just got a similar crash with a different mod set after adding environmental tech and base metals (and their dependencies).  Might be an issue with one of those two mods (I'd guess environmental tech... maybe a conflict with their basalt?).  I'll try a couple tests.  [crash-2016-07-22_16.24.11-client.txt](https://github.com/Chisel-Team/Chisel/files/379002/crash-2016-07-22_16.24.11-client.txt) [latest.log.txt](https://github.com/Chisel-Team/Chisel/files/379004/latest.log.txt) 
Done. The test now passes.   I made the following change to the dependency section of my build file to test your change:    Thanks for your astonishingly quick response. My co-workers were quite impressed with your how quickly you fixed this.  
@serge-rider  Thank you for your reply! my database is TiDB which is support Mysql protocol.  and the dbeaver went normally at the begining. I think i have some setting problem of the dbeaver, but even if i reinstall the dbeaver, there is still exits the same problem.
Merged into develop.
For postgres the config was preserved, for mysql/mariadb lost
@justinedelson  Did something change? We have sources available for 1.7.4 and prior?  ![index_of__nexus_content_groups_public_com_adobe_acs_acs-aem-commons-content_1_7_4_](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1451868/4924298/2057516a-6522-11e4-863a-ce71dfd60207.png)  Also, we should keep this open to get the 1.8.0 javadocs onto the GH site. 
I do.  I've had a quick look at `adb logcat` while this is happening.  I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I see something like the following repeated many times a few seconds before the list finally poplates:  
`class MainActivity : MviActivity<MainView, MainPresenter>(), MainView`
It happens on every video i download, even when the video is 60fps.
Now it is back. Haven't done anything since my last try. Really don't know the reason. It was persistent after a reboot, after installing different versions etc. – and now it works again. :( 
@l0rd I suppose the issue is that we're currently not generating the zip file and instead getting it directly from github. If you download and extract the zip for Che master, it'll be in the `<repo>-<branchname>` form. I can update the PR to instead do a git checkout and zip that, but it's a fair bit of added complexity. 
I uploaded it from a windows client on my laptop. My server is ubuntu. 
Sadly no.

Yes, I checked it during installation and it's in the Users PATH: C:\Program Files\DPF Manager. Also added the path to the SYSTEMS PATH but that did not work either. Perhaps the JRE did not recognize the updated PATH ??? A restart / new login might be required but I am just guessing.  EDIT: cannot be the JRE - forgot, that it is a vbs script running there..... 
I am running the market release from 5/24 on both HTC Evo 4g & Motorola Xoom tablet. The problem occurs on both. I don't believe it is the same problem as #1651, but I think can't say for sure. I am not running the calendar add on on either.

It was necessary to exclude org/w3c/dom/Document from class loading. That solved issue. Thanks!
I could do that, but it most likely depends heavily on client's machine, slower computer = bigger lag = bigger detection (?). So the value that is right for me might be bad for someone else.
I gave it the whole directory. I moved the schemas to the src/main/resource/schema directory and then used this configuration:

fine with the title changing.. but the only reason I restart the docker desktop is because the che stops working. if i go: http://che-che.161.44.255.0.nip.io, browser will try load the page and eventually timeout, then retry again, and again...
I guess my inclination would be to not download it and just have it populate the no data so we skipped it thing that you do for empty files right now.  Morteza, what do you think? 
It works now, thank you!
Yeah I updated a bit too soon. Unfortunately, I have only tested this on Android since my project is Android only. I ended up finding a solution with a bridge and native code in the end.  react-native 56 uses Android API 26 for builds, this could be the issue?  I'll be waiting for that react-native 56 support though =).
I apologize: You are right. I have been expecting a different behavior (i.e. the marked folders being listed way further towards the top of the list) - this went so far, that I didn't even notice the most bottom folder moving up one position. I guess, that if it was easy to implement a "free" folder sort order, you'd already have done this. Once again sorry for the noise and thanks for this great piece of software!
Hi @lvca,  I think I am missing something... My dataset is in GraphSon format thus the edges are represented like: `{"_id":1315003,"_type":"edge","_outV":62550035,"_inV":14823714,"_label":"/color/red/"}`  Are you suggesting to modify all the entries to be like `... ,"_label":"`/color/red/`"}` ?  Thanks, 
Yes，glad to
STT service was provisioned and model was created a couple of days ago, Watson SDK I am using the latest stable 3.8.0. Can I get SDK snapshot using Maven or do I have to download? Sounds like something worth trying.
Ah, I thought we didn't allow non-denotable types in Type.string, but it seems we do.

Ah, there is a difference. I totally did not notice that.  Firstly, I though that if there is a difference in that topic, then it should be related with `RetryClient`. What you said is difference between `ClientBuilder` and `HttpClientBuilder`. I am not sure still about on it.  Anyway, I will happily prepare for that PR.
Yes it does, it will send and I'll ask recipients for confirmation in a separate txt. They won't get a pic that's sent with the camera button but will when selected from the gallery.  On another note, I think it's just 'hanging' when sending, because people are now saying they're getting my pics twice. At least anyone that I tried sending both ways with. 
Manually.
here it is: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arthurvaverko/e0553b33fdb5b75cb14421a478b6e773/raw/2178716904435108912513e7cd57537009ef2ad8/Task.Service.json  i must say i have used the pet store swagger and it was imported fine, i suspec its using the "host" property but it is not mandatory, i would think it should use the Title or at least add some default text to the application name like (untitled) so it can be accessed and changed using the UI
it breaks things we depend on for bluegenes. I can with with beta if needed.

@sijie Sure.

This was  unfortunate copy-paste typo when I wanted to show on simplest possible example where in real I was experiencing it on different set of loggers. Sorry for thath. The problem is still there, after correcting to `org.springframework`. As described in the issue description, the same configuration logs on INFO level (where it shouldn't) when deployed to external tomcat, but doesn't log on INFO when the identical war is run in the embedded tomcat. That doesn't sound like typo error. 
The official Barcode Scanner android app does not work. It is the same as pictured above. I did however install the released Glass barcode scanner application they have (https://github.com/zxing/zxing/releases/tag/BSGlass-0.2.1) and that works and can be called via Intent.  Apologies for any wasted time. It would be cool if y'all made your project compatible for Glass projects too since they have the library done ;)  Thanks for your time!

@saudet  (This comment was updated because I was mistaken)  Original video size is 854. Size of the picture from **ffmpeg** program 854 also and it is with out black line.  If not using **setImageWidth** in `FFmpegFrameGrabber` (leave video width 854) the picture contains black line If Im setting with - 1  image is fine and not containing black line... (with width - 2 picture also fine)  So seems like the problem not with odd values... And seems like changing width to any value, fix this problem somehow.
I am normally keeping files in source folder. Files can be seen in web UI. In app removing them locally and re-downloading helped. But there are lot of images which doesn't show up in Android app and I don't want to remove and re-download them it will take lots of time. Can you please find a way to detect those files and automatically re-download them ?
I don't think the issue is with the priority between powers, the issue is that Time Eddy+ runs the power's atEndOfTurn callback twice without the action queue getting cleared in between; normally the actions queued as part of the powers callback would remove that power before the next turns end happens
Ill change the rotation when I get off work and Let you know.

Thanks for the info. We added a workaround to fix the issue. Let me have a try with the new version. Thanks 
Hello,  I encountered two problems regarding rollback with the latest changes:  - (I encountered this only once, but it stopped whole rollback) - probably a timing issue only as I never see that again  
@pocmo Where is `prepareFocusWebkitDebugDependencies` dependency from? Is this related with gecko?
Hi @smillidge   Tried to put a minimal example together which reproduces the problem, but haven't succeeded yet 🤦🏻‍♂️  I've checked all the JARs in the app where it's not working, and the only one I can find which includes a version of asm is groovy. However, when I include the same dependency in the example everything starts up fine.  One other difference between the broken app and the working example attempt is that the former uses a custom domain.xml. I'll have a go at including that in the example app next week and see if the error pops up then.  As always, your help and thoughts are very much appreciated 😊  Will get back to you when I know more.  Cheers, C

Of course, I have it running on my server consistently, so I will always get firsthand experience regarding what is and isn't working properly. 
uploaded manually :( 
Currently I don't have one because it didn't work so far so I abandoned this thing.  e.g., for using sprintf and sscanf  stdio.h would have to be #included (or it shoudn't work).  But IF they are needed and stdio.h had been  #included - then  all ANSI standard features also should have to be provided (e.g., float formatting).  In case a nano user would not like to have these full features but just some basic ones he should have to #include a different smaller lib  - let's call it nanoio.h, feat. a  sprintf_nano derivative of smaller memory claims (this argument was often heard when talking about the "full features".  For .h and .c files I just don't see how to save or open such a file in the Editor window additionally in an additional tab window.  I can't write code and save it to a file named "myHeader.h",  and if my current dir contains 2 files, e.g. SDfgetsDemo.ino ANSItools.h I can't even find the header file listed using the file_open menu.  And If I currently start Sketch I get a program "BareMinimum" pattern. If I designed it to be a header then I can't "save_as" by a name like myheader.h or ANSItools.h.  That's roughly what it is about. 
@nicolas-raoul The main problem with doing that is, what do we return as the value of `Single<JSONObject> getRevertRespObjectSingle()` in the case of `client.newCall(request).execute();` timing out? The function is `@NonNull` so it will not be as simple as returning null. Certainly still doable but would take more time and going through more of the code.
I am using leiningen plugin that runs the native-image binary, and that spits out the configuration, so I'll c/p it here below (despite large classpath, I'm only importing basic jars).    anything out of the ordinary?
Yup, we run with DEBUG logs enabled at the moment.
Ah yes - it did seem that xcode was the issue!   Running `xcode-select --install` worked for me.  Thanks for the help
when I use IDEA to debug Scala or Node, I never saw this issue. so I think this may be a issue for Golang plugin. 
Logs are spammed with two warnings:  https://pastebin.com/imsZS2r3   Only config change I made was to the header/footer and those look like this:  https://pastebin.com/Xqd1NwGS
@nik9000, I will get that once it returns to a failed state again. 
The important part of the pom I think is this:       <plugin> 		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> 		<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId> 		<configuration> 			<executable>true</executable> 		</configuration> 	</plugin>   It creates an executable jar which brings the BOOT-INF structure: BOOT-INF/classes/cassandra/migration  I think supplying multiple paths instead of just one would resolve the issue.  Here's the jar format: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html

No, this happened only once and I do not know which steps leaded to it. 
The issue is solved
Good to hear. No problem at the meantime I use those without WITH_ACK_RECEIPT. But although without such ack, if I send it with RELIABLE, I have no need and it's alright to operate with _WITH_ACK_RECEIPT if I don't do anything after another end ACK back?  On a side, could you please point me out to JRakNet documentation? I can find only simple demo code that client/server connects with each other but not send/receive any packets. I might miss something. Thank you Marf!

I figured the actual problem, I was wrong. It just won't show up in the thaumonomicon, even though it will function properly. (the recipes show up in the thaumatorium) They will also unlock properly.  This is the place, down until the end of the file. https://github.com/Frontrider/thaumic_arcana/blob/eb2b981739e0117d39d51d81d1e0b49446c0d23e/src/main/java/hu/frontrider/arcana/registrationhandlers/recipes/AlchemyRecipes.kt#L433  It creates a set of recipes,that changes the nbt of the specified item. (the aspect list is associated with the nbt)  Tried adding a set of "fake" crucible recipes (that would actually be desireable in this case) but they will not show up either.

It's a limitation of the browse, not the appbuilder.  For a variable or expression displayed without @  the column is added but it has NAME = ? . When walking the widget-tree of the browser it's not possible to identify those columns.  If `myvariable @ myvariable` is used the column widget name will be "myvariable". 
The reason I'm removing / adding back the scrollbar from the viewgroup is because I never was able to just hide it (neither setVisibility(GONE) nor setScrollBarHidden(false) works for me). So the crash occurs after I removed the view once, then simply try to add it back to the same parent. Simple call to View.remove() and View.add(). Nothing fancy here.

Hi Tobias I send test credential to e-mail
@Bananeweizen  I agree, that this OOM is basically the same memory leak as mentioned in #3778. Shall we close this issue then? 
I don't understand your point, but moved initialization under if(super.connect(...)).  I just want to make it clear. Two threads want to send a message. 1. They call `sendMessage()` method on object which is `GelfTCPSSLSender` instance.  `GelfTCPSSLSender` class doesn't have method `sendMessage()`, so call goes to method `sendMessage()` in `GelfTCPSender` class of object which is GelfTCPSSLSender instance.  2. in method `sendMessage()` has check whether it is connected or not. (in our case it's not) 3. then happens synchronization for method `connect()` 4. in `connect()` method of `GelfTCPSSLSender` object we are trying to test connection one more time. It happens under synchronization, and if connection was established, no double initialization of `sslEngine` field wouldn't happen.
Yes, of course I added the new dependecy to my pom.xml and I don't have any compilation errors in my application  The count delivers the number of 166 documents...

Ah whoops. Forgot the attachment. I'll take a look when I get home and provide info, plus the attachment itself (@philipwhiuk). 
What I meant is, it's not just group graph patterns that are affected, but if the second group was replaced by, say, `OPTIONAL { BIND (?a AS ?b) }`, it shows the same problem (or so I seem to remember—haven't tried it again now).  It may well be specific to `BIND`.

Made an issue for the IntentReceivers: https://github.com/inaturalist/iNaturalistAndroid/issues/356
Discussion during [Ehcache weekly dev meeting - 8 January 2015](https://plus.google.com/events/c7lgves3acscvgr9l075240rrmg) led to the conclusion that (at least) all declared failed keys should be invalidated in `Store` so, whether or not the write via `CacheWriter` was successful, the next `Ehcache.get` access to any value declared failed will yield the value from the store-of-record.  Converting this issue to a BUG. 
Ah—it works when it's set. Same with the same project-level attribute. So, closing.
So, after doing some more testing, I think I have a better idea of what happened. I typically run during testing with the screen off to save battery power, which puts the activity to sleep. However, when the USB comms interruption occurred and the FTDI to disappeared and then reappeared in quick succession, Android sent the USB attach intent to the activity, waking it back up (while the screen was still off), which called `onStart()` and thus triggered restart of the event loop. This, I think, is another good reason to remove the event loop restart from `onStart()` as mentioned in #11 - the activity should just be a front-end for the service; activity lifecycle events should not impact the service.

@md678685 I actually don't experience this with soul sand. Interestingly enough, I was able to confirm that the grass path needs to be in a chunk that is not currently loaded. If the path that you're warping to _is_ currently loaded, then it works as expected.  @vemacs I don't have any earlier builds to test with at the moment, but I'll look into it this evening. 
That was fast, thanks :) 
Sure, give me a little. My client is custom and in c++ so It was easy to modify to misbehave. I should be able to provide a mock using vertx only tomorrow. Thank you for the prompt reply.

@hhclam apologies, should have added that before.  Repro requires setting up a cache server, and then introducing an error in a c++ file, then attempting to build.  Callstack here:   
Sorry, we don't have enough resources to make a pull request. As workaround, could you please provide possibility set custom cashe to storage GlobalIdPK?  Provide method to set custom cache by interface when we build Javers object and make public method to get this cashe?  Like this: *interface Cache {* *// .. methods* *}*  *Cache  customCache = new CustomCacheImpl();* *JaversBuilder.javers().setCache(customCache).build();*

So our application has to hold the reference to the OrientGraphFactory? 
So basically the problem is with the Grpc Server that is setup with Dagger (client initiating compression works fine). A very basic simple example would be a server, taken from the Dagger article (https://dagger.dev/grpc/servers.html):   But because `dagger.grpc.server.ProxyServerCallHandler.ServerCallAdapter` is not delegating the `setCompression` call, compression never happens. Solution is simple: `delegate.setCompression(...)`
@macdonst, I sent two push notifications to the app. The first one with notId=0 and the last one with notId=1. When I tapped the first notification sent (notId=0), the push.on(’notification’) function was called with notId=1. The other notification also had disappeared from status bar. This only happend in Android. Thanks!

One character of my password is the ^ symbol. I already assumed that this may influence the problem. So I ran some test. I created a new vault and set the password to 123^1 Then I could reproduce the same behaviour as I mentioned before. I'm running Cryptomator under macOS 10.11.6 (15G1217). I tried the same on a Windows 7 machine and could NOT reproduce this problem.   I tested a second case where I set the password to 123^ so that the ^ symbol was the last character. This time I didn't have any problem unlocking the vault. The only weird thing was that some time I need to press the space key to get the ^ symbol and some times Cryptomator added it without pressing the space key. This behaviour wasn't changing after a restart of Cryptomator. 
 
@tobiasKaminsky Test account created and credentials just sent via Email.  Interestingly, the problem does not occur with the test account! I am confused.  Hmm... my own user was a fresh one, I did not import any backup which could have imported old problems...  The difference is only that the test user does not have admin rights.
I'm using git version 1.7.9.5 The problem is dirty itself works as a command on git. It doesn't reflect on the properties file using the plugin which is the weird part.

The only way to change my name that I know of is going to Mojang's website and I only did that once. My name was not Gumball when I created my Minecraft account a long time ago. I changed it to Gumball a few months ago and never touched it again. Is this the only way to get this error? Because if it is, then I think there's a bug.

I didn't modify anything on the database  I'm currently not able to test/check (i'm away)  
Oddly, OVM doesn't even ask for the Location permission (Android 7.0). Doesn't move either.  I don't know how to use logcat but I'll take a look at it, thanks.  Just wanted to say it's awesome you released this as it means I can finally break free from HappyCow :)
Yes. Content and Apps were installed. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3184018/75188077-5bcd0200-5700-11ea-998d-655f4108a196.png) 
No problem. This code definitely needs some serious thinking about proper refresh conditions.   
In many case, a .exe file is just a self-extracting .zip file. In these case, we prefer to extract it as it was a zip file. It is quicker, cleaner, and more user friendly (silent interface).

That's probably a good option. 
I don't know about develop, as I don't currently have my environment up, but I can reproduce this on dvn-build, dataverse-internal, and demo. Hopefully that's enough to conclude we have a problem somewhere.
It happened with the IAM outage earlier this week, in `/var/log/auth.log` it shows `aws-ec2-ssh` deleting all the users during the outage. Perhaps IAM returned 200 and an empty list while it was still recovering?  Nonetheless, this is still a case we have to consider.

Yes, only 3.6.9 3.6.6 works fine 
It is set to internal storage. i.e. not on the sdcard but in the private storage of the app itself.

@ddementieva Hi. There are no logs in the IDE. As you can see on my last edition, the Processes windows stays empty.  Please, tell me if you need something more. 
I don't know if I have followed your indications right, but still launches exception.  ![Captura de pantalla 2020-01-24 a las 9 30 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10059639/73055127-5d4ea480-3e8c-11ea-9f15-88305435cf9f.jpg)   BTW I added a second PS to the original post.

Hi,   Apologies for the late reply.   As soon as I check out the code (2.0.0 tag) and I follow the instructions, then the I get the stack trace that I posted. 
Wow that was so simple! Yes that should solve the problem. I have one more question if you don't mind. Since I couldn't find any help that day, I decided to use this inefficient line:    And it's working nicely. I haven't seen any issues yet. Plus I also found `replace()` be faster than using `replaceAll()` with a regex pattern. Is there still any other reason I should not go with my method?

@akarnokd Thank you. This was a test to make sure we buffer a lot of data and thought of informing the team. We want to buffer in case of back pressure and not lose data. Would the default onBackpressureBuffer() do that? The documentation doesn't mentioning about dropping beyond capacity but in the code it looks like the capacity is 128 and will drop after that.
Yes it is indeed "AutoUpload", just the directory on my nextcloud is called "InstantUpload". I don't know what a logcat is, if you let me know I will try to provide.
It says it is an NullPointerException, but then its an obfuscated class name in my package namespace.  "Attempt to read from field 'com.me.kG com.me.lj.ᐝ' on a null object reference"

That bug only happened in the past, when I didn't have imported a testnet adress yet. Just after I did that, I was able to change the password. And I didn't do any reinstalling process until now. 
No, nothing to speak of. One thing that I know we are using is HandleBars.js templates in our production javascript files. To be able to test these using jasmine, we are using jasmine-fixtures.js (calling loadFixtures('template.tmpl'). In our specs. Is it possible that this could cause an issue? Frankly, I am in the dark about this as well. I am still pretty lost as to why we are getting such strange coverage numbers....

Nop.
its set to stop all entities. ill take a picture as soon as i get home 
I opened https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/issues/216 for this.   The actual problem seems to be that the files are not included in the master branch of TM4E (but are defined in `plugin.xml`).
To test your suggestion I made `WallpaperEngine.sketch` package private and modified `PWallpaper.onDestroy()` to this:   When 'Select wallpaper' is tapped for the first time, the app crashes. The crash begins with a `NoSuchArgumentExeption` thrown by `android.view.Display` looking for a `getRawWidth` method, that escalates into an `IllegalArgument` exception (not sure what throws it) that then stops the app. Restarting the app from the 'has stopped' dialog then starts the wallpaper as soon as the desktop becomes visible. With the live instance running, opening the selector anew and setting wallpapers no longer crashes the app. I also never got more than three animation threads existing at the same time this way, which is an improvement.  Crashing while starting the live engine implies that `onDestroy()` gets called before the live instance is set up and that at least some parts of the preview sketch are required to do this. That it only happens the first time a wallpaper is selected implies, that this is a special occasion (I may be fixated on this, but I couldn't fail to observe that this is the only time where `mActiveEngines.size()` is below two). 
The light on my camera did stay on. I was trying to stop the camera source and it crashed. I was not deleting the camera source. 
Hi james. Thanks for looking into it.  In hopes that this doesnt cause you too much work..  Clone https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-dependencies  Set this to the snapshot version https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-dependencies/blob/master/elasticsearch/pom.xml  Run this https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-dependencies/blob/master/elasticsearch/src/test/java/zipkin/storage/elasticsearch/http/ElasticsearchV2DependenciesTest.java  Note this uses docker!  If this is too much I can try to isolate a test given an example test case for things like this.

Hi @robfrank ! I try version 2.2.-beta2.  Incorrect example  public static Number getSequence(Connection connection, String seqName) {         Number nextValue = null;         String query = String.format( "select sequence('%s').next()", seqName );         try {             Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();             ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery( query );             if ( rs.next() ) {                 nextValue = rs.getLong( "sequence" );             }         }         catch (SQLException sqle) {             throw log.cannotExecuteQuery( query, sqle );         } catch (OCommandExecutionException oe) {                         throw log.sequenceNotExists( seqName, oe );                 }         return nextValue;     }  Unfortunately, answer to your question is: see classes Statemet,ResultSet, PrepareStatement  P.S.  It is not critical for me. But ....it is JDBC contract 
The issue still happen for this version. I don't think sample data will cause this issue.  The issue is most likely related to concurrency.   you can try to run the following query with 50 or 100 times in concurrently. I'm sure you will have this issue.    BEGIN  LET user = INSERT INTO user SET about = "test"  COMMIT  RETURN $user 
Thanks for that. Have downloaded the latest snapshot 2.2-20170124.213832-138, and this problem (overwriting of the config, no matter what the edit) is fixed.  One item that users should be aware of: if the _settings.json is not the **exact** format expected (e.g. the username and password in the wrong place, even if it is correct json format) then the fscrawler appears not to recognize and will still prompt to overwrite the entire file. 
@philwebb Yes, I can confirm that workaround works (though I need to explicitly specify the `value` in the `@Component` annotation). Or one can just define the mocks as done pre-1.4 in a test configuration. 
No, it does not go away. I don't have the device with me, so I cannot cite the error msg, but it was samething like "attachment ..../cache/... does not exist".  To check it yourself, you could try disabling your internet, sharing a file with blitzmail, (stopping blitzmail) and cleaning its cache, starting blitzmail and internet, and you should get the error.  Thanks and greetings.

I confirm, azaelcarreral is describing the same issue. 
There's no magic so far: Here the menu button in the header:    Checked the code of MaterialSideNav but I don't understand it yet. I don't see where I could hook in the debugger in chrome to see why it invokes the close anyhow.  I tried to set the property as well on initialisation phase in code: `rightSideNav.setCloseOnClick(false);` But debugging this showed that it doesn't have an effect at all. The property within the MaterialSideNav isn't used anymore, it is only used on Initialization. So manipulating this doesn't have any effect later on. This might as well be a small issue but isn't this one here as I have the property set as well in the markup. 
I have tested this in my emulator and actual device. So far, I have tested it in 7.0, 6.0. I am going to try to reproduce the problem in the app where the toast padding is correct to see if my theory that the activity theme has something to do with the padding. 
> Currently I'm not planning to work on `test-setup.sh`, but I could quick-fix this (e.g. display warning message, ignore error). That'd let the test succeed -- failing to zip up the undeclared outputs is arguably a nuisance but no fatal flaw. How does that sound?  Sounds good to me. :)

Oh blast it, sorry about that, 2.1 RC5. 
Also I think refresh time probably should be calculated based on ttl instead of lease duration (or creation_ttl).  For example, if you create a token using:    The ttl value is always decreasing, it shows the current ttl remaining, whereas creation_ttl (also called lease_duration in the unwrap response) is always the same.  Refresh time calculated based on lease_duration can be off by a lot if the token was not used immediately after it was created. So I think using ttl is a better idea.   This may require an additional call to the token-lookup API because ttl is not part of the unwrap response.  
Sorry, fixed the version.  I'm not sure what you mean by "meta blocks". 
Hi,  hmm, I could not find a configuration file for the karaf stuff. However, I checked out https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public and modified https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public/blob/master/assemblies/nexus-base-template/src/main/resources/overlay/etc/karaf/config.properties I added `co.elastic.apm.agent.*` to the boot delegation. Hmm, funny thing is, that with any agent below version 1, it works without modifying the sources from nexus oss.  What I am not understanding is, why is the javaagent since version 1 impacting booting with `bootdelegation`. To be fair, I am not a Java developer, so there is a lot of things I won't understand ;)

The upload was 700MB, so this copy lasted minutes.... (10+?)   as the upload failed later on (other bug: #2637)  it is retried, retried, .... ad nauseam. Not sure the copy is a wise move ..., i don't realy understand the rationale of it. For large files this might be an obstacle. (f.e some of the OSMAND maps are 1GB a piece).  I have files on my SD card that are bigger than the free space on the internal storage.

You are right, i was not using the latest Version, sorry for not double checking. But i think i found another potencial minor bug, if you dont specify an alignTolerance (default value of 0), then you will get an indeterminate form 0/0 when the owner gets aligned, because targetRotation *= rotation / rotationSize; (rotation is 0, and rotationSize is 0). The align check should take into acount that, and check for a value minor or Equal to the alignTolerance. 
This issue still occurs using most current version form curse

I use 1.8-1.1.2.30 which is just mc 1.8 
I catch more info before exception. It may help you. I can see just one document to be pulled, but two tries to insert revision.   It happens, if i create document on a remote couchdb through REST API and this remote endpoint is continually replicated with CBL Android.   06-04 20:45:39.780

Still the same thing happens, I even tried changing Anisotropic filtering .  Also I always have it set to "off". 
No ideas yet. Will try to find it out. 
I think this was quite a good fix, moving TradeProtocol to countries package and using package protection!! Or else you can have countries hack the TradeProtocol and generate extra cash!!! I am quite happy with the work today :) 
I'm ok with giving an error message. What's the filter for 'no status label'? `-label:status.*` still works?

If you like you can call me over the Skype. Username is: deacix  Thank you! 
**Additional UX comments from others** - For short answer/essay items, it might not be immediately obvious to contestants that they must click the `Answer` button before answering. Suggestion: add placeholder text for the textbox e.g. "klik tombol Answer untuk mengisi jawaban", or make clicking the disable textbox activate the textbox - Suggestion: immediately set focus to the short answer/essay item textbox when clicking the `Answer` button - Display the input format restriction (e.g. "jawaban hanya boleh terdiri dari angka") to the contestant. Suggestion: we can put the input format description in the problem statement manually as a workaround for now - Make it clear to the contestant that he/she can still change the answer after clicking the `Submit` button. Suggestion: display a small help text - Suggestion: use Indonesian for the UI text, as some contestants may not be comfortable with English 
What do you mean by pageable? I'm not sure I understand...are there multiple pages of clips?  Right now I'm using Bitwig Studio as the audio engine for a generative art project. It's essential that I access more than 8 clips, otherwise I'm going to have to find another tool. Any chance of back porting this to 2.3?

Hi Alexander,  thanks for your invest. I check it with the latest version and give it a try with the .asciidoctorconfig file feature. I use a Ubuntu distribution.   Thank you for this great asciidoc plugin. It provides a great integration in our development environment. 
If you made changes after the release, then it probably is fixed.  I'll test it later this week when I get chance to get the most recent source.    Thanks,  Dana 
Bingo!, that appears to fix it. Fantastic!   Thanks so much for the fix! 
@tangiel That works, thanks, we'll use that as a workaround for the moment.
@serge-rider my point is that this situation should be handled same as https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/6463 :-)
Pictures in problem 21 were broken due to URLs can't match with file names in file system. I fixed them and checked all the problem statements with pictures, and no more errors now. 
Yup! I've edited my report with a link.
Yes, this is right. But the crazy thing is I set the timezone in kibana already to Europe/berlin ... The result directly from elasticsearch is OK.
How can i check if i am using the native Google Keyboard? Yesterday I installed GPS Logger in three different smartphones (sony & samsung). I could delete alphanumeric characters, but backspace didn't work when found special chars (% : /) from variables and protocol (http://). Finally I wrote the URL in another app, I copied the URL and pasted in GPS Logger.  Now, in the original phone I tried to select all text and write something, it worked fine, but same problem with backspace key and the new text. 
it's version 0.3.7
Yeah. Why not 🙃  Would be great if you can say me some class names where I can find that snipped.  Additional to that. How do we want to behave with that badge? 🤔  I mean the repo can be "anything".  It can be published to bintray, sonartype, gradle plugin portal, own maven repo... I think we should agree on some for a badge (or get rid of the badge? 🤔 ) Should we also try to parse the URL to find out the repo?  I would suggest (because of "easieness"): * We have a default string like `published repository ($VERSION)`. While "repository" is a link to the publicationRepository config (or automatic via bintray plugin) * We try to parse the URL for bintray and the gradle plugin portal: ** If bintray add the shields.io badge. If gradle plugin portal use `published at gradle plugin portal ($VERSION)`(while gradle plugin portal is the link) * We provide a `shipkitconfig.releaseNotes.publicationRepositoryBadge` (but the name is wrong 🤔 ) which can be a customize string... Like `my awesome repo`.. leads to `my awesome repo ($VERSION)`  Wow... Sounds not so easy 😄
Nothing special. In every instance I was in a different area of the world (different chunks, far away chunks even) and the game suddenly gets sluggish as the RAM is eaten up by the memory leak. Not performing any kind of action..... In two cases I was just standing still when the crashes happened.  The game freezes for an extended amount of time before the game crashes (like the above attached crash report shows).  When I re-open the world, one of the raptors has been removed.  Tomorrow I'm posting a video in which the crash actually happened while I was recording. 
I only noticed it after updating from 1.1.456 to 1.2.1335
Is a screenshot necessary? I simply can't pour Invar or Lumium onto an arrow shaft placed on a casting table. I click the faucet and the metals just don't want to pour. I'm an experienced Tinker, I've checked that I'm not making a rookie error like forgetting to put the metal to the bottom of the smeltery.  I can, however, pour invar and lumium into normal tool parts. My regular tools were invar for a time and my crossbow is currently lumium. I decided to make my bolts from manyullyn instead, but it still should be fixed.
It is happening on an Embedded Redisson Node.
This is Spring Boot metrics: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-code-hale-metrics So basically bind the Registry called "stagemonitor" to the @Bean MetricRegistry.  I think we might have missed the Stagemonitor.init() call in the beginning of the main Method, but I'm still sure that Stagemonitor should not clear the SharedMetricsRegistry. 
Hi Gatanaso,  here is a simple example of my project to reproduce the issue. After selection the content with the dialog button is loaded.   It is independent of using in a modal dialog or not  @Route("") public class DemoView extends VerticalLayout {      private final ComboBox<String> versionSelect = new ComboBox<>();      public DemoView() {         versionSelect.setItems(Arrays.asList("test1", "test2"));         add(versionSelect);         versionSelect.addValueChangeListener(event -> {             reloadContent();         });     }      private void reloadContent() {          MultiselectComboBox<String> multiselectComboBox = new MultiselectComboBox();         multiselectComboBox.setLabel("Multiselect combo box with string items");         multiselectComboBox.setPlaceholder("Add");         multiselectComboBox.setItems("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4");         multiselectComboBox.addSelectionListener(event -> Notification.show(event.toString()));          FormLayout content = new FormLayout();         content.add(multiselectComboBox);          VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout();         layout.add(content);         add(layout);     }; }  Thank you,  André

You misread that: "when the cursor is outside of the window" (actually I meant the SceneComposer Frame to be precise). It seems that if you press g then counts as "mousedown" just like it does in blender.  Edit: Oh and I'm tagging @Dokthar since he wrote the gizmos, maybe he has any insight.
Omitting the type makes the problem worse: the file path gets passed instead of the actual file.

I will try to get a simple reproducer, however data size is not huge,  its generated json couple of hundreds of KB. However there is normalize allocation happening in buffer which rounds to nearest power of 2 or so. it takes many requests to go for next allocation.  Also is there possibility that it doesnt get decoded if command timed out. I saw await being used 
@PEConn  It is the android 9 in my case.  
I am sorry that I reply so late. This phenomenon does not only occur in Time_12, it also happens in the repair process of Math_85, the buggy program from defects4j. I am not sure but personally I think that Math_85 is fully deterministic.  The details are as follow: I set the --maxTimeType as 30 seconds (it is originally 5 minutes but I think it is kind of long so I set this to 30 seconds), however, the it costs more than twice the 30 seconds to repair the faulty statement, and unexpectedly, it doesn't generate plausible patch when repair the faulty statement.   the output information is as follow:  "the repaired suspicious statement: org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils : 198 suspiciousValue: 0.058823529411764705 the repair time for this statement is: 64688ms"  another failed repair output is:  "the repaired suspicious statement: org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils : 198 suspiciousValue: 0.058823529411764705 the repair time for this statement is: 19794ms" (The repair time is less than 30s in this case)  But these failed repair trails, where Nopol repair the faulty statement but do not generate the expected patch, just account for a very small percentage, for instance 2 out of 100 in Math_85.  So this strange phenomenon about the Nopol repair still puzzles me. Can these failed trails be interpreted as a small bug of Nopol?  Thank you for your answer and guidance!
Yes thank you!

Well, you run the example from the [readme](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/gherkin/javascript/README.md) with a freshly installed gherkin package. You should verify that it installed c21e@2.1.1 (which it does by default if you install gherkin into an empty project).  You try to run it and get the following error:

@the-dagger Safari :/ 
I am using subzero-all-0.6 jar , It is working fine on my local machine but when I am deploying on production the deserialization is not working , The serialization is not giving any issue but when I am doing get operation on Map in hazelcast it is throwing this exception .  
Yup this works:   Thanks for the quick reply! Do you have any docs on what info it collects? I may just stay at the old version if there's something useful in there.
Sorry for my confusing description. P5 freeze (75% of time) after I try to run a sketch, the sketch is a complex one, this one I give you a link in the previous post. If you need the other sketches, say me.  But this type of freezing is not at the begining of coding session but may be after three or four hours. I need to restart the computer to resolve this freezing. So if I understand your link quit the process is better than force to quit and less hard to restart the system ? it's an intermediary solution ?  I hope is clearer. 
Thank you both for responding. Happy to hear that a fix may be in the works. (My current dubious work-around is to unequip the backpack (which **doesn't** pop into my inventory, incidentally) then teleport to the RF Dimension using the Matter Transmitter)  Anyhow, love your mods guys. 
for persistent queries - so it deletes all the repartition topics and changelogs. This is racy, which might explain why we don't hit this in dev environments. Adding some details now.
Sure, will commit it.

Seemed a bit strange that build was passing there but not on my machine that is why I asked the question in case I was making a very obvious mistake. I'll try and do it on Linux machine.  Was looking into Zuul and was hoping to contribute to it - to add few functionalities. Just wanted to make sure I could build and run all tests before I start playing around.
Hi Mark, Perfect! I have tested this patch and it solves my issue. Thanks for the quick response. 
@apemanzilla, did your PR fix the issue where the user was required to select an asset when the mod was being checked for an update?  I can't replicate that for EVE anymore. 
Is this bug related to tomcat version? I'm running tomcat6. How do I get the change? I'm currently running 3.1.0 demo, but the fix is in 3.0.10.

This happens on a new generated world. 
It's working with the latest snapshot! Before I opened this issue I already used the latest snapshot to test.. but only for generating and not the snapshot runtime library. Sorry for that. 
followed the installation for Windows Linux and Mac: installed the Settlers 3 Amazons demo, "Die Siedler 3 - Das Geheimnis der Amazonen Demo" / "Secret of the Amazons" (saved as s3amazonen_demo.exe) as its the only version that i can see, downloaded the latest JSettlers zip ("JSettlers-Android_v0.3-alpha.zip") and ran it... prompted it towards the install (c:\bluebyte\s3amazonendemo) and it did nothing, ran it again and still nothing... then i launched through cmd to find this error...  Edit: just attempted to rerun it and now its working... erm, all i did was leave it for ~8 hours, went to bed (pc still on) and woke up, ran it and now its working... JSettlers - Version: d6dcc99c
http://i.imgur.com/c8TZFNQ.png what info u need :3 , btw, added a pic to show more or less  https://github.com/P3pp3rF1y/Reliquary/issues/112 just in case its on her side of the bug 
Yes, issue is still there with 3.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT. 
> could you please provide also the whole command how you are creating the mixed index?  Sure, it should have been created like this (we use a script that is auto-generated to create the index, I tried to reconstruct it in a few lines, but there could be syntax errors now):  
for me this version isnt usable...  1. The issue is still here... 2. If you set a adapter before having any data to populate the array with it will try to add a header that doesnt exist yet...  3. when scrolling down I wont get any sticky header until the second header "is sticky" and then when I scroll back the first header works as it should... 
yeah I'll get you a log when I get home tonight.  it's not supposed to currently be possible for the client to be stuck in an infinite init loop like it is if client.prefs is the only file missing, right?   I mean I don't think this is intended behavior.
Sure - sorry I figured that would help but calling via `gulp-closure-compiler` so its a little abstracted.  Hopefully this is enough to go off:   
Thanks for looking into it. Sorry I am not the best tester. I only have one computer and am only running single player. Just tested with only Astral Sorcery and Baubles it still occurs (new log):   https://pastebin.com/9Hi14fuC  LWJGL 2 version: 2.9.4-nightly2015209 Minecraft version: 1.12.2 Forge version: 14.23.3.2662  Again thanks for all the work going into this mod.

That seems to have fixed it but also disabled the hardness x4 (even made new config for ITR) the mining speed of all things scales again now like skills and momentum mining ring etc. But the Hardness of blocks is entirely gone. I mean it’s in the config but with iton true and on false doesn’t matter still the same base speed/hardness. (Yes I did restart in-between global hardness change true/false)
I have no clue. I guess kotlin have chosen that for better readability. Actually, kotlin is not not checking the type. Also a field of type string like `val isFoo : String` will translate to `isFoo()` and `setFoo(string)` 
Hi Olga,  Step to reproduce:  - Run rabbitmq instance e.g. docker `docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=user -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=password rabbitmq:3`  - Place given test under `spring-cloud-contract/tests/samples-messaging-amqp/src/test/groovy/com/example`  We are creating channel using transactional always set to true which doesn't work with publisher-confirms mode. Is it necessary to trigger stub messages within transaction? If not just change it to false otherwise we need to check what kind of mode rabbitmq connectionFactory is working with.  regards, Lukasz
@hsz and thanks for the build which seems to fix it👍 
I will take a look later sometime again.
Yep! I'll give that a shot tomorrow, didn't see there was an update. 
As of writting, Nextcloud Android app 3.0.3 isn't available in F-Droid. I'll gladly test when it's available.
its the newest one that is automatically updated from within webstorm, but I can check later to retrieve the exact version number  The Version is 1.5.4

The problem is when you change your textview by any container with two textview for example.
It is definitely a bug in QR Code reading. If I generate the QR code the proper email is inside of the URL of the charts api, otpauth://totp/user+z@address.com followed by the secret etc. However when scanning the QR code it erorrs out. So technically you could classify it as a generating issue if it is suppose to escape those characters, or the QR scanner should be reading them. Either way it is a bug for sure.
I don't think I did... doing now!
I attached an example project to the original description. As @jaikiran noted, it is specific to `dev` mode; it does not occur if I run tests (also included).
Same problem with Windows (10 - 64bits) and Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 64 bits) - 
No @pimotte 'sy up --no-resume' does give the same error so does not help. I will email the log files to @binwiederhier 
@heiko-braun you basically can't use split with google spreadsheet connector. As this is a regression and it was working before I've set p0.
Hi @sherfert,  We tried running with the snapshot flag and while it lessened the frequency of the observed issue, it was still present. What you're describing sounds like Neo4j does not meet ACID compliance (specifically Isolation).  Our situation in the real world is far more complex than the simple example. It's a cluster of 5 core nodes and 3 read nodes with several ingestion apps writing data and many more APIs reading data. We're ingesting data from a pipeline and end up deleting and recreating both nodes and relationships during reingestion. We're seeing these deletes/creates interfere with at least 2 locations in our system and in multiple ways (both from referencing the original node and referencing nodes attached to the entry node). We've implemented some logic to mitigate this by retrying queries in situations that we recognize as being invalid, but it by no means covers all our edge cases. Because of this, we'd really like to be able to avoid rewriting our ingestion transaction as it would be a pretty substantial rewrite.  I guess I'm left with 2 questions at this point: 1) Does this mean that Neo4j is not ACID compliant? 2) For the `unsupported.dbms.query.snapshot`, should we choose to enable this on our servers, what sort of performance impact might we see? It does seem to make the situation better, but it might not be worth it if we lose performance. 
Hi Jordi, It occurs on Android. I don't have iOS facility yet.  Browser is ok. Thanks, John 
@ronblum I actually saw this in Firefox 69.0 (64 bit). I use Firefox on both Windows and iOS systems. I will try to check the latest RStudio Preview for the above issue and let you know.
Sorry, that was the version of Forge Mod Loader, not Minecraft Forge. My Minecraft Forge version is 14.23.5.2838. 
Thanks for the fix. Did my own build in the meantime. Everything seem to work great so far. Not a single crash 👍
one is mixstream one is remote forword stream ,but only get mix stream in  client1.info().getRemoteStreams(
Fixed.
Nop, nothing change, i also reported the error on bnd issue tracker. Error appear with `*` option in conditional package. This is strange, i have not this error on old version of goomph.
@claudio4j the datamapper one?
I don't have the startup logs from the time of the crash. I do have the log from the time of the crash but that only has stuff from when the server was online till it crashes.  Here is the latest startup log of the server: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23609447/
Hi @hideki, I don't use the PhoneGap plugin. I have a HTML/JS frontend running in a WebView and some background services written in Java that are listening to changes in the database . Because most of this code is also used in a desktop environment using Apache CouchDB the frontend and the Java based backend access the database using the REST API. The LiteListener is started in my own Android service.  To reproduce the issue generate many changes in a database and try to request a continuous changes feed. I created a little demo app: https://github.com/fpum/deadlockdemo It basically runs a loop from 1 to 1000 that in each iteration creates and deletes a new document and tries to get the changes using a continuous feed. You would expect it to run till "Created change number 1000" and "Found 1000 changes" but it gets stuck on the way. 
Survival mode is fine, just creative mode is the problem.
all 7 are of type String
Thank you for your work! With '3.1-SNAPSHOT' it works with gradle 6.0.
It would be more like the flap indicator or the pull brake than an instrument. 
No i haven't disable anything and i have not changed anything at all i did is setup MySQL and changed the perms to luckperms. but even without MySQL and luckperms it still stops working after awhile.
I had this code:    put the cursor on the first "hello" , right clicked and selected Rename. In the dialog that pops up it says "4" instead of "2". 
@benwtrent Thanks for clarifying! We can definitely fix it on the client side I was just not aware that there's a chance that fields would not be part of the mapping. I created a [corresponding issue in the Kibana repo](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/44251) and will close this one. 
I checked on the RR wiki and it states, that it added support for the IC2 mining laser. Therfore the bug can't really be on your side, it's probatly because your and IC2 exps laser apis differ.

>Could the solution in that case simply be that the scheduled task that propagates new values to the element captures the value that was received from the server instead of reading the current value from the state tree?  Yes and no/how ? - Yes. That's what would be nice to do. - How ? We expect that the value which is received from the server is written into the `StateNode`. And that's kind of the reason why do we have the `StateTree`/`StateNode`s at all. `StateTree`/`StateNode` is exactly the storage which we use to put the values received from the server (synced with the server). But this scenario breaks that suggestion.  So the question is how/where we should store server received values? Create one more storage which will serve to this purpose ? Looks like as an overhead.  Technically my suggestion with the meta-implementation (see above) is a variant of this: we put a value into `MapProperty` when request is received from the server side and ignore everything that comes from the client until this value is not applied to the client element. So it's kind of the same approach implemented on the top of existing design.
I have checked it with my iPhone and it's ok at this codepen.
I'm playing FTB Infinity on  a private server in my home.

Hi David  No, I don't have a working xml file for this sensor. ozwcp also never worked reliably for me.  On the other hand, maybe I can help you with the bit fiddling (if this is your problem)? If you just want to have bit 3 enabled it should be a decimal 8 (2³)  and also a hex 8 (0x08).   Dieter

Ah yeah I use FairCircadian.  I wanted to write an open-source version anyway; maybe it doesn't really need Internet access, but it shows weather and sunrise/sunset for the local position.  Is GB supposed to make that kind of data available directly instead of allowing network access to the watchface?  Still though, some watch apps really do need network access.  (Like the public transportation app I wrote, or a weather app that uses a specific source.)  Will you enable that eventually?  What about watch apps that depend on Javascript running on the phone?  Is that supported, or will be? 
@jjallaire @kevinushey   I rolled back, but will be happy to load it again and run a diagnostics report.  I tested on two machines in the local environment, neither of them completely clean 18.04 installs, both with somewhat older R (3.4.4).    There is no local proxy here, so networking should not be the cause.
@ryanjbaxter Thanks for your response. The reason being we do not want the developer to be concerned with the fact the service is a eureka client in development mode. It is a  infrastructure concern. We only want to use the service as a eureka client  in higher environments by applying a profile accordingly.  But, the concern now being it worked fine for us when we were using spring boot 1.4.5, probably something has changed in next version of Spring 1.5.3 which has caused this breaking change for us. I was not able to find anything from the release notes.  Do you mean creating a EurekaClient bean would resolve this issue. Not sure how that would do so.

Can't seem to find that option, Googling for a setting or something only results in people suggesting to use a custom launcher.. When clicking through the settings I did get a notification that I could update from 5.0.2 to 6.0.1 (as I said, replacement phone from the shop :-) ) So hopefully it'll be fixed after the update.. Keep you posted! (downloading the update over slow work-wifi now) 
Hi, I observed this crash on a nexus 5 and a motox. I was using version 5.0 of the sdk. It is always reproducable.  
Also managed to get a crash from putting my armor on.. I have the same materials/traits/modifiers for each piece. Manyullyn Core/Plates and Bone Trim ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26519206/37576185-39567188-2b7f-11e8-8741-79725574b330.png) 
I did run into a problem. I am not sure if what I am doing is purely incorrect and can be done in a better way, but here is what I have as a sample: 1. Class A extends `ThymeleafViewResolver` 2. Class A also has `ThymeleafViewResolver` autowired in as field, via boot.  3. When resolving a view, if certain conditions are not met, delegate to the super. 4. When resolving a view, if certain conditions are  met, handle directly.  So, what in order to correctly initialize A as a resolver, I added a PostConstruct method to A to set fields, based on the autowired `ThymeleafViewResolver`. This allows me to set the template engine and locale and a bunch of other settings on A, that were autowired from the actual ThymeleafViewResolver instance.   This presented the problem/bug, where views seemed always cached by the resolver because ThymeleafViewResolver.isCached() always returned true, and the ThymeleafViewResolver .getCacheLimit() was always > 0.  
I have tried this before. As soon as I deactivate `reformat file` the issue is resolved

Video I would could do, but render + uploading video on YouTube is too long.  So here's step-by-step guide:  1. Go to **SURVIVAL** mode 2. Take _"Bound Blood Drop"_ in your **LEFT** hand 3. Go to any source of blood (for example, blood infuser) 4. Take blood from this source (Shift + Right Mouse Button)  If that doesn't work, try to turn on auto-filling mode in Bound Blood Drop

I have a feeling that the method we use to fetch data from the API is to blame (cc @k88hudson).

I am posting one exited SS log with outofmemory, let me know if you need more logs [exited_SS_log_10252018.zip](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/files/2535680/exited_SS_log_10252018.zip) 
Yes, I restricted everything.  One thing is that in my settings I can't put more than 3 digits for MCC and MNC, and in country I can't put digits at all (only 2 letters). So I guess the problem comes fro there. Here's a logcat for network info:  I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): get 10075/sdcard storage=true # 351 ms  I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3003 restriction=storage action=sd card uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3002 restriction=storage action=sd card uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1015 restriction=storage action=sd card uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny sdcard_r/sdcard_rw uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1023 restriction=storage action=sd card uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1028 restriction=storage action=sd card uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny sdcard_r/sdcard_rw uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): get 10075/media storage=true # 268 ms I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3003 restriction=storage action=me dia uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3002 restriction=storage action=me dia uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=1023 restriction=storage action=me dia uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny media_rw uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): get 10075/inet internet=true # 261 ms I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3003 restriction=internet action=i net uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): Deny inet/inet_raw uid=10075 I/XPrivacy/XPackageManagerService( 5720): gid=3002 restriction=internet action=i net uid=10075 
Possibly. Though I'd argue that at least in Influx's case it doesn't matter. 'NONE', to me, is a work around for a system that doesn't metrics that have the same 'name' but different tags. (like prometheus).   Why store data that is meaningless ( in that exception=NONE is the effectively the same as just not having the exception tag at all )?

[This is a example](https://github.com/hoboC/demo.git) When the spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp dependency is introduced, the following configuration will have no effect. this is configuration: ` spring:   jackson:     serialization:        WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS: true `              How to solve this problem ? I want to serialize the date as a timestamp, not a time.              I would like to return to the following: 	         { 	             "time":"1548740817" 	         } 	         not this: 	         { 	             "time":"2019-1-29 13:46:57:0" 	         }

I'm not sure how informative my answer to Mario will be after Tom's comment, but since the thread does not seem to have come to a conclusion/consent yet, I'm adding my answer to be sure nothing is lacking.  Our use case is a service that uses the Java CDA API to obtain CDAEntry instances (i.e. our service is a client of the CDA API). The service caches these instances. The service uses different threads to serve multiple concurrently connected clients. Each client can have a custom locale. Whenever the service serves a request from one of its clients, it will access the cached CDAEntry using the client's locale.  Contentful surely cannot know the access patterns for all the clients of the CDA API. That's why we are happy to tell about our access pattern. The CDA API should certainly support all access patterns insofar as it should be thread-safe. I.e. the CDA API should by design avoid hard-to-detect bugs like race conditions and this is certainly possible with the solutions Tom and I outlined. We could surely build an abstraction around the CDA to avoid the race condition for us. That would, however leave the issue open for other users who acccess the CDA API from multi-threaded services which would need to uncover and fix the race condition again, individually. Contentful could solve the issue once and for all by adjusting the API.  Please let me know if I can provide any further input to solve this issue.

If so you really should be using EurekaClient. >  > "Doesn't work" isn't an effective bug report.  Sorry, I may not have made myself clear. I mean I have a springCloud project, and  I remove the Jersey dependencies. And I want to change the status of my project in eureka from `up` to `out_of_service`. so I sent a post request to change it ,like this: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d 'out_of_service' 'http://127.0.0.1:9999/service-registry/instance-status'` in other project, it work, but in this project that removed the Jersey dependencies, it doesn't work. the status is still `up` in eureka. so I analyzing code try to find the answer. And I find the rest API actually invoke other rest API by eureka server provided. InstanceResource.class in eureka-core.jar:  so I want to reconfirm that is it a bug or I am using it the wrong way？  thanks.
Oh Samsung :( Maybe the provider is not fully initialized when Application is initiated: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41474623/sporadic-illegalargumentexception-unknown-url-content  We could do as proposed in the stackoverflow answer and move it to a background job.
Yes, @pulquero I can use constructors instead.  Indeed, it appears that I should. I remain puzzled that a single instantiation (one triple in the SPARQL UPDATE query above) could results in a wildly-variable number of rule executions.   I re-ran the experiment this morning and got hundreds of time stamps (screen capture below).    It seems as though my rule is in some sort of loop and reaches some sort of limit, probably resource-driven.  I'm curious as to what the source of the loop is.  Could it be as simple as adding the first time stamp generates another run of the rules because it alters this instance, and that subsequent time stamps likewise generate subsequent rule runs?  I guess my question then is, what prevents any rule that alters the state of the instance from running repeatedly?  I'm not seeing this behavior when I'm running rules that generate error messages, BUT the error messages (datatype properties) are the same from run to run whereas the timestamp is not.  Hmmm, maybe I DO have multiple instances of the datatype property, but the workbench filters them out as in SELECT DISTINCT making it appear that I don't have duplicates.  That's probably it.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20132242/16847104/ee605d36-49b4-11e6-8efd-d51653942140.png) 
I reverted the whole commit, but I can test the flags if you want, I have just no idea how they are used and the impact :) 
Michael,  I've found the issue and have it running in my test environment.  In your release notes for 1.0.0 you mention 90% test coverage, however I've not been able to find them.  If you have a test suite, I'd be more than happy to run it against my (very minor) changes and submit a potential patch.  For what it's worth, I've extended this project https://github.com/jplock/dropwizard-discovery.git to send updates to Zookeeper via Curator.

I was in a custome biome where I don't use any newTreeDecoration at the moment. Let me disable the other biome.cfg and I'll try agian.  These are the two tree setups I used for my other test Biome.

@chris2011, yes I noticed it happened yesterday ... I have configured the build to kick off every 24Hr if there’s been no pull requests, and it got stuck on a maven repo. Tried it again, and it passed successfully 
Something like " missing the permission 'nick.command.name.random' " and " 'nick.command.skin.random' " 
i tested a few minutes before, and i think the first 200 rows fetching is the problem. my answer your question: "Do you see any dups in DBeaver results grid? --> yes "Do you see any dups if you copy by simple ctrl+c?" -->yes  but if i execute sql with this "select all rows" (ctrl+alt+a) --> there is no dubs. So i think the problem is the first 200 row fetching and afterthat the all rows fetching. 
Dear all, I use latest `openjdk-jre` version available in Debian Stable repositories, i. e. 8u141-b15-1~deb9u1, with `openjfx` v. 8u111-b14-1.  I can reproduce it sistematically with beta2. Try this way: 1. Add a book with author, title, date, key 2. Search the item with a field common to other items, in order to have other items in table with the one just added. 3. In biblatex **source editor**, add ex. gr. `titleaddon` 4. In the table, switch with arrows to another item 5. Return to previous item  Later I'll try dev builds.  EDIT From other tests, it seems that the issue happens whenever I add an entry in **source editor**.
Yes it is by every single video without pressing the play button.  I reinstalled the latest release 1.1 that has nothing changed.

Yes, I will try to run again directly in the clamav container and see the result.  I just tried in our test deployment and got the same report. Our clamav container is built from  `FROM mk0x/docker-clamav:alpine` and with freshclam:  
is this issue still relevant? 
My use case is actually using bitcoinj to create a transaction and broadcast it through a blockexplorer API like blockchain.info. I saw that the api returned an error and I tried to send it through Bitcoin Core and I found that it was Bitcoin Core that was rejecting the transaction. I'm on bitcoinj version 0.14.3, and Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1.  As for the dummy key,  I just put "key1" and "key2" as a dummy key because the real keys actually hold real bitcoins so I don't want to include it in my post. In my actual code I do create the transaction with the real base58 private key.  
@duncdrum What you have there is *quoting*, not *escaping*. The quoting is only needed around special characters such as spaces etc.

The quick fix will result in an implicit `NullPointerException` if one blindly calls the `get()` methods of `ReactiveQueryResult`without doing a `hasResults()` check. So if the get methods of `UnifiedQueryExecutor` has something similar (i.e. to determine if results are present or not), perhaps throwing (implicitly or explicitly) `NullPointerException` in the interim is OK. But from an API design point, IMHO it is much clearer to explicitly throw an *unchecked exception* such as `NoSuchElementException` / `NoDataFoundException` as `NullPointerException` wouldn't convey the intention.

Still failing, though differently. How about waiting until after the vacation, and fixing it then?   
@david-cortes No, it does not change when I resize the panel. See the gif below.  ![ezgif com-optimize (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/209714/55080040-c8b0c580-5073-11e9-9846-7e31d0a979ba.gif)  
Yeah I saw the ORM and it would be great to use it, but the app's so not ready for it! There's so much spaghetti and view stuff talking direct to the database almost, it needs pulling apart. That's what I was trying to do with the Forum package but there's so much hardwired into using int IDs and building making database queries and network requests, it's a ton of work and it's basically a rewrite of a lot of the app  The appended ID is a good idea... since it is sort of another 'thread', and it'll never show up anywhere else (and get purged after a week anyway). Only trouble is the thread ID is an integer in the database, and (of course) everything's pulling rows out of the database and expecting ints from that column. I'm not sure if we can quickly hack this, I'll have a look at it though  I'll push the tweaks I made to the parsing code, hopefully it's a bit easier to follow and it should fix some of the gotchas with reply calculations. There's other fun stuff that needs fixing though (like ignored posts aren't added to the post database at all if 'always ignore' is set in the options)
This is a link to my mod list idk if it will help or not http://pastebin.com/R5fD5bd6 - Make warp called spawn in dim -112 - Make warp called overworld in dim 0 - Use /warp overworld while in dim -112 will teleport and spawn nether portal - Use /warp spawn while in dim 0 will teleport and spawn nether portal - Using /back also does same thing if going cross dimension  Nether portals do not appear if /warp or /back in Same dimension only when teleporting cross dimension.   Also using /cofh tpx will teleport cross dimension without making a nether portal. Seems to only happen when using ForgeEssentials teleport commands. 
Hahaha, sorry Ray, I overlooked that the issue is only known to me :) We use ERXJDBCConnectionBroker and as part of setup() method following code is executed:  <pre> Connection con = getConnection(); try {     supportsTransactions = (con.getTransactionIsolation() != 0);     if(supportsTransactions) {         con.setAutoCommit(false);     } } catch (SQLException ex) {     log.error(ex, ex); } finally {     freeConnection(con); } </pre>  So, in this case when my connection initially setup was in autocommit = true and because using connection broker, we're reusing the same connection without really closing (connection pooling), and when the connection is in the middle of a transaction and when statement is not yet committed, invoking setAutoCommit(false) throws exception. In my opinion, the check fix the issue, which we've tested with postgresql database. 
Same error with the default driver suggested by DBeaver [Log_default driver.txt](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/files/1099480/Log_default.driver.txt)

I will have to wait to confirm, as oftentimes the performance doesn't drop until we've played for a day or two (again, leading me to suspect over-spawn).

Hii There,  Thanks for replying.  I think my issue is not same as #77. In my case OpenIAB is working for Android but not properly.  Issue 1 : If you press on purchase button in my game, then Google's popup for IAP is coming properly. Even you can purchase product successfully but after purchasing OpenIAB's OnPurchaseSuccessful callback is not executing. So i am calling QueryInventry() in a loop to check if user purchased any product or not ? So it is my first issue that OnPurchaseSuccessful callback never called.  Issue 2 : After launching game, if you press purchase button very first time in my game, then Google's popup for IAP is coming properly but this time don't buy anything just press back button to cancel IAP popup. Now you get back to game. Now again press purchase button, this time Google's popup for IAP will not come (Why it is not coming second time ?) but in code, OpenIAB is calling OnPurchaseFailed callback. So this was my 2nd issue.  Just to see this issue, please download my game from given Google Play link, if you have free time.  It will be nice if you guys provide latest OpenIAB unity package for Unity 4.3 as i don't know how to build unity package from source master. 
@MauveCloud  That whole loop from line 122 makes that, and if you want, try it out yourself, I built 15 * 15 * 15 cleanroom, and on start it wasn't working, altough everything was correct, then placed cables from bottom, where my engraver is to the top, where filter casings are and it magically started working.  P.s. If exactly, check this condition, it checks if it is tile entity. https://github.com/Blood-Asp/GT5-Unofficial/blob/unstable/src/main/java/gregtech/common/tileentities/machines/multi/GT_MetaTileEntity_Cleanroom.java#L128

So this also fails in java for me (created a fresh gradle project with this in a main method):    I am using `2.0.0-preview-2`  **Update**: Your list buckets call actually works and goes to the correct port! Mine however fails.
@neslihanturan the current share message is this: `Upload photos to Wikimedia Commons on your phone Download the Commons app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.free.nrw.commons`  It's missing the punctuation over here `on your phone Download`. It also seems to be a bit too dull in my opinion. I was thinking of adding the punctuation and making the message as follows: `Upload photos to the Wikimedia Commons directly from your phone.

@jesmrec Sorry, we've tried it on 2.9.1, it doesn't work. But as far as we know, it stopped working 2 days before I created the issue and that's why I expect the issue came in 2.9.0 as that was released 2 days before creating this issue.  I just edited my original post and changed "ownCloud app version" under "Environment data" to 2.9.1. I also tried it once more to make sure and it's not working in 2.9.1.
The reference to the topic (which is named for example 'iris10-20%.dita') in the DITA Map is correct and it looks like this:           <topicref href="topics/flowers/iris10-20%25.dita"/>
Sorry for taking so long to answer, i was busy with Uni this week,  I tried removing some mods and as you say, i can see again the ore and all its uses in JEI  The mod causing this is UniDict-1.12.2-1.7, it was my fault not to notice this mod unifies several ores into one, thats why i couldn't see any uses for the Uranium Ore either. So ill just whitelist it  Sorry for taking ur time for nothing and thanks for the mod
After checking it a few times, with several restarts, it still seems to be ignoring the fast-xp-pickup being set to false. Therefore I'm ruling out Hotloading issues :c
Hi,  Bug is still there in 2015-04-11-NB. I can reproduce the "loose of filter" when from a filtered list I enter in cache details then I go back to the list (which is not filtered anymore).  This occurs on lists: Nearby / List caches from map When I use the filtrer Status -> With Trackable.  Hope this helps to reproduce,  PS : It's funny how often developpers are not able to reproduce a bug or how users are not able to explain clearly steps to reproduce a bug ;-) 
@arvindsv Yes that's exactly the issue. Looks like the docs just need updating as per the readme you referenced 
Sorry,  I cannot reproduce it on a sample project. Actually I have two projects which have extra sources, the first one work fine but the second not. The first one launch.json is as below:   Is the problem come from my project structure ?  How can I check it ? 
Yeah, certainly looks like the natives trouble (btw, the os is Windows 7 and Windows 8, both 64 bit). The cause of the exception, unfortunately, does not tell much more. There is only one cause (calling `getCause()` on it returnes `null`), and it is not much different than the original message:    Is there any special, not very traditional mechanism that is used to load the native libraries? 
It may, but still depends on setup. I need to rewrite this bug description when I have some time.  The basic issue is that the application being developed should *only* be run in the main workspace container. The only mode of debugging supported by Che in any sustainable way is remote debugging in the main container. In my eyes, all "launch" configs should be hidden in Theia unless absolutely necessary, since end-users should not have to worry about what's running in sidecars.
1.       I haven’t tried the latest version but with version 5.0.2 I get the following error when creating a new schema.  If this has changed in the next one then I’ll be happy to download it.             
@prmathur-microsoft, I will discuss it with the developer. I will let you know about the outcome. If you have any comments about the shared files please let me know. It's a blocking issue not getting a device provisioned. 
@npark-mozilla thanks for checking, @vesta0! i just tried it on GeckoView and still seeing the issue.  Can we sync up a few mins on vidyo tomorrow?  would like to see if we're using same STR to arrive at result.  
Hi Luca, thanks for the response. I just tried the snapshot version, on my machine it works just like the beta - I haven't been able to reproduce the stack trace from the opening post in my development environment. It seems that the error only occurs after prolonged use / lifetime of the process, which causes problems for us in production. Unfortunately I don't think that I can convince my team to deploy a snapshot version of a library on a production server... the stack trace is all I can offer for now, sadly. Sorry about that.  We are reverting to 2.1.9 for the time being. 
Hi Yoh-There,   The data was logged in the Sony Xperia M5 using a OBDII 902 scanner. Scanner looks like this:   ![p](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35229609/34716003-77e3b706-f526-11e7-9de6-fcc8b8cf6ca6.jpg)  My CanZE setting page looks like this:   ![screenshot_20180109-110913](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35229609/34716014-8091b92a-f526-11e7-92df-c2bfb3df49cc.png)  and the resulting log file:   [data-2018-01-07-17-44-00.log](https://github.com/fesch/CanZE/files/1614687/data-2018-01-07-17-44-00.log)  One of the clearer figures is in "2018-01-07-18-39-10" until "2018-01-07-18-39-20" with data at "2018-01-07-18-39-15" being positive while the other 2 are negative.   Also interesting is that the power figure is, I assume battery V × battery A, but for the data on 18:39:15, the battery A is negative, but the resulting power figure is positive.  I am also wondering if you might be happy to enlighten me on the meaning of the column just before the "Range" column. I have not been able to figure this out yet...   Thanks!  Kind regards, Jin 
  Here is the json file. Seems like `category` field is there but still i can not save it if there is no extra field `BUG_FIELD`. Also when i added another filed `icon` of type `byte[]` it also becomes unsaveable.
The first workaround is fine, I just wanted to make sure you knew it was a breaking change. It'll probably affect a lot of people, so maybe the first release should make the new behavior opt-in? 
@JamesDrummond, thanks for the response.  I am running on Codenvy.io so the docker image is created in their cloud.  I have updated the issue title to reflect that environment.  I posted this issue in codenvy/codenvy also in case this is the wrong place to post this issue.
Oh, thank you!

I was using Alluxio 2.0.0-preview and Spark 2.3.3. You will find detailed documentation and see the actual test in my Jupyter notebook here https://github.com/mingfang/terraform-provider-k8s/blob/master/examples/alluxio/AlluxioExample.ipynb
Unfortunately, no.  First, it is a Xamarin project with bindings I created.  Second, it's an extremely large customer's project that includes iOS, WPF and a web back and front end...
I haven't used that plugin; this is what I've tried:   Second one throws an error. First one doesn't work.
Not sure about the xyz coordinates. I just know that its all in the same chunk, since i'm OCD about having everything be within the chunk and stuff. I use 2 altars instead now, each getting powered by 1 burner pylon. I'll check the coordinates later, coz it takes quite a bit for this modpack to launch on my laptop.  Oh and the 2nd pylon didnt burn fuel, it was just being idle.
I think it is a https problem . When I use the commit 'f4c83e8'. It works. But it does not have the class 'Call'   I have send you the sample class. 
Hi,  Here are some details about the app i built when discovering this issue :  Front : Backbone SPA.  Back : NodeJS + [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (express based mockup REST API server ), so no servlet engine.  1. The front calls the rest `POST` API with XHR and sets `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` 2. esigate gets the char encoding and affects it to `Content-Encoding` then calls the backend 3. Node + express refuse to process the request for `utf-8` is not a valid value for `Content-Encoding`.  I guess to reproduce, you just need to make an http `POST` to any node based backend through esigate.  Since the oppening of that issue, i added a request interceptor (middleware in terms of express) that overides this header. It works fine now with my current backend.  Eric Bretonniere, with whom i work at SNCF Fret for that study implemented an equivalent backend in both CXF and Spring MVC. From what he told me, it seems like they are not impacted by the issue. As if the header was discarded by the JVM, instead of causing a rejected request (`415 Unsupported Media Type`) like Express.  Please feel free to ask me any question that might help you reproduce this issue. :) Cheers,

Apart from the modifications in the core library's architecture (PSurface, etc) nothing changed in PGraphicsAndroid2D, and the new architecture should not affect how the renderer handles the canvas. But I may be missing something, so will be looking into it.
Sorry， there is no unit tests。 just  debug code find it。 case 1 occurred in dataset is very small. case 2 occurred in  NaiveKMeans as base clusterer  in DivisiveGlobalClusterer
DITA-OT 1.8.5, transtype pdf, pdf2 and pdf5 (AntennaHouse). 
Thank you for fixing this. It's loading now and seems a bit faster. I guess there's no duration if both timestamps match? 
it´s an Nexus 7 LTE with CM12.1 can I download this special version some where? I don´t have the build environment to compile it. 
It would have the same effect, of course. But it's not my understanding of clean code and working efficiency to (un-)comment multiple lines of code instead of using one constant for it.  That's why there exists Hugo, isn't it? At least it would have the same effect to do a manually log in each method too. But it's not as clean and useful as the @DebugLog approach. 
Minecraft version 1.12.2 Forge version 14.23.5.2847  It's in Project Ozone 3 Modpack  It is also updated to latest version 4.7.0
Tried it and it didn't work, in fact it worked worst than before.  1. Ingested 2 files 2. Added a file (so PREMIS isn't created) 3. Removed one of the files firstly ingested 4. Using [bless](http://home.gna.org/bless/) edited the other file firstly ingested 5. Executed the plugin on all AIPs  The task ran without detecting any of the failures, the removed file or the corrupted file.
The cert isn't self-signed, the CA is DigiCert. I'd think that would work.
Latest 1.10 version from Curse Forge. 
@skabashnyuk Will do and get back to you. This issue has been addressed is it?
I still have that issue. The java I am using: 
It was much harder to reproduce, but I finally got a bug report on the Note 4. Interrupting the player in various states by forcing the surface to be destroyed and recreated seems to make it more likely to fail, such as pressing Home and resuming or hitting the Recent Apps button. I also added some code to suck up CPU cycles on the main thread, which is what finally did it.

GenericObjectInput was imported from com.alibaba.dubbo.common.serialize.support.dubbo.GenericObjectInput; (dubbo:2.5.10)  I'm using dubbo serialization not hessian. config like this:   ProtocolConfig config = new ProtocolConfig(); config.setSerialization("dubbo");  should i change the serialization to solve this problem?  note:   I use com.alibaba.dubbo.common.serialize.support.hessian.Hessian2ObjectInput  -> test ok; I use GenericObjectInput with ArrayList -> test ok; I use GenericObjectInput with CopyOnWriteArrayList -> test not ok;  
Thanks for the quick fix! I can confirm it works now :grinning: 
Hmmm, I shall attempt some tests after work, most of the players on the server have said chickens and none have gone awol except those on the ship....that ofcourse does not mean advanced rocketry is to blame, it could be a chunk error and that can be in any world (time to set test chickens in each chunk of my ship lol) just this is thefirsttimeits been noted
Define "latest build" for me? In version 2.0.21 evokers revert to EVOKER_FANGS upon reload... I downloaded another of the latest version and I can't reproduce this "freaking out glitch" anymore, it must have been corrupted... But I can confirm that evokers disappear on reload...  Edit: I recreated the freaking out glitch... I will have a video later on how to reproduce this for you... It does not show any data in console when this happens either...
Sorry for the file, the upload did not work from my linux centos (too old chromium).  I retried it and still the same:   I tried to change disk permission (root:users to the folder /opt/JMSToolbox).  The log and the GUI only gets' the first message.  See the screenshot, I used ActiveMQBrowser to send to the queue and listen to the .mirrored topic; if there will be a problem in my config, the other client would also be impacted I think.  ![capture-jtb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2510180/46406447-dd874e80-c70b-11e8-9c0b-fedd9ca687f6.png) 
Can you fix it soon?
I do believe it was a regular zombie, although I can probably run a test on that in the next few days. I am aware that this issue has occurred for multiple people on the server I play on, so in case I can't test it, I can get one of them to test it instead.
The configuration is rather simple:  I run uv with:  `/usr/sbin/daemon -f -u urlaubsverwaltung -p /var/run/urlaubsverwaltung/urlaubsverwaltung.pid -o /var/log/urlaubsverwaltung/daemon.log /usr/local/openjdk8/bin/java -Dserver.address=127.0.0.1 -jar /var/urlaubsverwaltung/urlaubsverwaltung.war`
I have Windows7 and it shows "Users" share, inside this are some symbolic links for example "All users" or "Default User". Opening these folders (e.g. for listing) returns error with instantiation of SymbolicLinkError.
Using ActiveMQ 5.10  Get this error repeatedly once navigating to the ActiveMQ or Camel pages.  Sorry for not including this earlier.  
Thanks for the fast answer. The files are copied correctly into the temp folder, but looking into the copied ditamap of the sideDocument which includes the references, we have seen something strange.  The relative paths inside the copied ditamaps are partially changed. As a result the .dita files of the mainDocument cannot be found Here is an example: The first block is correct, while the second one has changed paths <pre><code> &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="01_subChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:2;7:39"&gt;     &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="01_subSubChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:3;8:43"&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/01_subDescription/_01_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/_01_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/01_subDescription/01.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/01_subDescription/_01_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/02_subDescription/_02_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/_01_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:2;8:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/02_subDescription/02.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/02_subDescription/_02_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;     &lt;/topichead&gt; &lt;/topichead&gt; 		 &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="02_subChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:4;13:39"&gt;     &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="02_subSubChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:5;14:43"&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/07_subDescription/_07_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/_04_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="07_subDescription/07.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/07_subDescription/_07_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/08_subDescription/_08_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/_04_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:2;8:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="08_subDescription/08.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/08_subDescription/_08_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;     &lt;/topichead&gt; &lt;/topichead&gt; </pre></code>
Good point, I didn't tried with only the two mods. My gut feeling is that is not related to BOP as this should not affect The Betweenlands dimension, however this was indeed a world generated by BOP and not a vanilla world.   Give me some time to do a new fresh forge profile in a different directory. I'll use it for testing so I can do some test without all the noise from the other mods.  Thank you for the help :)
Yes it is being called accordingly, I log the event, it also reaches the code accordingly where it should store the information, it just doesn't persist  On Jan 12, 2018 1:27 AM, "Gabriel Harris-Rouquette" < notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Can it be confirmed that TickEvent.WorldTickEvent is actually being > listened to?

GregTech 5 was added later to the world as a GregTech 6 replacement when I have found out that GregTech 6 had no tech tree at that moment.  In fluid registry only the glue from Tinkers' Construct was found and deleted. Launching the world afterwards changed all unusable GregTech glue to Tinkers' Construct glue, which successfully was accepted by assembling machine.  The problem was solved. The issue can be closed.
@SapphireTactician no, just keep it here. I want to make this a priority so that games will be playable on worse connections.

Actually, the cleanup method is called twice from different threads when running in local mode. One does not have the output stream initialized, cf. log output with the null-check applied:

The version  of JNA is 4.5.1
found out that transactions were (correctly) aborting, that's all.
The cache is stored on my device. I want to drop it, and I expect it to get dropped just as every where else, where that function is available. I guess, when a cache is stored on my device and in some cases, when I view it, "drop" is available and in other cases not, just as a matter from where I started to view this cache, this would be irritating. Anyway, more important for me would be a solution of #5758 instead of a fix for this issue. 
sure, here: [pom.xml.zip](https://github.com/Mercateo/factcast/files/3147875/pom.xml.zip) 
  This has never worked either. But I am now trying this with a very recent dev build. (I doubt there will be any diference) 
Here is an example:  We expect the requestHandler not to handle the request if the connection closed. But it will still handle the request. Any good idea to deal with that?
Thanks for looking into this @adamretter. I've given it a try with https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/1864, which does indeed reduce the amount of information in the logs, but does not fix the problem.   > This is actually not really a problem, and you can safely ignore it for now. I think the logging is too severe here, rather than ERROR, it should be WARN level at the most. I will send a change to fix that.  Perhaps I hadn't stated clearly enough in my original report that the problem isn't just the logging, but the fact that retrieval of the binary files with `http:send-request()` actually fails with the same error message.  After your commit, behaviour remains the same: in eXide, a first call to `http:send-request(<http:request href="http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/resources/images/app.gif" method="get"/>)` succeeds, but subsequent calls fail with the "exerr:ERROR Unable to add binary value to result" error.  ![2018-05-10 13_57_45-exide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/223134/39868661-de4a3de2-545a-11e8-8319-722724f86cc5.png)  In `exist.log`, logging now is reduced to:      2018-05-10 13:57:08,412 [qtp1980097967-53] WARN  (TemporaryFileManager.java [returnTemporaryFile]:108) - Unable to delete temporary file: C:\Users\RON~1.KAN\AppData\Local\Temp\_mmtfm_693a8863-3a27-4796-87c2-313e078f4ef52135163101174793632\mmtf_15259534218951031901657529973713.tmp due to: C:\Users\RON~1.KAN\AppData\Local\Temp\_mmtfm_693a8863-3a27-4796-87c2-313e078f4ef52135163101174793632\mmtf_15259534218951031901657529973713.tmp: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

After taking some time to look at this again on a fresh machine, I made some screenshots of the process I follow to create a new project.  The first screenshot shows the newly created, non-maven, Google App Engine standard project. You can see the error messages in the problems tab regarding the archive.  Even though this is not a Maven project, it still seems the project is referencing things in the .m2 folder.  ![newprojectwitherrors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36787970-2a5912de-1cb2-11e8-94e2-59abb11d81e8.PNG)  This second screenshot documents my journey inside the .m2 folder, where we can see the file size of 88kb.  ![mavencache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788030-5cb1a4a8-1cb2-11e8-813d-ad3d9dbadd33.PNG)  The third screenshot shows what settings I selected to create the project.  Disregard the differences in the project name.  I didn't take the screenshot until after, but I assure you the settings are identical.  ![settingsleadingtobuggybehavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788063-82521b8e-1cb2-11e8-91e5-a5546ad0eca9.PNG)  The fourth screenshot shows the file on the Maven website.  Here you can see the file size of the JAR is 93kb, not 88kb:  ![93kbjarfile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788113-b8cf4646-1cb2-11e8-81d9-0369d5fe273e.PNG)  After downloading the JAR file from the Maven website, I then copy it manually to the .m2 folder, as shown in this fifth and sixth screenshot:  ![downloadedfile93kb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788167-e4de8530-1cb2-11e8-9971-7003e3f7cc94.PNG)  ![copyfiles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788172-eaa51948-1cb2-11e8-8257-2b03ea42179e.PNG)  After refreshing the project, I then create a new project, as shown in the seventh screenshot.  Here we see that the problem no longer exists with the corrupted JAR file.  (The old project; however, has error messages saying there is an unknown problem, and it's not clear how to resolve it.  Instead, we just delete it.)  ![nowitworkswithnewprojectonly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788179-f16f35ec-1cb2-11e8-8b0f-20781adbb7c3.PNG)  **Please note:**  _This happens on every single Windows machine in our organization.  We have to follow this process with every trainee who walks through our door.  We delete and recreate new user accounts as new trainees enter the organization, and the .m2 cache repeatedly obtains corrupted JAR files after installation of Cloud Tools for Eclipse_.    I don't know if it's a problem with the Cloud Tools for Eclipse plugin or Maven, but it seems odd that the Maven website has a different JAR than the actual Maven repository Cloud Tools fetches from.    Let me know if there are any other details I can provide.  I'd like to help see this resolved, as there are people in the organization who are still clinging to the old, outdated, deprecated Google Plugin for Eclipse, and it seems the world is trying to move forward.  Again, I'm happy to help. :)      
first I had to change the dependencies from Finchley.M1 to 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT as the package `org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.instrument.reactor` is not contained in Finchley.M1 and its dependencies.  The output for setting the logging level of` org.springframework.cloud.sleuth.instrument` to TRACE is shown below:  
I can echo `$JAVA_HOME` on che terminal. But couldn't get it in java program.   whereas I can get `System.getProperty("java.home")` to respective jre directory.
As mentioned above this is happening on the master branch at the moment, so post 3.1 beta.
I added this in pr`!MessageConst.STRING_HASH_SET.contains(key.replaceFirst("^" + RocketMQHeaders.PREFIX, ""))`.
Yup, commas do work now.
I'm using :  - hadoop 2.0.0 (cdh 4.1.2) - repository-hdfs 2.0.0-light - Debian Wheezy  The TCP connections are pointing to the nodes of my hadoop cluster. Here is an extract of "lsof" output for the elasticsearch process :     I noticed that even few hours after the last snapshot, the connections are still not closed.  Thanks for your help 
 
I tried to reproduce this again, and deleted project directory and created Web Application Project, and this time it was successfully created, though got following warning:  Plugin: com.google.gdt.eclipse.core  Severity: Warning  Message:    I think we can take out bug label for this issue until other people reproduce. 
@sbrannen This fixed my issue completely. Thank you so much for the prompt response and fix! I am looking forward to testing out the new features of JUnit 5. Thanks for all the devs hard work. 
Thanks @yfuks ,  Build is getting proper and application is also rendering but when i am selecting any image for upload. Its giving the error. "checkNotNull preconditions.java 20"  Is there anything that i missing to pass because as i am seeing its null pointer .  ![screenshot_2015-12-29-14-53-09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13794593/12032280/73a628aa-ae3c-11e5-9a64-f61a6f77ec0c.png) 
Well, so it seems that for Aspects setting `proxyTargetClass=true` does the trick.  However, as far as I know @Transactional is always implemented via CGlib proxies, unless there's an interface to implement. This means that new testcase for this situation in the updated test cases below will never work? At least, unless there is an interface for the stage?  [testcase.tar.gz](https://github.com/TNG/JGiven/files/662256/testcase.tar.gz)
I believe this used to work fine and was only recently introduced seeing as it was used as a solution in a previous post: https://github.com/runelite/runelite/issues/2719.  I originally tested this on Java 8 until I updated to the latest version so I believe it's not related to the version of Java.   I'd like to also mention the issue only occurs when using the GPU plugin and works fine otherwise.
No change, @deathbeam.
Hi @jandadav  Yes, that's correct. If I change shebang in the `api_ml.sh` script, it  works. But the shebang is `#!/bin/sh` which is a symlink to dash on Ubuntu, and I get the syntax error.  Please note that  `api_ml.sh` is called from `zlux/zlux-app-server/config/generate_zlux_certificates.sh`, and we can't use bash explicitly in the situation without changing shebangs.
Yes, I am using CacheControl like this: <1> File cacheDirectory = new File(App.getApp().getExternalCacheDir(), "http");     Cache cache = new Cache(cacheDirectory, 2 \* 1024 \* 1024); // 2M     OkHttpClient.Builder builder = new OkHttpClient.Builder().cache(cache);     OkHttpClient client = builder.build();  <2> CacheControl cacheControl = new CacheControl.Builder().maxAge(2, TimeUnit.HOURS).build();  <3> Request.Builder builder = new Request.Builder().url(url).cacheControl(cacheControl);     Request request = builder.build();     client.newCall(request).enqueue(callback);  But okhttp will send a second request to server within 2 hours, because my http request url contains _timestamp_ paramter which changed every time I build the url.  So, will you make these changes: <1> Remove final modifier of class _okhttp3.Cache_  <2> Make the method _okhttp3.Cache#urlToKey_ protected and none static. 
I attached an example [example.json.txt](https://github.com/jsurfer/JsonSurfer/files/3287031/example.json.txt) 
Ideally no, but there are currently bugs in exectuion that can lead to uncaught exceptions. This isn't about helping normal users, it's to help us develop K itself.  For example, if you check out 182cbfa5e35014827fa7d5d2e6e08d8bdf58e54f, go into tutorial/1_k/4_imp++/lesson_8 and run    After that, krun has quit. Here it's not so bad because it's on the first step, but if it happens after hundreds of steps or at the end of execution it's pretty annoying to make multiple runs narrowing down the number of successfully taken steps to see the preceding state. 
About the lost item, I noticed, hence my question ;)  well.. fromCallable is marked Beta and wasn't in the core when I wrote that code ~20 months ago. I'll check if it works for me as the above example has a very simplified stripped down version of what's going on in the process method.  I would suggest to change the doc line on doOnSubscribe into _is subscribing_ instead of _is subscribed_ as it might be misleading. It was for me.  Also, the solution I came up with isn't _that_ weird, is it? There is one general result stream, subscribe to it with a filter for your id, take 1 and the subscription will get unsubscribed after receiving it because of onCompleted. But too bad one can not postpone putting items on the subject until a subscribe happened.  Thanks for the fast reply. 
I think i found out the problem, last few days my system disk can be full and therefore prefs file become ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15666932/57068719-82532400-6d0d-11e9-9307-4fa2ac1e5c19.png) When i removed it like u said, it start well without problem. Should i upload this file? 
I can recreate the errors with oregen and I'll post them when I'm done. The overwriting of the planetDefs.xml file still seems to happen. When it gets overwritten, the numPlanets and numGasGiants in the star tag both get changed to 0.  https://pastebin.com/PC6TVqTE
i edited my main post with the version number
I tested 6.7.4, and it has problems transcoding the same file. The PS4 logos just spin and spin.... Five minutes later, I canceled playback and immediately tried playing it again. This time it started playing right away, but English subtitles were displayed.  In the directory listing, the file name had changed from `XXXXXX.mkv [FFmpeg]` to `XXXXXX.mkv [FFmpeg] {Sub:SubRip/English (English)}`. I've seen similar behavior with 7.x.x, fwiw. If it fails to play the file once, subsequent attempts will inexplicably play with subtitles turned on. The problem does seem worse in 7.4.0 though, I think.  
Same behaviour with JabRef 4.0.0-dev--snapshot--2017-02-16--master--ebbeb1d24. (I had to use the the jar version, as the exe threw some errors).
Yes, exactly. It happenend twice. "before" ist a bit of a stretch, because ist was anyl running for 60 days or so. In both cases the operator crashed. 
I think things actually work better now :)  I reverted to Flutter 0.4.4 and plugin 25.0.1. The sequence of stop-at-breakpoint, modify-code, hot-reload, continue is totally broken. It takes about 20s for hot reload to complete, after which the app is unresponsive and the UI change made before hot reload is not visible.  @devoncarew @pq Have you noticed anything like this?
@mattmoor : Do you need more information? I was going to assign this bug to someone who maintains https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker but I see you are one. :)
Ok. The bug is fixed in the last version. I can use also Telespazio's maps for my tests. Thank you for the answer. If I'll find another problem I open another question. Bye! 
Ok, I digged a little deeper and found out that on my other Android the modify-date is set correctly after downloading. Maybe it has something to do with the files being on an SD-Card?
Hi, this is quite embarassing. Apparently there was an additional space in my input demux/barcodes file. This resulted in the reported barcode in the output file to have a space and consequently FASTQ file generation to crash...   After correcting the input file (removing that single space), all is working fine.
Oh sorry, had too much issues, did not notice this. Using AgriCraft-1.7.10-1.4.5 
Just tried again, but I am unable to reproduce the issue. What I had done before was. 1: Try to backup - IO Error: Utility 'pg_dump.exe' not found in client home 'postgresql-x64-10' 2: checked the directory that the PostgreSQL Binaries resolves to and found it was empty. 3: Attempt to Download drivers - Successful with version 9.6 4: checked the directory, and it had contents including pg_dump and pg_restore. 5: attempt to restore again - IO Error: Utility 'pg_dump.exe' not found in client home 'postgresql-x64-10'  So I uninstallled and reinstalled version 9.6, saw my previous directory options (home), selected the home for 10, and tested with success.  I later reinstalled 5.1.6 and tested again, checked the PostgreSQL Binaries folder again (it had contents), downloaded drivers again (just to be sure), checked folder (contents still there). Tried to backup - still gave me same error, so I manually added a new home; been working since. I have just switched the home folder to PostgreSQL Binaries and it works.  I have no clue why it works now vs before. I am pretty sure I followed these exact steps.  Hope it helps
Hi @marcingrzejszczak , just demo code for now :-)  Would it be possible to maybe just start discarding spans if the queue is full? It would probably be preferable to lose traces rather than throwing unhandled exceptions .  A sampling rate of 0.1 (or even 0.01) may be fine for expected traffic, but an unexpected spike should probably not start throwing exceptions if the rest of the code can cope. As you say, a custom poller would probably solve that. I'll definitely give it a try.  I've tried similar tests using HTTP as the transport mechanism instead of Kafka and haven't seen any issues. 
Confirmed on a TM-T88V. The density parameter _used_ to adjust the width of the image, but it no longer does this. Single and Double density print jobs look the same for both the user's .png file and our sample .png file:  ![img_20160712_104121857](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3408749/16771206/a10f5cb4-481d-11e6-8051-9c902c4ae7bb.jpg) 
Yes, it's happening repeatedly. I saw you mentioned it would happen once and then stop but I'm seeing it every time. 
Please see thread in dev@wso2.org "[DEV] hostname in certificate didn't match: <km.dev.wso2.org> != <gw.dev.wso2.org>"

@PhilJay  please solve this issue as soon as possible  
Beta. Worth noting that app content does correctly hide in normal cases (e.g., just pushing home or opening the app switcher without turning off the screen).
I did some research and seems that it conflicts with [MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mrcrayfish-furniture-mod) (v4.1.5). Both of these mods works fine when they're alone, but together they duplicate the sounds.  Client log: [latest.log](https://github.com/OreCruncher/DynamicSurroundings/files/1699681/latest.log)
In this case I'm just using free hosting somewhere, so I'm not entirely certain how to check. I can tell you that Fever itself works more-or-less normally in Chrome, though. There aren't any trailing spaces in any field, or leading for that matter.

Ok, on the Osmose website the bugs appear several times, too. It seems there actually are multiple identical bugs on one object. So this is rather an Osmose issue. I'm closing the thread.
Yes. Running the migration with 2.0.1 works fine. 
Here you go - http://wizrd.tk/r7j6d1 
It doesn't depend on if I use additional subfolders or not. My context menu contains both "Send to Tablet" and "Send to Subfolder on Tablet" (sic) entries, the latter also contains the name of the target subfolder.  What is supposed to happen when two items from different collections are sent to their respective subfolder? 
I am interested in submitting a PR. I will try this today.

@imasahiro: Thank you for having a look at this.  The application works fine with `2.1.12.RELEASE`, but I get a `NullPointerException` when I change to a newer version of Spring Boot `2.2.4` or `2.3.0.M1`.  It is a Kotlin Spring Boot app. The gradle dependencies are:   
I fixed it already. The problematic code were: https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/commit/0c145b1d875f1cbd7f6461f0871b066d6b06add7  As result it showed blank page... without redirect user to right place. In this and in few next commits I fixed logic. Closing this issue. 
According to code the issue is only with root page, children pages are not affected.
Logs here: [debug-logs.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/files/409548/debug-logs.zip)  All of the logs are against the squid proxy with authentication enabled (required).  The URL used as an HTTPS target was `https://www.reddit.com` and the non-HTTPS target was `http://www.wired.com`.  When I was debugging, I also saw something similar as was reported in #408 where @smatei says:  > It seems that in HttpRequest.BuildURI, an URI is created from "www.google.com:443", that has no protocol.  Of interest in _debug_log1.log_ is this line (resulting of the BuildURI issue):    are **removed**, the authenticator _is_ found, but still blows up later, after authentication.

Sorry it was Jetty 9.4.19.v20199010.  I am running this with Spring Boot, so the Jetty server is embedded.    Here is a complete spring boot app you can run that shows the problem.  [demo.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/files/3631833/demo.zip)  Interestingly, I noticed that Tomcat also throws an UnsupportedOperationException in this scenario.  A stackoverflow question that discusses this issue with respect to Tomcat (albeit with adding a ServletListener instead of a Servlet) is [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44389716/spring-boot-embedded-tomcat-weblistener-scanned-by-servletcomponentscan).

@thboileau Yes I can see the payload now in the browser (but just after applying a fix), here:   http://www.pastekit.com/lWAg6 
Sorry. I'm failing to build the 0.34 version of GHDL.
@ktoso. Will do now.  Did you try the steps in the example to reproduce on your system?  On mine, I most definitely see the problem. 
it doesn't happen with schematics, I must've not written the title correctly at 4 am. XD I meant that some blocks have a chance to tesselate, for example I crash instantly when joining a server because one of the stairs/stone bricks tesselates. sometimes from someone placing a block, it tesselates, but personally I never saw it happen from me placing a block nor schematics. 
im using 7.1.14. with buildcraft compat 7.1.3

I call the method dynamically with different colors as mentioned in #179 . The Fix I suggested is working for Lollipop and above. I didn't check it back then on pre - lollipop devices. 
[20151220_011920_Two Player Duel_1.txt](https://github.com/magefree/mage/files/67650/20151220_011920_Two.Player.Duel_1.txt) this an example gamelog. I've got two Cutthroats on the battlefield, sac one of them, only one of them triggers (should be two). 
There is no way to find out the console URL programmatically. We really tried hard, and there is none. For minishift and other similar installations you can try to guess, but it completely fails on OSO and other larger cluster installation. We could start to probe certain known patterns, but it will never be perfect as long as OpenShift doesn't offer the console URL via API. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/20447) for this, but I doubt this will ever happen soon.  We had this issue also for 7.0 and we decided, that from the two options we had, to make the console URL the only mandatory argument for the user to provide or just don't render the link when the URL is not given, we prefer the "don't render the link" as it's a minor feature which would be not available then (and which btw doesn't work all the time anyway, even when the console URL is given), so we didn't want to go from "parameterless installation" to "force the user to find out the console URL before he can install syndesis".  As said, this was the decision for 7.0 and as I haven't heard that we changed our mind since then, I consider it a bug that the link is rendered when the console url is not provided (so an empty string in the configmap)
Yep, that's all. Also for UISCoped by te way.
i found the pom.xml has 2.0.0-alpha.6-SNAPSHOT i merge the feature [surround search button] last day ,i think the problem is this  (｡･ω･)ﾉﾞ 
Sure. 
It's pretty hard to replicate, I've only had it happen once since posting the crash report and I have no idea what triggers it but I think it has to do with setting insane speeds on it and spamming the control block...  From what players have told me, the issue happened once while placing a second caller next to an existing caller. The other time, the issue happened from setting very fast speed on the elevator and spamming the caller block. Interesting enough, one of the two caller blocks disappeared entirely and then as soon as the one next to it was clicked, the crash occurred.  If I can find a good way to replicate this i'll letcha know. 
i also have a table named intd_project_approval,this is table : create table INTD_PROJECT_APPROVAL (   id               VARCHAR2(32) not null,   project_no       VARCHAR2(50),   project_name     VARCHAR2(100),   parent_id        VARCHAR2(36),   issue_num        VARCHAR2(36),   agency           VARCHAR2(36),   dcr_name         VARCHAR2(50),   releas_eperson   VARCHAR2(200),   bond_type        VARCHAR2(10),   first_consignee  VARCHAR2(100),   second_consignee VARCHAR2(100),   publish_way      VARCHAR2(5),   is_start         VARCHAR2(2),   year             VARCHAR2(4),   periods          VARCHAR2(2),   reg_amount       NUMBER(20,2),   benci_amount     NUMBER(20,2),   bencibank_amount NUMBER(20,2),   bank_share       NUMBER(20,2),   dead_line        NUMBER(20),   units            VARCHAR2(1),   nianhua_rate     NUMBER(20,4),   follow_bank      VARCHAR2(10),   rating_org       VARCHAR2(32),   rating           VARCHAR2(4),   bond_rate        VARCHAR2(10),   assure_condition VARCHAR2(2000),   remark           VARCHAR2(2000),   eftflag          VARCHAR2(1),   stage_code       VARCHAR2(15),   create_time      TIMESTAMP(6),   create_user      VARCHAR2(32),   update_time      TIMESTAMP(6),   update_user      VARCHAR2(32) ) 
i am on that version, and ill check. If you would like i can bring you onto my ts and talk and see that pack that i am using. see if anything to do with it can be repoduced by you as well. 
Yes, removing the tool if it fails, and resetting the command in order to do it again with a new name. 
Yes to both questions. I have a custom image for every account. 
I suppose I could try that but it doesn't make the above any less of a bug, so... For example if you already have an item stored in a variable - then you can't use the syntax suggested above without resetting the properties of the item inside the variable.  Also if you have for example ~10 lines of lore with specific things stored on certain lines then using one line lore makes modifying the data cumbersome. 
>Transformers are bugged? >Yes  Ideal transformers shouldn't act as pictures demonstrate. In general, not zeroing the currents and voltages on reset causes loads of issues with the simulator.

Sure I can claus.  First one is when I click on delete. ![bug_activemq_delete1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3993776/5355285/08b96b3a-7f92-11e4-8732-1ec5b7d7da69.png) Second one is when I close the body window. ![bug_activemq_delete2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3993776/5355286/09b36054-7f92-11e4-97cf-6f09fc2e48ed.png)  I use hawtio 1.4.40  I'm also using Firefox 33.1.1 (Damn James, seems like I'm the only one using and liking Firefox xD)  
Have not tried the build yet, this is the first problem I've had with android studio though. Been fine thus far. 
@koppor, thank you for your reply. Concerning "User-specific file directory" I will reply to that tomorrow, when I have multiple users in the database environment. We have a common user logging in the database, so the general directory was false. Definitely the documentation needs more clarification! Concerning the groups I will put my two cents in #1495, since in a shared database things are missing! 
Thankyou
@slemeur I'm not convinced this is related, as this is not the same issue as https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/6114
I'm quite sure we are closing the response properly, otherwise the file descriptors should also skyrocket during the run that has no cache in place, right? However to make sure that my understanding of kotlins [`use`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.io/use.html) and suspend functions ([`suspendCancellableCoroutine`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/suspend-cancellable-coroutine.html)) is not failing me, here is how the requests are triggered:   I also just decompiled the result and it looks like the `use` just wraps the whole block into a big `try{...}finally{response.close()}`
It works for me as well, sadly only on certain phatloots. Some of them don't work. Spigot 1.9.4, last PhatLoots version. 
If there is no impact, is it expected to log it as a warning? I'd expect us to be more silent.
At least the BlueMana(1) part is a call to a method that returns a Mana object. https://github.com/magefree/mage/blob/master/Mage/src/mage/Mana.java Names were defined a long time ago and they are ok in my opinion. 
Sure, here's a minimal maven project that triggers the error when built with e.g. mvn clean install. [testproject.zip](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/yauaa/files/3253520/testproject.zip)

You're right. I can compile with these.  1. Delete Ivy's cache  to build.sbt.  I could move all my sbt projects from JavaCPP 1.5.1 to 1.5.2. I checked both Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04. Thank you! I will close this issue. 
@dmzaytsev  I'm missing the meaning of word `potential` here. Who are potential friends? What is the algorithm of deciding whether it is a friend or not?     It is current user alias? If yes why it is not encapsulated into the User class itself?

liach: just what I saw in JEI. It will be a bit before I can provide full details about Forge version, loaded mods, etc. Finals week is busy.  Note that IC2 is loaded, and these loaders were separate from the RF loader and unloader.
Sure, I did a search before opening this issue and didn't find that issue, but yes is a duplicate
@stuartwdouglas thanks for responding. I haven't been able to inject SSE into a field (doesn't break startup, but the variable is null) nor a resource method (breaks startup). I was able to inject most of the other things that `@Context` provides (`UriInfo` and others like I said in the issue body). I can also confirm that `@Context` is being resolved by Arc - removing the annotation or replacing it with `@Inject` results in a bunch of NPEs
Thanks for the quick reply!  It's a work project, and it has happened on two unrelated projects.  Let me see if I can get a minimal working reproduction.
Greg - Not sure which commit, but i downloaded the code on Feb 5 2015. Yes it is happening when i initiate a new connection (new BoxAPIConnection) with the token from database. 
Changes from 192.168.0.104(Public IP received from Router DHCP pool) to 192.168.56.101(Local IP - accessible only on local machine). 
To be honest, no idea :) The trace shows a job request but I don't have context, it's one of the client who sent it.  The only thing I know: - client version 3.182.2281 (so svn182) - it's a windows - it's a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770 CPU @ 3.40GHz 
De-icing is not a choice. What you meant is de-misting. I think it is still simply too cold for the AC mode to kick in (but maybe it is warmer where you are).  What the field SHOULD indicate is how the coolant circuit is switched: de-ice the main radiator, cool, or heat. My advise would be to leave it like this until summer. 
Hi, apologies for the misleading issue above I have finally reproduced with curl (I had missed something from my mapping previously). This seems to be cause by nested fields. In the last step outlined below there are 2 results. If the mapping for entityContent is removed then there are no results (this is correct)  N.B. Not sure if this helps or not but this is a regression from 1.7.3 caught by one of our tests as part of me upgrading to 2.1.0  Steps:   
Correct. Just tried again to confirm:  If I have only AppleCore installed, no other mods, food heals me even with naturalRegeneration is off.  If I close out Minecraft, delete AppleCore, and run pure vanilla Forge Minecraft on that same world, the gamerule works properly and I do not heal.  Note that I used the same save for both tests, so I definitely spelled the gamerule right since I only typed it out once (EDIT: That is, the gamerule was spelled right because when AppleCore was removed the rule took effect) 
Hmm. Don't know I have just been seeing it in the log lately. 
yeah 1.3.71 and both ssp and smp ( I test it at the moment)  I don't know which version but I think .69 worked fine in SSP (couldn't test it on my smp) and I don't have it anymore :(  here some screens: http://imgur.com/csSXl8z,2iSFtfG,qmuKkXE,sWQtWyV,yybX6Q9,mEWkMRC 
StyleTable example, i try the code.   
Same glitch exists in AnkiDroid 2.8 installed via apkg.
@davidpricedev that a good question since I dont get any error messages. I just crashes. Will try to runt it with xcode and see if I get any messages from there.
Thanks for your quick reply. I change the log level to DEBUG. I just got the data of PageUsage 1 time, after that, i could not get that info again...  
For some reason, I can connect now with a different IP address/different route to the server. I've no idea what caused the error, in both cases I used IPv6 (a double-hop VPN connection). The problem persists with the first IPv6/route. It's inscrutable to me. May be there was a IPv6/IPv4 routing issue with the one route, but that's only an airy guess. - Because I can connect now, the issue can be closed, I think. Sorry for the buzz. Thank your for looking into the issue.
Related to #4164.
1. Set NO_CACHE 
With the latest changes on the ZTE Racer the map is no longer corrupted, however it still doesn't draw correctly, it's drawn with a blue/green tint, furthermore two copies of the map are drawn, one at the top left and one at the top right.  ---  |    BLUE     |   |    GREEN   | |    MAP       |   |      MAP      | |                   |   |                   | |_________|   |__________| |                                          | |                                          | |_____________________|   It would appear that the only PixelFormat that renders the map correctly on this device is PixelFormat.RGB_565, not sure about other devices pre Jelly Bean though.  On a Samsung Galaxy S4 the change from using 0x00000000 to android.R.color.transparent re-introduces the black map background on load. 
Using Forge 13.20.0.2285, LittleTiles version 1.4.8. This is on 1.11.2 of Minecraft. Basically use the hammer to make blocks into the little tiles blocks (i did 16x16x16 in the hammer) place those blocks down and then break those blocks with a vanilla pickaxe and you get 2 blocks when you break the block.
@ywelsch, thanks for your comment. Currently, we limit node_concurrent_recoveries setting <=50 in our product environment version based on 6.4.3 as follow,  Please give us some suggestions if you have, thanks a lot.
Hi, no, as I mentioned, it doesn't happen on my Galaxy Nexus.  But it's obvious by looking at the code that it relies on the order in which getView() is called for the various rows.   Since the caches are just queues (FIFO), If called out of order, they can end up with more than one item which are not retrieved in the right order causing this problem.  This doesn't seem to happen on my device, but it happens reproducibly did on my tester's device.  My "fix", which is a huge hack, throws away the cache if any of them end up with more than one item.  In effect, the cache just because a single variable. 
Still broken.
@jmcphers The only difference with #2642 is that it happens if I resize any column, not just the last one. But otherwise, the behavior is the same. Would you still consider that a duplicate? I'll add this detail.  This happens both with Firefox and Chrome on MacOS 10.14 and Windows 10.
Yes. The plane was able to move outside of the hangar. I had even thought that an aircraft can't move when standing on steel scaffolding slabs, I had replaced them with a vanilla wool, but this did not help. 
I have a smooth Spgiot server. Unfortunately I do not know how to do GIF, but I do not want to make a video. Maybe I can see a picture, but you can not see what the mistake is. Because when I go forward and I turn (eg right) you throw it back a block.
I don't understand what you mean by "it will collide with defaults for test run configuration".  Can you explain?  
HEllo  i have no eclipse on my pc. i have just install dbeaver 4.3 community edition.  i dowloaded all the sources files on https://dbeaver.jkiss.org/update/office/latest/ and create the same paths locally.   after i load the content.xml and i have the error,   see details in attachment   [office_dbeaver.docx](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/files/1588808/office_dbeaver.docx)  
@spencergibb Sure. Here are the steps to test/reproduce:  - Start a rabbit instance and the `config-server-sample` - Create `config-client-sample.yml` under `/tmp/config-sample`:    - Start the `config-client-sample`and `GET :3000/` You'll get the value in the `greeting` property - Now change the value in the configuration file (`/tmp/config-sample/config-client-sample.yml`) to something else   - The config server will pick this change and broadcast an event   - The config client will retrieve the new value and return it on subsequent GET requests  **Now the Bug**: - Change the value of `spring.cloud.bus.id` in the `bootstrap.yml` of the `config-server-sample` to anything other than `config-server-sample-1` - Config server wont send any RemoteApplicationEvents when changing the `greeting` property in `config-client-sample.yml`  More generally, if the value of `spring.cloud.bus.id` is not `${spring.application.name}-1` the `RemoteApplicationEvents` wont be sent  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I could provide a `docker-compose` to streamline this process if you want, however I wont be able to do it till later today or tomorrow.  
That means even if I right-click on column name(header of the task list), for example start date, the sorting will be triggered as well. 
Hi @aaberg , Thanks for your fast response, cool. I use sql2o 1.6.0-RC3 & postgresql 9.4-1206-jdbc4 and also I tried hsqldb 2.3.4.  Regards
Ok - super thanks.  We will try that.  We have been trying to test a target production like config and conscious of the overhead of VM creation, it was simpler to use a smaller number of VM's with a couple of Stroom's per node.   The test data set sizes are tiny compared to production, so even with a non-performance optimised environment, we were not expecting any problems. 
Yes. " (even choosing a Chinese font)". I chose the replacement font, then page 2 "task report(page 1 and 2)" display correctly, but not the gantt chart(page 3 and 4). ![g3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31975886/30463748-2d1dfd98-9a00-11e7-899e-5377baca902c.PNG) 
#109 screenshot includes some values below 15 (but above 10). I'm currently indoor, lowest I'm seeing is 10.3 for one of the GLONASS satellites, lowest for GPS is ~12.4.  Er, scratch that, just got an 8.9 for GPS 17 and a 9.9 for GPS 19, 8.1 for GPS 25. Temporary interference. All values were below 30 when this happened.
methodName_args are the defaults as defined in the thrift file, right? That's mainly for programming convenience, and especially for supporting optional parameters but not useful for populating a debug form I think - for example, imagine a user_id field, no one's going to put a default user id in the thrift file. 
Datasource is configured via Spring Boot, using HikariCP (version 2.7.8). Datasource-related configuration in `application.properties` is as follows:   If this doesn't help, I'll try to produce minimal test project.
From my point of view, making getUrl throw on non optional parameters and adding getUrlBase would already make the API much better.
Hi,  After setting this option to false, the problem is no longer encoutered. Thanks.  The problem is I am working on a protected project, perhaps is there a way to communicate you my ontology without letting everybody access to it?  Kinds regards,  GA
It seems that using a `ViewPropertyAnimator` on the progress bar triggers the issue.   
Hi @luigidellaquila  Maybe it was bug _github.com_  Do you see my issue completely? like this ![issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7984378/12445599/d7d54512-bf6d-11e5-95f6-ce5e357dc66b.jpg)  because my friend from other country sees my issue like this  ![badissue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7984378/12445906/c6737e54-bf6f-11e5-806d-876559e40de8.jpg)

I won't find the time to setup this environment in the near future. :-( However, if there are any simpler ways to provide additional information, I'd be happy to provide it.
Since the errors are usually the same (similar?) for the scope of 1.3 I'd say it's ok to show only the first.  @jelkosz opinion? 
I did receive the ability after the crash. I also attempted to get a haste buff but crashed again. i don't think that crash was related to your mod. It had something to do with creepers and i fixed that. I'll do some more testing and let you know what i find. 
Thanks I get it now. I have to do re.compile first.
Sorry, I upgraded from v0.91.4.0.
I still trying to fix freaking issue with Homebrew which explains why I am still awake.

Unfortunately I don't know how to modify AndroidApplication.java and then test if changing the order would help. (Everything I tried resulted in error) 
When a function 'a' use a function 'b', but the function 'b' is not declare yet, it should return "function doesn't exists"

Hi @racodond,  I can confirm that issue is fixed in 4.9.  Thanks you!
In the client side, I'm using StandardWebSocketClient. While handshaking, it is trying to extract port number from the URL, but container's public url doesnt have port number at the end: `wss://server2v4p7rik-dedicated-container-server-6000.mydomain.com/chat`   So, the websocket client is trying to use the privileged port no. 443 (?)  In order to overcome this, i had to use authbind to bind exposed port 443 to springboot websocket port 6000.
I have updated master to use guava 20.0 and made sure it was compatible.  I have also made sure it was compatible back to guava 15.0, with most functionality (no IPv6) working with 14.0.  Guava 21.0 is only Java8 compatible, so I opened up a new ticket #211 for adding java 8 functionality, but figure that is a little out of scope for a 2.0.0 release which is long overdue.
I think the only fix needed is to check the servlet version as early as possible. Does not matter if older Tomcats can't find routes if the old servlet versions blocks deployment with a clear message before it even gets to scanning (or not scanning)
@ddementieva I tried to ping the github manually inside the container.  I got the output as  'ping: unknown host github.com' .  I guess you are right there is no network in the container.  It would be great if you help me to solve this issue. 
Yes Philip, when I add baseProduct from admin, I'm getting this exception. It is updating in DB, but in BLC_SKU table, the DEFAULT_PRODUCT_ID is NULL, if I correct is using BLC_PRODUCT then I can see that product in the list of products, otherwise it will list like below screenshot, which I'm not able to add to any category.  ![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6489746/2049318/50533658-8a5e-11e3-8437-0750f5edbfec.png) 
Yes the damage is enabled and it was a normal gate, not a pegasus gate. All damage is taken by my armor and more testing showd that a protection IV enchanted endstell armor from EnderIO can save your life too.
I think either is fine.   Most people using docker are used to doing `docker run myimage` which docker translates to `docker run myimage:lastest`. I don't know why you would ever want to assume that `myimage` without a tag is anything other than `myimage:latest` unless docker started adopting something different. 
Yes, the .symlist have `$`-signs in them, too.  Here, for example, is CRSXC_CD.symlist:    Not everywhere, as you see, but almost.  P.S. This is all on a debian 'jessie' system with - sed (GNU sed) 4.2.2 - GNU Awk 4.1.1, API: 1.1 (GNU MPFR 3.1.2-p3, GNU MP 6.0.0) - /bin/sh → /bin/dash

yes, I already tried with teardown thread group, and it works that way

1. The exception is in our code. It's caused by the infinite state we keep. 2. Yes. It's a custom implementation. It's based on your code, but we implement our custom logic.  I'll explain in more detail.   We'd like to be 100% certain about the vehicle position. Unfortunately barefoot doesn't allow that at the moment. Yes you can get the best estimate, but it's often wrong. Here's an example. https://www.darrinward.com/lat-long/?id=5a684e31786528.24392522 I hope what I draw makes sence.  S - state vector C - candidate  S(0)  C1(5%) C2(20%) C3(74%) (most probable, but still wrong) C4(11%)  .....after N points, S(N)...S(0)   S(0)   C2(40%) - the only one left. Now you know for sure this is the correct position.    To get this behaviour we implement our oun logic. We have a wrapper around your KState, that alows us to peek into your private data. We keep the state untill there is only one candidate left in sequence.peekFirst().one(). At this point we mark the point as correctly matched and we cut off the state. It worked perfectly with version 0.1.1.  But with the new version we get ![kstate-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25247356/35325864-a72aed80-00fd-11e8-9595-4d50d0fa6ec5.png)    C3 is still wrong. There are no transitions from this one to the next position, but it's still here because it was the best estimate at S(0)  So now our custom logic doesn't work, and we are left with an infinite state. I hope what I said makes sence.

No, the message was not received by the recipient. That's how I noticed it hadn't been sent (I didn't get a response).  I normally go back into the app to see that it says "Delivered", but on this particular occasion I was in a hurry and wanted to respond quickly, so I immediately shut off the screen after pressing the Send button. Not sure if it had something to do with that.
@Gitschubser  Thanks a lot, that explains it perfectly! I wish that info had been found in the API pages and not hidden away with different labels on the [FAQ](http://wiki.opencellid.org/wiki/FAQ) page. ;)  **Long CellID vs. short Cell ID** (CellID vs CID):  > The formula for the long cell ID is as follows: > Long CID = 65536 \* RNC + CID >  > RNC: the Radio Network Controller > CID: a short cell ID (an integer in the range of 0 to 65535) >  > If you have the Long CID, you can get RNC and CID in the following way: > RNC = Long CID / 65536 (integer division) > CID = Long CID mod 65536 (modulo operation) >  > Example for long cell ID 66808694: > RNC = 66808694 / 65536 = 1019 > CID = 66808694 mod 65536 = 27510  
I tried version 1.43.4 What was wrong with my try? [Example.zip](https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/files/4169655/Example.zip) 
so far i understand githud (never used it before) i can only edit i file at a time. but many changes require more than one file to alter. 
I get the same result using 5.1.0. I've actually been seeing this behavior for more than a week now. I was very busy on other projects and didn't have time to thoroughly test & report it.
Adding the clojars-repo to the pom doesn't work. Tried that. Setting up a normal maven project (no SDK-based project) gives the same problem. Was just wondering if the Alfresco SDK contained something to fix this clojars-issue.

Indeed, I am using 2.2.15, java document api.  The previous issue occurs when I use remote url, if I change the url to plocal, then I got   java.lang.ClassCastException: [B cannot be cast to java.lang.Number 	at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.serialization.serializer.record.binary.ORecordSerializerBinaryV0.serializeValue(ORecordSerializerBinaryV0.java:680) 	at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.serialization.serializer.record.binary.ORecordSerializerBinaryV0.serialize(ORecordSerializerBinaryV0.java:383) 	at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.serialization.serializer.record.binary.ORecordSerializerBinary.toStream(ORecordSerializerBinary.java:99) 	at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.impl.ODocument.toStream(ODocument.java:2378) 	at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.impl.ODocument.toStream(ODocument.java:664) 	at com.orientechnologies.orient.core.db.document.ODatabaseDocumentTx.executeSaveRecord(ODatabaseDocumentTx.java:2157)   And this exception is not caught on updating a record, but on saving a record for the first time. By the way, in my test, my binary data is just 18 bytes. I would say this is some very basic operation, why I got exception? Do I have something very wrong? By the way, if the Test1.s is not readonly, then there is no such exception. 
the guy spawning in the ground, was a one time thing ( I could not replicate it)  so I posted it as a, haha :) 
1. I wasn't able to reproduce it on my own, but it doesn't matter. The issue exists. 2. The last one --> 1.4 3. Yes

Sure. It's work in progress, but it is a valid lexer/parser grammer. They can be generated to Java without any errors.  [CoolLexerParser.zip](https://github.com/antlr4ide/antlr4ide/files/984562/CoolLexerParser.zip)  
Yes, Shuttle has the same exact issue.  Tried ID3 Fixer and selecting the "fix android database" on the songs fixed it (though I had to do it for the entire album, including songs that weren't affected, so they would get merged under the same album properly), thanks a lot! 
ver me.relex:circleindicator:1.1.8  I know about the updating issue, so I update PagerAdapter by setting new adapter. like this:  ` mViewPager.setAdapter(new ProfileAdapter(getSupportFragmentManager(), data.getResult())); mCircleIndicator.setViewPager(mViewPager); ` 
I had looked at these before, but I had not noticed that I was running JRE 1.8.0_131-b11. I updated my Java to 1.8.0_151-b12 and now things are working fine. Thanks for helping me out!

SD card. One more thing I've noticed: I went out, took some photos, and when I connected WiFi and plugged in the charger, they were synced properly - so the behavior I reported isn't consistent.

bamboo.buildKey is replaced by bamboo_buildKey for env vars. (verified and tested). For ``bamboo.planRepository.<position>.branchName``, I didn't have the issue. 
Yes I did. I believe this is caused by this piece of code:  stackmob.listeners.ServerLoad ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17891302/57985289-87f17f00-7a1a-11e9-8e37-4a87ed848a44.png)  If you swap peroid and 100 I think it should work.  Thanks.
Looks like Bazel is not included in the repository as you mentioned. Should I do apt-add?
If a project is stored in TFS source control, files are ready-only unless checked out for edit.  And just in general, files can be marked read-only to prevent modification -- strange I have to state that explicitly.
 I get a red line under "satisfies Bar&Alias", and when I mouse over the stated error appears.

@nicolas-raoul  Yeah, I will work on it after I complete the current one. 
I don't see any way to import directly from a ZIP anymore, so it's not an issue.
My encoder will encode a json string as 2 bytes offset, then json string bytes.

Thanks for reply so quickly. I think #27 provides a good way to reproduce it. Based on my understanding, SlaveServer shutdown will cause its TcpRosServer's outgoingChannel to be null. In that case, calling  in the for loop will trigger a NPE in advertiseAddress.toUri(), because advertiseAddress's portCallable require a non-null outgoingChannel. It is not clear to me why it is not happened all the time. The only functional consequences I can think of are some residual rosjava processes after shutdown.
I tried checking Travis, didn't see an obvious second build. Maybe we could have Gnag report the Travis build number in comments, or include a link back to the Travis job? Could be configurable to be CI-system-agnostic, of course.

Nope. Here's a recording:  ![shiny-deploy 2018-12-05 11_30_22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86978/49532015-3ba5ee80-f881-11e8-8112-ed4850a6c9e3.gif)  This seems to happen only for the first deployment of the app. If I redeploy, then everything happens quickly.
Sorry, it's company code. You can actually see the problem in the screenshot. All urls are created just fine, just the one inside the health panel adds an IP and port to the url.

Java tests, that interact with the outside world, to be precise. Provided there is a test, that interacts with outside world via network, running it in bazel sandbox - fail the test because of the network blocking (as expected). Running same test in debug mode - passes the test.  It isn't a critical issue, but it comes to be a nuisance when investigating the test failures  The most basic idea that comes mind - is it possible to block network for all, but debugger traffic?
I'm running 0.5.1, I'll see if I can check an earlier version. I'm playing on Win7 with Java 7. The issue is ubiquitous. I have it just starting a new world and it doesn't ever get better, no matter what I do or don't do (well, besides the even lower FPS spikes when the world loads/generates of course). Just to mention it, there is at least one other player on the server with this issue, but also most people are fine (or at least not as bad as we are). 
Hi Yaron, I'll try those steps tonight at home when I have the device again. Thanks for mentioning the permissions step.

Same with both Oracle 7 and 8.
Outdated issue
type of server is just a regular forge server, mod list inclosed in pastebin.  http://pastebin.com/W1ba9BZq 
I tried it there too: enter "Monte..." chose from list "Montevideo, Uruguay" error message as above. 
 
With a new config it works as it should work. Thanks!
Yes, i tried v0.0.5-beta and v0.0.6-beta. 
Those failures are only encountered while running a travis build. Feels like a very rare random occurring bug. I prefer to proceed with #617. After that i can investigate more.
@p works with the nearest player, the mots time the player that pushes the button. also at that time only one player was there. It shouldremove 100 Gold from the nearest player @p, but it only worked with all player, @a

And it's only the tier 1, when upgrading to tier 2 the torches are placed by the builder. [edit] Almost forgot: Repairing doesn't help either. Actually I put a torch myself there for testing and the builder rather removed this torch, so the builder did repair it but no torches placed. [/edit]  About the seeds: He took 1 stack and planted then all, but it was a 11x11 farm (minus 4 watersources and the scarecrow) so he had 52 places left which he tilled but didn't plant anything. I tested now and took half the field away and spread the seeds in the entire inventory of the farm-building (so that slot 1 to 27 all had 1 seed to take) but he really only took the seed in slot 1 and ignored all others.  [edit] Some more testing with the seeds: - The AI seems to understand scanning through all inventory-slots.   I put a torch in the first slot and then filled the rest with seeds again. Now he ignored the torch in Slot 1, took the seed in Slot 2 and ignored the seeds in slot 3-27. - It seems he gets stucked on an "empty" slot in the inventory. - The seeds he harvest he then plants, since he put them in the first empty slot he finds and then finds the seeds before getting stucked on empty slots again. 
Any shaders cause the case. You can use the YouTubers' Dream Shaders [download link](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/youtuber-dream-shaders/).

@stefanomorson I was able to reproduce it following the steps described above.  Try this:  1. Browser should be full-sized before test.  2. Connect a live kura device to kapua  3. Go to Devices, select live connected device and go to its _**Configuration**_ 4. Select _**Position service**_ and verticlly resize bottom window (the _**Configuration**_ window) and shrink (horizontally resize) the whole browser window. _**Now all the unnecessary sliders should appear.**_

Thanks for the quick fix :) much appreciated!  As far as the boot logging you were interested in, here's a comparison between 2.1.3:    as I understand it the SLAVE response for ip xxx.yyy.zzz.67 is arriving in a separate packet before xxx.yyy.zzz.65, which seems to be overwriting (or somehow losing) the response from 67.  If you want me to log a separate issue for this let me know and I'd be happy to.  Thanks again! 
Yes, the fix will be included in 2.7.0. Probably next week, if there's no issue with the release candidate.

2 . Find a gif here: https://gfycat.com/WarmEqualImperialeagle all the failures are when I press the enter key, I can get out with the mouse or by pressing tab (nevermind the overflows, this is because of the column type). Just realised that this only happens with the regular enter key, numpad enter works as intended. 3 . Is this new ? I was able to save with CTRL+S before, CTRL+ALT+S works fine though, thanks. 
No OpenShift involved. Sorry, I wrote `minishift` but it's `minikube`.  The command is simply `mvn install`.  It seems that there is a mismatch between the documentation and the sources:  Looking at https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/fabric8/maven/core/config/ResourceConfig.java  , it seems that the `<deployment>` element is not supposed to be there at all.  I have tried with all minor FMP versions down to 3.2.1 and it seems that the `<deployment>` element never worked. I wonder what does the documentation refer to. Perhaps I am applying it at wrong place?
> Do the fake blocks apper in the same place in each paste?  If you look at the top image, they seem to be random, but huge swaths each time, and it is not the same each layer, that was pasted. 
If have checked this now with several tasks. When pin and un-pin them before a reboot, such tasks will not reappear.
I'm not familiar with JVM profiling so some instructions would be nice. I tested with empty ritual pedestals, empty ritual pedestals on the marble structure under it, and active ritual pedestals. The chunk updates were consistent throughout them all. 
I took a look in our Sentry and the oldest problem of this kind happens directly after the update of metrics from 3.1.2 to 3.2.0.  I took a short look at #1063 but found no reason, why it can cause this problem, because it just shortens the measurements map. But maybe I am wrong.
Maithem, there is no single test case. It's all random chance in a race, as far as I can tell. It's easy to generate the needed load, using QC.  QC is currently using all (10+, I forget the count) API functions in the SMRMap. I could try to reduce the API range if there is a smaller fraction of the ops that can still trigger it. And also using some printf() to see how many concurrent updates to the map are necessary.  -Scott

I think it happens when rotating the phone while viewing lynx. The OS is 5.1.1 and the device is a Samsung On5. The app has been obfuscated.
It's from the Java guide, see https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-guide-for-java-devs/blob/master/step-8/src/main/java/io/vertx/guides/wiki/database/WikiDatabaseService.java
That's on the develop branch with no additional patches applied. I take a photo in portrait orientation then while the image is semi-transparent with a progressbar below I rotate the phone to landscape orientation and wait for it to finish. Then there are two photos displayed. If I rotate the phone back to portrait it all becomes normal, only one instance is visible.
@sav007 thank for you replay. I try downloaded schema.json not using apollo-cli https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cli but manually created introspection query from https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/utilities/introspectionQuery.js, add seems to be working correctly now. 
I think the most recently added should be the most specific.  It already has a pater of default overrriding so I would follow that  So adding them to the head of the list seems best to me 
yes its similar....i will send the code... 
node version is 6.9.1  
Yea @oprisnik that's still happening with v14.0.1. I updated yesterday to check and seems like that's still the case. 
So, after a restart the Mediator sees the state as OPEN which is what I would have expected. I only closed Bob's ticket so it is probably a UI bug somewhere where it marked both rows as CLOSED even though only Alice's should have been CLOSED.  I've updated the description to make it more clear what actions I took.

Yes. Updating the IDs to use the panel index every time `updatePanelIndices` is called would be a good solution. 
I don't know. I haven't been using 1.3. 
I assumed it was because while we now clean at most once, it is only if you use either pinning, or access the cleaned certs. We didn't previously clean if it was enough that the SSL handshake code (Android or JVM) found a valid chain to the known root CA.  And the root CA doesn't need to be in the list provided by the server IIUC.  I'll try to prove we use the same certs for verifying.  I hope it's not a new bug, prefer it to a broken assumption with self signed certs. :)
I tried "\u0004" (EOF), "\n\n", "\r\r", "\u0000" but without luck — they are copied by `cat` to stdout as ordinary characters and the process doesn't end.

It´s a `Sony Xperia Z1`. Generally the Lollipop CM12 works pretty stable for such early nightly.  I think I could use logcat to see what happens when running AIMSICD? 
It's fairly simple to test... just create a web worker.js file with the following...    Watch the javascript console to see the errors.  Essentially, Dojo and Jquery both attempt to use items that are not available to Web Worker scripts (window, document, etc). The likely correct answer is to use an alternative Library implementation designed specifically for use within the limited Web Worker environment, with the acknowledgement that doing so might mean limiting some of the SDK features (authentication might get a bit weird, for instance).   This would not necessarily be a simple fix, unfortunately. 
Yes, I do. When I initialize my fragment, the setPosition() work, but when I call this method on a Listening, this not work
Well primarily, I am looking to pass all read/writes to the DiskLruCache through encryption/decryption streams.  Facebook has made a surprisingly efficient library called Conceal that must have had an enormous amount of manpower to develop. It is extremely fast and I have successfully implemented and integrated a file encryption class that utilizes Conceal to wrap DiskLruCache.  It is fast and works on every device I've seen.  So if there is an opportunity to expose the raw input/output streams to DiskLruCache in your new implementation, it should be possible to hook in libraries like these.  I would gladly contribute if you all think this is possible.

so if for testing purposes, if I need to go to -1,10,-1 often because it's a boss location, I could assign the address "boss" to to the coordinate -1,10,-1 and from then on, I could type teleport boss instead of -1,10,-1 (just to make it easier). and hm, maybe it was a mapping discrepancy between us. if it works now, that's fine. And yeah, current coordinate would only make sense for the test profile.

@jgrandja Would be happy to provide the PR.  Do you think it is of any value, if I also provide a PR with an optional facility that allows to limit the amount of `OAuth2AuthorizationRequest`s for a single session. This could be an additional session attribute backed by a size limited `LinkedHashMap` containing the `state` values as keys and an empty object as value (this would have the benefit that existing sessions can be de-serialized).

Okay the rotate script doesn't work without FAWE. But to be fair... WorldEdit has problems with scrips in general. It can't even execute one of the build scripts.

I was trying to combine a diamond on my tinkers pickaxe on a tool forge and then it started to clone whenever I move my mouse onto a slot and when I placed the pickaxe on the center, it also cloned on other slots in the tool forge. I’m sorry I couldn’t describe it correctly.
What I have is:  https://github.com/ktf/AliceO2/tree/bazel-support  where you can for example do `bazel build @root//:cling`. Given this is a subset of tensorflow (i.e. the part which builds llvm), plus some extra stuff to build parts of clang, I am surprised this is not a common issue. Notice I build on my local laptop (2015 MBP) with no external cache.
Thanks David. 
In the second example, I was expecting the "Join Lines" to be grayed out, because the result will introduce a syntax error, and we are talking about an IDE who understands the syntax of the language, not a simple text editor that treats each line as "text".  I just checked PyCharm, and it behaves like in the Erlang case:    which is funny :-)  Up to you to decide if the second case is expected behavior or a bug. 
Sometimes, when the player destroys the cart, the cart the player is in will teleport into the ground. I've noticed the game freezes for a second, you'll see into the world and glitch back and forth (you can't exit the minecart), and then it kicks you out with the error. Any further attempts to rejoin result in "Internal Server Error" with the following crash:   EDIT2: For some reason I can't reproduce it now. I didn't modify anything, but it's only happened once since my report. But I do know that my steps show exactly what I was doing when I did have the issue.
@Massedil Best to send one of the drafts to the maintainers.  I'll send them my requested mail too, missed the first reply 
They were wearing various armor pieces from twilight forest. The thing is that they didn’t even turn red and make the noise as if they got hit, they just stood there with red potion particle effects (meaning the bleed did apply) and their armor rapidly lost durability. Since it works on mobs, the correct potion effect is being applied. I also tested it on another player wearing iron, diamond, and darksteel from EnderIO, same thing happened
Looks like it has been introduced by #11414 
departmenRid is an argument passed in from the function. It is basically a String. and Employee.department is a LINK to Department.  But no I have not tried out 2.1.5 yet. Appreciate if you can confirm it. Note that it gives the correct result but throwing an error on the console - while skipping the index.  Alessandro Rota from Stackoverflow could recreate this issue. I am posting their screenshot.   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9631525/10940274/816a2f18-832b-11e5-9c3f-7f51e70d6e89.png) 
I thought the purpose of this button was to open the user's preferred file manager? So it would make the whole feature less useful. Maybe we could use that as a fallback if the intent fails?
It's pretty random, but I have it again today. It only happens when someone joins. (Meanwhile, placeholderapi is updated in this error) https://hastebin.com/lapurotozo.sql

I _think_ it silently treats it as a tag. Whatever it does, it's certainly stealthy about it :) 
Tested Cerberus in QA with:  - CentOS 6.5 x86_64; - Firefox 24.5 ESR;  - JDK 1.7.0_40;  Ran test case "PAGE VCConfig ZipCodesManagement - 0009A" for PT (Execution ID = 12997570). The behaviour is still the same: all actions and controls after the "manageDialog" action are not executed. Additionally, a screenshot is generated for that action, even though verbose is set to zero and execution result is OK. 
Those could be options as well. I just went for the most obvious fix, that provides a decent workflow. Could be enhanced. 
It depends... Sometimes the errors show up after a couple of seconds, sometimes several minutes are needed. I'd say it is not determinated.  This is another excerpt with open chrome console.  ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1578979/41227097-5ad9e102-6d7c-11e8-856d-b5854447d9cf.png)  I'll provide and code repo as well, but I'am using simple SBA project with only one main method annotated with  `@EnableAdminServer`.

Ahhhhhh yeah, I had "screen sharing" turned on.  After disabling the screen sharing, the server starts fine and arquillian integration tests with payara-embedded-all work fine as well.  Thanks!  I imagine this would be a hazelcast port colliding with the vnc server port then?  I wonder what the best way to resolve this would be within the embedded server.

Hi   Sorry, so the complete context is that we have a container running latest Jetty 9.3.10.v20160621 and unfortunately we're stuck with that. CometD Java however is using 9.2.18.v20160721.  Between 9.2.18.v20160721 and 9.3.10.v20160621 there have been some refactorings within the Jetty library, and trying to use CometD with 9.3.10.v20160621 generates the issue below:    (where `PathSpec` here is now `org.eclipse.jetty.http.pathmap.PathSpec` instead)  So at runtime when an instance of `JettyWebSocketTransport` is created, an instance of `ServletPathSpec` is requested as part of initialisation, which in turn will trigger a classloader lookup, with the expectation to find a `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.server.pathmap.PathSpec` which doesn't exist anymore.  What's more important is that there could be a series of such things that would break at runtime, and these would prevent running CometD on more recent versions of Jetty. 
My mistake; I've corrected the bug report. 
How did you install the apk manually? - in android from directory on SD card D:\Distrib\gnirehtet-rust-win64>adb install gnirehtet.apk adb: failed to install gnirehtet.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED: Install canceled by user] upd: There is "Установка через USB (Разрешить установку приложений через USB)" [translated: Installation via USB (Allow installing applications via USB) ] in developers settings is OFF and do not want turn ON without SIM card (I have not microSIM). upd2: Now it works. It was problem in "Install Via USB" + "USB Debugging (Security settings)" + xiaomi account. I found SIM with internet and turn ON this two options. May be after install the apk manually will be enough turn on only "USB Debugging (Security settings)" without "Install Via USB". Thank you once again for your program and help!
There was not a stacktrace or exception. That was it.
Nevermind it's apparently not JDBI's end, perhaps something related to my db configuration. My records were not shown until a couple of 10's of seconds later when I queried the table (long after my dao update statements were executed).  JDBI 3.11.1, MySQL 5.8. Json data type was used. no warnings. Debugging JDBI yielded 1 row (record) was updated. 
The QA reveal that everything was handled correctly? Note that:  1. The problem occured when I tested with udig copy feature command and  2. only in the case the source and destination shapefile layer for the feature was the same.  3. When copying between 2 different shapefile layers or creating a new feature or deleting a feature via the map tools everything work correctly. Read locks were held and released correctly and write locks always were acquired.

hi @paoloantinori ,  I'm afraid your solution will work only for problem 2) where the pod starts but complains about being Unauthorized.  For problem 1) it won't work, because the deployment is in progress - it is waiting for the pods to be running - and that won't happen because the pod can't find the secret.   - Without scaling to 0,  the deployment will timeout after 10 minutes and the deployment will be marked as failed and openshift will automatically roll out older deployment (so it will roll out the original version of the pod) - With scaling to 0 first, it times out again, but because of the scaling, openshift will not roll out the original version automatically. However if you scale it up to 1 again, it will roll out the original version and will ignore the failed deployment.   And it will be probably necessary to test this with rollback as well, as currently I always end with server and meta pods in version 2 where all other pods are from version 1 (I'm using exit 1 as last step in upgrade_50_replace_template)

@jtaubensee It does not error. I do not know if it hangs or not. I am attaching sample code, when it uses PREVIEW it receives messages from a session enabled subscriber printing info like: "SessionID: 11 - Message Received - 9747bf2d5b06486aa8e6e8a23468fcb1" message is deleted from the subscription.  When the library changed to PREVIEW-1 the output is empty and messages are not deleted from the  subscription.

Consider the following data set:  
Yeah sure! Just one moment!
It applies to exec's, shell-operations and file copies.  For example: - I created a remote file "TestFileÄÖÜ.txt" using SFTP, SCP, Exec and Shell each.    In WinSCP it gets displayed as "TestFileÃ„Ã–Ãœ.txt". In PuTTY it gets displayed in 2 lines like "TestFileÃ\nÃÃ.txt". - When listing files in sshj using "ls" or SFTPClient.ls(), a file "TestFileÄÖÜ.txt" that was remotely created using PuTTY or WinSCP gets displayed as "TestFile???.txt".   Calling getBytes() returns "84, 101, 115, 116, 70, 105, 108, 101, -17, -65, -67, -17, -65, -67, -17, -65, -67, 46, 116, 120, 116". Each '?' is encoded as "-17, -65, -67".   On the other hand, all files created with sshj will be displayed correctly. - Existing files can't be found. Executing "cat TestFileÄÖÜ.txt" results in "cat: 0652-050 Cannot open TestFileÄÖÜ.txt." and only works if the file was created using sshj, e.g. when "TestFileÃ„Ã–Ãœ.txt" exists. Same for SFTP/SCP downloads

Sure. Currently in Morphia you can call the addAll() method on the UpdateOperations with the last flag set to true in order to perform a $pushAll.  Specifically on line 83 of UpdateOpsImpl you'll find a reference to UpdateOperator.PUSH_ALL  The $pushAll operator has been deprecated (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/pushAll/), however, rather than discontinuing this in Morphia, it could simply be replaced with $push and $each.  This is similar to how the UpdateOperator.ADD_TO_SET_EACH works. Line 207 of the UpdateOpsImpl:

Android considers the app hanging if the main thread is allocated for more than x seconds (for service mode 5 seconds since android 8+). Then it issues warnings in the logcat about this. Newer android's halt the process completely forever (see GPlay Console ANR reports). If you stress test the conditions and toggle the "apps decision" fastly from "false" to "true" to "false" and so on, messages got sent via the onPrefsChangedListener and queued up, so you end up on permanently starting and ending syncthing on the main service thread. Plus delays that has always been in there to allow safe startup, polling and shutdown you get a delay "per on/off cycle" from 2 to 3 seconds. More cycles --> ANR.
From my investigation this was caused by a change in `GrpcFirestoreRpc`; I've opened a PR #3460  that does the "minimal thing" to get correct overriding behavior if that's the direction y'all want to go.
Inconsistent but mostly seems to slow down. All ID elements are set to 1tick rates but extraction often slows down to once per second. This also happens a lot while inside a Compact Machine with the item storage claimed via FTB utils and chunkloaded via ChickenChunks.  Since most inputs are always-on farms I cannot easily tell the difference between >5s tick rates and a full stop, will try to test in creative with vanilla nether portals.  **Edit:** tested a bit in creative with the same modpack and could not get a full stop, so it might be a severe slowdown due to the increased load of my "main" world. I _did_ catch the transient end of a slowdown though: the ID transfer system appears to be working at a significantly slower rate while I am in a different dimension despite being chunkloaded.  My test setup consists of a series of TE ducts drawing from an infinite item source into a chest (here: AA large crate, vanilla chest works too). From there ID transfers to a second chest, which is much faster than the ducts while observed directly. The second chest is then emptied into a trash can by a larger number of ducts such that the second chest is always almost empty.  I then enter a nether portal behind me, wait a while in the nether, then go back through the portal and immediately open the first (ID "input") chest. Depending on loading times and waiting time in the nether the chest will contain a significant number of item stacks, which are promptly drained into the second chest and removed as the system picks up speed again once I am in the overworld. I have also observed this behaviour with the ender chests in my compact machines.  Test setup: ![2018-02-27_17 21 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22204328/36743800-75603608-1beb-11e8-8a85-3dcb55061753.png)

I don't think that's what it is. For one thing, Google Maps doesn't have this bug. Per your suggestion, I've tried to release one finger then the other and the behaviour of osmdroid is totally erratic. I didn't end up as far as antarctica, maybe because I was doing the gesture very slowly, but still ended up way off where I was supposed to be.  I've uploaded a video of the issue, you can see the touches on the screen. Hopefully it'll help you figure out what's going on.

No need to adjust the range. Thanks!
The call is just "mvn sonar:sonar". But we have some magic in our parent pom which sets the sonar.branch.name if GIT_LOCAL_BRANCH is available. But as this is not set in my local test environment there should be no sonar.branch.name at all. The Nullpointer source line indicates that the branch is null, which matches this.

@TylerJewell thanks for the explanation  I am trying to run che behind https using nginx reverse proxy, I have adjusted the che server tomcat server.xml to have the proxy port and scheme to https.   and configured another system as nginx reverse proxy to do the ssl termination and forward to 8080 and other websocket ports on the che server  So i have to start the che sever with CHE_HOST=public host name, but just before the project creation the che server application tries to connect to the wsagent on http://CHE_HOST:randomport/, I am not sure why it is http, but nevertheless I needed that ping to pass so the project creation can pass, so I had to add a dummy hosts entry to the che container for CHE_HOST with the ip of the host machine, and ping passes.

ok, so are you saying that your mod doesn't support upgrading?  you might want to tell modpack authors not to upgrade your mod, then. seems like a huge issue, to me.
Sorry, here is my log and config file [2020-01-01-1.log](https://github.com/itsmeow/betteranimalsplus/files/4016755/2020-01-01-1.log) [betteranimalsplus.cfg.txt](https://github.com/itsmeow/betteranimalsplus/files/4016758/betteranimalsplus.cfg.txt)

@filiphr the real mappers are quite big. It happens when you have a shared config and non existing properties. The exact conditions I need to figure out...

No wonder that after 15000 records the stack goes 1363 calls deep and the map containers occupy more space than the actual data. Something is very wrong here anyway, when I put a breakpoint in line " if (c.getMemory() > store.getPageSplitSize() && c.getKeyCount() > 1) {" I see that for every insert it stops a few times on this line. 6 times for the first insert. And for every two new inserts after that it stops there one additional time. Increasing the page size by a factor 1000 might help, but the whole concept of getting a deeper call stack for every other insert seems very wrong. Please put your breakpoint on MVMap line 201 and see if you get the same behavior.

I select a row in the resultset and then use context menu, in last versions isn't working. In the editor the table hyperlink isn't working neither.  On the other hand, generate SQL and edit data works in the table data resultset. 
@ericwa sorry for the late reply, i havn't seen a notification that you commented here. yes the apk is from f-droid.org  i reproduced the error on the orginal samsung rom  Android 7.0, so it is nothing lineageos specific.  currently `adb` is not working for me, i have to investigate the problem (think it is a usb driver problem)

@snicoll no worries. I worked on some demos and you can take a look into them [here](https://github.com/eddumelendez/kotlin-everywhere-gdglima-demo). These projects are full `kotlin` using `maven` as a build tool. What I was reporting is that there are missing configurations like dependencies or some tuning in the `maven-compiler-plugin`. PR #283 provides all the configuration needed for the producer and the consumer side when the language is `kotlin` and the build tool is `maven`. This is based on producer using the `spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier` dependency and the consumer using the `spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner` dependency
Okay, I'll verify it soon. I'd appreciate if there was a build with the fix so I don't have to build it myself. 
@deeleman   Request to: `https://myproject.192.168.64.17.nip.io/api/v1/metrics/integrations`  
Actually I don't think that this PO is necessary at all since it should always be of the right type as far as I can see. But it would probably be a good idea also to try this example in VDMTools as well. 
Sorry yes I should have attached screenshots, but the pic you've attached after your fix is identical to what I get if I manually patch the file in `node_modules` to play the old way (with transforms). I'm curious, did you reapply transforms or get the scaling on `ImageView` working? That was quick!
For me the crash has been fixed, the scoreboard team name is still existent As of the 21th: Both fixed, thanks ^^
I'm running Elasticsearch's tests. Heartbeat interval looks like its set to 10 (is that seconds?).  Is there a way I can attach a debugger to the forked JVMs? Such as by passing an environment variable or some such to pass the right debugger options?  Could something be happening that causes the Forked JVM to stall before getting to bootstrap event?
Thank you very much. Your team worked very well.  And I had another problem, the graph can change zoom level when I delete a node but it didn't work when I add a new node. I have to zoom out to see all nodes of the graph after that.

Following a helpful chat with @dsyer I now have a much better understand of the intent here. `InMemoryMetricRepository` is, largely, an internal of the Actuator's metrics support. Application code should deal with `GaugeService` and `CounterService`, both of which are present with both Java 7 and Java 8. The javadoc needs to be updated on `MetricRepositoryAutoConfiguration` to reflect this. 
@MishaDemianenko yes that's correct - it looked to pass the cursory integrity check i did on the backup
As an example, I have the  ID for the entity public_rnaseq_3_Samples (in above example example_ID) and I want to get the information that is in the public_rnaseq_3_Input_file, to which public_rnaseq_3_Samples has an mref. I don't know which ID in public_rnaseq_3_Input_file is linked to example_ID of public_rnaseq_3_Samples, but if I request  public_rnaseq_3_Samples/example_ID/input_file_paths/  I get the mref data from Input_file_paths that is lined to example_ID.  What would be a better way to get this? 
The latest version in Maven Central is `0.42.0-alpha` which is why I'm using it. I'm using the artifact link described in the README. Is this not the correct one to be using? https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.google.cloud%20a:google-cloud

I don't know whether it will be better or even possible if we are talking about codding, but I think it would be correct if blue crystals would only drops from mature plants, because this is the only way we "create" something new. So, maybe, it will be even easier to implement.
I am using 2.1.1. Switched to 2.2 and made some changes on my part, but it looks like it runs under win 10. Thanks !
I am separating stdout from stderr already. The issue is that the message is included in both streams.  Regarding stdout vs. stderr and expectations, if the programmatic contract with the CLI is expressed via both stdout and stderr, then both should provide structured responses. If the contract is always communicated via stdout, only it should provide a structured response and stderr can be free-form.  I integrate other CLIs with the IDE, notably the Salesforce DX CLI, and when you run it with a `--json` argument, the exit code determines which stream you should consume, both of which are written in JSON format.  If PMD is only intended to write a structured XML response to stdout when run with the `-f xml` argument, I agree that it doesn't matter how stderr is formatted. The contract just needs to be communicated/documented enough for integrators.

Sure, this is the contents of the file V020__data_feed_source_locations.sql (I just replaced the real domain name with "someUrl"):  INSERT INTO `source` VALUES (138, 'Source DN', 'Source DN', now(), NULL); INSERT INTO `source_location` (`id`, `url`, `active`, `type`, `source_id`, `m_created`, `m_modified`) VALUES  (386, 'http://someUrl.si/feed/?cat=32,7,10,9,64&amp;feed=rss2&amp;tag__not_in=77', 1, 'news', 138, now(), NULL);  If I copy and paste these SQL statements into console mysql client, it works perfectly:  mysql> INSERT INTO `source` VALUES (138, 'Source DN', 'Source DN', now(), NULL); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.21 sec)  mysql> INSERT INTO `source_location` (`id`, `url`, `active`, `type`, `source_id`, `m_created`, `m_modified`) VALUES      -> (386, 'http://someUrl.si/feed/?cat=32,7,10,9,64&amp;feed=rss2&amp;tag__not_in=77', 1, 'news', 138, now(), NULL); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)  After the mvn flyway:migrate is executed, there's no need to do mvn flyway:repair since no record is written into schema_version table.  Kind regards, Lidija 
Discussed in FixItFriday.  We've decided that we want to keep the `lte` adjustment and to fix it to follow the following rules:  * `lte` adjustment only happens if rounding appears in the date math expression, eg `now/d` or `2017-01-01 14:53:12||/h` * Rounding is implemented as a floor operation on the date, using the specified unit * Then, any other calculations are applied (eg `+2h +10m`)  etc * The smallest unit mentioned in the date math expression should be used for the `lte` adjustment,   For example:   * `lte: now/d` rounds down to midnight, then adds 24 hours minus 1ms    * `lte: now/d+2h` rounds down to midnight, adds two hours, then adds 1 hour minus 1 ms   * `lte: now/h + 1d` rounds down to the nearest hour, adds 24 hours, then adds 1 hour minus 1ms  This probably requires a significant rewrite of our date math parser.
Here's my startup log: https://pastebin.com/YynRpFUX  And no, I haven't be able to determine any pattern to when the errors happen but they aren't constantly occurring. I'll let you know if I notice any patterns or connections or when the errors take place. Thank you!
Thank you for your fast response :)   I do see it every time i close the IDEA window.  Maybe this is also important:  I have 2 Projects opened (2 different Windows), one which has a dependency to camel and one which does not. When i close the project which is not dependent on camel, the error message appears in the project which is dependent on it
I think current representation is good and we don't need to change it. The program works fine if you are using exporting and importing facilities only. It is just that I am reversing board somewhere in the GUI. So just need to have deep look into this and carefully fix it. I hate myself and my code now. Needed to implement this carefully in first place.  
Yes, I think the issue is that when "NO_GRID" is selected, the x and y are interpreted as pixels coordinates, while with all other metrics they are interpreted as cell coordinates.  Very confusing to say the least, and contradicting the wiki. I suggest make it cell coordinates as default, with extra parameter to use pixel coordinates.
@n8fr8 confirmed fixed in beta9 - thanks for the rapid response!

Ubuntu 16.10. Unity Desktop. Unity 7 comes with that AFAIK.  I wasn't having this issue until a while ago. In recent times it has started. Can be due to Ubuntu 16.10 upgrade, but I am not sure. So I wanted to report it here. 
I have assembled a minimal application that shows the problem: [demo.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/864159/demo.zip)  1. Start HSQL in standalone/server-mode: `java -cp hsqldb-2.3.3.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 file:dbname --dbname.0 dbname`  1. Start `DemoApplication` ([/health](http://localhost:8080/health) will show `"status": "UP"`)  1. Make some arbitrary change to trigger `spring-boot-devtools`  1. [/health](http://localhost:8080/health) will show `"status": "DOWN"` (log will contain `java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect`, HSQL prints `Initiating shutdown sequence... Shutdown sequence completed` in terminal)
@serge-rider tomorrow I will look for it, thanks for following the bug!
Strange, it's consistent for me even with the latest build (58e60970e18a00ff54cd223d905ce6a158031b27).  Regardless, is it possible that two calls to edit for the same role (initiated on different threads) could cause this issue even after your fix?  I just took a look at the source code and it doesn't look like the request is asynchronous, but how is the result of the role updated? Is this sent later on by the Discord server?

Yes nice!  When the frame appears it's empty (all white). I can see the content only when i change the window size.  Thanks.
hi @marcalwestf , It is a correction, currently the process generates commission for reverted charges, if the charge is reversed it should not generate commission for this charge since it is a zero charge.
I have   
I just verified, and yes, the subcommand now works like expected.
I agree, it is probably related to the commit. Are you able to reproduce? No I don't use the forceLegacy flag.
 
Here in this image you can see how my head is inside the block-entity that the explosion has thrown. I placed another, solid, cobble slab above it so you can see the difference.  http://snag.gy/hRuIK.jpg 
I am playing on 1.10.2 and the latest version is from June 6th, 2k17 and it's the 2.1.24. And it seems like you can select 2 filters after some restarts and then this bug appears again.
Seems to happen in any case, they just don't get deleted at all from the database 
OK will do.  Thanks.  On 1/8/16, Costin Leau notifications@github.com wrote:  > Closed #618. >  > --- >  > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub: > https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-hadoop/issues/618#event-509812823 
The files are Mac Icon files from a born-digital collection that we're processing.  Apparently, it's [fairly common](http://superuser.com/a/298798) for their file names to end with \r although from the sample we're looking at, it's not consistent. Since it's a problem with the file name and not the content, I've been creating test files through bash. `touch "Icon^M"` 
I'm using Mysql, and this no matter with the database. I mean that when a field is a type of string, the generated xml file should add the expression in the if clause.For example: if my java code is  ` String sysCode = ""; ` xml file content is  ` <select id="query" parameter="java.lang.String" resultType="java.util.HashMap"> select SYS_CODE as sysCode from table <where> <if test="sysCode != null" >         AND SYS_CODE = #{sysCode,jdbcType=VARCHAR},  </if> </where> </select> ` when I call the query method, the sql will be:  ` select SYS_CODE as sysCode from table where SYS_CODE = '' `, actually it should not match the if clause, it should be: ` select SYS_CODE as sysCode from table ` so I had to add the code  `sysCode != ''` every string field every time,  because it spends me a lot of time.
  This output shows that removing 1960 caused 2000 to be removed as well. 
No ... in album view it turns white instead of the toolbar. 
It is Cyclic-1.10.2-1.8.2 - as part of hermitpack 1.4.0.  The description of #161 seems to match.  I'll upgrade and let you know if I see the problem again.  Thanks again for a great mod and your continued support.  
These are not modes, the usual blocks from version 1.11.2. But why are they not ...
No. I am temporary using EditText instead of MaterialEditText exactly because of this problem. With EditText everything is ok.

How about the modded blocks i was trying to move?
Yes, probably it's the same. I have one PreferenceFragment that loads preferences that consists nested PrferenceScreens. 
Yes, it is on master, but I'll fit it :-)

Sure, here's the link; I'll PM you the password.   
 Sorry was having issues uploading the whole config file but I can give you an example of what I changed. I just copy pasted a small section straight from the config and everything else is default. I thought changing the enable/disable effect (default false) would add it to each individual piece and enable/disable the full armor effect (default true) would change the tooltip to reflect that. I did look for the Tinker armors in the config but I just assumed there wasn't an option to change them. I just wanted to change the less expensive ones like Coal or Redstone armor as an example.  # Enable/Disable the Coal Effect (Boots, Leggings, Chestplate, Helmet)             B:enableCoalEffect <                 true                 true                 true                 true              >              # Enable/Disable the Potion Effect the Coal Weapons will have             B:enableCoalWeaponsEffects=true              # Enable/Disable the Full Coal Armor Effect             B:enableFullCoalArmorEffect=false 
Both are empty by default..     (Jeeze my PATH is messy)   Will attempt to set them myself now

I was mistaken in the post above, the bug only occurs in a situation like in the following example: 1. Thousand year storm in on the battlefield, no other spells have been cast this turn. ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48334115/55835547-697a9880-5aea-11e9-8169-a662108a1b17.JPG) 2. An instant or sorcery spell with a discard cost like tormenting voice or pirate's pillage (pillage in this case) is cast. ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48334115/55835641-73040080-5aea-11e9-9d22-e2fa0660ca89.JPG) 3. After all triggers on the stack have resolved any instant or sorcery spell is cast (it dosn't have to have discard cost). ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48334115/55835667-76978780-5aea-11e9-8dd4-7c649516f578.JPG) 4.The thousand year storm trigger is allowed to resolve and no copies are made ![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48334115/55835674-7a2b0e80-5aea-11e9-868f-41c818fc732d.JPG)
I am on the latest, 15.8.7
I have several fixed issues which might be released very soon. But there is no hurry. I can delay it until you are ready to release 0.0.4.   Btw, why would you version less4j with alpha or beta since the version is 0.0.x which implicitly means that it is kind of alpha? It would help if you would document the reasoning behind versioning used for less4j. 
I can not use that yet, I'm using maven 0.5.2

If I have no log no problem ^^ but once log start coming it freezes, no need to have much in my case. But append every time

Sure.  assume the following code:  public class MouseHook {     /*\* prints the license terms and turns off logger output     **/     private void printMessage(){         // Clear previous logging configurations.         LogManager.getLogManager().reset();       }  }  first I call print message, then getMouseClick. the program exits at registerNativeHook. If i don't call printMessage first, it works. If the program runs in debug mode (eclipse), it also works.  thanks,  René  On 11/11/2014 11:27 AM, Alex Barker wrote:  > Can you provide steps or code to duplicating the issue? >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub > https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook/issues/20#issuecomment-62572860. 
Doesn't seem to hook anything, no fake data provided to apps, no xprivacy popup and so. 
In a simple answer: because it's not consistent with the rest of the library. I can't think of any other `Glide...load(???)` that will crash the whole app. Just because an image is not available it shouldn't crash, that's why we have `.error()` and `onException`. I think the strongest argument is that `null` doesn't crash it, which is a worse value for a resource ID than 0.  This is actually not a theoretical issue. I ran into it yesterday. I have the images for categories as `res/raw/*.svg`. The items in my DB can have a category associated to them by a column which refers to the above mentioned svg files by name. The name is then resolved by calling:    Now, the everyday usage is covered because if the `imageID` is a valid `R.raw.*`, it works; but there may be some cases when the resolution may not work and then if you check the [`getIdentifier` javadoc](file:///P:/tools/android-sdk-windows/docs/reference/android/content/res/Resources.html#getIdentifier%28java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String%29) it says:  > **Returns** `int` The associated resource identifier. Returns 0 if no such resource was found. (0 is not a valid resource ID.)  The current hack is that I check for 0 and replace it with `null`, because I know that works as I want it (displays `.error()`). Adding little workarounds like this starting to lead to cyclomatic hell around the image loading as, I, for example also have to check for `null` images because it is not handled as should be: #268. 
I expect that the native actor is not generated (no C file and not present in the CMakeList.txt).

Hi Pascal, thats what i thought too - by default, the GenericLinkExtractor will be used by default even if i don't add it to the config file - is that correct? That by default does not have the javascript protocol in there, so it should work out of the box directly and not process them by default..  Here is my config file:  Thanks
Stefano,  Yes, we’re using the Serverless-Java-Container. (Jersey).  Its been working great since the first release, but we’ve just noticed this happening (well its the first time we’ve put a space in to be fair).   We’ve been able to use the container library with Jetty which allows us to run the framework locally, where we don’t see the error.  It only seems to happen when we deploy the lambda to AWS.  > On 14 Aug 2017, at 20:57, Stefano Buliani <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > Hi @dhcrees <https://github.com/dhcrees>, just to confirm, you are using the serverless-java-container library right?

Yeah creative. When experimenting with a mod I like to create what amounts to a void world so my laptop doesn't have to render more than it needs to. I tend to like building ridiculous setups that make placing a block in the chunk the setup is in cause something like half a second to a second of lag as it rerenders the chunk. 
the SD  is needed to be checked by the root path SD.exists("/") because the current  files on the SD are unknown, So finally the root path is the only path which is existing on either formatted SD. OTOH, SD.begin() also always returns no error if the SD is mistakenly not present any more. Additionally, if no SD was inserted at the start (SD.begin() fails at setup() ), then a later re-inserting during runtime plus an extra SD.begin() also does not restart and reload the SD contents: a total mess all over, tbh!  Eventually I have no idea what the lib does or not, but if intended behavior or not: it's faulty what it does  currently, so it needs to be fixed either way. 
You are right, all logs are from the same thread. I share with you the logs filtered with the lines of  traceId "3239b0fd76624aa7".  
Oh you're right looks  to be all backpack sizes, currently.  I just upgraded a small to a regular and it stayed a small on the inside while the lore and item title were properly updated.

Replicates in IE, Firefox, and Chrome. Checked the error in FF and Chrome, and it is identical.   It looks like `bkUtils.initializeCometd` is only defined in `core/src/main/web/app/beakerEmbed.js`  Then I would wonder if beakerEmbed.js is no longer getting loaded in beaker.js where the error is thrown?  I also cleared the browser cache 
@fviale Yes, something similar was used:    However, I think it's more a workaround since the same configuration (I mean number of PA nodes and tasks submitted) but a different sleep timeout value in task code (reduced to 25 seconds) does not make exceed the default limit. This last observation let me think it is more an application problem than a system configuration issue.  
Hello @emmanuelbernard  In fact, I removed the field from the`update()` method just to try different things and forgot to put it back. Including the field is the way it's supposed to work, but it doesn't. I just updated the source code including it.  I added 2 animated gifs to the [README](https://github.com/manoelcampos/hibernate-concurrency) to show the issue.  Replacing `persist()` by `flush()` or `persistAndFlush()` doesn't have any effect with the locking. The `@Version long versao` field is incremented, but the data from the previous user is overwritten.  About the transaction, as it's just an example, I made the entire `ClienteResource` class transactional. I moved the `@Transactional` directly to the `update` method and it doesn't help anyway as you said.  I made sure to stop and restart Quarkus after such changes.
Hi Christian,  the problem dissapeared. I thought it was persistent and had tested it several times, that's why I reported here. I changed the workflow to circumvent the problem. After changing back the Segment Cropper nodes show the intended and right behaviour so I'm not able to reproduce.  Sorry to bug you!! 
it occered at world generation: worldgen: quark_realistic seed: 1583336344085787454 xyz: -934 81 -1830 (somewhere around there) i upped the spawn chance of catacombs to 75% as none would spawn otherwise, but they might have has i experienced freezes and crashes before, but did not look at log file. at the place where catacombs are generating is also an anceint warfare 2 camp/town around.

Ok, I came up with this:   When I executed "/test a",  Sword #1 and #4 were removed (should be Sword #4 and #5)  When I executed "/test a2",  Sword #1 was removed (should be Sword #4 and #5)    When I executed "/test b", Sword #1 and #2 were removed (should be Sword #2 and #3)  When I executed "/test b2",  Sword #1 was removed (should be Sword #2 and #3)    - I tested this on Paper 1.14.4 (Skript 2.4) and Paper 1.15.1 (Skript 2.4.1).
I haven't tried an uninstall by running any kind of official uninstalled. Just deleted the Arduino app, and redownloaded. Is there a more in depth uninstall process I am missing? I could try removing the resource folder that is created in documents, and seeing if that helps.   They are clones, but they are exact hardware duplicates as far as the micro processors are included, so not sure why that would be an issue, but I'll check with some official copies as well.  The other user reported that he successfully flashed some of his and i tried on multiple copies, with the same result.  But I will verify on official non-clone boards.   Thanks. 
Hello,  I think i found the problem. I tried the quickstart and it works and then return to my code and it didn't. then to cut some testing time i hard coded the twilio token which is generated from the online generator and suddenly, IT WORKS!  I think for some reason there is some inconsistency between android and other clients on parsing the access token.  Our backend generates the access token with video grant AND conversation because we are currently supporting both till we have a stable version.  Our python library is 5.6

I think you should widen the selection. 
I think we probably want to make the load balancing strategies pluggable. I’m generally not into pluggable things (why not just include a good implementation in the box!) but in this case I think being pluggable gives us options we can’t build otherwise.  One strategy I really like is from what gRPC calls an external load balancer. https://grpc.io/grpc/core/md_doc_load-balancing.html https://grpc.io/blog/loadbalancing

I was testing the teleport turret and used NEI to obtain a turret base and a teleport turret. I placed the teleport turret on the bottom and would get the error. If I took that same turret and placed it on the top, it would not error out. I was hoping the teleport turret would teleport the mobs to under itself when in the bottom position, I was hoping to use it in a mob farm, however I found the turret would still bring them in above itself. This would cause them to get suffocation damage, but it is not what I was hoping for. 
Hi @thekingnothing,  I've checked and it does not change anything. Moreover I almost changed all places in our codes but reached one with org.powermock.api.easymock.annotation.MockNice annotation that is also affected but does not have _fieldName_ to be set.  Regards,  Karol.
Hi Claus,   The behavior seems to be  1. when a queue is selected from the tree it populates the list of messages 2. If you click the link to open a message before 5 seconds after you select the queue, you can see the headers. 3. if you click the link to open a message after 5 seconds from selecting the queue, it will still show the message body but not the headers and properties (and you also can't do a move).  That's even if you have opened the message before (I.e. if you close the message dialog and reopen that message whether the data is pruned that allows seeing the headers depends on the 5 seconds since selecting the queue) 3. if you keep the dialog open for a message and it shows the headers, they don't go away (it doesn't refresh)  Hope that explains it. 
I guess it must have been this one: PRIMARY KEY(commit_fk, property_name)  property_name length is 200 x 4 bytes is 800 bytes for utf16 property_name length is 200 x 3 bytes is 600 bytes for utf8  same goes for other tables. Just try to run it on InnoDB engine and utf16, you'll hit this error. Also see third list item [here](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-restrictions.html) 
The `AppCompatApplication` (full source below) is what I'm using right now, so the bug is no a blocker for me. However, the provided `Context`can be in fact some custom instance of `ContextWrapper`, so getting resources from it directly would be a more bulletproof solution.

I have generated a simple app with https://start.spring.io/. When running WAR file with Security Manager I get:    It is not actually ClassNotFoundException, which happens in conjunction with another framework we use in our project. This NoClassDefFoundError I get from empty Spring Boot application seems to be the root cause of our problems.
I'm not sure that blacklisting is the right way to handle this.   Could the issue be related to the fact that the device is L3, not L1?
From the log, the failed test  uses 9558 and 9557 ports. But before the failed test ends, there is one more test started the gateway at port 8555. The tests are run differently for ssl as we wanted to set a security property before JSSE is initialized. We specify forkCount=1 in surefire plugin config in transport.ssl/pom.xml  But my guess is that parallel execution may not be the issue here. There is some exception happened as you can see in the log, but the cause is not posted on the logs (4363 [New I/O worker #35] DEBUG transport.ssl.accept - Error on SSL connection, closing connection: java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException)  ## See below interleaving of two gateways  2826 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Starting services 2827 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:9558 2827 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - tcp://localhost:9557 ... 4083 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Starting server 4083 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Starting services 4084 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:8555 ... 4388 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:8555 4388 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Stopped services ... 4392 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Stopping services 4392 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:9558 4392 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - tcp://localhost:9557

Why do you think it has to do with the doSetup?  I cannot really understand the exception yet. It occurs when the RuleEngineImpl is activated. As RuleEngine depends on ScriptEngine and ScriptEngine depends on ScriptServiceUtil, I would have assumed that SSU.activate() has already been executed at that point. Do you have an explanation, why this isn't the case? 
[Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&hl=en_US) is free, and allows you to configure default app launching animation through `Nova Settings -> Look & Feel -> App Animation`. Keep in mind this issue only occurs when launching the app if the app is not already running.
I'm not sure if I understand what you mean. If you just use the current demo for Cards (https://gwtbootstrap3.github.io/gwtbootstrap3-demo/#card) in Firefox, you'll see the issue I'm referring to here. I confirmed that it's not something on the recent version of Firefox and went as far back as Firefox 31. Does that make sense?  
@vreixo Ok, I'll hold on release.  To reproduce: 1) I installed the current Google Play version of OTP Android as a new install 2) Planned a trip 3) Installed the new v2.1.0 APK (download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzb24f4mqrg5hx4/opentripplanner-android-release-v2.1.0.apk)) over the Google Play version 4) Open the app  I don't believe I even planned a trip - if I did, it was by long-pressing and holding on map and setting End Location (start was My Location at USF).  Let me know if you're not able to re-produce it. 
For now I just try in my modpack, with only 256 mods #FeelsBadMan  But I can try with less mods for see.
I've only noticed it on larger tables, ones smaller than around 10mb tend to be negligible.  I did try it with Intellij's built in DB console, and on the sql server itself, and neither had this problem with comments.  Here's a run (3 of each) from the Query manager:   
I agree that address validation isn't necessarily useful, but if you view the source code for `AbstractSubjectConfirmationValidator` (super class of `BearerSubjectConfirmationValidator`) you'll see that it is responsible for validating addresses.  Its implementation uses `InetAddress.getAllByName(...)` which seems to imply that it would support name resolution lookups to compare to the SP's whitelist.  The `AbstractSubjectConfirmationValidator.validateAddress` method will return `ValidationResult.INDETERMINATE` if the whitelist isn't populated by the SP and the IdP included an address in the message, but unfortunately the validator is specifically requiring that the `validateAddress` method returns a `VALID`  From there, [OpenSamlAuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/saml2/saml2-service-provider/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/saml2/provider/service/authentication/OpenSamlAuthenticationProvider.java#L335-L340) will throw a `Saml2ErrorCodes.INVALID_ASSERTION` as the validator returned `ValidationResult.INDETERMINATE` instead of `ValidationResult.VALID`.  In summary, I think the provider should support validation of the address (which may be a hostname or IP) as well as the ability to disable (or ignore) specific `ValidationResult.INDETERMINATE` results.  #7517 Provides a solution to validate the address
ah! Sorry Axel, my apologies if I am, I didn't realise there was two different editions. I presume we're on the community edition. I've pulled the 5.0.7 artifacts down from the mvnrepository.com? 
issue retested and found fixed
Now I search.... until without results I'll let you know when I find a way.
Hi @remkop ,  I just did it and now the options appear as expected. Great work! 
> Did the transmitter have power?  Yes, before and after.  > Did you put it at the same position?  Yes, before and after.  > To where was it dialed?  It was still in a "dialed" state when placed back down. It was dialing to an existing receiver that was still present after being replaced. 
http://i.imgur.com/aH2ar2x.png nabbed a screen from random video with outdated mod to give you an idea. You see how there is 64x soldified experience in it? Well if I keep opening/dropping XP and opening it sometimes doesn't show there, it just shows as an empty slot. Clicking in the empty slot has the correct behavior though - I can still withdraw the XP perfectly fine.  The glitch happens at random.  Is video still needed? 
Focus navigation with remote control is kinda weird, as sometimes is not clear where the focus is and what the next action will be. As far as I recall it happened in all categories, including while navigating in Detail view (when the focus is supposedly at the mid level, items list). BTW, for using Serenity in an Android box, do you suggest to use the standard or the TV UI option? (as per the app settings)

I got a step further, looks like curly quotes copied from browser...  Now I get a 200 response but it is: {   "message": "Unknown" }  Any ideas?
@jmolsmobile  Thanks for you help! This is my resolution for record video.   
Don't think that is the case. /etc/opentsdb/logback.xml is the only logback.xml on the system.   
This is what I meant:    Maybe it's too much, but I think this is what "gracefully" should mean. We don't want to do `shutdownNow()` too early, since it means `interrupt()` on every thread. Instead, we want to wait for them to stop correctly. And only if it's too late - we shut down in a cold way. What do you think? 
Sorry, there was no script, that was attempting to run the `ct blocks` command to dump all block IDs. The crafttweaker dev meanwhile pointed out that it's clientside code on the server: https://github.com/CraftTweaker/CraftTweaker/issues/644
@popzip Yes, I am new to DHF. I developed a workflow on a sample data set and it worked fine. I only got such error when I ran it against a larger data set.  Just to confirm, is there a timeout limit on how long a harmonization flow can run, regardless of error or not?
It happened two or three times. Maximum of 3 scripts were empty at once.
Yep, exactly, forgot to mention that ^^' Thanks!
Apologies, I have recreated the issue with more info in the correct place. 
Rebuild the project and let's it restart by itself, then issue happens when Tomcat embedded in Spring Boot run is trying to deserialize the sessions.  But yes, with spring-boot:run  Also this has happened with all Java versions, including Corretto 11.0.3 I use currently.

I am testing the lambda function with the test functionality on the console and also linking an API Gateway to it. But in the both scenarios I have the same response. 
I have removed 20 of the mods I used to load, no change. currently have to fob around "in the dark" for lack of a better term if I want to craft armour.  I dread the prospect of heuristically checking each mod to see what the cause is, is there a way I could check for a rendering issue?
The issue did not occur with a fresh install with only ID (same forge version).  Issue was in singleplayer. Tried a fresh world in the modpack, issue persisted.

Just tried it with the following and I'm still receiving the same error:  - spring-cloud-function-adapter-azure: 3.0.1.BUILD-20191211.181256-45 - spring-cloud-function-context: 3.0.1.BUILD-20191211.180745-45 - spring-cloud-function-core: 3.0.1.BUILD-20191211.180639-45  
Sorry, should have included that info. I'm working on 1.1. So it's probably already fixed in 1.2 
Thanks for fast feedback. Usually I have the cache turned on - it's only when I was debugging my more complex search queries I wanted to be sure that unexpected result doesn't come from caching.

I run from the command line instead of intellij and it works! Sorry for that! 
this happens in 1.0.0 in browser environment.  note that if I type the inner Foo declaration with String : Foo<String> it does not happen. 
@thboileau Is this a Restlet bug? Or could be something else?  @komasoftware yes Hibernate validator is there, also Bean Validation works just right in client side, so my idea is this is a serialization bug of Restlet... as the ClientProxy works just fine if I remove the annotations.  
select * from user where id in (1,2,3,4,5,,,,,,,,,) the id count is 5000+,or even more
alright, after some testing, it seems that it loads fine on Forge 1474 if I don't have liteloader loaded. 
This is happening for my obs as well as when I look at others. However, it's happening a little less now.  I tap on an ob and swipe photos immediately when I get to an ob screen. It appears to only happen with 3 or more photos. It also still happens for previously opened obs. Hopes this helps. @kueda is this happening for you? 
@kaczmarkiewiczp   I not compiled rclone using Termux, just copy [rclone v1.42-066-g1f3778db arm64](https://beta.rclone.org/v1.42-066-g1f3778db/) to /data/data/com.termux/ on android.  Then run rclone serve webdav on termux, and the  remote is sharepoint. uploading file using ES Explorer and Solid Explorer,  or syncing directory using FolderSync, all  are work fine.  Then closed termux and run serve webdav (remote is sharepoint) on rcloneExplorer(v1.6.0-20).   uploading file using ES Explorer and Solid Explorer are work fine.  But syncing directory using FolderSync failed.  FolderSync reported error: "Method Not Allowed" for second file, and the first file is sync success.  This is very strange, I am not sure what the problem is.          
I did not, but (trying it just now) that didn't appear to make a difference.
Sorry, this stack trace is from our crash report system, so I don't know what exactly happened.

@oscerd can you guide me on what 'From' and 'To' patterns mean? I would expect that the get event would be an initiation step of a flow like: 1. I get a specific event 2. I do something with the info What is the use case when 'Get event' is an end action? Can I do sth with the result that it returns?
Exactly. Thank you for looking into this. I just went looking into providing the required information, but you were faster.
At least in the current state of the conversion method this might happen - of course I could also adapt this in the implementation to convert both \n and \r\n to breaks which is probably better. 
Thank you, Moritz!  I wasn't sure if I'll receive such a nice answer due to my angry expressed post but you made my day! Yes, I am happy if I can help you testing your code. I have 100,000 active app users. THEY will test it for you.  Aside from that: Is there no other way to use an IAB plugin for Cordova which is not basing on that buggy Google code from 2012? Also I wrote an email to Trevor Johns, the developer of that java code asking him if he really things that the bugs are all fixed. He is not responsible for anything but should tell the truth if someone asks him. An IAB plugin is not a nice to have plugin. It is essential for surviving for indie developers who code in Cordova.  Best regards from Dortmund ;-) Marc
@nmitsou   Have you tried to restart KISS after that?  The attached video shows what happens.   [Screenrecorder-2017-07-24-09-55-44-872.zip](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS/files/1169167/Screenrecorder-2017-07-24-09-55-44-872.zip)

@paolitaclo I was able to resolve this. The reason might be this: For RN v59.x, it is given that we install the latest lottie-react-native, which might have the referenced libraries that have migrated to AndroidX. I upgraded the RN to v60.2 and then followed documentation. Also, automatic linking didn't work for me - I had to do it manually.  Be sure read the [upgrade help docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading) before upgrading.
I've installed and tried them now, and they seem to be working fine. I had to set the locale to other languages for the test (I tried French and Galician), since I did not translate them in Sardinian yet, but dandelion and Cherry had the same problem with those languages as well (with all languages, actually). So right now it looks like this:  Stringlate, Markor and Memetastic: OK  Cherry and dandelion: ERROR
After copying from a previous version the following 5 binaries:  `extractor evaluator kbmira mert pro`  mmt tune starts correctly and executes til step (3 o 4) where it fails with error:  `File not found: /tmp/tmp02ju54 (interpreted as /tmp/tmp02ju54). at /home/ubuntu/ModernMT/cli/opt/mert-moses.perl line 494. ` The error persists even after adding (with symbolic link) all the remaining binaries.   
I think you gave me the wrong link, that link goes to blocklauncher :P 
@parrt Just at the moment I cannot replicate the null pointer exception, I will put a bit of time into this soon and forward on what I have. However the 'EOF' bug and no 'start rule selected' remain. 
Still happening with latest build (1.5.3) 
Docker is on 184. Sorry. I've copied the wrong curl line for you. I've edited now. I have changed the real IP to a fake one. But I'm curl'ing the right IP. hehe
Left more info in your discord about this, but Shadows said:  "its a crash on rft's end from a failure to properly handle the wildcard meta to convert from an oredict entry back to a "real" thing you have to get a state from the item when the item has the meta wildcard (32767) and the state doesn't handle it properly, stuff like that happens specifically he's accessing an array without clamping a value"  I don't know what any of that means but maybe you'll find it useful.
This is what happens when my alt joins with Liteloader its as if it doesn't even know he has it. 
@Theobald93 Yes,I tried,it resoled #379 
Thanks,I will check in next release. sorry,but It is too difficult to build from latest master. 
I use Informix SQL command SET ROLE xxx during connection ( in bootstrap queries ). This role grands me permissions for some database objects ( tables for example ). When I try to do SELECT from these tables I get error: no SELECT permission for  ( all versions 6.3.x and 7.0.0 ).  I always got permissions in versions prior 6.3.x but I never seen SET ROLE in Query Manager (may be  this is my wrong look!)  
It worked -- thank you so much! This issue can be closed.
Copying a directory, with both the source and target on the same filesystem. After a bit of experimentation, it looks like it only happens if there is at least one entry in the source directory.  Expected behavior: it should copy the directory itself (not any contents).  Justification: while the JavaDoc could be clearer, the official tutorial page at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/copy.html does specifically say: > Directories can be copied. However, files inside the directory are not copied, so the new directory is empty even when the original directory contains files.  A quick snippet that demonstrates the problem: 
Wowww..... it worked like a charm! thank you thank thank thank you very much sarxos,, i am really really happy..  thank you for your help..  I can't believe it! fiuuhh after many many days spending my time. . thank for your support sarxos :) 
Unfortunately not, I have never done plugin development.
@andersekdahl Well, it _should_ call ESLint without specifying `.eslintrc` since then ESLint chooses the proper file itself. In a project one can have multiple `.eslintrc` files for different parts of the code. 
when  reconnected yes

The point is not about reproducing this specific issue because it is a general class of problem -- there is no useful feedback during the Web UI intialisation process. I can give you a command which will reliably cause CHE to fail but this is not about fixing that failure, it is about making sure that the users know what is happening:  `docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/che:/data -e CHE_MULTIUSER=true -e CHE_SINGLE_PORT=true eclipse/che start`  This will try to start up and run but the front-end code will fail to talk to all sorts of things properly, such as the websocket.  And please do not say that this isn't a supported configuration. That isn't the point. It is just an easy and reliable way to induce errors in the initialisation process.

Change `UfsSyncPathCache` to a map from <path, isRecursive> to timestamp. We only record the top level path in the cache, and during file access time, we check if its parent, its parent of parent ... has been recursively synced in the last time interval. This add some overhead in file access time. >  > We are still debating which route to take to improve this. > @liuzx32 will let you know as soon as we decide and have a fix for this.  @yuzhu I think that it's a problem about the longest prefix match, and only cache the parent dir can solve the last time interval case. Only cache dir not every recursive files can also save memory for master. 
It would be better to hide the icons or show at least valid selection values (instead of wrong ones). Hiding the features could be counter intuitive. That issue is not that important, go for the fastest solution.

Hello @msteinbeck, With AutoImports having the "false" value, Spoon specifies it. Is there a specific option for not importing the standard libraries such as String or System ?

The workaround `ref.setParent(method)` was already added [here](https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/27fc8208c4da4145c687c7f4db057de7dbed50f6/src/main/java/spoon/reflect/factory/ExecutableFactory.java#L101). But is just workaround, because we cannot assure that parent of executable reference will always point to it's declaring method. I have created a test and "some" fix in #1277
Hello, @swankjesse, no only one copy of OkHttp3, if you mean this line: `testImplementation testDependencies.okHttp3` I removed it and tried and still get the error. One is `implementation` while the other is `testImplementation`. However, other than those, there isn't any other copy of okhttp, I also removed the `testImplementation` one so there is only one implementation in the build.gradle.

Yeah, url to clipboard is fine. If it's not too much work, maybe a linky clicky thing so people who don't want it in their clipboard don't get it. Could be just a link in the help text.

> What's this AP Turrets? Sounds interesting.  It adds "Mounted Gun" signs that allow a player to right click the sign and change into a sort of turret mode, where they can then right click with a button and fire arrows.  It is very effective at balancing ships vs god armored players (as it can 2-3 shot them if configured correctly).
Hi Benny, I would really like to assist you to get this out of the way. Until now I used your binary releases. Is there any pointer/hint on using this repo to build the plugin myself? I think I could maybe experiment with some debugs myself to tackle the problem. I checked out the source but get lost on the way to turn this into a useful project in my netbeans installation that I could work with. Any help greatly appreciated.

Not sure if this helps because it need to distinguish if the event target is the local client or a remote one.  In case one player hosts the game, he should still get the renaming popup for himself because he would be the authority too. 
Refreshing the cache did not fix the problem. Did it twice. My java version is 1.8.0_51. Perhaps add more logging to help us troubleshoot? 
The problem is not the plugin, but how can we skip it for some specific goals of maven execution ?  Problem is that when merging my branch to develop using jgitflow plugin , plugin even stores commit values for that operation, hence making the execution goal failure for feature finish.  `Checkout Conflict Exception ` at the end of process. Sorry there is not any public project to reproduce the event.

@cimba007   I replaced the entire mycontroller directory - excluding backups folder and then replaced the database file with the one you provided for the slow graph issue.  In chrome I used "Empty Cache and Hard Reload" option and issue remains. I tried chrome in a "New Private Window" and same issue. I tried another browser (Firefox) and same issue.  Note: The other "Types" all show "Sub-Types" - it is only "Internal" that does not show the sub-types. I.e. When selecting Presentation, Set, Request or Stream the "Sub Types" dropdown is populated. So it is only when "Internal" is selected that the Sub-Types fails to populate. 
Well, I went through the process of making `adb` work only to find out it show immediately now too. As with #820 I am not able to reproduce it now. Inbetween the phone was rebooted a few times and some stuff installed. Probably some rare condition, but I was fiddling with it for quite some time, did numerous Syncthing restarts etc...  For the record, I had one more issue in the yesterday's state - when the battery saving was on for Syncthing and I got the popup dialog in Syncthing and tapped 'later', I was unable to change system settings (disabling the relaying to be precise), it would come back on after a restart. After I turned off battery saving, I was able to change the option. I wanted to reproduce it again before reporting, but now it works.
Autorank integrated.
Thanks for your response.  I answered you on the StackOverflow ... alternatively if you prefer I continue the conversation here.
Thanks for the fix.  Yes I'm a big Kotlin fan, and I'm very pleased to see that you're working on improving this library for Kotlin devs.  Thanks to you for your work on this library.
@KnightMiner Singleplayer.  @TheQuadShot What I meant was that when a building block for the smeltery is placed in the smeltery multi-block while it is currently smelting items, the smeltery will then drop the items it is currently smelting in front of the controller. It dropped a set of real items and phantom items. For example, if it is currently smelting an iron ore block, placing a smeltery block in the smeltery causes the smeltery to drop the iron ore block, along with another one which is a phantom item.

I think I have to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example. I'm not even sure if javadoc-plugin is the reason. It's a large project with >10k Source Lines of Code. I'll try to do this by the weekend.  Could you advice how to set up logging, so I can see which files are "dirty"?
No, I checked if ID only, this bug still exist. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23412916/31571138-c9b979d6-b0bf-11e7-8c7b-2bccf1ebf876.png) Gif here ![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23412916/31571128-b85a88ce-b0bf-11e7-8b35-15c039d04eec.gif) Cannot stack item can't be copy.

Yes, currently all emails end up in our default space despite the 3 rules we have created. We are still trying to debug that. The space does exist but has restricted permissions, which I'm thinking we might need to reconfigure in some way.
does not help. if i have a file with lombok annotations open the exception occurs as soon as the indexing is finished. 
@andrewlewis  I just reproduced it on another device. Device: AMINO Amigo7  Android: 8.0.0 Detailed Specs: https://www.aminocom.com/products/amino-vu/client-devices/amigo-7x  Also, I was able to reproduce the bug on exoplayer2.demo from the release-v2 branch, using the default sources (for example all Youtube DASH)  Here is how to reproduce it:  com.google.android.exoplayer2.demo.PlayerActivity  - Enable tunneling line 202

I thought that this error is more related to buildcraft, because it happened after updating your mod. I created a issues in Forrestry.
It works if you explicit set the database on your application.properties/yml spring.jpa.database=POSTGRESQL

But you should get in touch with @iocanel that already started to investigate also.
Yes, it is working now.

By indexed scripts I meant [stored scripts](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-scripting-using.html#modules-scripting-stored-scripts), I am sorry for the confusion. Also my number 1 point specifies that it should not require dynamic mapping, therefore I have dynamic mappings disabled. Is the dynamic mappings feature required in 5.x to use scripts?
running the latest paper 1.13.1... if i afk without the movement disabled, when move u r fine.. its just like dropping you when u cant move..  i'll check all my plugins to see if anything can be interfering and make sure all are updated and report back.
@ywelsch Thanks for looking at this  - These are not master eligible nodes. There are 3 other master elegible nodes in the cluster (which don't store any data). While doing a rolling upgrade, the script processes all the master eligible nodes first and then moves to data nodes.  All data nodes (the kind which show failure) have similar config to one given below    The master elgible nodes are `10.44.0.43,44,45` which don't show any failure.  - Closed indices are mostly created on 7.x. For the latest issue, the indices mentioned in the logs above were created using 7.x

I wrote the Unit-Test using the latest reactor-core master (commit 49b899b57673ad4ea97f79517113010157113b62).  Thanks for the tip with `Flux#parallel`. I didn't know this exists. We don't need dynamic subscribers, so this would fit. I also like, that in `Flux#parallel` the `prefetch` count is configurable.   When looking at the code of `Flux#parallel` I noticed, that there is also this logic, that `Subscriber.requests()` is always called after `prefetch * 3/4` elements (e.g.  [ParallelUnorderedRunOn.java#122](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/aefbe5303725ca9c6aec172a86d672e16a430a9b/src/main/java/reactor/core/publisher/ParallelUnorderedRunOn.java#L122). Is there a reason for this `3/4`?

It was configured on OAutomaticBackup. I do not have installed linux containers, we are running on windows, should we install anything more?  Other strange thing is that configuration "firstTime", didn't work well, backup started when we started OrientDB service. 
Well according to docker my local image name *is* the repository. However, yes, that is in essence what I'm suggesting. 
I could not find a similar case where colors are not parsed correctly, so I quoted it on here, but since this is just an addon, bbox might be the root cause. 
Yes, it's still the same issue in v2.1.4 as of today (10.10.2015). 
Okay, I created a really small test here:  import org.flywaydb.core.Flyway; import org.junit.BeforeClass; import org.junit.Test;  import java.io.*; import java.sql.DriverManager; import java.sql.SQLException; import java.sql.Statement;  public class BaselineTest {   
I'm using the latest build (as of today, 4/11/16) of Spigot 1.9.2, the latest vanilla Minecraft client (1.9.2), and I have no idea what version of Java I'm running on the client because I've never installed it on this gaming laptop (it's brand new) so it must just be whatever the Minecraft client installs/downloads.    There's nothing in either the Spigot logs or the Minecraft client logs. I don't know where I would find any Java client logs since I never actually installed Java on this laptop???  The pet hat feature definitely works for me, too.  But when I click on the pet hat icon again (which is supposed to remove the pet from your head), that's when Java crashes. If I just toggle the pet off instead of attempting to remove the pet from my head with the pet hat icon, it doesn't crash.   
@joshiste  Sorry for late response.  It's inside of docker.  And I use it with spring cloud config and spring cloud eureka.  The spring cloud version is Camden.RELEASE.  Here is the application:

There are no errors in the console log. All is starting fine. Spigot version is 1.11.2
Yes, it's a predicate, these steps reliably reproduce it when run in a fresh vespaengine/vespa docker image.  
I've never built this project (or used gradle) before and may not find the time to try it this week. If the fix is mostly harmless, it might be faster to send the pull request.

I can't show u the exact ip address. thing is: when execute _nodes/stats, most nodes show below: "transport_address": "inet[/172.0.0.1:9300]",but there is one node shows: "transport_address": "inet[172.0.0.2/172.0.0.2:9300]", I guess the format shoud be ip:port, but why this one shows ip/ip:port

@chickenlj  I am sorry. I am busy recently. I have not started to develop for this.  I think we can add a extra config subelement to the <dubbo:method>, such as argumentClass. If a <dubbo:method> is configed and the method is an override method, the argumentClass is required. And it is optional for a non-override method.

The dop is 4 for the complete graph. The tasks that hang have the name: CHAIN DataSource(Input Lines) -> Map(Tokenize Lines).

@sjudd This problem is caused by the mobile phone system. The mobile phone manufacturer has solved this problem.
I was moving. Console say that Vlader97 moved too quickly, but I could not repeat it.  The error shows up randomly. 
1. I have seen this with two alerts, and their alert conditions were: - "Alert is triggered when there is more than one message in the last 6 minutes. Grace period: 60 minutes. Not including any messages in alert notification. Configured to repeat notifications."  This alert should have fired off after restarting it, but never did.   - "Alert is triggered when there is less than one message in the last 10 minutes. Grace period: 60 minutes. Not including any messages in alert notification. Configured to repeat notifications."  For this alert I made it more sensitive by changing the threshold to "less than 1111 messages", then it should have fired off straight away. It did not fire off until half an hour later.  2. I haven't found a reliable way to make the alert condition work again. My current workaround is to create an entire new stream, alert, and notification from scratch with the exact same configuration as the old one - and those new ones work.  3. I am not sure. The "unresolved alerts" list doesn't make sense to me - I can see a couple of alert in there listed as "still ongoing" when I know the corresponding stream does not have any messages anymore. May be a problem unto itself.

It seems that every client got frozed together when anyone of them established a synchronous connection.

When I click "yes" it only downloads the next picture, just tested that again. We are using our Nextcloud server only as a gateway to our own S3, we only use external storage folder, nothing is on actual nextcloud server. Can that kind of setup cause issue?

Hello and thank you for your quick reply. I restarted the server and after 25 minutes, the problem came again. 1) The KVM machine under Proxmox ![proxmox_kvm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2456309/21232090/c008eeda-c2ea-11e6-910b-9a04fa00884d.png)  2) The Google Chrome Dev console. I first thought that an extension diigolet could bring the issue. So Pic_1 is before disabling diigolet, Pic_2 after disabling it.   ![chrome_dev_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2456309/21232328/77d8f500-c2eb-11e6-871a-3d04ea098325.png) ![chrome_dev_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2456309/21232323/75fe6d8c-c2eb-11e6-84b2-19ee6b749e57.png)  Many thanks for your help.

@phit yes, i go in crash coordinates - no crash without Sponge ![2018-01-08_03 04 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26658563/34655794-d1b5980a-f420-11e7-8e73-e51ded9197b2.png) 
Hmm, how many disk space need strimzi ? That could be a issue since i have only 30 GiB disk per VM on my development enviroments
It's a 5.1 tablet and yes it is updated for 0.13.1 
Yegor, sounds good. The only issue is that with "fully hardcoded" file name you won't be able to run several builds simultaneously, what is usually done on build servers. So I would name this parameter like socketDirectory (which is equal to "data" parameter by default) and use file names like "mysql-2013-12-25-14-00-48-<random>.sock".  As another alternative (to simplify things for users), you can add parameter like "useTempAsDataDir {true|false}". If this option is true - a random directory is created inside temp on every build. If this option is false, data is located according to "data" parameter. Disadvantage of this solution is that your plugin will be needed to determine "temp" directory location and this is platform-dependent thing (don't know whether Java allows to do it automatically or not).  Another solution would be to introduce option like "dataParentDirectory". User will point you to parent directory like "/tmp" or "c:\windows\temp" and all you need is to create random subdirectory there by yourself. This is easier, but less elegant. 
No example yet, sorry. But seems it is configurable but not enabled by default: https://github.com/flyway/flyway/blob/master/flyway-gradle-plugin/src/main/java/org/flywaydb/gradle/task/AbstractFlywayTask.java#L53 and https://flywaydb.org/documentation/gradle/#extending-the-default-classpath

@loosebazooka  I am not sure if it is connected to Windows or its version. I have installed an Ubuntu OS with VirtualBox, and I could deploy without any problem. The output of that command is [], so an empty array.  @chanseokoh  I agree. Could you reproduce the error? I followed [this tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-app-engine-springboot/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) on my Windows 8.1 computer, and I got the exception.
I get the following error: /usr/bin/go build -o /home/d3xter/IdeaProjects/Go_Test/bin/Go_Test -gcflags -N -I main flag provided but not defined: -I usage: build [-o output] [build flags] [packages]  computeGoCommand removes the double quotes.  And when i try the command with the double quotes: /usr/bin/go build -o /home/d3xter/IdeaProjects/Go_Test/bin/Go_Test -gcflags "-N -I" main #main open main: No such file or directory  "go build" tries to pass "main" as a file or directory to be included when compiling.  running the command without -I works: /usr/bin/go build -o /home/d3xter/IdeaProjects/Go_Test/bin/Go_Test -gcflags "-N" main  Go_Test binary is compiled and no error happens 
Now that I think of it that could be a possibility. That is the same dragon that was flying in the jerky flying video I put up. Maybe it happens when they land.

I use maven for this dependency. but I could not find latest 5.5.1 in maven repo. Please update. Thanks for your quick support.  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.simplejavamail/simple-java-mail
These are the main issues: 1. The error message is ambiguous so the user does not know what the problem is - the app or the server? 2. There is an empty folder made when this happens which is undesirable. 3. The app has the "try again" feature but is not offered in this case.  Returning a specific error message would be too much work considering the possible pururin errors.  How bout a general "server error" message and then offering to try again similar to download errors. And a folder should only be made if the links are parsed successfully and an image is ready to be downloaded.  The above suggestions should fix the main issues but please do not consider them to be the best solutions. If there's any way you can fix the above issues with less work then that's great. Good luck! 
1. Can you confirm you aren't using the daemons because those block that shutdown signal from being sent. YES:  I guess I can tack on an `osw.close()`, I'll give that a shot. 
If i do "UPLOAD" the CSV that looks ok I will get this message.   _Error creating new mentor Error occurred while creating new mentor with id 'd06072ef-05e6-3f83-4f3b-dfaafb65320e', name 'undefined': {"error":{"code":null,"message":{"lang":"en-US","value":"Unauthorized"}}}_ 
the delay before the sound is switched back is roughly a second as far as I can measure it.  the issue doesn't occur with three-pin mini jack connectors apparently.  however, some of the problem depends on the application, as it doesn't happen with e.g. VLC. 
Install ant, run "ant" in current directory (builds the .jar file).  "ant clean" to remove everything, and "ant test" (TBI) to run unit tests 
I have attached debug log, but there seems to be nothing related to the issue.  [dbeaver-debug.log.zip](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/files/244686/dbeaver-debug.log.zip)  What happens is: I log in to the database.

SUGGESTION EXPECTED HERE from table_t t 
Please find the attached log. [mirror.log](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/files/3550921/mirror.log)  I also used recently added probes which does not seem to work.    
You're right, it just shows the error from the web GUI. I'll copy the issue upstream. 
The tests are ignored, if they are needed check they pass. 
Hey @aaalaniz   As far as I know it happens only in speaker mode.. will check it out and ill let you know there may be a delay cause I don't have the mobile now will update here once I test it out.   
I suspect the circular dependencies are somewhere inside that massive load of stuff coming from the imported BOM file. :( not in the build.gradle file  itself. I posted it to https://gist.github.com/alexeyOnGitHub/c16f619028a2ba2285af2dcde4aaac8b (stripped the company name in it).

@overheadhunter Not 100 percent sure how you mean that, but I've tried the following: - Clients used: Cyberduck and CarotDAV - Server used: WebDAV server of box.com online storage - Transfered the mentioned files to box.com via each of the above clients. - The end result is the same as with Cryptomator. - Only difference is that Cyberduck doesn't even ask if the file should be overwritten. CarotDAV does.  One unrelated curious thing I've just experienced is that Cryptomator opened one of my vaults twice at the same time, i. e. it has been displayed as 2 separate drives in Windows Explorer (until locking). After unmounting/locking the vault in Cryptomator, there's still one instance left that I can still use. I'll leave it there until I shut down the computer tonight, so if this is of any interest to you, let me know. [Edit: Dang - too late. Somehow managed to accidentally quit the Cryptomator client, now the second instance is also gone. Sorry]. 
Another stacktrace (same app slightly different result):   
When I restart, all works, but I can't resolve this import: `import gov.nasa.jpf.vm.Verify;` But I guess that is not a problem with FeatureIDE itself, except if the library with this jar should be added to the project.  I will check the update. U r welcome. 
> How were you expecting to specify the pac4j Config originally?  I had no expectations at all.  However, is it possible to do it in a way that is similar to what you are already doing (and the way that JAX-RS does it in general): i.e., by allowing the user to define a `@Provider` that implements an interface that is _specifically_ for initialization? E.g., something like JAX-RS's `ContextResolver` interface.  
@germanattanasio  Please reopen this issue.  You did not solve the problem with extracting out the year from some queries.    Show all results in 2016. 2016  I have tested this scenario in the Java SDK and in curl posts.  These queries do not work in the Java SDK, but they do work in the curls.  
On a "normal" jar packing build I would expect only the one jar artifact to be in there. And I am pretty sure it was working like that before (with maven2?).  What's the difference between `project.getArtifacts()` and `project.getAttachedArtifacts()`? 
Oh…I'm sorry. I tried it again,I can do it. 
My modification take always the first result key word ("Résultat"). So, 2 solutions: - take local (replace List `ResultColumnNames.getAuthorizedNames()` by a Map ("fr", "Résultat" and "en", "result") and use get element by key (with local variable). - just switch "result" and "Résultat" and use always "result" (always "en" by default in SQL).  what do you think about it?

Thanks for the quick response and for having already addressed the issue by the sounds of it.  Just updated to v3.2.10. Will try it in a few hours when I head home and report back.
I tried something along the lines of     but then requery complained because the statement expected the mapped type (`UUID`) not the persisted type (`byte[]`) as argument. This leads me to believe the converter is called for me.  I tried explicitly setting a custom `UUID` to `String` converter on the entity field with no success because `UUID` is internally always persisted as `byte[]` by requery before converter gets a chance. 
We have hundreds of Dagger modules in the project. It will be really hard to find such component. Is there a way to get Dagger to print which component has the error?  About example to reproduce, I honestly have no idea what is the problem right now so I can't provide a repro steps nor example at this stage.
Using JER 0.3.1 and JEI 2.22.4.106, I'm not seeing any recipes from JER. JER loads up fine, says it's enabled, there just aren't any recipes for items like gunpowder and rotten flesh.  EDIT: Derp on my part, updated to latest JEI, can see recipes now. 
Another message from the same account in another client. This way chatty won't change tab color to red and I don't need to check if any new message.
Looks like it only happens when `git-as-svn` detects a new Gitlab repo (branch) that should be exposed via svn. If I restart the daemon the error won't appear again.
I've had a look now, but I'm sorry to say that I don't think I'm able to ascertain whether this would help me or not. I have no reproducable test to simulate this sudden unregistration that we sometimes see in real life situations, where a successful WriteResponse may turn up in the logs long after the device has unregistered and perhaps even established a new registration in the meantime.  But I didn't think that this was only a Leshan issue? How does the Californium BlockwiseLayer class get aware that it shouldn't send the next block but instead cancel the request? I cannot find that logic in the code.

Thanks for the feedback! I created a PR: https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/issues/2062 
I can confirm that this is still an issue for me. I tried changing the folder and also downloading it to another drive, but I am still getting stuck.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54046061/66438572-1763f280-e9fb-11e9-9a04-6ce38e4ebee9.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54046061/66438599-2b0f5900-e9fb-11e9-9a11-c7609a3d0e4b.png)  
Yes, all games. Everytime i go to the games configuration and tapping Start the app freezes. 
We have encountered the same problem in a project before, and finally solved it like this:  `if (e instanceof SocketTimeoutException){             OkHttp.getInstance().okHttpClient.dispatcher().cancelAll();             OkHttp.getInstance().okHttpClient.connectionPool().evictAll();     } ` But there is a downside to this, the app must fail once and the next visit will succeed.  Based on the results of our current tests, this may be a bug in the okhttp connection pool module, which is very easy to appear on a particular machine. The step is to open the application, wait a few minutes, and then trigger the event to access the network. To be sure, the network on the machine is normal at this time, other applications can access the network normally, and a new okhttpClient can be created in the current application to access the network. 
Thanks for your lightning fast reply ! I don't really know what I could send for the PR, as if we check for the HRESULT is null, this will prevent the exception, but I don't know how to resolve the fact the com is not initialized.  I would like to help more. I can try any modification you want me to test.

I deleted this plugin and reinstall it again, I deleted the Prison files, to make it work! But it didnt work! Here is the following What do I mean, I created rank [K] as the begging rank, and a made alot more ranks like J-FREE In Rank Free (The last rank) I did /rankup again, it changed me back to rank K It didn't say that Im in highest rank! So I suggest doing /prisonranks create [K] start &8[&3K&8] 100000 This is a example /prisonranks create (rankname) (level) (prefix) (money) level allows me to make the rank first rank or last rank or middle rank Like changing start with [finish] and middle [mid] starting [start] Please say that you understand me

@PatilShreyas thanks much for the quick reply. It's a simple issue.   There are two **FirestoreRecyclerAdapters** not one. One in **ui/firestore** directory and other in **ui/database**  You added **updateOptions** in both of them but forgot to change the constructor in one of them. In **ui/database/FirestoreRecyclerAdapter** _mOptions_ is updated.  But the same isn't done in **ui/firestore/FirestoreRecyclerAdapter**. See lines 38 and 39  https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/d7aec385c2bbb807b39b4c3c444f161f55be17fc/firestore/src/main/java/com/firebase/ui/firestore/FirestoreRecyclerAdapter.java#L38  @PatilShreyas @samtstern Let me know if you need more details. I can give the code but this is more succinct way to get to the root of the issue.
Sorry, I'm working in a complex application so I'd have to create an example only for this. Before of create an example because it will take some time for me to create it, can you answer me this question, who is starting the listeners if they are registered in TracingJmsListenerEndpointRegistry? The method which starts the listeners is in JmsListenerEndpointRegistry (start) because of the implementation of the Lifecycle interface, so I understand that this method will be called if the registry is defined as a bean, and with the last commit there is only one registry in the context the generic JmsListenerEndpointRegistry which is not used by the JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar.

My computer specs are there also, not playing on a potato.
Sounds plausible and I would agree that the bug seems to be in the automation part - so @danchom, your call :-)
 
I tried 1.5.6.RELEASE and 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT . Same behavior.
I simplified this a bit too much to get the stack trace, but if you look at the JSON output from calling http://localhost:8080/organizations first with the 1.3.5 then with the 1.4.0 you can see that @XmlTransient is not being honored. Just switch the comments on the spring-boot-version property and parent version in the top-level maven pom.xml.   Here's some SQL to create sample data:    [api-sample.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/345103/api-sample.zip) 
Hey Mario,  The 5 calls are not problematic - I'm actually loading 5 different content types for our home screen. It's those content space and content type querying calls that are strange, because I'm always passing the explicit content type to load.  For example, this is how I'm loading the whole content type:    As I said, I do this for those 5 different content types, so I would expect 5 different calls like this, but not 15.
@rwinch Yes it is, i have cleared all the cookie then i have logged in then while tried to logout its giving NPE. I was using 1.0.2.RELEASE and was overriding **CookieHttpSessionStrategy** to solve setting custom cookie path  as per your input and i have experienced the same NPE but i thought it may be due to the change i've made so i have fixed in **getSessionIds** method as follows    the problem was `cookieValues.iterator().next()` was returning null on logout. 
Distributed session implementation such as redis and hazelcast, only update the modified part of session data to session storage.  And the session modification is captured by calling `WebSession::setAttribute`. Only modify session data's value without calling `setAttribute`, session data will not be updated anyway.  For example:  The following code will NOT add ("key", "value") to session key`A_DICT_TYPE_SESSION_KEY`'s value, if use redis or hazelcast based distributed session.    `setAttribute` is overwrite by redis or hazelcast based distributed session to capture session data's modification.  For the above reason, we finally got "authorization_request_not_found" in some case since the code failed to update session's data. 
I think the reason is two-fold. 1. To reduce the possibility of creating nearly identical file names, which can be confusing to file users. 2. This is how MediaWiki normalizes file page names (among other conversions such as mpeg→mpg) and we would like to stick with it to not surprise editors: https://doc.wikimedia.org/mediawiki-core/master/js/source/mediawiki.Title.html#mw-Title-method-normalizeExtension

Hi @sanzinger , thanks for your additional comment. Then I will create a PR to fix it. Thank you!
@vietj works with my test suite, so seems to be fine.
I am using this lib in Android, compiled with JAVA 1.8, but as i said everything works fine on `alpha.3`, the crash happen only in `alpha.4` Added too in my `R8/Proguard` files rule : `-keep,allowoptimization class org.pcap4j.**` But it crashes in `Debug & Release` build too no matter for code shrinking  Example in this line it crash  `Attempt to invoke virtual method 'java.security.CodeSource java.security.ProtectionDomain.getCodeSource()' on a null object reference` 
No, displayed fields differ between entries somehow. 
No additional information, it's easy to reproduce. Steps are provided above. 
I did use `<table>` element and didn't set `@frame`. 
Thank you for finding the bug,  I fixed it. By the way, only the last reduce is marked as combinable. With chained reducers, I simply mean two subsequent reduces. Still getting the error.  I'm using the LocalExecutor, not sure how to retrieve the plan from that. 
No, SceneBuilder should not crash on editing fxml file just because it was started from netbeans.  Maybe check if its an issure with SceneBuilder, Netbeans plugin or JFoenix.

Hi, Aliksander!  > were you using some custom attributes for this affected TR, btw?  No, I didn't use some custom attributes. Just attributes form [instruction](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/salesforce-sso/)  > Could you please write down all your configuration steps   I'm not sure that it will help you to reproduce this issue because I didn't do any special things. But there are steps that I did: 1. removed previous version of Gluu (2.4.2) (_apt-get remove ..._, then remove **/opt/gluu-server-2.4.2***) 2. apt-get install gluu-server-2.4.3 3. /etc/init.d/gluu-server-2.4.3 start 4. chroot into Gluu envirenment by _/etc/init.d/gluu-server-2.4.3 login_ 5. configure Gluu and setup components. All except CAS and Asimba 6. Create few users in OpenDJ for tests 7. Configure TR for TestShib2 step by step as decribed [there](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/test-shib2/) 8. Testing TestShib2 9. Configure Salesforce step by step from [there](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/salesforce-sso/)  At first time I used cert Custom Script for authentication. But in the second time after Gluu reinstallation I used default auth metod.  I tried to remove TestShib2 TR but the same result. 
No, the DPI is default, but if i change size of interface elements in Settings/Display, problem will be resolved. On screen I show situation, when I have default settings.

It can not transfer into the ExtraUtilities2 Wireless battery, and cannot transfer into any Actually addition machines. And cannot accept energy from EnderIO Capacitor Banks but can transfer energy into the Capacitor Bank.  Testing other storage blocks in our pack to see if it has more issues.
There's only shown "Event Cache" (not Earth Cache as I wrote at the beginning) in the filter panel above the list.   The switch button solved my problem. Now I can see all caches again.  So I think the "recycle bin" icon is not supposed to clear the filter if it was set on the main screen?  
No, it doesn't seem to happen in the latest nightly (new UI), but I have only run it for a few days so I can't be absolutely sure yet since it didn't happen often before either. 
Hi again :) It's a testnet. I slightly modified your code and truncated the number to fit the ushort - changed this.setRefBlockNum(UShort.valueOf(blockId.getNumberFromHash())) to this.setRefBlockNum(UShort.valueOf(blockId.getNumberFromHash() & 0xffff)) and it works, but I don't know, if it is a legitimate :)

I will remember to save the log next time it crashes. Travel is a upgrade for The Ender sword and dark pick (and maybe other dark tools) that basically functions as travel wand so you don't have to carry the wand.  
@sapessi I can confirm that the workaround above works for me. You might want to use   In practice, the file name passed in to the method is not the path of an actual file, but the path of an HTTP request. For static files this is unlikely to be the correct path of the file on disk, and for dynamic requests the file may not even exist, and the type detected may be used to route to the correct handler.  This method is essentially saying: "given a hypothetical file xyz.html, what would the mime type be based on the file extension?".  Requiring that we mark all paths in the application working directory as valid seems unnecessary and potentially a risk if the same security check is used in other places.  My preference would be to keep the security check in place, but to isolate the file system `probeContentType` to a known (non-existent) path to allow the content type detection to work without custom security exceptions being needed.  That's just my view of the problem, I am happy to leave it as-is if you disagree :)
It's fixed! Sorry, I just back home :)
Sorry, I don't have a simple example I can share. I have hit this bug when using Py4J to call Pyhon on Apache Spark workers from Scala. I was not able to reproduce it under a simpler scenario.   However, when I added the locking around `connections.addLast(cc)` call, I stopped seeing this bug.
I'm using `Spring Boot 2.2.0.M1` and thus it's difficult to test `1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` now, as it breaks several dependencies. I'll confirm your thoughts and close the issue once a new Spring Boot milestone is available.
Hey there turbo,  I looked up last nights logs and it just shows the launching messages and some chat - it seems the crashes didnt generate a report. It seemned to me that they were memory errors.  Today (because I have the fusion reactor chunkloaded) I could log in to a base without power. And without graphical lag.   here is my setup: https://imgur.com/a/4ePof , the advanced powercells output 20k rf/t , and they were fully charged. I have the electrolysers equipped with 30 speed upgrades and unlimited water from the sink.   Hope this helps, building the fusion reactor was great fun (I think it's an amazing mod, great work!)  
Changing the name is not a problem in VSCode. It's the id that matters. We just have to update the docs. If you look at the other extensions in the Marketplace, mentioning the company name in the name is not common. Red Hat is really the exception here. Also we always show the publisher along with name and description.

Using the existing fork would be fine, a new branch with a unique name would allow multiple iterations which usually will happen if the app is actively developed, maybe you can simply number them 1, 2, 3 or add a date-string, so they are easier to distinguish/put in order.

The headless flag was intended to allow the plugin to run without issue on headless jvms for docker.  But a user might have some plugin that requires to have headless=false even in non gui mode.  So I think previous behavior should be restored.  Thanks

I cannot say specifically what triggers this error. So far it has happened only on my dev laptop, not on my desktop PC, but several times already, always after upgrading AS. Last time (a couple of months ago) I was able to fix it by reinstalling AS + clearing build caches, but this time this did not work, so I started doing some more internet research. There I found several people having the same problem, not always with a solution at hand. Finally I found the solution that worked for me (extending proguard config) here: https://github.com/serso/android-checkout/issues/138 (It also includes a possible cause: ProGuard config of another component being too agressive.) Since I have added those lines to my local proguard config, every build is stable again, and without those lines every build directly crashed with the error shown in the first post.

Will upload new stack trace when I get it. Now I don't get it anymore, it must have been some error in my code causing it.

I can confirm it is fixed, I tested using latest Snapshot `omnifaces-2.2-20150924.202210-25` with RichFaces `4.5.9.Final`. Thanks! 
Nothing actually. 
Apart from reading Java, I haven't done anything with it lately. Here's a short, commented test written in Scala: http://pastebin.com/h7XMeCX2 Hopefully this helps. 
yes that fixes my issue, thanks.
Unfortunately, it's `DECLARED`. Only the unknown annotation type (`mapperTypeElement.getAnnotationMirrors().get(0).getAnnotationType()`) has   kind `ERROR`, but that is probably not useful to detect the problem.

No, the `autocorrect` feature is disabled. Just installing and enabling the detekt plugin is enough to break Save Actions.
Yes it could be fine. See for example _jakarta.json-api_ or _jakarta.persistence-api_ .
Yes we upgraded spring-boot (https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/issues/3917), this is spring-core. Any objections to go to 4.3.18 for this? I think we need to make sure the version of Camel we use in the meta and integration pods can handle this.
yeap:) 
Yeah I agree about production but I am thinking more in terms of offering a similar experience in case of static file and URL.  I have tried to trnasform to JWKS (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/9a0b47298c807739a9eb1adfba50795e/raw/31678c9d5de9efe10207da6ce1378bb51ff12a43/quarkus.jwt.pub.jwk.json) but now I am getting `Failed to resolve a key from: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/9a0b47298c807739a9eb1adfba50795e/raw/31678c9d5de9efe10207da6ce1378bb51ff12a43/quarkus.jwt.pub.jwk.json` So probably I have not done correctly.
is a crash really weird and it happens random. On the emulator Nexus 4 with Android 4.3 never happens with the emulator Nexus 7 with Android 4.3 it happens random, changing accounts, opening a transaction, or opening the drawer....in a manner precisely abnormal.

Our SCC version is 1.2.1.  In the contract, we have query parameters in the request section, e.g.: `parameter 'size' : 4` Ideally, we would want to use a regex here, allowing the user to call us with any integral number. As such, in the response we do not want to use a hard-coded number either, but rather refer to the request, e.g.: `body([ size : fromRequest().query('size'), ... ])`  This, however, yields to quoted strings in the generated JSON stub, e.g.: `"size" : "{{{request.query.size.[0]}}}"`  Ideally, fromRequest() would allow us to specify the type of the result, as it cannot guess in advance. As I said, string is fail-safe, but in this case yields wrong results.

I checked all versions between 3.4.0 and 3.4.4 and the error is reproducable in all versions. So maybe my predeccessor had found the same issue and thought it's not important.  It's very reproducable: 1. Activate feature -> Everything is working fine 2. Deactivate database connection 3. Activate database connection -> the feature is failing to start again.   From now on we need to keep an eye on the production server.
ok, i try to explain what happend 1. every request will execute method `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#loadGatewayFilters` and it will traversal a ArrayList(param: filterDefinitions); 2. u can find method `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#loadGatewayFilters` usage in `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#getFilters` , u can find the implements of List are both ArrayList; 3. some times we must refresh `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.config.GatewayProperties#defaultFilters` or `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinition#filters` or both them, if now the request thread is excuting the method `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#loadGatewayFilters`, it will throw `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`  i'm sure is not happen all the time, but i think it can make our service return the error message, it's terrible for users, thank u!  stack trace:

Hey,  I am attaching a file with 50 labels. When I try to open it with edumips I get a parsing error that label below "label32" are not found (I have named the labels from label0 to label50). I tried removing the first 2 labels and the error I am getting is that labels from label34 and below are not found. That's why I assumed there is an upper limit to the labels.  Thanks for your help, John [LabelTest.txt](https://github.com/lupino3/edumips64/files/225602/LabelTest.txt) PS: I checked there are no duplicate labels

Anything like this does the job on Safari, but not on Chrome / Firefox (where the same circle is serialized to approx. ~13k / 6k message size, both of which arrive without any issue at cineast). So it is most likely a Safari problem. However, i think i've encountered the problem already on chrome / firefox. It seems also to depend on the size of the sketched circle, small circles do not crash. ![Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 09 22 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14314470/71156879-34117780-2241-11ea-86f3-e0d3b52f07ac.png) I suggest keeping this issue open in case someone can reproduce it on firefox / chrome

No, any chest at all.  The one in particular was not connected to the ME.  It was just a standard chest.    And Yueh, the server owners have a system that allow you to actually purchase points to buy kits that will basically just creative in items for you.  That is how I got my ME drives.    I did some further testing and just can't figure out what is causing it.  I have the exact same set up on an SP world and have not seen such an issue.  Got another guy on the server that has an ME set up, no issues.  I have used AE since Unleashed and never seen anything like this before.    Restarting the server is like an on off switch for it.  After the items dupe, they remain duped until the server restarts, at that point when it comes back online the items literally undupe unless I have pulled them from the ME and placed them in my inventory.  I am at a loss.  
Thank you

Hi, thanks for your replies.  @ignazio1977: I'm quite sure the removed axiom cannot be derived from other axioms, but I'll recheck that. Thanks.  **_I wanted to explain what I was doing exactly and show what went wrong, but unexpectedly the inferred statements are successfully updated in the scenario I'm explaining below. I'll have to check other examples, to see if this issue is fully solved._**   You can see the exact configuration and ontology at the end of this post for more details.  I'm using Apache Jena Fuseki's [assemblers ](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/fuseki-configuration.html) to create a InfModel with the PelletReasonerFactory attached. Because I'm not using Openllet from Java code, I'm unable to see what is happening under the hood. In this configuration I'm loading the ``ontology-plus-data.ttl`` file (with the below content) into the InfModel and this works as expected.   When querying this dataset from Fuseki SPARQL query interface (see Query 1 below), it successfully returns the expected inferred statements of the single individual having the inffered data type property value "12".  Now I execute an update query (see Query 2 below) to remove an axiom and this is successful (note that in Fuseki for updates you need to use the /update URL and not the /query URL), ~~however, the derived axiom (when executing Query 1 again) remains~~ and the inferred statement are removed, which I did not expect.   Query 1 
That works fine.. Great work! 
In `Live map` I am using `OSM: Mapnik` If there is something else that I can do to give more info about this. Debug log from c:geo maybe?

You can't use `@Transient` because the property has no backing field. The backing field is provided by the delegate instead.
@vRallev I will provide a sample to reproduce.  I agree this should work. In fact, our original way of canceling the job was the following:    But looking at the library code, I realized that in this line [JobManager::285](https://github.com/evernote/android-job/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/evernote/android/job/JobManager.java#L285) the `includeStarted` parameter is assigned to `false`. So, I assumed that that was the problem to cancel the job, because I was calling the method inside a running job and, therefore, `getAllJobRequestsForTag(...)` was returning an empty set.  That's the reason we are using `JobManager.instance().cancelAllForTag(TAG);` directly. Because this method ([JobManager::419](https://github.com/evernote/android-job/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/evernote/android/job/JobManager.java#L419)) sets `includeStarted` to `true`.  None of the solutions worked, obviously. Another thing to say is that the usage of `includeStarted` in those methods is kind of misleading and maybe a better way would be to expose this parameter in `getAllJobRequestsForTag(...)` method... Anyway, maybe I could open another issue for this or provide a PR.
I did, since it is also mentioned in the tooltip; "If true, shows the hunger (and saturation if " + SHOW_SATURATION_OVERLAY_NAME + " is true) that would be restored by food you are currently holding"
It did indeed fix the issue. We are currently looking if there are still issues on some devices. So far it looks like the workaround is doing it's job. https://github.com/Qabel/qabel-android/commit/1cecf3f7037ebd970f35bf06811b82fddafa032b

/dev/mmcblk0p1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered) nothing special.  with 1.6.0 it looks similar, but after a week there are "only" 19000-20000 open file handles.

Yes. I don't know exactly what mod does it (no special mods installed for it). I tried to reproduce it on new map by just emptying oil bucket in nether. But it just exploded. Seems that oil generated in nether somehow o_O I know it is nether because crash can be reproduced on spoiled map by entering nether portal 
Maybe we should remove the timeout. Increasing the timeout just sets the amount of data threshold higher. It doesn't solve the problem.  Ideally, we would remove the timeout and interrogate ES to find out what is going on. If just synchronising, then leave it alone. If failure, kill it.

that didn't work for me. to build the project, i had to create an `ant.properties` file with the following contents:    i created that file after using the `android` command.

It's a client error log that was sent to me in discord. Accroding to it, the version affected is 1.12.1
We were able to reproduce the problem using Flyway 4.0, 3.2.1 and 3.2. 
Having a really difficult time troubleshooting this... I suspected it was one of several non-standard items that were in a few of my chests, but when each was placed in an empty chest one at a time, none of them seem to trigger the hang. However, when I open and save certain chests full of items, it's a guaranteed hang. Will find a way to upload a world file shortly, but looks like Github doesn't support anything other than images.

I will give it a shot. Sadly I don't have a good way to reproduce yet. The fix looks good and makes sense. The allocation/release is now symmetrical. Other invalid bytes I had were 'l', 'o', 'u', 'C'. This might be related to the way we wrap the connection in SSL.

i think he maybe closed this as I accidentally submitted instead of putting "enter" when just entering the ticket initially... so it was no where near complete, but probably left it closed since it's technically a duplicate of #104, not at all the same behavior... but I guess the same error.  That one is closed as he keeps thinking he's fixed it.

Well I agree it defiantly has to do with the issues with #270 but it was working just fine before. I would say the simplest solution is to treat the new value not as `Array<Anything>` but as `dynamic` also is it not?

Of course `"My Feature With Space"` have to be in quotes, but for non-whitespace characters it is _optional_ to add quotes. isn't it? When leaving this out, `"A"` will be interpreted as invalid feature name although it is possible (because `boolean isWellformed(FeatureModel, String)`will accept it (I'm talking just about a visual representation in syntax highlighting by the way. I don't change anything on the logic outside "coloring" letters ;) ).  With the solution described above, the syntax highlighting works as it should.  ![bildschirmfoto 2015-02-10 um 22 12 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3775170/6136562/f5802358-b171-11e4-8993-848332eba303.png)

Not sure, I'll try preparing a simple application in a separate project.  It seems that the copying error is thrown each time the text area has larger height than the total text width and you try to select with with your cursor, starting from the bottom. I don't think you need any specific data set to reproduce this, just make sure it's multiline. 
I'm not quite sure but believe that I checked that, too. Think it was the same error message.  I found a workaround by changing the .foreach part by:    Surprisingly this works fine for me!? Maybe this is useful for someone else...

@eivantsov I have downloaded the latest version. And i am running it Vagrant. 
Sure, be happy to open a PR. We're currently using version 1.7, working on upgrading.  After a node restarted, one of the shards failed to initialize with the error message I listed above. I'm guessing that a write was dropped on the replica at some earlier point, even though the overall operation reported success (if this is a known issue that is fixed in later versions, I'd be very interested to hear it). To fix this, we removed the shard files from the node reporting the wrong doc count and let it recover from the primary.  When checking doc counts with /_cat/shards, I noticed that the doc count didn't match up with the error message. Checked on the source code to see where the number was coming from and found the bug.

Hello, Ashraf! How are you? What i found about the android 10 not working error is that i think the latest ics-openvpn library code is not used in the app because if we use OpenVPN app , the root app. This error  is not there in that app. Can you guide me how to import the latest ics-openvpn library ...
It was happening without it enabled, just enabled it and it still happens. 
I already knew that; doesn't Item.getItemFromBlock(block) do the same thing?  Anyways, changing it from that to (new ItemStack(block)).getItem() (since you need the Item and not the ItemStack, right?) doesn't seem to help.    Is there any reason why calling ignoreNbtTags would cause it to work with the getNbt method, but not with using the + to craft?  I've tried debugging by creating an identical ItemStack to the one I'm having trouble with, and then calling getNbt on it, and it seems to be ignoring the correct NBT tags, while the in-game + feature seems to be having trouble.  Actually, now that I've checked, it doesn't seem to be working for items, either.  I've been looking through your code: is isIdentical in StackHelper supposed to use ItemStack.areItemStackTagsEqual?  Shouldn't it be filtered through getNbt? 
I have not tried that yet.
Yes, that's when I see it.

I do use CREATE_NOT_EXISTS. The problem is that om MySQL it works for everything else, except for specifically Indexes, so just switching to other mode is a bit of an overkill
thanks :-) I'll give feedback if it worked 
well yes and i tried create a new world or go to a server and it crashes too... trying to contact my friends to test it, maybe it's our modpack's fault. 
@mr-gosh did you test again? 
I just dont get why you would go with two flag. They are ultimately serving the same function and that flag will just create a tree-some of bugs after all. I think the effective why is to drop to only one flag.  
From the point of the gist, it doesn't matter. It's just simple java application based on lsp4j which starts as language server for yaml file types and send notification to the client on didSave event. It works fine, but sometimes initializing is going forever. It's also true for JSON language server. 
I can reproduce it on 2.9.1 with the same steps. I'm hosting it on my computer & RPi3.
I use android.support.v4.app.Fragment. I downgraded version to 1.1.1. I'll check 1.1.3 today.
Hi, and sorry for the late reply. What kind of test case do you need? I thought the provided link to a sample maven project, which actually displays the probleme and the described steps in my post should be enough for an test case or do you need something else  ? 
@skabashnyuk  Thanks for the reply.  I think the goal is the same as #7662. What I mean is that the goal is load balancing and availability of che-server container. Also, I would like to use multi-user authentication of KeyCloak.  I'm sorry, In combination with AWS, I have not used Kubernetes or OpenShift yet. At the moment, can I use OpenShift to realize load balancing and availability?  I confirmed that the multi-user function of Kubernetes has not yet been implemented from the following. #8745
@slinkydeveloper by latest do you mean 3.8.5? or 4.0.0-milestone4 ?  I think the latter will require some refactoring on our side as there's a few things that have changed.
I don't know. I'm only using Windows these days, so I haven't had the chance to see it elsewhere.
Adding quarkus-vertx works around the problem, yes.  I see there's a problem with the issue templates, the description gets so long that it's not easy to read all of it ;)
I can't right now, but tomorrow I will try. I still need to choose the `dev-SNAPSHOT` version, correct?

You mean in the app? Then I see a clone of the notifications I have in the NC web interface.
Thanks for your explanation, Raphael.  From my end, as a user, an activity A is started, if I accidentally selected another new activity B, the ``undo`` action should cancel B and return back to A. This makes sense because I am still want to stay in activity A.  The app currently does follow this common sense. Great!  But, if I started A and then terminated A (which means I finished A), and then I accidentally selected another new activity B when I actually planned to select activity C. I hope the ``undo`` action should cancel B but should not restart A. In other words, the app should show ``<No Activity>``. Because I already terminated A, and I do not want to restart A.  Undoing the full action (including the termination of the previous one, in this case A) will force me to terminate A again before I can start C (which is annoying). Also, restarting A affects the duration of A which I selected before.  Thus, I think this could be a bug or issue that should be resolved to improve user experience. Hope my explanation makes sense :) Thanks.  
Hi @omehegan,  I did a short look into the sources as well, that is why I mentioned the branch filtering config. I tried different filtering settings, from filtering by branchname, as well as regex and at least allow all. The NPE occured with every setting.

Hi @mattdyoung,  Gradle Plugin version is: 3.5.3  We are using Bugsnag in a library submodule
yeah, sorry. i did in my initial post but not upon re-editing it...  i should not post late at night.  it happens on the second search, every time. if i try another search after the second, it tries to dump about 400gigs. the game i was searching was south park: the fractured but whole.
I can't seem to reproduce it any more, but also IntelliJ seems to be remembering the SDK location now and I can't work out how to make it forget Previously it had serious issues remembering the SDK path - of course that might be an unrelated issue.  There are several `threadDumps-freeze` logs that seem to show bad stuff happening. I've attached them all here. [log.zip](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/files/1005781/log.zip)  There's a nice 180-line stack trace in there (yeay Java) that seems to suggest it is some deadlock deep inside the file browser dialog, I think when I click cancel.  Could be an IntelliJ issue. If I uninstall the Dart and Flutter plugins, and reinstall them will that reset their settings to a blank state? Might be worth a try if so. 
The app doesn't actually crash. it just gets closed. so it produces no error on react native debugger console. but here's the error shown on my app analytics: Bad notification posted from package com.app:   From what i could gather this error is related to the images displayed in the notification which are vector drawables 
No, I no longer have the execution. The error happened when the SPARQL CONSTRUCT to file list was executing. However, I assume the higher-level exception handling is the same for all components.

Sounds reasonable if you could do it today. 
When based on basic boilerplate, `npm run build` will create folder `build/SampleApp/static/js` where all the scripts are. In index.html, they are referenced as `<script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/vendor.bundle.js">`  My need is to have generated index reference scripts with absolute path and slash at the start, `<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/vendor.bundle.js">`  Added union.config.js (version 0.2.1)  and expected to generate paths with slash at the end. Its due to trimSlashes here https://github.com/lundegaard/react-union/blob/master/packages/react-union-scripts/scripts/lib/utils.js#L68 or here https://github.com/lundegaard/react-union/blob/master/packages/react-union-scripts/scripts/webpack.config.js#L134 EDIT:   Changing `const sanitizedPublicPath = trimSlashes(publicPath);` to `	const sanitizedPublicPath = publicPath;` solved issue.  Is there any reason to prohibit public paths with leading slashes?

The first stack is obfuscated and the second is non-obfuscated. This issue definitely not occur if i don't apply proguard. And it seems only happened on OnePlus A0001(4.3) .  
@eivantsov what stack did you test? This is happening for us on the ubuntu base stack. Using the SSH into workspace option (i.e. on a custom port) it works just fine.
Yes I think we should gather this issue and #227 #145 #217 in a one issue.

Hi @karldahlgren,  I think I already attached them to the initial issue, but sure - I'm sending it to you once more. By the way don't you think it is better to leave the issue opened until it is fixed and confirmed to be fixed from the reporter and then close it - then we will avoid creating many issues linked to each other.  Regards, Milko [CreditSafe_WSDL_Local.zip](https://github.com/castlemock/castlemock/files/2476669/CreditSafe_WSDL_Local.zip) 
From some more testing it looks like this was caused by comparing itemstacks to null in https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/afe5114b83124c601714f40345023e59805d7b5e/common/buildcraft/lib/gui/ContainerBC_Neptune.java#L90. I have no idea how it worked in a dev before, so we might come across another related problem later.
Seems like it works for empty filters. 
Append all elements to a list, and add them as the "direct" elements of a single returned depset. In the toy example,   *size* (number of elements) of a depset is not an issue here, only depth.
I checked the same lang server with eclipse, but the problem is not there. Strange. But i will check the idea implementation and update this issue
I am on Luna, the last one (4.4.1). I am on windows 7 x64. Here please find installation details of my eclipse configuration :  ![screen_preesm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6907192/5300116/7c3be7b8-7bcd-11e4-9f10-eeb802295ae0.png) 
its clear. i solve that... thanks for reply... 
Tested on SV 107, confirmed fixed. 
Sorry, my mac was about to reboot itself so was trying to get the issue done as quickly as possible. So...  This is an ionic project, on android, and basically if I load the app for the first time and close it immediately, what I assume is happening is it tries to download as many assets (in this case js files) as it can before I close the app. When I close it quickly, I'm assuming that it's not getting them all. Next time I load the app up, I get stack trace errors in chrome://inspect basically about how it could _not_ load angular because it doesn't have those script files (they don't appear in the sources tab either).  So my guess is I just haven't given it time to get all the files. When I leave the app open, about 30 seconds to a minute later it hits a breakpoint I set up in the function block where it gets events from the native side, saying it's downloaded all the files. Then it works fine on each new reload.   Does this sound like what you'd expect to happen? I figure if it knows when it has downloaded all the files, it should also know when it hasn't, and it shouldn't look for them in local storage until it knows they exist there?  Granted, I'm closing the app a lot quicker than a regular user would because I'm just testing out hot code push, which otherwise works great.

Tested both cards - correctly returned the creatures back from exile at the end step as intended now with the recent changes. 
Curious.  I'm starting it via this very boring marathon config:    I think I've fixed it purely by accident, however.  Some other docker-using jobs were failing to start following my upgrade to Mesos 0.23.0 / Marathon 0.10.0 - and I traced that down to mesos-slave now requiring `--docker=/usr/bin/docker` (previously the unqualified `--docker=docker` default worked just fine).  Fixing that (or perhaps the churn from rolling it out?) appears to have also made the above go away - but I confess I don't really understand why.  I'm going to close this as "unreproducible" for now - unless you want to morph it into a lower-priority bug to actually address the multiple SLF4J bindings.

No it does not. If you connect redstone to a repeater, the first redstone is 15. Now, connect a conduit to that redstone and you get 14 out the other side, then remove the redstone and replace it with a conduit, it should go up by one, but it does not.   Redstone sources set the level at the block next to them. Redstone only reduces by one when it is connected to other redstone, the first redstone connection to a redstone source mirrors the level of the source, then the second piece of redstone starts the reduction based on distance.   As the redstone conduits are now, it is literally impossible to get a level 15 signal out the other end, and this can mess with many redstone contraptions, even dialing devices for enhanced portals.  A single piece of redstone connecting a source and destination does not reduce the redstone level to 14, yet a single piece conduit will. 
Hi rsudev  Sorry, I didn't found the time to create a screenshot. Meantime the issue is fixed, most likely with a update of the HTC file manager.  Thanks anyway. 
As said before, it's not bothering me in any way, I just wanted to share it with you.

Thanks for testing. I can't reproduce the error for files on the internal storage. SD is still the same.  As a workaround copying the files back and forth works.   One weird behaviour though: I can't navigate to: Folders - root - storage - emulated - 0 and therefore I can't navigate to the files. Is there any other way to get to the internal storage?  My workaround was the "last added" playlist
Yeah, sorry I wasn't clear enough, the bug report is for version 3.0.8 ( with traces) just updated this morning.  What I meant was, the behavior looked the same ( straight crash when scanning but I didn't get the traces with logcat ) yesterday with 3.0.7. Thanks
I'm afraid I cannot since the code I'm working on is closed source. I did not try to reproduce the freeze within an example project.  I tried out a fresh IDEA 14.1.4 install and removed the settings folder in my user's home directory.  Still, the IDE freezes with the same error when I move my cursor to a method that doesn't exist yet and that I'm about to add.  When I disable the Lombok plugin -> no freezes 
I guess this might be the relevant part:   
It seems hard to reproduce... I'm trying.

Yes, PdTest does work on the device. Play back of the sine waves works and patch mic results in a distorted, high pitched sound. 
Hi @Flaurite, Sorry, there is an important detail I missed in original ticket description: commit happens in `done()` method. Thus my complaint in regard of `LocalizedTaskWrapper` is directed towards implementation of `done()` and `cancelled()` method with try-catch block: exception is caught and is shown in a non-user-friendly fashion in comparison to globally defined application exception handlers.
I used your core analyzer to look at the coredumps i gave you, and it looks like a jit thread is hanging or something. It's the largest cpu time user of any thread and grows between the two dumps.

Yes correct the timestamp that is being sent by the device contains the correct timestamp. Graylog extracts the timestamp then adds 7 hours to it. The timestamps being sent by my device are set to UTC. I live in PDT which is UTC -7 so I do not get alerts until 7 hours AFTER the fact, and they do not show up in my dashboard. I can find the message if I set the time to include messages that are at least 7 hours in the future though.  The only thing that makes sense to me is that Graylog is assuming that the messages are set to PDC timezone, I don't understand why though because the original messages do not contain anything that says PDC or UTC-7 or anything that could be misconstrued as PDC or PTC. What confuses me is that if Graylog assumes UTC if it cannot determine the timezone then why is it extracting as PDC when there is nothing in the original message that can be interpreted as PDC or PTC.  My original message shows a very typical example of what comes into Graylog and the screenshot has what is extracted. It definitely adds 7 hours to extracted timestamp.  Here is the exported extractor

I'm running on a cluster so I don't have it installed per se, I just have the unzipped mixcr.1.8.1.zip which contains the jar file. There are no other mixcr files in that directory.

I guess set it to 3.3 and see if it still compiles? - Peter  On Fri, Jan 1, 2016 at 5:39 AM, Barthelemy Dagenais < notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Thanks @lessthanoptimal https://github.com/lessthanoptimal , the > previous commit should fix the issue.

Happily, running a debug build of the code in master does not have this bug. But is that because it started afresh fetching data, because of the code changes, both, or either?  I went to Settings > The Blue Alliance (not The Blue Alliance Debug) > Storage > CLEAR DATA, then retried the steps to repro. --> No duplicate entries now.  How to verify the fix? 
I'll have time for the weekend and then I'll make a test package focusing on this case.
No. At the least using the 0.9.10 its behave the same way, just overlay buttons moving.
@laa I reran the scenario and there is not much else in the logs.  I then increased the disk cache size ` OGlobalConfiguration.DISK_CACHE_SIZE.setValue(16384) ` and  the issue went away. But the problem is that our application cannot be shipped with such a high value for cache.   I am attaching the full relevant logs ..  [orientlogs.log](https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/files/1908204/orientlogs.log) 
I have no issue with demo.nextcloud.com . I will check (again) the installation of my server. Thank's for your support.
Umm, I think I described the bug badly. I wasn't referring to the searching of numbers. Let's say I have a number saved, e.g. `*101#` which allows me to check my prepaid balance. I then search for it, e.g. `bal` and it shows result `Account Balance *101#` along with two icons, one for direct message and one for direct dial. I click the direct dial, and instead of dialling `*101#`, it instead dials `*101` without the trailing hash.  PS: I'm from South Africa, and yes I can compile from source here :) 
Simply take the examples, there is no form in a form. I've even tried it with b:form, but the error still is the same.  I want to have a form inside of multiple tabs, therefore, a h:form outside of the tabView is no solution.
I have not examined in detail what is happening when the state machine reaches the terminal state - I will do that.  Having said that, I don't immediately see why there should be a relationship between the state machine being stopped or started and its current state? I had intuitively viewed the different between start and stopped being whether events were being processed. Why link state to start/stop? Even if a state machine is force stopped because it is in a terminal state, surely I should still be able to ask the state machine what state it is in?  My use case is that I am modelling human-centric workflows as state machine instances. So you can view a state machine instance as represent a ticket. When a ticket is finally completed (e.g. approved or rejected or whatever that causes it to reach a terminal state) I need that to be persisted - I am using the state machine context as a way of view tickets in different states (i.e. new, in progress, complete). With the current behaviour, when looking at the state machine context in the persistent store it never reaches the terminal state and you cannot distinguish between state machine that are genuinely in a penultimate state from those that are actually in the terminal state.
I think so. IMO we should involve the "magic" only when "normal" method fails. Don't know if others agree @Artpej @jponge
Unfortunately not. How to create one? Are you able to reproduce the bug? 
Hi Alex,  That is what I thought too that the if-else should be reversed. When I said register, I mean install the service. Install is currently supported (0.90.9) only on Windows OOTB, and I was trying on a Windows 7 laptop (64-bit).

@ZacBlanco  - I'm running alluxio in master/worker mode in AWS EMR , started alluxio master in emr master node and worker in EMR core node.  'Return to Master' from worker webui its not working, looks like it's trying to open alluxio master webui with worker node hostname
You are right, sorry. It's the findbugs maven plugin. I'll annoy them instead.  Thanks for the prompt reply.

The stack traces are the same for both versions, exactly like the one I've posted above. The assertion error is obviously for `assertEquals(10, buffer1.position());`. I'm getting curious. This is my environment:  JDK 1.8.0_11  eclipse Luna TestNG 6.8.6.20141201_2240 (as eclipse plugin) and JMockit 1.9 & 1.10

I can conform it is working again. Tested with: GCZHQ1, GC1J7NV 
I'm using 4.1.1.   Again I'm sure the issue is my lack of experience configuring home assistant.   If I wanted to create a bridge element to turn on a group of lights as identified in home assistant how do I build this element.   In home assistant I can create the results by using the developer tools/ domain:home assistant/service: turn on/then the json info that maps to the group. Basically I want to know how to map the information I test in home assistant to the device I'm building in the bridge.   Again I know this is probably obvious to the more experienced but I'm about two weeks into this..   Thanks. 
Yes, I get the same behavior with RStudio 1.2.1280  
it appears to be random, sometimes you play whole day and it's fine, sometimes after several minutes.  Also, the message actually appears when bug manifests, not on load.

I'll try and build a small repro case. 
@dsn5ft Sorry, I still don't have steps to reproduce, but with more reports it seems that what happens is: Screen(fragment) is opened Snackbar is called (likely twice, v.shortly after the screen is opened, probably via `Snackbar.make(view, message, Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT).show()`) There was **no** device rotation in the meantime. Snackbar was called from main thread and activity was likely resumed , as it is was called from LiveData.observe.  That said I still did fail to reproduce it on any of my devices.
You guys are terrific for doing this. Thanks again.

`updateState` does not work, I saw that method and tried it already...  I will try your suggestion and tell you if it works. Thanks for the help 
Thanks Jeremy - I'm on 7.0 flat.  Very much appreciate the diligence in bug tending - refreshing!
Thanx @Orbiter I would do it ASAP.  
We have some more complex search implementations in which we build the query based on wether results can be found for parts of this query.  So something like  if (q.cloneQuery().field("field1").equal("value").count() > 0) q.field("field1").equal("value"); if (q.cloneQuery()...)  I am aware that its not a good design practice and working with proper aggregations would certainly allow us to achieve the same and more performant result, but I was wondering how the method is suppose to work instead. I am sure having a way of cloning a complex query to be used independantly can be of use in a lot of scenarios.  E.g. database consistency checks while unit testing.

I created sample. "https://github.com/kurofune/spring-boot-sample"  I tried 2 ways. 1. from Gradle    - I execute `gradlew bootRun`.    - I can change templates/index.html after accessing http://localhost:8080    - But in this way, I can not  proceed to next springboot devtool.  (ex.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32572784/cant-get-spring-boot-devtools-auto-restart-get-to-work-with-1-3m5-with-eclipse) 2. from Eclipse    - I import this project to Eclipse using `gradlew eclipse`.    - I execute `Run as Spring Boot App` from Eclipse.    - I can change templates/index.html before accessing http://localhost:8080.    - I can NOT change templates/index.html after accessing http://localhost:8080, and Eclipse said `The project was not built due to "Could not delete '/spring-boot-sample/bin/templates'.". Fix the problem, then try refreshing this project and building it since it may be inconsistent`.  Tell me if need more information. 
It's for a little demo I'm doing. It allows listing the instances of a given app on a local GUI. The workaround is to use `api/eureka/applications` and the filter per application name. It works.
Hi Mirko,  the intention might be right. But I cannot see any constructor code that is generated by the generator. Hence, as far as I can see, the generated code will be defect if a grammar is imported and a token resolver is reused (and which is not the default one).  Cheers!

yes, I have already build the libbridge.so, and put it into the bin directary
That seems to have fixed it. That also explains the lack of errors in my program output window.  Thanks. Now to recreate my workspace and projects.

Thank you for your response.  I usually suppress "clojure/rust/pascal/lambda" messages. I tried with "-l DEBUG".  If I add this parameter, return code is 0 but if I don't use, return code is 1. Please see attached output and sample script.  [output.txt](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/files/3649476/output.txt) [test.sh.txt](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/files/3649485/test.sh.txt)   
In latest (16.02.2012) available on market and I also tried latest nightly (21.03.2012) and had the same behaviour (not visible on stored list if it was stored on ealier version, as searching/storing opencaching.pl cache in latest nigthly seems to be broken..) 
Update: without MT on my setup it doesn't happen with MT on clean install it doesn't happen  I guess enable one mod at a time with MT and see what's causing this?
It's almost certainly a bug in the code which is directly using the Unsafe methods.

Good morning all, I there some progress on this issue? kindly help. Thanks
Do we download the whole files now? We should download the previews (or even thumbnails) that are conveniently generated by Mediawiki.

I think I found out, that the signature was different and I had deleted the assignment of the function return, that was, what the debugger doesn't like.  About error messages, there are a lot of zero pointer exceptions in the window - not written to a logfile - when started arranger via the command line.  Many thanks for your help. Rolf

If you add the following code from `BitmapFontLoader::getDependencies()` into `FreeTypeFontLoader::getDependencies()` it works again. However the font size don't work. 
It does not effect the expression itself, however, I cannot format the statement with indents myself. OS is MacOS High Sierra, Java is OpenJDK12, Dbeaver is 6.3.2 (latest).  Regards, Thomas

Hmm only way to reproduce is to break an annotator manually at a point where it will update entities in the database, like it happend with the >255 into string field here.  If our annotators all work, then this is no longer an issue. 
You can use tests/regression/java-rewrite-engine/list/test1. It's commented out but uncomment it and you'll have an example, although it doesn't print the stack trace unless you turn back on SMT solving. 
Version was the last up-to-date in PlayStore. (2014.11.04) 
I guess it's running in the background, but the icon never appears in the taskbar like it's supposed to.
No and no. I am sure this has to do with the weird bug that changes plot ownership to another player at random note at the time of post this version http://ci.forgeessentials.com/job/FE/1147/ 
I have no idea where it's lost but it was lost post 3.8. It's there in every commit up to the 3.8 tag. 
Just the following line is enough:

Yes I tried /train reroute & I'll see what I can do about a video although it's not something I've done before.
For example, if there is an 8FE/t solar Flux reborn solarpanel on the battery and the battery is full then only 8 FE/t will be output. Without an incoming energy source, 2000 will be output or what you specify in the configs.
we are currently using forge 10.13.4.1492 universal. After turning off android spawning we were able to play for several hours without incident, I transformed myself into an android and spent a good portion of that time as one without incident (although for some reason it wouldn't let me take the damage upgrade, but I was in creative at the time so it may have had something to do with that). I'll let you know if anything else comes up, and thank you for looking into this. 
Yeah. from 2.2.29 to 2.2.30 few days back.
Ok, to provide a little more perspective, I noticed that it's only the scenarios of two features that get proper naming, if I add a third feature to the mix, the third feature wont get properly named.  But let's address this step by step.  First my **pom.xml** looks like this:    Regards  **NOTE:** Edited out some data sensible for my customer 
Sry for the late answer  You wrote: _"It hangs and I get OutOfMemory!"_ That's something we experienced too .... We installed your plugin on our production bitbucket and tried it on a huge repository with a long history. As soon as we noticed that it runs very long - and our normal users cannot access to bitbucket anymore - we restarted the server to have it accessible again (so we did no experience the OutOfMemory as we restarted before). After this I wrote this report ...  Your proposed features are the same I thought about ...

> Yeah, shaders break a LOT of things. Does this happen in third-person or just first-person? Does it happen with other entities, or just the planes?  It happens with all entities as well as both third and first person. It may be a lighting issue (I could be wrong) but for every major lighting update that occurs seems to be the interval at which the vehicle flickers. I've decided to not use shaders and have switched to PR Luminance which is a basic lighting resource pack which uses optifine and doesn't affect the vehicles. It seems to only occur with lighting related to dedicated shader packs and not resource packs which have a similar mechanic.  Really nice mod btw! Flan's mod doesn't really like me so I had to do some digging to find an alternative. Came across this and I'm glad I did!
I found it only on Windows machines. Mac OS X do not showed it. I do not tested it on other OS'es yet.

> make it dirt simple to build  I'm definitely all for _dirt simple_. Installation and setup is a real thorn.  I'm sure the JSON API could be taught to encode the jar file, but I think I would rather have people download one jar file once, than to deliver it each time. 
Thanks @jameskleeh I had lack information, it's working when I put errorType to client annotation.  `@Client(value = "service", errorType = String.class)`
Background:  I have seen Spring Boot Applications, which are configured the same way at least in terms of Spring Logging, but behave completely different, because of dependencies in the classpath. Sometimes it is even third party libraries, which "break" the logging contract. I should be possible to debug these situations more easy.   In `org.springframework.boot.logging.LoggingApplicationListener` the only Logging Output is in case of Exceptions.    Something like -Dlogback.debug=true would be great

@xingfudeshi  i was solved it 。 when we use nacos and fescar ,we must config LAN IP mapping hostname. windwos host : C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc 
this issue happened with rv2-stable-9 i downgraded to rv2-stable-8 and it works  edit: i just tested this with only applied energistics and it does this on its own so i am sure its on the mods side and not some conflict 
Yes. I am testing some features of other plugins. Thank you very much.

Sorry, missed the post. Configs are default. Don't believe I made any changes to them. https://pastebin.com/ay2WJ2G5  Just as an aside, Thaumcraft is not installed but I am sure the mod detects that. 
Yes, it can work. But it seem that it just write one vcf to another vcf without any change. So does it mean maybe it is the problem of my pedigree-file?
AFAIK there's no specific feature in 0.9 that we need. I just wanted to use the latest if possible. I've already installed 0.8.0 instead.  We'll be upgrading to TC 9 fairly soon anyway.

I own a 6.0 device and the experience there is different.. This particular issue is rather exclusive to Android 4.2.2 jelly bean... I'll include that video now below this post..
Yea agreed - nothing should be valid _when executing_ which is why I assume it's tryin to kill some tools.  Specifically, this code is never referenced (so likely not used? I didn't fully unpack the protector) - so I'm assuming it's not used...  dexlib2 handles this fine since baksmali worked on it.  No access to IDA right now or dexdump.  This actually would be a cool detection use case for a protector or anti trick if APKiD or something detected register ranges outside the context of the function.
a.) I like it.  b.) I would think so. If we have one specific file that's already compressed and is known to fail through the processor, this would allow us to exclude it and still use "strict" processing for the remaining files (should part a be implemented) 
Just realized this is also happening in Firefox (tried version 19.0.2), so I guess it doesn't help to try your solution, right?  Any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance! 
I can provide a bit more detail now. I'm storing BaseDocuments that I can store without any issue using the arangodb-java-driver 3.1.0.  Using driver 4.1.0 documents that cotain strings with non-ASCII characters such as "·ÃÂ " consistently fail. I'm not getting an error message, but the documents don't get stored in the database. The _key I defined in the document does get reserved (so attempting to insertDocument with the same key will fail with error message)  Another document I'm not able to store consistently (possibly because of the slashes?) is as simple as  {   "article": {     "artist": "PREGARDIEN/RHEINISCHE KANTOREI/DAS",     "releaseDate": "1970-01-01",     "composer": "BACH",     "format": "CD",     "vat": "H",     "carriers": 1,     "label": "CAPRICCIO",     "title": "BACH  ST MATTHEW PASSION BWV244",     "barcode": [       "4006408600466"     ],     "conductor": "MAX, H."   },   "stock": {     "status": "RMV",     "lastUpdate": "2016-11-01 00:00"   } }  For the time being, I'll stick to driver 3.1.0 - please let me know if you need any more information. 
  This is an embedded HA database running a single instance (yeah, I know, kind of silly).  And no, the database can't be possibly shutting down since this is just a 1 per roughly 10-100K calls to the service that fails, and there are other succeeding calls to that very service after this exception.  By the way, can you address another question I have? Basically, if I obtained an iterator from `db.findNodes()` and closed the transaction, but then I open another one and try to iterate through that iterator, it fails. I suppose that's a normal behavior? What's the motivation behind it? If I'm not asking too much :) 
You were right, this is a duplicate of #1650  Session is not working properly. Sometimes it works other times not and I think I found the reason.

Enter with nick: md_5 and sessions work fine. Enter with nick: Xephi and sessions don't work.  md_5 it has lowercase only. Xephi has a capital letter. Session only seems to work well with nicks that are written in lowercase. AuthMe saves the nicknames in lowercase only, that is why the session never corresponds.

I'm undecided. Spring Social GitHub hasn't made it to GA yet so I'm inclined to say no. That said adding `@ConditionalOnClass(SocialConfigurerAdapter.class)` will fix it with very little downside. 
yes scan is carry on. But dose it skip some scans ?

Vanilla "evil" mobs just don't spawn in the world, even it's in difficulty 2 (normal) but they can spawn in twilight forest for example. Even in The End no enderman spawns. (the dragon have no problem)  Also, if you try to spawn a mob using a egg, the mob spawn and just disappear in a moment.  I know, it could seems I use Peaceful mode, but it's not right, I am 100% sure the server config is difficulty=2 and I never changed it.  Any ideas?

In order to ensure we're only keeping the latest (regardless of order received) we've gone with indexing using `external_gte`.  Our process simply ignores the VersionConflictException that gets returned when attempting to add an older version.  It has worked rather well for us.  Periodically, we'll need to delete data, for a variety of reasons.  These are one-off deletes, usually related to expiring license agreements and such, and are separate from any versioning scheme.  Historically we've just manually done a delete by query to handle these cases, which has served us well until recently. 
robfrank,  Linking items from the same class.  You need to edit filename in json and make your own for the inital data to be linked. The linking will fail once it hits a col2-item that does not exist in the initially loaded data. You need to edit/create your own json to load the classfile.

i'm still struggling for this problem. yes its really suspicious. Because windows 10 in Turkish is installed on my laptop. And Turkish has that character :) i really dont know how to find out default encoding. But on save as in Notepad first encoding option was ANSI. and notepad++ shows UTF-8 for generated file.  i tried now followings for maven-compiler-plugin. But there is still ı instead i :(   
Sadly, I'm a bit too swamped to work on this...
This command also hangs.  Yes actually I have couple of VeraCrypt partitions mounted and decrypted and an SMB share (currently not connected).
I am sorry, that's all I've got. Unfortunately I am not using this library anymore for a different reason. I think the only other detail I can give is that I have multiple fingerprints. But besides that I have nothing.

Looks fine on preview.flymine.org But, instead of 'Manage Filters' - it says '2 filters' - wonder what our curators will say to changes once they make video tutorials..hmm In any case, I plan to release 1.1 in production first. 
One module, consisting of around 60-classes; although, I think it was indexing all my haxelibs which are substantial.  Thanks for that metric - maybe I didn't wait long enough.  I gave it about 15-minutes, and it appeared as though IntelliJ was trying to produce a crash log.  It had a rather devastating impact on my IntelliJ instance as a whole - I had to blow away all preferences and caches so I'm a little apprehensive to try again immediately.    Perhaps this issue should be closed, and I'll try again; or, keep my eyes open for the next release of this plugin.  Thanks for the insight. 
as I have installed previously a palette, in the <TIBCO_HOME>\bw directory I have directories 6.3 and palettes. The code I removed set the prop.bw.version to 6.3;palettes. This makes the installer not to work when doing the unzip in the directory <TIBCO_HOME>\bw\6.3\maven\plugins\bw6-maven-plugin  To try, create a directory in TIBCO_HOME\bw and execute in installer if you don't want to install a plugin.
Hi, I have two android mini-tv boxes: one is CX-919 with 4.2.2 "stock" ROM, the other one is MK808 with 4.1. The problem happens on both devices with the same scenario, but with different symptoms: On CX-919 you see the crash above, while on MK808 I see strange rendering artifacts (like split screen and snow during playback). The scenario is always the same: use a multi-variant  HLS source (for example 0,1,2 - where 0 is the best-quality) and wait until a situation where ExoPlayer decided to switch from a lower-quality source to a higher one.  I've also added some printings in HlsChuckSource::getChunkOperation() and I noticed that in the given scenario the player simply "ignores" higher quality chunks, and crashes (on Acodec) while reaching to the last buffered chunk of the lower-quality sample. I'm starting to suspect that maybe the higher-quality sample isn't perfectly aligned with the lower one. For example: if the "lower" chunk contains video from 0 to 6000000us, then the "higher" one doesn't continue the video smoothly at 6000000us... I really want to understand how to smooth-transition between different variants is designed to work, so I will be able to try to dig-in deeper in to this...  Any thought on this?  Thanks.

Yes i did. Nothing changes. What seems to fix it: Reconnect all laser relays with the one on top of the item interface, individually. ![setup3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9303498/20866230/4bf1503e-ba28-11e6-9561-10bb23fc3a4d.jpg)  To nr. 2: Yes that is correct. I placed the item relay from the esd on the side. Now the esd recognises the right amount of inventory slots. (one chest less then before)
I've download from github via wget and manually on linux and windows and i always have the problem.

I would say something simple like this  
I was logged-in as an admin user. Can you point me towards instructions about providing a logcat archive?
I forgot to mention that I use the "-force" option when formatting the namenode. Formatting appears to work fine without the "-force" option, but fails when "-force" is added. 
Yeah, not able to load the content  editor without restarting dbeaver. The NPE above is the only thing I see when attempting to reopen.  (I've switched back to 4.3.0 as I haven't seen this on that version, we'll see what happens). Feel free to close if you think it's an eclipse issue. :)
No I do not have antivirus stuff installed, can reproduce the bug consistenly. Performance monitor only shows "System" proccess accessing the file.  I'm using Administrator user profile and I have Full Control rights to the file. I tried opening Full Control rights to all users for the file and the folder, and the only thing that did, surprisingly, is deny the deleting of the original .jar file.  I think Windows won't let you rename the file that is open at the moment, maybe you need to make a small batch or command file to cleanup and run it after updating? 
Latest update has no change. Still cannot create any commands when on a server.
Maybe :smile_cat:  
sorry those logs were collected from users and we are not able to get the images which cause the crash. And it seemed to be indroduced from fresco 1.0.0.
@GreatOrator Sorry about that, I was using 1.0.0.6 (core) and snpsht 3 of DE 
A feature which seems to have been added about a year ago allows for multiple devices to be open in the same test (not a parallel test) such as for sending SMS or calling each other. This feature is very helpful for our needs however when upgrading to qaf 2.1.13 the null pointer exception above occurs on the teardown as soon as it is done tearring down the first device driver  Below are the versions I am using: <qaf.version>2.1.13</qaf.version> <qafsupport.version>2.1.13</qafsupport.version> <quantum.version>1.14</quantum.version>
Based on what I think is the openjdk 7 implementation it seems there is an assignment going on no matter what unless you try to set accessible the constructor of Class (see L143 in http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/lang/reflect/AccessibleObject.java.html). Whether at runtime that assignment is meaningless if obj.override is equal to flag (true in our case) or not I don't know, but if it is, then what's the point of isAccessible() existing, or rather, less philosophically, why does this code have the isAccessible wrap? https://github.com/square/moshi/blob/ee75000c94d20b9b23a98b0d09940ae820635d99/moshi/src/main/java/com/squareup/moshi/Types.java#L230 I understand it could easily be because it's code written by different people, but I'm not confident enough with reflection to assume so.

I will be trying to get the logcat after the "force close". Actually i haven't seen it lately so maybe it is problem with my watch. I will be trying to get logcat If it happens again.

BasicDataSource's version is 2.0.1. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12583734/51374156-158c9300-1b3d-11e9-86ba-050016b3b854.png) during debug, I found that the following line throws exception: TableMetadata tableInfo = databaseMetadata.getTableMetadata( table.getName(), tableSchema, 						tableCatalog, table.isQuoted() ); one more infomation is that the connection seems closed during debug into that method. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12583734/51374833-263e0880-1b3f-11e9-8c91-04300cd93ea3.png)  and the table is a normal table, which don't not require sharding feature.

Hi gdt, hi cketti,  I'm trying to connect my **Samsung Galaxy S8 with the PC** and the Device will be shown as plugged (Linux CentOS 7) I've already installed the `android-tools` with `adb`, but when I type `adb devices `nothing will be shown:  I've already enabled inside K9-Mail | Einstellungen (settings) | Globale Einstellungen (global settings) | Fehlersuchvorgang (Error search ?!?) | Fehlersuchprotokoll (Error protocol ?!?) **TRUE**.  When I talk about "freeze" I mean, always if I use the Papierkorb leeren (empty trash) the **K9-Mail wait 5 to 10 sec. and then the program continue to work as expected**. No error message was shown.  This start first with the Android 9.0 (Pie) update, with the Android 8.0 (Oreo) everything was fast.  Thank you for your patience with me! Klaus.

I can't access my linux partition now, but here is the installer http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/ 
@homersimpsons yeah, this is exactly how I plan to implement it. Right now the app will only scroll down if you're at the very bottom message (but this doesn't always work). I plan to add a threshold to this, like 10 as you suggested, and add an indication that new messages were received if you're scrolled up too high  Any thoughts on scrolling down no matter what, if a message was sent instead of received? Or do you think they should both behave the same way?
I sadly don't have thermal expansion I'm using a pack called All The Mods Expert.
I was actually just looking at configuring slf4j/logback to output to StackDriver for now, and after submitting this issue and looking at what I needed to do to make this work for webflux, realised that it's not really doing what I need. That being said, I'd say it's still a valid issue.  I've followed the instructions here https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/setup/java for configuring the appender manually via a logback.xml configuration file and using this blog https://simonbasle.github.io/2018/02/contextual-logging-with-reactor-context-and-mdc/ as a basis for logging context-based information.  I've actually just disabled StackDriver Trace because I've ran into an issue with it being enabled in conjunction with pubsub. Not managed to figure out the cause of that issue yet but will create an issue if I get time to figure out whether it's my fault or a library bug.
Telegram official app. The most recent version (3.2.6). 
Works on firefox, issue just exists with chrome. 
Here comes the reproducer (sort of, not necessarily tomcat specific): https://gist.github.com/danielwegener/6fe53c3f4625c1761de4507a3dbefe2b Note that the underscores in filenames are directory separators.  When calling `GET http://localhost:8080/test.html` (served by tomcats DefaultServlet, important: call it without a cached version!) or `GET http://localhost:8080/resourcelike/sucks` you won't see any CSP response header.

> @timurt , what is root reason of problem ? What is missed ?  Saxon has different implementations to evaluate different types of query.  So `//CLASS_DEF | //METHOD_DEF` and `//CLASS_DEF | //CLASS_DEF//METHOD_DEF` are considered to be two different types of query and they are being evaluated differently.  First type is the simple binary query, second one is more complex and uses `VennExpression` class.  Inside `VennExpression` implementation there is call to [GlobalOrderComparer.compare](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/javadoc/net/sf/saxon/expr/sort/GlobalOrderComparer.html#compare-net.sf.saxon.om.Item-net.sf.saxon.om.Item-) method  From documentation:  > A Comparer used for comparing nodes in document order. This comparer is used when there is no guarantee that the nodes being compared come from the same document  Here is implementation of the method  As you see Saxon assumes that it is possible nodes to be from different trees and to verify it Saxon retrieves `TreeInfo` object from nodes. Nodes from one tree should have same `TreeInfo`. 
I'm simply using mvn command like this:  ` mvn test -Dhttp.proxyHost=URL -Dhttp.proxyPort=PORT -Dhttps.proxyHost=URL -Dhttps.proxyPort=PORT `
No, not the whole map, only the caches. 
@nigelcharman, no worries. Copied the "before" table to each example for now. I'll refactor once it's fixed and released.

As always I try to pinpoint the source of my problem as best as I can before posting in the correct place.  So yes I have already disable all plugins and have defaulted all settings.  > > Hopefully this issue wont go unseen for months like the issue I pointed out with the always respawning at map spawn. >  > I have never seen a bug report for this, I fixed it because I saw the bug in the code while updating. > (Just wanted to clear that up)  I don't mean to to argue but the bug that I was referring to that went on for a while is the one where your spawn point was not saved and you respawned at the map's default spawn point every time you died.  Not sure if this happened more than once but this bug dragged on for about 2 crows and a stable Canary build before it was fixed when I noticed it.  Here's where I requested to be fixed: http://forums.canarymod.net/?topic=3171.0  Which was fixed by commits:  Fixed bug regarding server crash when your bed is destroyed. (Somners) https://github.com/FallenMoonNetwork/CanaryMod/commit/93651f6f8270bcff442a4af51454a39c6aabc627  AND  Fix bed re-spawn issue, I hope. (WWOL) https://github.com/FallenMoonNetwork/CanaryMod/commit/49e48c81500585ac97b72be54cae8d9ed068ed22  ---  Anyway if you're talking about the current bug (respawn at death point) then let me know if that's the one you've already fixed so I can be quiet and we can dismiss this case.  Thanks. 
Ah – I use Firefox. Maybe try with that one? 
@christophd Yes you are right, that works. It is certainly not the most obvious solution though. If this is the intended solution, it should be at least documented somewhere (@TovaCohen can you elaborate if it is already documented, or add a mention of that in the documentation?). But this is a thing you don't really expect that you have to read documentation for, maybe a little mention in the UI where there is the "Provide a condition that you want to evaluate (for example, `${in.header.type} == 'note'` or `${in.body.title} contains 'Important'`)." Or in a perfect world if the datatype is a JSON schema there could be a note added or something. (cc @syndesisio/uxd )
Thanks for your feedback.  Since it does seem to be unclear whether the bug is due to Bootstrap's javascript, or the way it was wrapped in GWT, I simply extended the GWT class with my own and added "try/catch" blocks around the code calls that trigger errors:

Yes.   To fix this, there is two options: 1. make sure the type is not created if indexing fails 2. update the mapping on master even if indexing of doc failed  Option 1 is rather tricky to implement and I do not see why the type should not be created in the mapping so I'll make a pr for option 2 shortly. 
The DNS query does not leak the data to the feed server but it leaks the information that you access feedserver.com to your DNS server.  I will try to get logcat informations.
no, i just checked, same problem in google chrome... sucks... 
Privileges needs to be added to softdepend to fix this 
I see this from time to time. I don't know where it comes from.

I haven't reproduced it yet. I need to make a testbench for this.  I'm guessing that writing on the DataStore timed out (which doesn't mean the data hasn't been committed) and Collect retried sending the image, but we can't be 100% sure...
It is the complete stacktrace, as recorded by firebaseCrash analytics. Also, googling for the stacktrace shows other people who have similar stack trace[not related to this lib].  I had 100% crash rate using the steps that I outlined.  There may be two cases I can think of   you remove the bottomsheet after click, in the app code.  or your phone removes the activity a bit late [low spec device] or the bottomsheet is removed before the activity is destroyed[high spec device].

@sewe : WDYT?
Hi,  I'm using: - graylog-server-1.2.2-1  - log4j is log4j-1.2.14-18.2  I've read some articles about the GELF chunks and set some params but this didn't resolve the issue so I reversed it again. Find below the reversed changed params: For both graylog2 and the client I'd set the following tunables. net.core.wmem_max = 124928        --> 262144 net.core.rmem_max = 124928         --> 262144 net.core.wmem_default = 124928    --> 262144 net.core.rmem_default = 124928     --> 262144  In Graylog2 GUI GELF INPUT --> UDP input recv_buffer_size: 262144 
We already have the ability in the user interface to force the use of one interface so I don't think we need to worry about that. It would be cool if we supported multiple by default as long as they can restrict it to just one, which they can. Our competitors use all interfaces I think (I tested and confirmed Serviio) 
Seemingly so. I first tried a couple of times maybe a month or two ago (on the same machine) and got the failures each time and left it. Removed the directory and recloned to try again yesterday, ran it probably 4-5 times (with a successful build without running tests in-between) and got those failures each time (one time I got the organise imports failure as well that I saw there's already an issue for). It seems to work fine after I build without running the tests, using it with vim and vim-lsc.
I captured stack trace by `jstack` and compared JDK 8 and JDK 11. The difference between them was the existence of two `Http2Connection`s waiting for something.   JDK 1.8.0_172   
Sure! Where can I send it? 
IIRC dovecot. I use [posteo.de](poseo.de).
Thanks @farodin91 I try to build Janusgraph on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS which is hosted on an Azure VM. Maven 3.6.0 and OpenJDK 1.8.0_191 were used. I don't have docker installed on that machine.
I think this problem appears because I am using M&B: Battlegear 2,  in which melee weapons can't block completely 
This is probably because in my serialization code I am using UTF_8_SHORT in case the string length is <=15.  To be precise, the error is inside the method writeUtf8(String value). So the workaround is to *not* use UTF_8_SHORT if the string is empty. There needs to be special handling for a length of 0 in writeUtf8.
@serge-rider well, it's starting just fine if i change the workspace (or the data_path). My issue is : how to migrate settings from my previous workspace? and also, even if I start on a fresh workspace or data_path, it seems to get corrupted anyway (I haven't tried since last time, it's really annoying to add manually the connections and see they all got lots with no way to retrieve them)  how can I export/import these settings so I can easily add a couple of connections, save them somewhere in case my workspace get corrupted again?
Yes I think that is the problem I have had
I using gradle 4.4, and I just upgrade to gradle plugin 3.1.2 today from 3.1.1. It's failing when I execute `./gradlew :myModule:assembleRelease` from the command line.
Hi Phil, I pushed sample app here: https://github.com/pmihalcin/liquibase-sample
Sorry, it's my problem. thanks. 
Yes, I use (how in my other issues) MySQL5.1 with InnoDB. I think, the problem occurs, if the same artifact is deployed mutliple times. The aspects than have some problems with generating metainformations. Do you think, the migration to postgres is the general solution for my problems? I want to use your awesome repository for productive purposes and run into so tricky problems... 
v2.1.0-151 I grabbed it yesterday and started testing.

Unfortunately stack trace seems to be not logged by jenkins-control-plugin - it just displays error message in red "balloon". It seems to be when parsing xml from Jenkins (but I don't know which, the main one looks "normal" for me). The same problem occurred in an alternative hudson monitor - and I attach stack trace from it.   
Lag happens on both MP when the server is not on the mac and SP.  Happens whenever I am near a stargate - gets really bad if i look at the gate close up.  Once Im 50+ blocks away its fine.

Yes I have done all that.  I tried all the locking track modes as well. 
If my app target API 24, the gradle prevents my ap from compiling successfully, but, if I just compile it using API 23, the compilation is successful 
We used to paint the coastline with separate rules for `closed` or not and a fixed width for all zoom levels, which didn't look very good.  Now appearance is more clear, but some may still like to have coastline in the maps. That's why I didn't remove it from `tag-mapping`, to let them paint it if they want.  The land polygons, if they are split, cannot be used easily for that without artifacts. 
I am using hikaricp these properties are supported but they are not in datasourceproperties so i dont see how they can be passed to the datasource 
I need to block all sites except the checked, but for an example it is better.
It seems that it does work now, the script keeps connected to the correct event without issuing any crashes.  However, I found a similar issue with renaming a condition. After renaming a condition, a script using the condition inside an inline event will now reference to a complete different condition. I would suggest to use IDs to link conditions to scripts if possible, this may can prevent problems with renaming.
i have send the pull request #2260
Very possible. If your headset doesn't actively check to see which of the active streams are actually playing stuff and instead just takes the first available stream, it would likely lock itself into NewPipe's dead stream until you tell it to change.
Cool, I will give it a go. Thanks. 
Well unfortunately the above code did solve the problem only for a while:  I made a libgdx project repository for testing which shows the errors:  https://bitbucket.org/TomGrill/itest  Each time you touch the screen it toggles between load/show interstitial. So always wait for "interstitial received" message in log before showing.  You can switch between CRASHMODES :)   Edit: IOSInterstitial.java to reproduce the errors.  There are 3 modes you can use: Explanation:  0: Will crash the app immediately when you touch the screen the first time to load an interstitial. Crash error: Terminated due to signal 6  1: Will crash the app the 2nd time you load an interstitial. Crash error: Terminated due to signal 11  2: Loading and showing new interstitials works ... somehow: Works for quite a while but then randomly crashes after ~8 minutes. (May take even longer) Repeat: Load and show 3-5 interstitials. Dismiss the last interstitial and leave the phone without touching for like ~8 minutes. Crash error: Terminated due to signal 11  Tell me if you still need the symbolicated crash logs. I hope I manage to get them, seems kinda difficult to do that :) 
@erick03 If you mean a solution for being able to update `compileSdkVersion` to `23`, we need to create and register a new notification instead of calling `Notification.setLatestEventInfo()`.  From my conversation [here](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=73720#c5) with Google on the best practice for updating notifications:  **Me:**  > To clarify the above, for people fixing old code - the current official best practice for Notifications is _NOT_ to hold a reference and update them with new information, correct?  Instead, to show new info to the user, you should always cancel the existing notification and build a new Notification via Notification.Builder? >  > The app I was working on had periodic notifications delivered to the user, and it used persisted notification IDs along with setLatestEventInfo() to update the information shown to the user within the same Notification.  Based on my understanding of the above, the proper behavior would be to cancel and re-create the Notification using the Builder.  **Google:**  > There is no need to cancel. Simply notify again with the same id and tag and the existing notification will be updated.  The actual notification object is parceled when it is sent to the service, so it's not important to hold a reference to the local Notification object. >  > See packages/experimental/NotificationShowcase and look at the upload notification for an example.  So the solution is to implement the above, and test to make sure reminders still work correctly.  It's on my TODO list, but I've been trying to focus on getting the UI redesign to the point of release.  PR's accepted! :) 
im fine with protocol lib even my anti cheat uses protocol lib EVEN NOCHEATPLUS uses protocol lib so yeah 50% or more servers uses protocol lib XD 
Sure, I provided one by mail :+1: 
Well, the far lands were removed in Beta 1.8. However, there is a game engine limitation of X/Z: ±30,000,000, which we are breaking if chunks past that point are requested. 
Sure. Here it is: http://prntscr.com/engi7o
The test you wrote matches my scenario correctly. I was using Beta 4, I think. I guess this was resolved in a newer version. Sorry for the trouble then lol

Nope. If you looked this up in your log - I'm currently in heavy development, so the server restarts are very often.
This works fine on my windows 10 development work station.  It fails, however on the linux production environment machine.    I could send the created database to you if that would help you understand what's going on. 
Workaround for turning off root mode: 1. As root, edit `/data/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/shared_prefs/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid_preferences.xml`, setting `use_root` to `false`. 2. Change owner for all touched files from `root` to the respective user, for example, `chown u0_a143:u0_a143 /data/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/files/* /data/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/files/index-v0.11.0.db/*` 3. Force restart Syncthing, maybe multiple times.  Unfortunately folders seem to has been reset either by this or because of some previous upgrade and device ID reset to one like `AAAAAAAAAAA-AAAA-A`, but this may be unrelated.  So maybe just using "Clear data" may be more approripate. 
The function is our performance. Making for almost each http request additional http request that sometimes (not sure is it always or not ) make query to database   - is unacceptable solution. 
Thanks for the feedback, @sjka. Yes, I can make the change. It will be my first ESH change... :-)  Do you know...  Do I need to install the ESH IDE to make the change, or can I use the OH IDE that I already have installed? I already have a signed ECA. 
awesome!
We're on version 3.0.5c of boilerplate and B3.5c of Steamcraft. The error doesn't show up in single player (this is indeed on a server). Going through any other portal doesn't cause this error EXCEPT with the portal to inner earth (from the steamcraft mod), which got me the error and then I think killed the server when I logged back in...  
@eivantsov do you mean like http vs. https?  I did figure out what the problem was with websockets as well as a related problem with Keycloak not recognizing https. It turns out that ELB Layer 7 cannot do websockets. However, if you start using ELB Layer 4, then Nginx Ingress cannot send all the needed http headers to Keycloak, specifically x-forwarded-proto, which makes Keycloak mix http/https. So either path with ELB will break Eclipse Che/Keycloak. So I switched out ELB with ALB (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller), and it seems much better so far. The ALB goes directly to Keycloak and Che, but also on path (/server*) to the nginx-ingress-controller so Che can keep adding in ingress rules.  WSS is still a little bit flakey, but I am able to connect now.  So Keycloak seems rock solid now, and the Eclipse Che UI seems great as well, but I am still not able to create containers. Actually, I did not even get to the stage of the command being issued to Kubernetes. It seems to get stuck on not being able to create ingress rules now. From the Eclipse Che catalina.out:   
thanks @rampatra i've added it to my code....will run it for a few days and update this issue

Ok i will try tomorrow. 
That is weird. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 running Fluxbox. The file in question was one with Chinese characters mixed with Latin containing ? . The Chinese equivalent of ? Worked fine.  I'll try to find the exact filename and I'll post it here once I find it.
Nodes should be self-contained.  Lustre does not have a concept of "global" variables.  In this case, the node foo() refers to a variable outside of its scope.  When we translate into jkind, this triggers an error because the node foo() is translated as a separate node from the "main" node that contains the definitions for system A and system implementation A.impl. 
Checking screen state is useful to exclude other logs that look like gameplay logs. By only logging during a game we don't get confusing messages displayed.   For example, immediately before a casual or ranked match you'll get logs like this:    These look the same as logs that occur during the game, so in my first version these messages were displayed as if each player had played their hero power when the game started... which wasn't true. The messages just indicate Hearthstone setting up the game. I stopped those misleading messages by checking the game state: when [LoadingScreen] identifies that the mode is TOURNAMENT the messages are ignored; once the mode changes to GAMEPLAY the logging starts. Is that going to be a problem when using RxScala?

Here is a specific line 72 trip:    Start:  82nd & Alder   End:  82nd & Holgate   Time:  I did it at 9:04 PM most recently, but as in screenshot above, happened with trip earlier in      day as well    All other parameters are at their defaults (which is 0.5 walking for us)  The original plan was same as above, except depart at 1:46 PM on 1/9/14.  I also used other start places (ex: Greeley & Humboldt) and end places (ex: 82nd & Crystal Springs) and found that they all showed the start of the trip at the beginning of the route in the trip viewer.  I tried out the other item I thought might be related, and it was still happening. See screenshot for trip details.  Also in the screenshot is the Trip Viewer - note that it is displaying the incorrect direction (and for what it is worth, shows Foster & 88th as the start point for the trip).  ![croppercapture 4](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4853348/2048149/b073e06e-8a3b-11e3-9cb3-23a176c522c4.png)  [The caller wanted to know if they were getting off at the first stop after the Hawthorne Bridge, so the agent opened the trip viewer to confirm that -- and found this instead.  The original trip was planned on 1/22/14] 
That's correct "double click in the task name cell clears task name".  
I haven't gotten this error with MapDB.  Doing some investigation, having removed all the records from MongoDB_(crawler) data base and deleted previously the `work` folder where the `progress\latest\status\MongoDB_32__40_crawler_41___MongoDB_32__40_crawler_41_.job` file will be created:  a) I run the crawler with:    I got the result: reference(s) processed: 94 DOCUMENT_COMMITTED_ADD: 50 Read timed out: 37 REJECTED_CANONICAL: 7 Documents in MongoDB: 94  So it only seems to fail with the first URL. Finally I have deleted the MongoDB_(crawler) data base and run the crawler with:  <url>http://www.federacionpiraguismodeextremadura.com</url>  but still get the status file error. Don't know what the problem is with this URL. 
I'm on the same line. I'd rather keep the tab and add a prompt/button to add data.

no.. the plugin have a bug test in ur server
This is what I see in Protege 5.5, on a different class (I have only access to an older version of SNOMED-CT, which does not have the class you show in your screen shot)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2441046/58206156-08231900-7c95-11e9-92a7-7bce9662742b.png)  This looks good to me.  @rwynne can you confirm that this is still an issue in Protege 5.5?
@concavelenz  Yes, I can provide a reproducible case, but don't know how to attach it to this issue (a 12K ZIP file with a 137K JS and a small build script).  But I added the --dev_mode=EVERY_PASS option to the compiler's command line, don't know if this helps:   
nope. I use now version 2.0 and its work 3.0 doesnt work 
Corrupted library is unlikely to be the cause, as I got the same result from the app built on 3 different computers. I’ll wipe gradle cache and retest. Just to double check - did you run your app with `-Duser.language=tr` ?
I did it 3 times in a row ... so, every time.

Yes, I'm using those versions. 
Yes, it is there. 
I agree using duplicate column names is bad practice but forcing clients to select every column to avoid including two (or more) `_id` is a bit annoying :cry:   How would you feel about keeping `:1 etc`?  Or would it be possible to append the table name instead? `_id_table1` `_id_table2`  
Event scale samples were built on `0.5.0-2252.c180711-SNAPSHOT` as it was giving build failure with `0.5.0-2260.b477eec-SNAPSHOT` while creating fat jar.  
> And all uploaded maps are checked for zip bombs anyway  If the server-side check is the same one, how would one upload a map like the aforementioned `crazyrush`?
No and I think because maybe nothing is dropped into the world (that I can see), the xp goes straight into your bar.
There is now log when connect to db  still no stacktrace.  Yes, I run it in console, plocal.
Updated post with extra info, also this happened under 10 minutes of being logged in at an area with nobody talking for majority of time.

No, it's not a blocker, but this is preventing us from seeing the real cause of the exception. My question is, why rethrowing a generic ZKException if the real error cause is available?
 Forge 13.20.0.2300 Optifine B9 Single player Confirmed occurring in: Electric Arc Furnace Lathe Crystallizer Cutting machine Rolling Machine Precision Assembler  I can not confirm more, since I have not been able to go any further
Ahh thank you for ino tterrag1098  As for forge 6210classick I use MultiMC that can download any Forge version needed. If need to get it manually then they are located here http://files.minecraftforge.net/minecraftforge/1.7.10 
Found it, simple cause: if the map difficulty name is empty string, then it didn't create a new list because the if condition checked against an empty string. So whenever you select a map with no difficulty name, it would throw a null pointer. I made some maps to test the slider things I did, and didn't bother giving it names so I had such maps in the list. (I didn't realise version meant difficulty.)
So i have ran this file as admin in javaw.exe and i see that it only made a file called recaf-1.15.1-patched.jar. But it is empty
You can't reproduce because I derp'ed and left out the fact that'd changed betterstorage.cfg. I want to disable all of the cardboard related items except the cardboardSheet so I set:  item {     B:cardboardAxe=false     B:cardboardBoots=false     B:cardboardChestplate=false     B:cardboardHelmet=false     B:cardboardHoe=false     B:cardboardLeggings=false     B:cardboardPickaxe=false     B:cardboardSheet=true     B:cardboardShovel=false     B:cardboardSword=false     B:drinkingHelmet=true     B:key=true     B:keyring=true     B:lock=true     B:masterKey=true     B:slimeBucket=true }  When I set them back to the defaults of true the issue goes away. Sorry about leaving out that detail. :( 
LetHopeItsSnowing and HTTP500 - I wasn't quite sure who to contact 
Nope :/ 
Thank you for your quick reply, and I apologize for my late one. I have a world which demonstrates the problem. I have the Resonant Rise 3 modpack, but I am running the latest Refined Relocation version (1.1.28)and have only used Iron chests, with RR and vanilla items.  Steps I've performed in this world:  - Place 5 sorting iron chests in a row. - Set the rightmost chest to whitelist All Ingots - Set the chest second from the left to blacklist all ingots.  Tests: Action performed: Place stacks of ingots in the leftmost chest. Expected effect: Ingots move to the rightmost chest. Observed effect: Ingots remain in the leftmost chest.  Action performed: Place stacks of ingots in the second chest (The one with ingots blacklisted) Expected effect: Ingots move to the rightmost chest. Observed effect: Ingots move to the leftmost chest.  World file is here: [NewWorld.zip](https://github.com/Dynious/RefinedRelocation/files/214357/NewWorld.zip) 
When I use `allowStyling()`, the background-image property gets stripped out in the following simple test.    I don't see a way to enable the background-image to get through. 
Yup, it seems to work. So the code should be changed to the one you gave, yes? 
Hi @palbr, If you look at the id column, you can see that the sorting is broken.
@marcphilipp I forked the sample project and added the classes there, it still shows the same behaviour for me. It's located here https://github.com/LiamClark/junit5-samples
I've installed yesterday 1.157.0  PyCharm 2019.2.5 (Professional Edition) Build #PY-192.7142.56, built on November 19, 2019  
I had issues when connecting item importers/exporters to the powered furnace and the crushers. I also had issues when transferring energy into the same machines. Essentially, nothing would transfer. I'm currently at work but later tonight I can get some screenshots of the setup if necessary. 
mycontroller is running on my raspberry and I browse from my main computer running chrome.  The adblocker I use is "uBlocks origin" (chrome)  The /metrics/metrics gets blocked by an adblock list named:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3453121/17456350/258e6a00-5bd5-11e6-8388-de90f422588a.png)  No big dealas the only thing I had to do was to whitelist my raspberry .. but I remember some1 else having a problem with "widgets loading forever" .. maybe he hat the same addon? (Issue was posted on the forums) 
Indeed. I installed .NET 3.5 and it works now, thank you. It will be difficult to have a multiplatform software now :(  I saw that any others free softwares test if JAVA or .NET are installed and if not, download and install them. It would be interesting to add this feature in the installer.

I can confirm that the latest Early Access build (01-Jul-2019 17:26) did not resolve the issue.   Looking at the 2 modules files.  The one included in the Early Access package has a size of 23,608 KB The one included in the OpenJDK11U-jre_x64...11.0.3_7 has a size of 91,049 KB Interestingly to me, I do not find a modules file in my Oracle Java installation so it must be specific to the OpenJDK software.  ![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33190780/60456084-ec991f80-9bfd-11e9-970c-f3122c41b90c.PNG) 
@FroMage Just the modules that the typechecker already knows about. Of course that list is very incomplete. 
Unfortunately no stacktrace is logged: >   [userguide-book-2.4.3.txt](https://github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot/files/771272/userguide-book-2.4.3.txt) 
aye, ignoring amount would be a good step when the other parts (here address) are preserver.  simple reproduction of that error with an qr code (intentionally one decimal too much after delimiter):      qrencode -t utf8 "bitcoin:1vvo1f7xSnZLAxwqATYvSpCCLMjNXcdNE?amount=0.123456789"  results in error message      unknown format

I'm using Google Refine version 2.5 (on a Mac). The problem happens  immediately after project creation.  Perhaps this issue has already been corrected in later versions of Open  Refine ?

@azatsarynnyy that would be awesome. parametrized task is ok for now, I guess
I'll send you the modpack, if I can get it from the host lol.
I cannot pause my phone playing after using librespot-java, even if I kill the app as soon as it loads it starts playing again. The only way to fix it is to connect to another spotify connect server, like the web player. When ever I press pause whilst playing on phone, a LOT of information scrolls up the console window from librespot. I don't think it matters whether the music is playing or not when you switch back to phone. I built from source today and the problem is the same. I'm using an android phone and running librespot on Windows 10. 
Yeah, it is working fine in 4.3.83  Thank you and congratulations for this awesome plugin :-) 
@KasparRosin exactly what @Hydrox6 said. it has it's own highlight box (idk what you call it)  Thought it might just be a simple fix so I reported it. It's not a big deal at all really
Thanks for the tips, I will try to see if it works.  Maybe you could try to use [android:imeOptions](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:imeOptions) and listen when the user press on that key on the keyboard? (maybe `actionDone`, or let the developer choose its own). 
The nexus where we are using cloud storage API runs in GCP kubernetes engine in the same region where the bucket is (EUROPE-WEST1), so I think internet connection shouldn't be an issue.  Usually it is stable, but sometimes (5%) it fails with this error and it is constantly failing for a couple of minutes and after that it works again.

@TWiStErRob I followed your suggestion that writing `Glide.with(this)` in my `Application`. It seems that the problem is solved but I need more tests to ensure that. However, the `context` in `Glide.with(context)` is `CustomRemoteViewsService.this.getApplicationContext()`. I've tried to cast `context` to an `Application` object and logged it, the result shows that it is. So this is very strange for Glide.

Turns out that declaring the fields as nullables is not enough, they have to have a mandatory default value (for nullable fields should be null). I'm attaching a small example.

Hi Michael below are the version detail of different components .   
- test using any file set as "available offline" - have no internet access (eg, turn on airplane mode) - click on file to open it  You will now wait ~ 65 seconds, with "Fetching most recent version of the file." on your screen.  There is even a further maddening delay of 5 seconds or so, where a "using old version of file" is shown at the bottom of screen.  After this all passes, you will be able to view the old version of the file.  Understand that, for example, you may often need to look through many documents quickly.  I was at the airport, and had to search through 8 documents to find an obscure number I needed.  Timeout in such a case should be much, much, much less.  Say -- a few seconds at most?  Alternatively, a way to just view a cached file should be available.  EG, long click/hold menu?  Even better for it to realise that you'll never get a file, when the phone has no network connection.  And most maddening of all.. I was (as mentioned) looking for something at the airport.. so, if you close the file and re-open?  Same behaviour.  
well, the "mode con" command output followings:    it's caused by the OS language i am using? it's Chinese character encoding: GBK. 
I haven't tried any other versions nor operating systems. I'll try the previous versions of the SDK, though I'm unable to test on Windows or Linux. If someone is able to try either OS, I'll push this code to [my fork of the repo](https://github.com/kkirigaya/Java-DiscordRPC) for someone to test on.
Yeah for sure. I have connected
No, it wont allow the tool part ot be replaced giving the standard warning saying the modifier cannot be combined with Luck etc etc
Looks much better. Please close this issue. One remark, I think the whitespace between sashes is too big (similar to the  default styling). Please take this a personal feedback, I understand that this is a question of personal taste.  
I was using v0.17.0  when error happened 3 days ago. Then I updated to v0.17.2 and very soon v.0.17.3 was released.  So far - I am still having that error in v0.17.3 Linage9
I have tried it with blank, Java, Java-Mysql, C++ and custom stacks. I did not change the default settings for the blank, Java, Java-Mysql, C++ stacks and I have allocated 4 gigs for the custom stack which bases on codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8 image with some minor changes.

@IanChilds It isn't worked,and i coundn't found any exception in logcat. 
Yup, verified fixed. Haven't pinpointed the change that did it, but good enough for me.
I've updated the sample project to use OpenPDF 1.3.1.  At some time I should have a try and debug the issue, but I'm not very familiar with image processing (and also with PDFs), so someone with more experience might be more efficient.
Yes I need only property.  I tried updating che.env for adding one custom property but still I was not able to inject that property in ws agent code. May be I did something wrong. Can you describe how to achieve this?

If tommy cannot find the story I will create it.   It's not that the error message is unclear to me, but combined with issue #6809 it is really annoying to make nillable expressions for this questionnaire, because each time I mess up the expressions I have to drop my complete database.

@GitMensch  > Could this be a good time to re-raise the issue about automated testing?  Yes, but I'm starting to doubt it would help in this case: I had just accidently set the export option "No conversion of the instruction/expression contents". If this option is disabled, the export looks pretty fine. The good question, however, is whether the extraction of the type definition and variable declarations should happen in the "no conversion" mode. This isn't specified exactly. And the real difficulty is to define all consequences of this mode in a consistent and sensible way for all target languages. And yes - to write the test cases forces to specify the intended functionality.
Hi Pavel, It's a false alarm. My apologies. Thanks for the quick response. 
I just realized in the screenshot that Erk's range for Physic is wrong. (_EDIT: But how can that be, this is from Duffle's broadcast, so wouldn't Duffle if he was using v1.4.0 see the correct range even if the opponent had the wrong version? Now I'm REALLY confused._) That clue leads me to believe that NeoFire99 was using v1.3 still (_gotta get cracking on #61 , my friend_) while Sarah was using v1.4.0 unless there's a regression in v1.4.0 (_which I'll be checking tonight_).  ~~Sarah doesn't have any error logs according to her but I'll double check.~~ I don't know the other player, and thus have no means of contacting them to harvest logs, someone else from the sub invited 'em via advertising on /r/fireemblem  We'll have to make due with what we have, I'm afraid. 
Yeah here's the stack trace:   
I would just go with giving all the test helper classes versioned names. It keeps things straightforward.

Yes, I can join any server, build, talk, etc. When I relog, however, I instantly crash before I can join back on the server. I can relaunch minecraft and forge to join again, but once I get back on, no blocks were registered.  I tried it again and the same result happened.

Yes, I mean 'Full application restart'. Sometimes I need to click many times. But sometimes just two clicks with like half a second in between hits this. I seem to hit it more often when using a physical Android device than when using the iOS simulator.  After that the only remedy is to restart IJ, so pretty severe. 
That seems to have partially fixed the problem. Now when I run `ClearScreenDemo`, `ColoredRotatingQuadDemo`, `ColoredTriangleDemo`, or `TriangleDemo`, a black-filled window titled "GLFW Vulkan Demo" appears with no error. I can move the window around on the screen and close it without issue. When I resize the window, the black fill is replaced by the appropriate figure (nothing, colored rotating quad, colored triangle, or blue triangle, respectively) on a light blue background. I am able to expand the window as much as I want. However, when I make the window _smaller_ in any dimension, I get this error:

Sure. Here is the link of video i am facing problem http://tinypic.com/player.php?v=289wjo7%3E&s=8#.VGLjdMluVlM Issues with this video when dragged left and right on minimized state are : 1. On dragging right halfway, it is going left and vica versa.  2. And when video is dragged out(via left or right), it comes back again in minimized state(on right side)  sometimes. 3. Fading effect(alpha)  while going left and right fades video completely as soon as we drag. Fading should be such that video keep on playing and should fade lightly then completely at corner. And lastly one minor issue is dragging horizontally was not that smooth . Vertically it was very very smooth. 
It has been fixed, thanks.
Spring Boot :: 2.1.7.RELEASE Spring Cloud : 2.1.1.RELEASE
We actually had this come up during some routine maintenance at HubSpot. It actually raises another issue, which I'm not sure how to file. We were swapping a master (with the intent to sustain no downtime). The redis docs recommend setting the replacement as a slave to the old master, making it writeable, directing all traffic to the slave, and then once the old master is not serving any traffic, promoting the slave to master. At this time, we found out that: 1. When you [SLAVEOF](http://redis.io/commands/SLAVEOF), the hostname is just a fully qualified domain name, so something like `mountain-top.subdomain1.subdomain2` is just as valid as an IP address. While the master stores slaves as IP addresses, the slaves stores the master as-is. This means the topology provider will hit the slave, fail to parse, and die.  2. In order to do a master swap with no downtime, you must write to a slave with read-only disabled. Lettuce _does not_ support this at all, at present. I think it probably needs a write routing option (with either `MASTER` or `WRITE_ENABLED_SLAVE_PREFERRED`). The former makes sense when swaps may incur downtime, but the latter is required for downtime-free swaps. 
1.1.0 but it was the agora I could already solve I did the update to 1.4 then to 1.7 and now to the latest version and no bug is ( PS : I am using the translator google I am Brazilian , sorry for English errors)

Hi, I tried to write a unit test but without success, I never reproduce the problem but it is always existing in my full code. After more investigation, the problem seems to come from one custom constraint (HardActivityConstraint) I added to the VRP (with one additional custom StateUpdater for this constraint ). In fact, if I always returned FULFILLED or always return NOT_FULFILLED, I never have the problem. But If I keep the logic of my constraint I have the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  So I am sure I am doing something wrong but no idea for the moment. Thanks for your help.

I think, generating UUID each time when an instance of MultipartContent is created is a very little overhead. Having any static string value publicly available will significantly increase the likelihood of being included into someone content.  (At least it's possible). With a random value it's very unlikely to repeat that value. 
There does not seem to be any stack traces in the logs. 
Saw it a few times in the past few days. But I tried to replicate it just now and couldn't. I'll update here if I see it again.

@jiazhai Pulsar is running in a cluster when this occurs with the "pulsar-timer-*" threads on the client side. As mentioned in the "To Reproduce" section, I am not sure what triggers the problem. I simply see the problem after a period of time and network instability has sometimes been observed during the interval where the problem occurs.  If I find a way to cause the issue, I will add it to the "To Reproduce" section.

Users do not appear to be able to start workspaces inside or outside of an organisation. I tried on a completely new setup and connected to a different A.D. setup just incase but this is the same result.  The admin **can** start workspaces inside or outside of an organisation.  The only difference I can see is the users are LDAP users and the Che admin user is created on keycloak directly. I will create a user account on keycloak directly and see if this works for creating workspaces (but this will have to wait until tomorrow!)

http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Status_Information  Here's a simple version of a user defined status script:  <pre> #!/bin/sh # Get data for the WEB Miscellaneous backend status. mythshutdown --check --verbose general --loglevel notice | \     grep " N " | grep -v -f /usr/local/sbin/MythStatus.ignore | \     sed -e 's/^.......................//' | \     awk '{ printf "%s %s %s %s %s[]:[].[]:[]\n", $3, $4, $5, $6, $7 }' # Enter your user/password here: mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -e \     "SELECT value,data FROM settings WHERE value='MythShutdownLock'" | \     awk '/MythShutdownLock/ { printf "Shutdown Lock Count = %s[]:[].[]:[]\n", $2 }' pgrep mythfrontend > /dev/null if [ $? = 0 ] then echo "Media Center Frontend Is Running[]:[].[]:[]" else echo "Media Center Frontend Is Not Running[]:[].[]:[]" fi </pre>  The output of the above is just:    I happened to have something like the above on both of my backends. So this was pretty much a lucky catch. Truth be told, I really don't look at the web status page much. 
1 - My app should not show the counter of the characters 2 - Initially, the counter is not visible 3 - I start the mention view and displaySuggestions is called with display = true in RichEditorView.class 4 - I click at an item of in the mentionlist 5 - Again displaySuggestions gets called, however now the boolean of display = false 6 - Finally lineNumber 381 is called: mTextCounterView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);  I tried fixing this issue with a textwatcher and setting the visibility off myself. But that didnt work, because after clicking an item in the mentionlist the methods of the watcher do not get called

Version 2.9.0.140 It doesn't happen often, it is probably a kind of race condition bug between input and search.

@duncdrum I know its difficult. But isn't it possible by looking into the code to at least find out *why* this particular warning is generated and what it means? It must be generated somewhere and someone once thought there was a good reason for it... Maybe you can have a look in the code (search on parts of the error message text?), I'll try to isolate the damned thing.  - The variables mentioned in the message can be located, sure. They're in the code, liud and clear. But I can't find anything wrong in their usage, let alone something eXist should be warning me about. - No I haven't fiddled with the logger level yet - Timing? It happens when some query runs - We don't use HTML templating  Anyway, if we can't resolve or clear up anything, its ok. It all runs without glitches.   However emitting incomprehensible warning messages, filling up the log with nonsense, eating system resources in doing this, confusing users that access the log, sounds like a bug te me, although not a fatal one.  
OK, That was the first time make a pull request...... maybe the operate will wrong. please don't mind that.
Thanks @benfortuna.  I do not modify the event time programmatically but in Outlook or in Google Calendar. I then use the code quoted in my first comment to read the events with iCal4j.
I tried RC6 (no RC7 on f-droid) but I can't login because the user/pass fields appear to be missing. I enter the URL and I get an error when pressing enter.
Updated issue with plugins/mods, basically Sky Factory 4.0.5  I did manage to test upto SF 3734 which seemed to work normally on one server, but on another SF4 server ore excavation wouldn't work at all, just had failure errors in the console along with other issues on the server, so it must have been a very recent change.  I didn't want to test anything above that as alot of very recent versions seem to have some major issues/reverts
Not sure about 2.0.3 and lower. The 2.0.4 was just saying that this happens in the latest version. 
We have a `RestTemplate` correctly configured for the app and want to use the other benefits of `TestRestTemplate` in tests.  I expect mutation methods, such as `addAuthentication`, to change it, but not a constructor.  If `RestTemplate` was immutable, the constructor couldn't alter it.  With accepting only `RestTemplateBuilder` instances, will it set objects on the builder only when null or the default, or always?  We need ability to specify something and not have it replaced (an unexpected replacement consumes time determining why something isn't working).  Since `RestTemplate` is mutable, a current workaround is to set it again afterwards. 
Some more observations:  - I figured out that the whole thing works in Chrome. It doesn't work in Firefox only (we have Firefox 52.4.0 (32bit) here)  I pasted the URLs in the browser:    - when using the hostname: I get immediately redirected to some other page (judging the sourcecode: IDE.html) and a dialog pops up "Can not get workspaces. The reason: Workspace with name "" in namespace 'api' doesn't exist."   - when using the ip: I see the JSON proper.   I logged in on the machine and used curl:   - http://ourhost:8081/api/   returns the API description just as it should   - http://ourip:8081/api/ returns the same stuff   - http://ourhost_or_ip:8081/api  (no trailing slash) redirects to the dashboard.  To me it looks  a little bit like Firefox is somehow loosing the trailing slash and gets the redirected page instead of the JSON during the API call.  
Rather sporadic, yes. Only happened once.  https://gist.github.com/Sunconure11/75237792a443823ec8032870d056087f
Updated PEX to 1.23.4; tested with latest release builds. Behavior is same.  I could just be wrong about how sudo works in the first place; is /sudo simply not intended to work on the person executing the command?  I could've sworn that sudo worked on oneself in past versions of ESX. Maybe I'm wrong, though.
Im added workaround:  if (world.isRemote) { ....  but idk if its ok.  When usig this workaround, no crashes anymore, but when press right mouse button to fire, nothing happens.  Maybe some incomplete client/server code. 
@andrewlewis what I want to achieve is smooth transitions between videos, so an opaque view is not a solution.
I'm having trouble reproducing the problem. I created a new Unity project added a script and imported the project in Consulo, this time though it didn't pick up any of the Unity classes either (as before though it still found the namespaces).  I tried restarting the IDE but that didn't work, then I deleted the **.consulo** project directory and imported the project again and this time the everything worked correctly, including the AstarPathfinding files.  I've tried deleting the project an creating a new one but now I just cannot recreate the problem. I've also deleted and reimported my other project and that's fixed the problem. 
Sure   
Unfortunately, I'm still seeing it :(  Not an issue when I check off playing in VLC instead.
Yes. Configuration is  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3930671/70162718-66a66680-16be-11ea-9349-ff7dc0b0fbac.png)    But opening a sql editor shows ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3930671/70162783-89387f80-16be-11ea-80e3-b305d900c3e1.png) 
nevermind sending messages does work thought but the account i was testing on needed its email verified going to check acceptInvite now
For me it doesn't work for any abstract class.    MyLifecycle is correctly highlighted in IDE saying it doesn't implement methods, but when I click "Implement methods" they are not added to the class as they should. 
I don't have this problem in the latest release nor in the current development branch, but I'm using Android 7.0. Is there any version where it was working on? 
@buchgr After removing `/root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/install/e4abe4ff56d8f229afa015dc729c5bd9`, bazel can build my project successfully. But the error sometimes still happens and I have to do the same thing.
Cool, I can look into it but won't be able until late December.
But the same happens if I query the VehicleHistoryGraph db. I have a question: If  I have a query doesn't return any result, why getColumnCount() throws an exception? Is it not possible to read the meta data another way?  I have this problem by using BIRT and orientdb via jdbc driver. In BIRT you can create some filter parameters which are applied as prepared statements on the data set. Since this parameters are set dynamically by user BIRT cannot create a schema at the time of data set definition because of SqlException. With the sqlite db this use case works without problems. 
Hi. Tested with 1.2.8.4 and it's still there 
That's what I thought,  which make me wonder why we get that error. After looking at the link, perhaps there is a setting we've missed somewhere, that tell osm not to look for this bubble... 
The main use-case is for testing.  I have a set of jersey-test tests that will call the service which takes the json patch.  My tests currently use maps to construct the json diff request.  It would be nice if the tests could construct the json patch objects.

Sorry, not sure what the ddb range or hash key means here? Still learning all the basics.  I will try a simpler test case to try to provide expected results vs. actual results. Create a simple table with just a few records, should make it easy to test.
Nope.  Turning it on the side (320x240) makes it prettier: Then all the lines with half visible fonts are gone. So prettier, but less useful.

Hi Benny,  Yes, no problem.  This is my simplejavamail.properties file:  simplejavamail.smtp.host=smtp.production.host simplejavamail.smtp.port=587 simplejavamail.transportstrategy=SMTPS simplejavamail.smtp.username=username simplejavamail.smtp.password=1111 simplejavamail.defaults.from.address=from@default.com <mailto:simplejavamail.defaults.from.address=from@default.com>  And this is the constructor of my EmailService:  public EmailService() {     	File propsFile = new File(PROPERTIES_FILENAME);     	if (propsFile.exists()) {     		LOGGER.info("Overwritting simplejavamail properties from external file '{}'",PROPERTIES_FILENAME);     		propMap = ConfigLoader.loadProperties(propsFile, true);     		LOGGER.trace("Java mail properties read {}", propMap);     	} else {     		propMap = ConfigLoader.loadProperties(ConfigLoader.DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME, true);     	}     	mailer = MailerBuilder.buildMailer(); 	}  And I get the exception when building the mailer instance. By taking a look into your code, the property simplejavamail.smtp.password is expected to be a String but it gets converted to an Integer Object on the ConfigLoader class:  static Object parsePropertyValue(final String propertyValue) { if (propertyValue == null) { 			return null; 		} 		// read boolean value 		final Map<String, Boolean> booleanConversionMap = new HashMap<>(); 		booleanConversionMap.put("0", false); 		booleanConversionMap.put("1", true); 		booleanConversionMap.put("false", false); 		booleanConversionMap.put("true", true); 		booleanConversionMap.put("no", false); 		booleanConversionMap.put("yes", true); 		if (booleanConversionMap.containsKey(propertyValue)) { 			return booleanConversionMap.get(propertyValue.toLowerCase()); 		} 		// read number value  		try { 			return Integer.valueOf(propertyValue); 		} catch (final NumberFormatException nfe) { 			// ok, so not a number 		} 		// read TransportStrategy value 		try { 			return TransportStrategy.valueOf(propertyValue); 		} catch (final IllegalArgumentException nfe) { 			// ok, so not a TransportStrategy either 		} 		// return value as is (which should be string) 		return propertyValue; 	}  Maybe you should try to convert to Integer only the properties that need to be Integer such as port…  I hope that it helps.  Best regards.

No matter what vibration or number of repetitions I choose I cannot get only one vibration. Two vibrations are minimum that I can produce.  That is what I tested on MiBand 1A (white LED version). 
1) you restrict templates to come from the DynamicCities module: https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/terasology/dynamicCities/buildings/BuildingManager.java#L107  2) the map entry has only the prefab name as key, so two prefabs with the same name coming from different modules would overide each other: https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/terasology/dynamicCities/buildings/BuildingManager.java#L109  3) you are comparing only the strings to match. you should consider something like the asset resolving mechanism (maybe can reuse it?) that is used when querying blocks, for instance.  https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/terasology/dynamicCities/buildings/BuildingManager.java#L220 
Alright i can provide you with some more information i gathered.   I found the demo structure spawning in the Nether and clearing all its surrounding. (so it did spawn with air) Although when I spawn it in my other world it wont clear land. This let me to the conclusion this might be an bug with Multiverse since the world im trying to use it with is a Multiverse world. But in the Normal world also doesn´t spawns with air.   But now to your request.  https://www.mediafire.com/#3a40jv4zbhcaq This are the schematic files i use.

I guess it is caused by the auto-umount of user home folder by ecryptfs in Ubuntu 16.04. 
In a very basic test I could not reproduce it. But having a bit more complex model I could. Here is a model which will cause this issue:    The last test fails.  **The error is related with the Map having a Entry which is an object**. When is a Map<String,String> for example, it works. 
@gwenneg you´re right. It only happens on DEV mode.  @loicmathieu I tried workaround with @Priority without success (thnx for pointing the code).   @gsmet What about a setting on `application.properties` disabling this feature?

Fails in the same way as above; Tumor or other "above" thresholded cells are not classified. The warning isn't important, but it did let me figure out why I thought the command wasn't working overall when loaded.  It does create "Above" objects and classify them when initially creating the classifier.  And in case anyone else comes across this, you can work around the current problem with scripting! Create the below threshold objects (assuming an either/or situation) and then invert the annotation and delete the first set.
This query is created using Alias.$() (within the generated OfferDaoImpl.java).  Your hint helped solving it: It works if you change the line `query.where(Alias.$(offer.getDrinkId()).eq(drinkId));` to `query.where(Alias.$(offer.getDrink().getId()).eq(drinkId));` in the generated code. Is this something that can be fixed in the generator template? 
Loading it into a test copy of my world now, will report back shortly.

Ah, ok. I'll upgrade and check. Hope it doesn't clobber my files, but if so, oh well. 😢  
there no stack trace available  it happens on class / method   
I tried **Java 1.7 (update 60) 32bit** and **64bit**, **Java 1.8 (update 5) 64bit** and it's same behavior on all of them, _none of them works correctly_.   I spend few hours by debugging JDK and WebLaF code and I manage to narrow down the problem.  When propertyChange listener is called `line 251 WebFileChooserUI class` and condition `prop.equals ( JFileChooser.ACCEPT_ALL_FILE_FILTER_USED_CHANGED_PROPERTY )` is fulfilled then `filter` and `filters` values are obtained.  `filter` value contains **selected filter** (`setFileFilter` method) and `filters` contains **choosable filters**. Then the method evaluate `colected` filters and set them to the dialog (if none found, accept all file filter is set as default). **That's completely fine**.  But, there is difference in creation of `JFileChooser` with WebLaF installed and `WebFileChooser` itself.   When `JFileChooser` is created, it's called its own method `updateUI()` which on `line 1838` calls     and adds accept all file filter as **choosable** file **filter** (that means, when property change listener is called the accept all file filter will be in `filters` variable).   When `WebFileChooser` is created, `updateUI()` method on `line 302 WebFileChooser class` is called, and this method creates `WebFileChooserUI` instance, which creates `WebFileChoosePanel` on `line 109 WebFileChooserUI class` and this class on `line 306 WebFileChooserPanel class` call method `setFileFilter()`. This method though sets accept all files filter as file **filter not as choosable** file **filter**.    Then property change listener contains accept all files filter in `filter` variable (instead of `filters`) and acts differently :smiley:

Master rediss://xxxxx.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com:6379 has changed ip from 10.153.99.49 to 10.153.99.219","loggerName":"org.redisson.connection.DNSMonitor","thread":"redisson-netty-1-12","severity":"INFO"}  It seems to me that Redisson did identify the changes. But when I ran " netstat -nt | sort +5 | fgrep .6379 | grep -n ^", I saw Redisson sent "SYN_SENT" to previous primary node even Redisson had already "ESTABLISHED" connection with new primary node. Once failover completed (it took about 10 mins), Redisson "ESTABLISHED" connection with previous primary node as well (33 connections to previous primary node, 34 connections to new primary node)  Another thing I noticed is that the following two calls seem using different connection pools. redissonClient.getMapCache("foo").get(key) always uses pool which points to new primary node.  redissonClient.getMapCache("foo").size() always uses pool which points to previous primary node. After failover happens, in about minute, get(key) starts to work, but size( ) keeps on throwing "SlaveConnectionPool no available Redis entries" error.  The reason I'm trying not to use individual node is that if we need to add new node or delete a node, I don't want to restart app with new node configuration. We used AWS Redis (cluster mode disabled). The primary node can handle both read and write. The other nodes are mainly for failover.  
The solution you provided worked perfectly.  Thank you serge-rider
Hi @iref,  thank you for your suggestion! I prefer to do filtering is a behaviour that leads to a defined result. Throwing should be the least alternative, breaking the program at runtime is not a good idea.  I'm looking forward to your contribution :-)  \- Daniel

Fixed! 
  Thats what we currently use. With Hikari dev from 12. Sep. the database name gets ignored. However I just tried Hikari dev from today to check the ThreadLocal leak bugfix and it seems to work well. DB name is honored now. 
> NET-ETH0-003 does not specify to set Search Domains.  Well the tests asks you to add set all other kinds of settings from your local settings. This is one of them. So maybe adding that field to the test explicitly makes sense.  > Should we just disable or remove the field from the Web UI?  I think fixing the issue would be the appropriate action.
@testforstephen Sorry, I can't include the full argfile. Here's a potentially relevant portion however:   It looks like both the `app/main` and `app/test` folders are being included in the classpath. Is this possibly a bug? Or is there a way for me to specify some classpath exclusion for a particular directory?
@JohnoverBoard Any progress?
There should be an easy way to map the file names to the content of the tweets. Maybe this should be done in corpus management? i.e. a way to open a corpus, show its content, and which file a data point maps on to during analyses?  
Test version still shows the same error. I am running on an LG V10 (T-Mobile, USA), stock rom.

Yes et no I haven't this column. Argh... so the DatabaseVersioningService is bugged?
I needed to zip the file due to github file extension policy. Second thing I noticed: When I create a category automatically, it stays empty. The file size of the generated file is zero and stays empty if I click "view". [category.zip](https://github.com/ctron/package-drone/files/78818/category.zip)

Thank you very much for the quick response. Sadly not stacktrace is logged by `flowable-ui-idm-app` and the full response returned does not contain more information than what I already posted:  `{\"timestamp\":\"2019-01-14T15:51:26.473+0000\",\"status\":500,\"error\":\"Internal Server Error\",\"message\":\"There is no PasswordEncoder mapped for the id \\\"null\\\"\",\"path\":\"/flowable-idm/app/authentication\"}`  
Actually it doesn't seem to be a Payara issue but a JDK one.  I've verified my issue is related to the following bug: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8196491 .  Thanks for your response. 
I download latest nightly and here spiner works perfectly with the same sources

I unzipped the RTAFmsEmailAdaptar-1.0-20170601.050247-1.jar file ,and found the pom.xml in META-INF directory, but it looks correct. I have uploaded this pom file, could you please help to check if there is any problem?  thanks a lot.  [pom.zip](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/files/3327901/pom.zip) 
Yes you are right, when I just add Locale.setDefault(Locale.ENGLISH); the test it passes. My default locale is sv_SE.  
Thanks Felix. I am using postgres 12 with postgis 3. Actually I was following the "hands-on tutorial v 4.0 (2018) but I will review all these first steps following the official docs you show me. I remember to got an error when running CREATE_DB.bat, but since the schema was created I thought it was ok, and indeed, I have just citydb. Many of my problems will be noob mistakes and not exactly issues on the software. Which place you recommend me to ask/discuss about installing and running 3D CityDB?
Nope, just a standard steam pipe. 
Thanks for your efforts, xmd5a2. The data were generated with Srtm2Osm, as described in a comment in the linked OsmAndMapCreator issue. But all Ids were positive, though close to 2^63. Since I wanted to use a larger area in my Garmin map, I created the elevation data again for a larger area, but now with smaller Ids (some 2^40 for nodes, less for ways), a smaller maximum length for ways (319), and used a fresh Geofabrik extract also. Now, all Ids stayed constant during the process (I checked the original Id in Josm for one object, and the final Id after OsmAndMapCreator process for the same object: 137,439,087,617). The issue prevails.  But I found a new hint: lines which are shown are open, while lines which are not shown are closed. Oddly, this does not happen with building and islands consisting of circular ways.  Is there some "flag" required to treat closed ways as lines instead of e.g. areas?
I'm currently using version **1.10.0** for this project. My earlier projects did not face any such issue where I was using 1.9.0
I just checked and it happens on other brands like bx and others. anything stepped... the value is correct in bitwig. it tends to be correct when you first look at it but if you change it, the update process appears broken 
The code can be found [here][1]. It uses the default settings for `AsyncDocumentClient`. The FeedOptions have `enableCrossPartitionQuery` enabled. Further it uses Akka Stream to treat query result as a reactive source and then processes and emits the json to a file  As this is a rarely used operation I can tweak settings even if they lead to higher resource consumption.

I have no idea why it crashed so i can not provide that information since my server did not record that.  
It was a unique self inflicted issue that had nothing in fact to do with Nextcloud

How about we close the other one as this one provides more information.  I'll bring in some detail from the other one.
Hi Greg,  6.  If this is a request message and none of the above are true, then        the message body length is zero (no message body is present).  okay, i can get that, so the parameters or not parsed, then, but why is the Body-InputStream checked against this then, and throw a "Form too large"?  HTTP2:   Thanks, Georg 
Much better, thanks! 
@gdude2002  This doesn't happen without ProtocolSupport.
Nopes!! Its working fine in WhatsApp and Telegram.
Great, it works as expected, thanks a lot!
I'll Check. Outside of that, I have morph installed and when I morph, if i have a block outlined my hand becomes solid. 
I think so... but most VDM++ examples use operations. I'll see if I can make a minimal example for the two dialects later today.  BTW, I assume that "Send to Interpreter" always triggers debug mode so any breakpoints are checked.

I'm currently playing around with this screen, working on the title for the split, so I'll just create all the issues that I run into first. Will probably fix later, when I finish this one. 
Thank you @pveentjer, will try. Hope new official release will be ready soon too. 
Just rembered what i forgot to post above. I use the Vanilla-Textures and the ressources given by the mods. I've already tried reloading the ressources with F3+T.  And i've just now tried your suggestion, sadly with no effect. I tried placing Earth next to the Pipes and around it.
Unfortunately I could not reproduce this. According to google play console it happened on - android 7.0 - Galaxy S6 Edge+ (zenltetmo) - Galaxy S8+ (dream2qltesq)  In total it only affected two users.  Our code is only this one: if (!Device.getNetworkType(context).equals(JobRequest.NetworkType.ANY)) { ... }
Amazon Fire Phone (OS is based on Android 4.4.4). PB 0.8.0. Steps to reproduce: - Open PB; - Service On; - Launch Camera by pressing a button on the left of the phone; - Take a shot; - Exit the camera app; - Open notifications; - Press on PB notification; - Get an empty view (everything white and PB header on the top).   I will be honest - it is not always reproducible, sometimes I get regular PB view after pressing the notification.

I can't access into che-master(http 503), the state of che pod is `Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500` 
Yes , it started right when i added these 2 mods.  I tried last 2 versions in a clean instance and they worked fine.  And now in a clean instance with same settings and these 2 mods it loads into world fine.  No Optifine in either instance 
YES!!! It worked, sorry about that lol. :) 
the api level of device is 4.4  the minifyEnabled is false  p.s: after changed Os to O0, it works fine so I think is the c compiler problem  and which part may be affected by the option

Not using OptiFine (AFAIK).  FYI (and this may be irrelevant), I have tried going into `indigo-renderer.properties` and setting: `always-tesselate-blocks=false` `ambient-occlusion-mode=vanilla` It doesn't seem to help with the issue.

I will try to make a patch. I'm not sure of the appropriate fix. My first thought was to throw exception when end-of-stream is detected in the decodeNext method, but I have not looked back at all the callers to see how everyone handles the null response it currently emits. If that's not the right place, then providing a specific fix for the decodeInfinitiveLength method seems straightforward enough.   @c-rack If you have any insight as to where I should focus the fix, please advise. Otherwise I will fork, fix, and send you a pull request as my work schedule allows .
like this ?

Hi, Android 9.0, all permissions enabled except for access to read notifications.  Speaking of permissions, the first setup screen with the option to set or skip permissions setup is confusing. It should be clearly stated which permissions are required for the app to work and the purpose of the permissions, ideally permissions should be asked runtime, not upfront. 
Yeah sorry about my poor mic quality, But bbayu123 is right and it is weird that in the video it has no problem when its the one car alone on that right side but then when two are there waiting on the left and right then it would not work. I do have a work around to just place and remove a block underneath the car like i showed in the video and that is making it work, but it seems i still have problems with the particular car not catching speed limit signs when its launched from that side and in some parts of the ride. Also the build number is (567)

Every time the grinder kills a zombie horse. The modpack has still EnderZoo-1.7.10-1.0.2.7_beta so it is maybe already fixed.  I just disabled the fallen mount in the config for a temporary fix. 
It seemed like the problem was writing the file name derived from the Unicode title to the exfat file system on my external SD card.  It doesn't seem to support it.  However, that does include a bit of guesswork...  Android 4.1.2.  The AntennaPod version was off Play, might be an Alpha.  I currently have 1.3.4.1, but it looks like I updated that after the problem.  /dev/block/vold/179:17 on /storage/extSdCard type exfat (rw,dirsync,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,nodiratime,uid=1000,gid=1023,fmask=0002,dmask=0002,allow_utime=0020,codepage=cp437,iocharset=utf8,namecase=0,errors=remount-ro)  I have to confess I've made it a little hard to test a fix, I hacked around the problem by directly editing the sqlite database and saving the podcast on the SD card with the quotes removed :)  I could probably undo that workaround if necessary to gather more information. 
one feed i remember and checked yesterday: https://wochendaemmerung.de/feed/mp3/ there was one new episode by that time and that didn't show up during refresh. i even triggered several manual refreshs of that particular podcast. 
I agree! I could produce a little screencast. Would be nice to have a website for weblounge release notes... 
grbl v1.1e, stopping mid job works perfectly with smaller files. This is the g-code: [holes.txt](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/files/1034217/holes.txt) I don't remember exactly, but i think it was generated by jscut and then panelized/tiled using bCNC.
I replaced the simulator with my own data source and wrote .xls files in the mdb directory reflecting my telemetry and command definitions.   My source is also CCSDS but does not have the packet ID.    The yamcs-monitor utility shows my data source is connected, but its not receiving any messages. 
Okay, I will do that :) 
Do you mean the tag editor plugin? It shows the correct album.  (Zeke...oh, is that the name of the beast titan? TBH I know little about the anime; I'm just a huge Sawano fan.)
@snicoll  I wouldn't read that tip, as don't do it, but more be careful if you are doing this. I also wouldn't expect this functionality to change in a minor revision (as this a breaking issue).  Good catch on the `public Nested getNested()`  would expect that to show up in 2.1.5 as well.  I actual project this is a private method (so i've updated my [example project to reflect this](https://github.com/bdemers/spring-config-problem/commit/fd97c0894d6b8143ae4993efd43592e801e96a3c#diff-86560ea992f714b0bec72ed9ace49852R46))  The metadata generated was not effected by this change (both in 2.1.5 and 2.2.0.M3)  Thanks for the heads up on the `@Autowire` + constructor.  For now, I'll try to work around this to support 2.1 and 2.2 with your suggestions.  Thanks again!  
Hi! I'm using the 1.13.2 Version of Forge and i tried the "newest" Version but it didn't work 
Same crash with 2.4.0.109:   
"oll" works :)
No. Not sure since when I tested, but it never worked on LineageOS on that smartphone model. Sure, if I can download the compiled apk.
BoP, EBXL, Natura and Streams are the ones with a major influence.  ATG doing overworld terrain gen too, but that doesn't change anything with the decoration stage, and doesn't touch the nether (I'm the author) Others have smaller stuff like adding some trees, but they shouldn't be affecting this, and certainly not in the nether. All non-GT ores are disabled except the TC infused stone/amber and Pam's salt, though I noticed that the "disable default ores" thing doesn't take away vanilla nether quartz. Pam's clay spawn and deadly world add pockets of other blocks in the overworld (clay, sand and silverfish blocks). IHL adds some stones but they're all overworld too. 
It always checks the code.

Hi, I'm using libgdx 1.5.6. 
To reproduce, create a new stack using this json https://hastebin.com/moyifanoji.json and then create a workspace based of this stack.  
Tried 3 different clients, only happens in RL. Doesn't happen in OSBuddy or on the OG client. 
Sure, I could fix this by throwing exception but am not 100% sure that doing so would fully address problem.  If you look at stack trace, you'll see that I'm not directly calling constructor. I make a seemingly reasonable call to setStyleSpans(int,StyleSpans) with a non-empty StyleSpans object. I probably need to investigate what's wrong with arguments to this call. Perhaps I'm adding empty span via StyleSpansBuilder? Should that be prohibited? Whatever the case, it's probable that error condition could be detected before Paragraph ctor is invoked. 
Sorry, I haven't commented the 'fade' thing - from my perspective, this class in undesirable. It enforces the fade effect even if I don't want it. However, it may be added via `styleClass` whenewer needed. Are you ok with this change? 
I mean a sticky header (apparently a bit too sticky :)) 
> Is it faster when you open "photos" again, one time directly and one time waiting at least 30s (as I do caching)?  It takes the same time regardless if I let it sit to do the caching. About 6-9 seconds on average with the new version and 18-20 with the old one for me.  > Do you know when this happens? e.g. all files -> photos -> all files?  Select photos from the drawer, then open the drawer and go back to "All Files". The "Photos" section will stay selected even if its no longer active. **The app will crash if you select "Photos" from the drawer again.** (All files>photos>all files>photos[crash])  >Hm. I did not changed anything in regard of creating thumbnails. Are those exact the same images? Are they generated faster when you browse within the app to the folder containing these images?  I found out they will eventually load one by one very slowly. Yes, thumbnails are generated faster from the "files" section than from the gallery (also the non-QA version is faster at loading the thumbs in the gallery, as mentioned earlier).  Another important issue I discovered was that some photos will refuse to fully load and instead are displayed by its thumbnail resolution, see below: Only way to be able to load images from gallery properly is to go to "Files" section, find in which folder the picture is and let the app load the thumbnails. Once thumbnails are visible for that folder, it signalizes that the gallery will load the picture. In other words, user must visit the "files" section before heading to the gallery for it to load images properly.  ![pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36133540/61531074-18057200-aa26-11e9-9ccf-59a586b4b1d0.jpg) **--**  Another highly important issue is that the folders will display images that are in fact not in those folders (talking about Files section now, not Photos). Go to one of the folders where the pictures are and let it load. Then, manually update that file by swiping your finger down. The "No files bug" will emerge for a second and  then random pictures that do not belong in the folder will appear in that folder. (This problem is not present in the non-QA version of the app).  
no worries. Take your time. Thanks and have a nice sleep.  You can also check the end result at www.yumaze.com specially at the navbar links 
It happens with a new project, created from scratch, but here is the new project directory: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1185307/hello2.7z 
Here it is:   
Thank you for your answer.  Wow, that was one of the strangest bug squashings I ever saw. This is going to be frustrating for you too.   Because the log was full of all the errors I got when installing and setting up the drivers for Oracle, I decided to empty the log first and then trigger the error again. That was a bad idea: since I emptied the log, the error does not happen anymore. I checked in the dBeaver folders but obviously dBeaver erases the errors immediately from the disc, which makes sense. Sorry, there was maybe a bug, but I can't help you find out where it is. The only thing I can tell you is that I was having a lot of errors because of drivers issues. At first, I thought this bug was part of the drivers issues, but I finally managed to get the right drivers and this error stayed so I thought this was finally a real distinct bug. Maybe it wasn't, maybe it was only dBeaver needing one more exit and restart before fixing everything.  
It's linked in my first post.
I did some more experiments and it seems related to hidden tracks. See the attached project.  When 'show hidden tracks' is off, you cannot descend into the Drums folder, even though there are unhidden tracks in there. When 'show hidden tracks' is on, it seems to work.  [folder test.bwproject.zip](https://github.com/git-moss/DrivenByMoss/files/4014216/folder.test.bwproject.zip) 
No Automation hooked up. Just going in it sometimes crashes to Desktop, When I get back on the world, it seems like everything is fine. 
Just run the following example. Sorry, if it is looking quick and dirty (This discription is still too good for that), but it is my little class for testing around.  https://gist.github.com/mjakobus/eba09fd2f814ffc100b051bb22e88425 
Yeah, that was #7454 .
Confirmed. I am unable to reproduce the 500 error. Thanks, Alex. 
Sam local has nothing to do with the Swagger that generates HTML and CSS portion.  The security mechanism that is used with Swagger I found was conflicting with the Sam local proxy security.  In fact the MVC portion of spring boot used with Lambda was requiring a login user name and password, which in fact without Lambda is not a requirement.  I have provided two examples, one with Swagger, and one without.  The lambda example does not have swagger support, but it would be nice to have it.  I can provide and reproduce a test case that provides a failing result, with Swagger integrated into the Lambda example.    Otherwise, you can look at the two test cases, and let me know what you think.
I don't, however I am in no rush to have this fixed as the server is still under development. 
The bug is indeed fixed. 
Thanks @jexp   Yes, I am using the enterprise edition and will raise a bug there.  I don't have the errors from the time it happened, however, trying to drop the constraint throws the following message in the neo4j-shell

Hello, sorry for the delayed response on this. I uploaded my college sketch here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/98im01wj1iso3ru/testcase.zip (it contains more than needed). Anyway, STR:  After opening it with Processing 2.1, go to line 36, right after the comment, press Enter. Now type 'setC' and let it autocomplete. Select "setCurrentMagnifier" and press Enter. As you can see in the following screencast it works sometimes and sometimes it does not. See http://screencast.com/t/9xzy3uLN5wda  Name of the sketch main file: sintomark 
I actually fixed this. There are two versions that are in all the files, the other of which doesn't have the `Params` column. I'll do a PR in just a minute. Also, I dovument my work in these issues, dont feel at all obligated to fix everything at once :)
I use ''restart'' within my multicraft panel or ''Stop''. 
> Which exception do you get  I'm getting a MPDConnectionException  > and what' the point in continuing if initialization doesn't work?  Counter-question: Why do you make the initialization fail if the connection cannot be established at startup?  Ideally, the app would try to connect to an MPD instance continuously, and register the listeners once a connection is established. Repeat after the connection is lost.  [To my (biased) mind this would be a perfect fit for using Akka with play2. But, currently, I'm still withstanding the reflex to re-implement the app myself...] 
@jackygurui Modify according to the issue template finish . 
I had an empty WAR but I did a mistake.  To make a test I have changed the folder for result and this lead to have an empty WAR.   Now I have to solve the last 2 issue and i have done. I'm stacked with basic authentication and examples

Essentially save scumming strategy for many other games. Save before a fight, then load the save if you fail. Every time you do this, the game brings over the damage done to the npc after your original save. So, you can technically attack for some damage, die, reload your save of the same profile and kill an npc since they took damage and held the value. 
kill the express server with monaco for example and see the xtext ls hanging, without closing the page 
Well I wanted to do something like that :   Do you know how I can make something like that with the bit expression (I don't really understand the expression well.... :/) 
Hi, Here are the values you asked: Build.DEVICE: a70 Build.MODEL: a70 Build.MANUFACTURER: TMN Build.VERSION.SDK_INT: 17  This device is a Gionee Elife E3, re branded and customized by an Portuguese Mobile Operator. I don't know if, the not rebranded version, has the same problem but it will probably have different values for those properties.  Until the device/codec is added to the blacklist in `MediaCodecUtil.isCodecUsableDecoder` is there any other way to achieve the same result?  Thanks 
Here is the call stack leading up to the error:   
sorry for the late response, yes it is: [https://vimeo.com/351740697](https://vimeo.com/351740697) 
There are no proxies or other stuff that could drop the connection.  Is it correct to have TX and NOTX connections in the same pool? Should I create separate pools? 
http://localhost:2322/api?q=berlin and here is the error message about missing index. Thanks!   
Yes, it does happen for any operation. I had the same error with both a spring-boot and JBoss EAP6 application. My use case is pretty straight-forward:    It occurs in my local environment with everything under my control. No monkey business with user/apps or anything like that.  I'm now doing the same using the Bolt driver. I still need to fix some stuff, but it seems like it connects. 
They are the same for both 
Alright, I'll do that when I next get the chance. I personally am not bothered by it (would rather use the ears on the skin, I think the 3D ones look odd), but I know other people will be, and I thought I would report it anyway.
Yes, but I think this has nothing to do with my issue; it's supposed to solve the problem when _children_ views are catching the events, not _parent_ views (ie. drawer layout in my case).  I am thinking that if there was a getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true) somewhere in the onTouchEvent code (eg. after we make sure the ListView should handle the event), it might work.  PS. I just got your reply through ajax while writing this and I see what you mean about usability; I have already implemented list item removal through a popupmenu, the swipe functionality will be a bonus eye-candy :-) 
Sure, sorry should have added it in the first place. I should note that this log was while using a slightly modified version of the Direwolf20 pack but also happens with just this mod installed. http://pastebin.com/WCEMUqbY
I will check and let you know 
The same one than the output of `java -version`, i.e. `1.8.0_20-ea` 
sorry i did not get any msgs 
Hi Victor, yes. just tested with one file and exactly the same error.  bert

On inspection I'm using the binary nVidia driver's "TwinView" feature, which I believe presents one big framebuffer to X and doesn't give any hint as to the fact that it's two separate monitors (as opposed to proper X xinerama configuration) (iirc). Indeed: $ xdpyinfo screen #0:   dimensions:    3840x1200 pixels (1049x331 millimeters)   resolution:    93x92 dots per inch   depths (7):    24, 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 32   root window id:    0x15d  This may be impossible under such a set-up. 
i forgot to mention that i've already tryed the steps on #18. Running manually it was showing the certificate error. Then i fixed it and it now runs manually. Then i tried using the mirror hook and that's when it started to show this process timed out error in the logs.
Hello. Yes, it works without GP. Here is the fresh video: https://youtu.be/poIN8xXgelA
Sorry, what do you mean by "External"?
I cannot reproduce with a new download/installation of 6.2.3.
Yes I'm on windows the javaHome variable contains C:\jdk1.7.0_55\jre and as I've explained changing with the debugger with \C:\jdk1.7.0_55\jre makes it runs... I'm going to try with MAVEN_OPTS... 
Thanks for your response, I'll try reinstalling the plugin.  It seems to be any day. I can only look at my time entries for today because the "formattedDate" query parameter is not set when you first open the time tracker.  Here's the form data sent (when I clicked the ">" button): date:12/07/2016  dayNext:> endOrDuration:end startTime:18:03 endTime:17:43 comments:  And in another instance (I selected a date on the calendar):  date:29/07/2016  datesubmit:Submit endOrDuration:end startTime:18:03 endTime:17:49 comments:  In both cases the URL has "?dateFormatted=12/07/2016" at the end. 
1. I mean, if someone kills you with TiC weapon. 2. Just tested in singleplayer. If you kill yourself with dagger, for example, tools drop in multiple amount too. 3. Cauldron 1240 (the latest version) have lots of bugs, so I switched to 1231. 
yes I think that should fix it
@psiinon both machines are running the same version of Chrome: **Version 73.0.3683.75 (Official Build) (64-bit)** Below are the errors logged to the browser console when visiting a page with the HUD enabled: 
Internal storage and it also happens if no NC is installed. So definitiv a bug of LineageOS/camera app.
I am sorry but right now i am unable to reproduce it.  
I would not say 66de8b78e7620b42039b31dd87eab3af12d13a01 caused this, as it is actually a step towards fixing this issues. Just invoking the Xtend compiler a second time after the Tycho compiler was missing: 09da09d06809b8d7fe03e061a0735f6a6027c3f1
I didn't. I'm not sure you red all i wrote.  First i tried without the port number in the public-adress tag. But your code hung on the fact that you're splitting this string on the ":" symbol.   So i tried with the port in the tag to see what happened. The previous code passed, but then of course Hazelcast was not happy with it.   So the problem is : if i don't have a ":" symbol in the public address, your code hang.   and ofcourse no... having the port number in the port tag. doesn't work. 
Thanks for the quick reply, if it is working for you it should work for me.  Let me try again and I will get back when I know more. 
@serge-rider a great suggestion and it fixed my problem, thanks!  I am used to using dmg's to install stuff, will try PKG's instead now.
'queryDSL': '3.4.1', 
I talked to Hellfire on Discord already. It is Advanced Rocketry. Hellfire changed the registration of the liquids to init. Maybe that will fix it.
Also checked that FORGE link and it looks like I will have to wait. It's not just JEI. it's the sprint key itself that can't be used for anything else. The sneak key also has this problem 
Hi. I just follow this example: JNCryptor cryptor = new AES256JNCryptor(); byte[] plaintext = "Hello, World!".getBytes(); String password = "secretsquirrel";  try {   byte[] ciphertext = cryptor.encryptData(plaintext, password.toCharArray()); } catch (CryptorException e) {   // Something went wrong   e.printStackTrace(); } This is the original file, password and encrypted data (convert from byte to base64string): http://www.mediafire.com/download/awxrbbw4zar0lut/JNCryptor.zip 
Hi I think this could be a bug because I run in another machine and works correctly then I open the same page in my pc  in edge, firefox, IE(I was using Chrome) and render properly, I clean all cookies, cache and data from Chrome but the b:selectOne render incorrectly  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49858714/69878687-39efea80-128b-11ea-8d9d-3016085f7a9e.png) 
hi @maggiolo00  it's plocal no Exceptions One of or unittests fails because it cannot delete the database directory after a drop. I found out that the reason for this seems to be that some Lucene index files have not been closed files 
Yes. Can handle that in Python. Will make sure `"clazz"` comes first. 
I have mailed cridentials and set up the server to direct all traffic to https.  I have a oneplus 3t if that's relavant. 
This was my docker file for gensecserver:   The server.jar is irrelevant here as it was not used. So you can just replace that with any command that will keep running, like for instance "/usr/bin/sleep 99999999".
Sure, hopefully this makes sense in video form. https://youtu.be/ozlje3OVMLA  When removing the books I press the key for the slot the sword is in. So 1,2,3,4 as I remove the books. As you can see the books end up in my inventory but aren't removed from the sword. 
Example problem with wrong fix (see comments): 30e8fec8df9c58e179c28ed4db32a814809ab798  P.S. Yes, `countAll` can be marked as safe.
Any type of job. It doesn' execute a single step, no matter what.  **How to reproduce**:  1. Start with a new machine, by deleting the config directory _~/.openpnp_. 2. Proceed as usual. Configure machine, driver as _gcodeDriver_. 3. Run job _pnp-test.job.xml_ 4. Verify machine executes job without problems 5. Go to [Solder paste] tab. Delete all entries listed there, for all jobs. Save job. 6. Exit openpnp. 7. Edit _machine.xml_: delete element \<paste-dispensers\> and all its children. 8. Run openpnp again. Go to the [Dispense] tab, under the camera window. Verify there is no dispenser listed there. Go to  [Solder paste] tab. Verify there is nothing listed there. 9. Start the job. Error message:

Hello @ronblum! Thank you for the very quick feedback.  Here is the screenshot of how the document outline appear on my IDE: <img width="242" alt="Schermata 2019-10-09 alle 16 13 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26568338/66489628-37a1b900-eab0-11e9-9617-8e467a68b2d9.png"> 
Network is fine and based on your response I believe this may happen also when there is no file to review - patch contains 0 file. It happens when you send to review patchset that was already submitted to another branch and what you have done was to merge this changes between branches and sent to gerrit. In that case I believe JSON is empty or similar. 
Yes when I use shutdown.bat I use -p password param. I tried passing the same argument for shutdown in the service but it doesnt seem to be working. 
I was also under the impression that the issue has been fixed on 1.4.7. However I still have it on two different computers (my main development notebook and a surface pro which I carry around).   It seems that selecting "sleep" in windows start menu and then waking up shortly after seems not enough to trigger it.   However, yesterday evening I left my surface in "sleep" by pressing the power key and closing the lid. This morning the dokany letter was "taken" and shown in explorer but data inside was inaccessible as per the OP.  My guess is that there is a "deeper" sleep state (similar to hibernate perhaps) that is entered after some time and not immediately. Hibernate however is not enabled on this particular device so it must be the deep sleep of windows 10.   I'll  try to enable hibernation and see if it changes something or if it makes it easier to reproduce. I'll also try the mirror suggestion and report back.  Update 1: Hybernation alone is not enough to trigger the issue reliably 
Thank you for taking the time to look at my issue.I tried to complete my question.
not exactly sure what do you mean, but  a) running `microprofile-metrics` quickstart with 0.21.1 passes  b) there is no issue filed for this in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus

@skabashnyuk I'm trying to figure out why we need to call bash sometimes, docker other times, and docker-maven-plugin other times.   Surely we could achieve both building and testing with a single approach?  @benoitf I'm not trying to solve the chicken-egg issue. I'm asking why we use:  * maven mojo to call docker 4 times,  * maven exec to call bash to call docker exe 2 times, and  * maven exec to call docker exe directly (no bash) 2 times.   Why do the same thing 3 different ways?  (You're right, my comment about portability was misleading. I've removed it.) 
@KurtStam it looks like the issue got resolved in the meantime, as with latest version of syndesis I'm not able to reproduce it anymore. I'll wait for the results of our jobs and will close the issue eventually.
Minecraft 1.7.10. Most recent Iron Backpacks file. I put the bag in a crafting table, I then went to pit an upgrade into the table with it. As soon as I clicked into the table,  the game froze and then closed itself.  http://pastebin.com/xeLmXwa3

The missing input file is because you need need to prebuild the compiler via `scripts/prebuild-binaries.sh` or build with `--define yaspl_bootstrap=true` to actually build the main compiler using the bootstrap compiler. My bad for missing that in the instructions.  It looks like it is still broken with 0.18.0.

This exact test fails with ios-x86_64 The results of a complex mnist app on ios-arm64 were incorrect, but I didn't check this particular test so in theory that might be caused by something else.
ah. okay could be. ill try thx
I did some tests and seems its works correctly. Thanks 
no, I've tested other Dimensions including the nether portal and it doesn't have this bug.
Actually, I am reusing the same SortOder instance each time when I fetch nodes with getAll(). In the tests, a new SortOrder instance is created when the getAll() method is called. I think this is why you can't reproduce this bug with the test you provided above.

I guess i should just stop reporting bugs until i update to 1.7.x seems like a lot of my bug posts are in the already fixed catagory 
Yes, please 
I can confirm this is fixed on the latest snapshot build. Thanks!
Jesse,  I don't want to drop the table - GeoNetwork does in its database init method (DbLib.java) - we could change all that in 2.12.x but probably not in 2.10.x - in any case it's probably safer for GeoNetwork to remove the table rather than assume that a table with that name has the structure it expects?   That aside, the problem seems to be caused by earlier code in JeevesEngine which opens a database channel (originally to test the db connection) which is now also being used to select stuff from the services table but which is never closed. This seems to hang the drop table call made later by GeoNetwork DbLib when initializing the database. Closing that test channel in JeevesEngine fixes the problem and releases a channel (probably better for resource usage). I'm just making sure that this has no other implications before committing the fix.

Considering that table has large number of columns, It should have provided view in horizontal column.  Even if the table could be re-sized according to preview window, it will be fine. 
We already have that ability in "Project" menu. It should impact the whole "project explorer" (so folders in `/projects` too)

Hi @laa good to hear from you. And yes it seems you've got it BINGO!!! after replacing the dots with an underscore it seems to work as before. I should have asked you earlier - it would have saved me some hours ;-) now my question is it a bug or feature? Anyway I leave the underscore. Thank you very much and best regards from Graz airport.

To do it just scaffold a Quarkus project and in `hello` method return a `Response.created` instead of String.  
Looks good for 2.0  Regarding bug I believe we need to show warning window instead of window with error stack-trace. What do you think?
I have no idea which one is the best choice (I remember having the same type of problem when changing the world shape with the target projection). Maybe, if it possible, we could just for the moment add an error if someone wants to change the shape of the world in the init section. 
made some tests today, probably it's my fault how to reproduce it 1 in creative gamemode create a new portal far away from the first and go in 2 hold "w" to run forward while loading(as you are in creative mode you will immediately tp) so after appiring in overworld, befor all chunks normaly loaded, you will tp back to Betweenlands(continue holding "w") after tp back to overworld this happening ![2017-12-19_15 58 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34198111/34160479-cd974ab6-e4d5-11e7-8b81-f6a174df3727.png) ![2017-12-19_16 09 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34198111/34161222-9cacd5c6-e4d8-11e7-877d-c62459d294f1.png)  maybe need to make a bit more tests, but you should turn on delay between tp in creative mode  ps few time after tp to overworld, i appeared without "portal tree" once in ocean and second in forest(probably because"the space is not large enough")

Seems to be fixed on latest version, as I replied to the other thread I've switched to 1.14 and made a quick PVP WorldGuard region, the pet no longer turned hostile.
@tonihei thanks for the update, I'd really appreciate @ojw28 input as this freeze causes failures in some of my unit tests.

I'll try the 1.2.2-RC,but it doesn't fixed. I saw the source,in the code  `if("objectBox_objectBrowserStop".equals(intent.getAction())) ` the intent will sometime be null,when onStartCommand result return START_STICKY or START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY.  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html#START_STICKY if there are not any pending start commands to be delivered to the service, it will be called with a **null intent** object, so you must take care to check for this.
It did solve the problem, thanks.  It might be a good idea to add a descriptive error instead of just failing, tho. 
I have tried for GCS path as well as for local file path. I have also tried QuickstartSample but it is giving the same error. I have created a maven application and added gRPC dependancies.   I have these pom.xml file which adds the gRPC 1.0.3 dependancy. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18505359/24488412/51958db8-1534-11e7-9342-0f8cbc23bd58.png) 
It's difficult to explain, you should try the above method out and see for yourself, the hover message will still be there after the last word (but there's no text) 
The issue happens after I’ve used the Observatory. If I reload a world, inventories and things all work fine until after I use it. Walking around the Observatory before I use it doesn’t seem to be a problem. I don’t know if it would make a difference, but maybe I could try reloading the chunk it’s in after I use it and see what happens.
Great, it was that! Incognito window solved my two different problems. Thank you! 
I'm not sure what you mean. Call pitest with any non-ZIP file as part of the `--classPath` option and it should reproduce.
@doom369  The board (ESP8266) differs from the one with which I tested it earlier (SF BlynkBoard) and it does not send data to the port monitor. I checked that the widget works correctly, the board gets the necessary data.
Thank you Paul. I tried the nightly build and it solve some of the problems, it was much faster and seemed to work much better. To complete the test, I need to install the nightly build. Not sure how to do that. There was no install script or files in the nightly build. Thank you again. Charles Cook 
I installed v14.1.1, and found the same issue, when I click the close X button.   
Yep, I don't either. I've debugged the application in Spring Boot and something should call `EmbeddedValueResolutionSupport#setEmbeddedValueResolver` but it's not clear as why it's not called. I don't think the background thing has any effect.  Perhaps @rstoyanchev knows a bit more about that part before I start digging again?
I can check that
Sorry for the late reply, yes we did put it on the default branch. We checked that numerous times. 
My system: - Windows 10 Pro - latest DBeaver version - latest Java 8 version  Can I provide you with anything else?
@jgriffiths Yes, I can get that data.  It will take a little time due to the device being repaired.  If you can, try making a few exports, and see if you get the same thing (it's pretty obvious... scored of `RDATE` lines near the top of the file).  If you don't, then me getting you the data will be the only way.  Well, unless someone else has the same issue and uploads an example. 
Also, your reply that "this is a limitation of gradle itself" seems to ignore my initial statement   > Yet, if I go to the command line in the same directory and run ./gradlew clean, gradle has no trouble doing the job.   Do you still need a sample from me?  I'm not clear at this point.
Thanks, @saudet! If you decide at some point to use `flatten maven plugin`, feel free to ping me for PR!
Still continues to happen with the owncloud server with selfsigned certificate, but on other with free ssl certificate I tried everything is ok on first look. So I think there is something wrong with selfsigned certificates. I have imported mine through CAdroid. 
It's like the 2nd one (`/home/user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/00LOCK-<package>`). I'm not doing any such customization and the computer where this happens doesn't even have an `.Rprofile`.
Yes, the current dev build works fine for me (build 131).

The issue seems to be in our application. I am closing the issue.
@wu560130911 Not understand why you quote this warning? It should not related to the "too many open files" issue

I think it was checking/unchecking a checkbox in the 'Impling' settings-page. I reproduced the bug (game freeze) when unchecking it (a min ago), but did not get any message in error log. (after restarting game I can check/uncheck it again without any bugs, so might only happen after playing for some time. Same is true for other (similar) bugs.)

Oops! I added them now. I think it probably depends on screen size.
I use the default config 
Basically i am getting this for my Spring related tests. I have defined one step def as below- @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:spring/api/application-context.xml") public class SpringSystemTestSteps {     @Before     public void SetupCucumberSpringContext() {         //dummy method so cucumber will recognize this class as glue         //and use its context configuration     }  }  The other step definitions doesn't have the - @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:spring/api/application-context.xml") defined anymore. Its just the tests. I am getting this error.  I also have other stepdefinitions where Before and After hooks defined for all step defs. This error is even present there.  Please let me know, if i need to do something different now.  
Please look at the header with menu. It is short and (presumably) should determine the borders of the page. Every content below should 'fit' within. This table violates that boundary, and whole page does not look symmetric at all.   Here is another screen from app which in my opinion is correct: I think that this is how this should look like:  http://postimg.org/image/mjw6e61h9/  Container class in css is quite clear about it: width: 700px; 
But so far I never removed the `pool.queues` ...  Anyway I retried, ... 3.0.25... dcache stopped... moved back the old `setup` file as generated by 2.16. `pool.queues` in place... started pool... and the same crashing loop as reported before.
Without a shader it is not completely gone but it also happensjust occasionally. I also strangely had the stack overflow error without a shader for the first time during this test, so it might still correlate with that OpenGL thing.
Once it starts some of the users do. Not everyone, also the only plugin that is custom is our STCore. It allows players to fly within a towny area by typing /tfly but my developer said that it hasn't got anything to do with essentials.
> hi @rotorboy , > unfortunately, cannot understand your issue. could you add screenshots that will make your issue more clear? > thanks in advance  Photos likely won't help but I will provide more detail to better explain the issue;  Query-produced Integer fields displayed in data editors, by default, appear as "grouped": e.g "1000" is displayed as "1,000". There is a checkbox option in preferences->data editor->data formats preference panel titled "Use Grouping" that toggles between displaying the comma or not.  If a data editor is already displaying an integer, and the checkbox state is changed, even if the change is "applied", the CURRENT data editor integer display will NOT be changed to respect the new "use grouping" setting. This means that if the editor is displaying "1,000", and the checkbox is cleared in the preference, the editor will CONTINUE to display "1,000". To effect the change, the editor must be closed and reopened, and then the effect will take place, and the integer will now be displayed as "1000".  I hope that provides enough detail...
im using the mods in 1.14.4 of their latest versions  I am able to obtain the books from a zombie villager after I cured it and started cycling through their trades
I tested osx to osx. This works as expected. 
I hadn't upgrated to the new version when I wrote this, both problems seem to be resolved by updating dbeaver.  
macOS 10.14.2 and Chrome 72.  I have yet to re-test this by building from source, I was using the release. If you are unable to replicate the Service Unavailable response, I can look into it further.
3.0 Beta 7
That looks like the expected behavior, but it's different from what I'm seeing on my device. Here's a quick GIF:  ![20191010_060110](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8658164/66556361-f8bf4200-eb47-11e9-912c-5a46f2862da0.gif)  As you can see, the editor switches to light theme (and remains in the light theme when I reopen it) but the note list keeps the dark theme.  However, this is a fairly edge case scenario — in other tests where I added content to the new note or performed other actions the whole app switched themes as expected — so this could be a very low priority or wontfix issue unless others are running into it. 
My CB Version: 2203 SkylandPlus Version: 0.12  I have 2GB of RAM allocated to my server, should I add one more? 
I'm launching JarRun with a Run Configuration in the Feature Base project. I pass these arguments: JarRun testing -import ~/binaries/cat  testing is a ghidra project I created with Ghidra 9.0.2. cat is /bin/cat   The environment is the git repo (commit 1cae5552). I followed the instructions in DevGuide.md.
I have prepared example app: https://github.com/PawelJ-PL/spring-security-csrf-error How to reproduce error:  1) Build and run app (because of spring-session, it requires Redis listening on localhost. I've used Redis docker image) 2) In web browser go to endpoint `/do/something` (`GET` request) 3) You will be redirected to login page. Enter username: `user` and password printed in console 4) You will be redirected to page with content `QWERTY`. Copy SESSION cookie 5) Using curl (or similar tool) send `POST` request to endpoint `/do/something` (and use cookie from previous step) 6) You will see stacktrace in response (because CSRF token has not been provided).
Both in the compiled app and the companion, the background color is black when I use dark theme.
1.7.2 is already released. 
ok, then, please, explain your vision on which way you are encouraging to use for development of Che and how to debug Che without changing default logging level. 
@mikecroft  Yes, it works. So I switched back to Beta 1
@timja yes, but I can't create an issue in that project

Thanks for the updated binding. Installed it.  I turned up the debugging on owserver to maximum. (To be clear, I mean the "owserver" daemon that is included in the OWFS suite of unix apps -- not the physical OWSERVER-ENET-2 hardware device, of course):  First, the OH OneWire binding log output:   
@tobiasKaminsky it's not clear what you are proposing for me to do.    It looks like @atomspring did the same thing mentioned in the original post to _temporarily fix the symptom_.    That is: after some unknown and intermittent issue causes the nextcloud account on a device to be removed (for me, this only happens intermittently to my nextcloud app account - no other accounts have this issue) _and_ I discover that I cannot add the nextcloud app account back again on my device (this _also_ is intermittent and not necessary correlated with the nextcloud account on my device mysteriously being removed).   Then I will:  1. put the device into recovery (I use TWRP) 2. pull /data/system_ce/0/accounts_ce.db to my computer via adb 3. edit the "accounts" table and the "extras" table by deleting all entries referring to the nextcloud account in the file accounts_ce.db by using a SQLite editor ("DB editor for SQLite" is my poison of choice for this) 4. After saving the edits in step 3., push the modified accounts_ce.db back to /data/system_ce/0/ on the device via adb. 5. Use "adb shell chown system:system /data/system_ce/0/accounts_ce.db" to make sure this file's user & group ownership is something android expects 6. reboot the device, delete any now defunct nextcloud app accounts _on my nextcloud server_, and readd the nextcloud app account on my device.  FWIW, I continue to have this problem intermittently (so far I have not been fortunate enough to get a logcat of the events otherwise I'd share it).    Updated environment data/additional info:  Android version:7.1.2 lineageos 14.1 20171020  Device model: surnia (I also have/update a falcon and a hammerhead device both using lineageos and a similar app mix but so far have not run into this issue).  Nextcloud server version:12.0.3, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-97-generic x86_64), TOPT enabled, https only, redirected from a DDNS service at a high port that is redirected to port 443 by my router.  While this problem has affected me over the past month when using versions of 2.0.0RC and the "stable" 2.0.0 both from fdroid, I cannot provide reliable info to reproduce this problem.  It occurs unexpectedly, intermittently, and, as far as my recollection goes, not always due to events related to using the nextcloud app.  If I can get a logcat before/after this event happens, I'll share it.    HTH 
Updated stack.  Out of curiosity: why would you synchronize on DefaultBroadcaster.resources while it is already Thread-safe? 
@kevinushey The report I sent above is from work. I've seen it on my personal PC as well, but can't reproduce right now. I'll send the extra required information on monday.
http://kevin.deldycke.com/2010/05/initialize-git-repositories/  We'll have to do an init and a force update after that. Seems like an extra point of failure to do dozens of times for every build for something we only need to do once. 
Updated the project to be Lombok-less (& updated the repo on GH). Same issue persists.
I was on M4 before. I am not sure how you want me to add and remove a channel. What do you  want me to do?

Sure, just pushed them to this repo: https://github.com/felixfbecker/PowerShellXSD  `Format.xsd` is the the schema (I autogenerated it from the XML, so pretty sure it's valid) `TestFormat.xml` is a schema instance. Try hovering over any tag, or triggering autocompletion, and you should see the above exceptions logged (and no hover/completion results).
Hi Ron! I uploaded the Textfile and screenshots of the described behaviour.  Thanks for any help! Gregor  [Textfile_Screenshots.zip](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/files/2512561/Textfile_Screenshots.zip) 
@zhuowei I did redownload it and here's my mod http://www.mediafire.com/download/odgd5vonbb31ten/Redstone_%2B.modpkg 
Sorry, here's the log:   
I don't know how I could explain it better, so I recorded a short [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Zl0DYtUPap9dL4xsN2fgm30gE2dHEZXT). Also this happens only on code exercises and also with very old ones too so nothing I am changing something constantly.
I think it's done (i'm not famliar with github merging, sorry if i did a mistake). 
Thank you for your quick reply. getLocations returns only one location if I remember. I didn't call getValidLocations.  I have just done another test, and no problem here. getLocations and getValidLocations return 20 entries. See [logfile](https://gist.github.com/sekiroh/ef633e5734f7c09b2906f0a8d4445fcf)  This time, wifi connection wasn't enabled when starting, perhaps a problem when previous location is obtained from network, and new from gps? 
`BNODE` looks great, will try that, thanks! For the future, is that exception behaviour intentional for blank values or could that be changed so that they are ignored?
I think I was running on Raspberry PI at the time, however, I always made sure that the CPU was free by reducing rules/load for it to hover around 70% usage.

Thinking of it, this may be an issue with my custom ROM. My gallery displays all images as videos as well. I'll leave a notice if I find anyone else with the same issue.   
I can try in 2 days. I'm let you know..

This page is awesomely helpful https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Concurrency
You are correct. Apologies for the false alarm.
It could be possible, to write such kind of test, but I'm not sure.  The point is that you need 2 different threads, which are calling `getTypeDeclaration` from the same type reference at the same time, so they both enter here: https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/10e983b20f7bbf793e87d965f2e1730f48f35bc8/src/main/java/spoon/reflect/factory/TypeFactory.java#L555  BTW, does it seem like a bug to you, or `getTypeDeclaration()` is not supposed to be thread safe?
Perhaps it was an issue specific to my particular configuration, but when I tried to add ABS as a library project, to an existing app, I needed to change all of my styles to not declare IDs, but to reference IDs defined in ids.xml.  This is likely an issue related to my particular app, and me simply having an issue that didn't come to light until using ABS exposed it, so this is a non-issue, I expect.

I think 1, 2 and 3 it's also your problem, because with CombatTag or CombatLog instead PvPManager fly event in plugins WGFlyFlag and FlightPack work normal. (except 3. in FlightPack with CombatLog)  6) I mean if u have Kill Abuse -> Max Kills: 10, and player kill another player 9 times, after relog he can again do 9 kills and [Commands on Abuse] don't be actual. And [respawn protection] to. 
I have only tested with "normal" needs (I stumpled across this while testing lazy loading of needs) so no, this is not specific to What'sX
Enabling/Disabling Sonic does not make a difference. The problem remains.  I tried the Ogg and the Opus feed. The Ogg feed works fine. No problems with that, I use it as a workaround.  The Opus feed does not work at all. There is just no sound played for Opus. Should I open a new issue for that? 
Understandable but then it make sense to have it with grey background. Writable text box could be useful in case when having a directory path in clipboard to paste it into that box. That would be even more useful when having a long path of multiple nested directories. Now I have to click "Browse", then hit "CTRL+L", and then I can paste the path.
It looks like only a few (7 out of 120) of the vulnerabilities were spring-related, and all of them were present in both java 7 and 8 result sets. In the Java 8 results, most of the "extra" findings were in `<fileName>struts-2.3.20-all.zip: juli-6.0.18.jar</fileName>`, and a couple in `<fileName>struts-2.3.20-all.zip: dwr-1.1.1.jar</fileName>`. There was one finding in `<fileName>struts-2.3.20-all.zip: xwork-core-2.3.20.jar</fileName>` in the java 7 set that was missing in the java 8 set. 
I am on the road now. When I get back home I can do that.   > On Jun 21, 2019, at 2:21 AM, Bastien Jansen <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > Could you go to Help > Show Logs in explorer and attach idea.log please? >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/antlr/intellij-plugin-v4/issues/358?email_source=notifications&email_token=ACCDGVUXLNZHCGWK5S2V5CLP3SFRNA5CNFSM4HWHSIWKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGODYHZQFI#issuecomment-504338453>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACCDGVX5NJGKZTTBJDE3GL3P3SFRNANCNFSM4HWHSIWA>. >

You cannot add an empty file, but you also can't add any other files you select at the same time (using multi-select) either. This is problematic because then you have to go hunt down the one null file and delete it before uploading the rest of the files. Can you make it so it just doesn't upload a null file, but uploads the rest of the files, and gives them a popup warning that says "x files were not uploaded because they were empty" but still lets the other files that aren't empty load in?

Hi @kosarko what you just described is the behaviour for UFAL theme, whereas using Mirage, I don't get a javascript dialog, but instead I choose the file using file chooser and fill the name - both on the workflow page and then submit it by pressing "Upload and add another" button. The first file uploads successfully and is shown in the list below. But when I upload the second file, the "Upload" page refreshes but the list is not containing the newly uploaded (second) file data.  The same happens if I continue an abandoned submission.  The only way to see that file in the list is to choose the same wortkflow step by pressing "Upload" button in top progress menu, or to press either "Prev" or "Next" and then return to the "Upload" section.  I tested it with fresh 5.3 build yesterday and in both Mirage and UFAL themes I get the same faulty behaviour. The .js files updated are UFAL-specific and don't seem to affect Mirage at all.

sry wrong button 
Confirmed Firefox 70.0.1.  After further investigation, I've observed that prior to upgrading Linux WebDriver to v13, a process called _geckodriver_ opens on a random high-order port when you use the Launch Browser button, and ZAP makes the connection to it, then the browser starts.  However after upgrading Linux WebDriver to 13, geckodriver does not start and does not start a random listening TCP port.  Then ZAP times out trying to connect to the non-existent port and the logs show a connection timeout.  ZAP log below showing timeout:  
Indeed, on my windows machine, it doesn't happen.  As a matter of fact, after switching the tab, my search term is always selected (and the search field never has focus). My first idea was, this could be related to the highlighting function, that marks the search term in the preview windows and the entry editor and somehow applies its highlighting also to the search field. But than it shouldn't be Linux only. 
Hi James, certainly:   
I'm sure, I have widely used app (1.000.000+ downloads) targeting API7+, and use this approach all time. Actually you may see some reports from dalvik in logcat that it replaced unknown method by nop, or something like this.  Only doc that confirmed this to me is "Android development" from Commonsware, which is a paid book.  Another approach to avoid massive reflection is to make base export class for lowest API adding some fields to report, then extending the export class for subsequent API level that adds new reported fields, which appeared in that Android API. At run time, instantiate actual report class by API version and call its reporting function.

Yes, of course. I though the client-log might be useless, since the mod works fine in singleplayer, so it must have to do something with the server :D  I hope this is the right file, at least the time matches.  https://gist.github.com/Accurexx/9346c76526b8d54f119fd3f6123c5d47  There are 2 regions within the log where thinks go weird (at least when i open the log with the notepad). If it's the right file, the first one should be the clay soldier placement, the second one the reconnection.
Step by step:  -/shopkeeper (a villager appear) -sneak+clic to access the edit menu -click on the name tag -type a name -change the outfit of the npc  and now or even before i try to put things in his inventory but things continu to come back in my hand.  I've found another way but still got a problem, i've used the /adminshop create Farmer all the buy/sell is setup, but after a restart server, some of the npc lost all the setup.

Yeah, the line #70 is called a "Diamond Route", where it divides and serves different parts of a neighborhood on alternating trips.    BTW, I can kinda understand why OTP is doing what it's doing with that trip, since it's always trying to transfer you to the 19 at some point (so if you say you'll walk a mile, just put you on the 19 and forgo the 70).  The strange thing though is that it's not consistent in telling you to walk to the 19 when you say you're willing to walk 1 mile ... same trip with a fairly small change (e.g., a trip start point 200' to the east) gives you the 17th & Rex routing on the 70.  It's inconsistencies like this from OTP that make me worry there's not a scale of problems underlying the routing choices, hence the desire to get someone to take a look. 
No, i have just selected "FeatureIDE" feature and then eclipse started to resolve the dependencies, but it's working very slow in our company via proxy and we do not want to have all (not needed) eclipse dependencies to have the IDE lean.

Mirakel is 2.1.2 from the Play Store.  I did a duplicated setup under CentOS 6.4 and recompiled taskd/Taskwarrior from scratch.  Behavior stays the same, Taskwarrior works/Mirakle doesn't.  I'll get back to you with a logcat.  Thanks so far.

Last year it was connected via powerlan (unstable), but a month ago I connected it via cable. Since then it appears stable to me.  What confuses me is, that OH seems to be able to find the wallbox,  if I run it as root user. Maybe this indicates missing access rights? Another difference might be, that I have a P30X, which is able to run as a master and therefore runs a different firmware. Maybe it reacts in a different way to those requests compared to a P30C.

Because it worked OK in Chrome 38. fitBounds in Leaflet seems to cause this. In leaflet changelog there is one bugfix for infinite loop when changing map center after setting map center. Maybe this is it. Fix is changing Leaflet from 0.5.1 to Current 0.7.3. I'm working on PR and testing if this breaks something else. Currently it seems that everything is smoother now. 
I'm using everything the the 2.0 beta1 release, except for `gst-java-core` and now the newer `jna`. It seems to have helped a tiny bit, though without fail, my app doesn't fully exit when I quit. There's still the hanging process issue. I'm using Eclipse and can see the app doesn't fully terminate until I hit the red stop button. It now gives me the `WARNING: no real random source present` error when I quit my app sometimes, which didn't seem to happen at that specific time before. So, the results aren't much different yet. I'll look at using the older gstreamer binaries, if that's even possible. Thanks @neilcsmith-net !

It was the issue of openjdk, sorry for not explaining that. Specifically, openjdk is the default Java version on most linux versions. In fact, I could only get the build and library to work with the oracle specific runtime and jdk. The build failed on openjdk versions 7, 8, 9 because of the override.  **Thanks! current builds complete on open-jdk 7,8**
Are you asking where the emails are coming from or the actual details of the emails?  Just had it happen to two again today so I'd be able to do either.  It's happened to varied emails, no real connection.  This time I deleted these emails in K9 but instead of deleting and disappearing, they turned to this no Subject/no text issue  
Np, I've been on the receiving side of the cryptically short github ticket...no fun :)  Unfortunately, Java 1.7.0_51 didn't fix the issue:   
I followed the example here: http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cuke4duke/tree/master/examples/java-webdriver/ I am using cuke4duke 0.1.8 and cucumber 0.4.3

Why does it seem to work for unit tests like `ModelTest.testGetArrays()` though?  The expected behavior would be the same as for the other solvers, which is expansion of the array and returning a `ValueAssignment` for each cell where the SMT solver assigns a value.
Now i've got the same issue in parser. Shall I write another bug? 
With the latest version, the problem has changed. Now the constellation continuously pops in and out of visibility for what appear to be single frames, moving each time. This also happens on all worlds, not just the original world with the problem.

@tasiek Nice, it's good to know the root of the problem. Could yo help me? By providing me a link to the TV App 1.4 release's source code, just to try to fix it by my self, I've been modifying the latests development versiones but they're crashing randomnly. I'd like to try the last release version. Thanks 
Well, I sat down to test it, crashed the first time I right clicked [a bag](http://i.imgur.com/VrSv3i3.png), and crashed. I've crashed right clicking my [other bag](http://i.imgur.com/ssnE8qP.png) and the [one I wear](http://i.imgur.com/jStTUEy.png) before, BUT.. After I logged back in, I didn't crash when right clicking any of them, and I didn't change the contents at all.  So.. Yeah. I'll try to narrow it down some more I guess.
Hi Trustin, Thanks for your hint, but the original problem was a forgotten system property -Djavax.net.debug to be removed before starting the load tests. All this print stream stuff is related to the debug logging. After removing the system property, there is no blocking anymore.  So this issue can be closed. 
I am using Fetch in a download service. I shared the file with your email over google drive. You will have to add onStart to the listener for it to be compatible with the latest version.

Hey Lecho,  Its just 4 lines in total, 2 solid lines and 2 dotted lines. To make the chart a little less complex I have removed all but one lines. The issue still appears, but does not happen as often with less data on the screen. Examples below...  Before: ![screenshot_2015-09-23-08-41-06](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5235732/10075107/e60f32b8-62cb-11e5-9cbb-d4695aa93adb.png) 1 min later: ![screenshot_2015-09-23-08-42-49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5235732/10075108/e60f48ac-62cb-11e5-861f-294809f29bd0.png)  As you can see the chart reloads its viewport to show the full chart and then links the start and end of the line together. The charts viewport is linked to the preview chart at the bottom.  Here is the code:  Chart setup:    Building of Graph... Best to link you [direct to GitHub](https://github.com/timomer/HAPP/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/hypodiabetic/happ/ExtendedGraphBuilder.java#L222)  You can see the full code on GitHub, the code I quoted above is in MainActivity, I believe all you need to see is here.

Ah thanks, I didn't spot that this was a duplicate. I tested my environment against the master branch and I'm no longer seeing the error. I think this can probably be marked as a duplicate so I'll apply that label and close it.  Duplicate of https://github.com/imageworks/OpenCue/issues/270

If I use browser on PC to HTTP server on Linux. When trying to change configuration directories the dialogue box does not come up and explorer freezes.

In this issue I'm discussing only **non-static** fields. This problem does not occur with static fields.  > What is it that you are trying to do that triggered this problem?  I was using a final field with a PerTxBox to implement an optimization in the BPlusTree when I stumbled upon this situation. I've already found a way to work around the problem by removing final and using different initialization code...  > if it varies from one instance to another, then it is because its value depends on some parameter passed to a constructor. But then, during a future load of the object, that information is no longer accessible, if the value of the slot was not made persistent  Its value can depend not only on constructor parameters, but also on any changes made to the object. Just imagine a tail with a number of hairs; the cat can chew on its tail and lose hair (perhaps I should have used a dog instead). It's true that the number of hairs is not persisted. When a cat is fetched from the database, the number of hairs is reset. Worse - if the transaction is restarted the number of hairs is NOT reset... But the cat should **always** have a tail (because of the final semantics).  What if the programmer knows all this; that the field is not persistent and not transactional, but still wants to use it for other ends (i.e. keeping a temporary value of an intermediate calculation)? Or is the use of non-dml-fields an invalid use-case for the framework, and thus not an issue?

No, the problem is with validation during executing this: https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/blob/fc28d12c57a7a4e36e969728223cda6cab411965/vertx-web-api-contract/src/main/java/io/vertx/ext/web/api/contract/openapi3/impl/OpenAPI3RequestValidationHandlerImpl.java#L461  For example with schema:     User:       type: object       description: User data       properties:         id:           $ref: '#/components/schemas/UserId'         firstName:           $ref: '#/components/schemas/FirstName'         middleName:           $ref: '#/components/schemas/MiddleName'         lastName:           $ref: '#/components/schemas/LastName'    It says that there is no definition for UserId, because this definition was first and was not put to root

@breautek I can't remember exactly. It always worked before last Android Studio update or new setup. But know I see in the Android Studio path the Gradle folder. I could set the enviroment variable to this path instead of downloading gradle separatly. But currently it works with my workaround from my prev. post. But the path to `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\gradle\gradle-5.1.1\bin` should also work. It's weird, I never had to set the path before. Something has changed. How detect Cordova the Gradle? Is the Gradle cli required or does it look up the Android Studio Path?  Installing the Android Studio without any hacks will not work anymore. The error message of Cordova should be changed. It's very trivial if you know what's the problem is and how to fix it. I was just annoyed to get one error after another. - Be free to close it.
I do not know if it helps, but before this issue occurred there were cases in which wrong very small values returned at any time during an experiment (e.g. memoryUsageSum=612265984 or fsSizeSum=98304) which was the case when resources were requested after system's termination.   Now, such cases are not occurred. I suppose that have been replaced by the aforementioned issue (`null` stats). And If I try to request the resource usage information after the system has terminated there are no small values returned but the `info` of `ResourceUsageInformation info = req.getSystemResourceUsage();` is `null`
@mrniko sure. can you tell me how to configure that?

Thanks! 
Found out, that the app actually does ask for GPS permission. But only if GPS is enabled.  If the position mode is only set to GSM position the app does not ask for the permission.  So the app only works with GPS but not with GSM positions. Don't know if this is intended.

Good that it's easy to fix. About same behavior in Editor and in APK I would find it consistent, yes, how do you think ? If you want retro compatibility, since no one complained in the past, you can keep the fatal NotFound exception.

At the moment mine just skips rendering the board when you set the speed to 32x or higher.
I should have mentioned, this exact same code works fine when using the '3.1.0' version of the library.  All I did was swap the library to use '4.0.0-beta1'.  > Could you give a step by step instruction?  Sure, I called the library using the code I listed above: 1. The dialog opens as it did in version 3.   2. I clicked on a folder, which opened up to list some files on my device 3. I selected a file and hit OK  As a test, I created a new Android project with a single button that calls the Intent as shown above.  I used the default style and Activity declaration as shown in your README.  I'm getting the same exception on both an Android 5 and Android 7 device. 
Hmm, we can do that. However, in that case we are editing the behaviour of `Save as`. Why not just have a dedicated dialog for creating boards?

same behavior on both the ASUS Transformer Infinity and Samsung Galaxy Relay running CM 10.2.1.  this might be related to having a firewall up but both firefox and apktrack are allowed through. 
@TylerJewell Well, I read it in the Che docs at https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/machines#section-machine-snapshot. This is probably the wrong place to look at.  @eivantsov Thanks for pointing out that snapshotting is possible in the operations perspective. I was not aware of that.  @TylerJewell and @eivantsov However, it seems to me that both ways (manual snapshot in operations and the implied automatic snapshot) do not work for me. If I install a package in the machine (e.g. `sudo apt-get install cmake`), the package is gone after restarting the workspace. Am I missing something fundamental here? 
It is Kit Kat. I have fixed another bug related to small sets. When you have 3 columns but only 2 elements, the top and bottom is computed also using the empty column (with wrong values). 
Sure, here you go:    These are probably just fine, since without asyncWriteEnable, everything works (slowly) 
@adam-sandor I'm not sure what else is relevant.    I recall that I didn't have `docker-machine` installed at the time I tried this, though... 
@rbygrave can you add it?

@clintongormley sure thing. I am using 1.6.0 locally just haven't needed to upgrade prod yet.  Loading my full dataset (~5.5mln documents) into 1.7.2 and running the same query shows 4/5 shards failing.  response error:   
I can't reproduce it on the sample app. Played around with the sample app's XML, too, to see if it's something in there.  I stripped out my fragment to just the calendar view, removed all decorators, and set options and other views on the screen, and it still does it. Still the same results.

@MorrieAtElastic this is now scheduled to be fixed in 6.4.0 by #32615.

Issue still seems to be present in my case; It's now more noticeable that warping does initially set the correct facing direction initially but then sets the old facing direction immediately after just like you said. I want to say I really appreciate the time you're taking to update your plugin and respond to others (i know this isnt related to the bug lol) but it is very kind :)
Hi Kay,  the comment in the empty else path was only set, to find the element in the exported code. An empty element was also generated, without a comment.  I like your idea, to comment out the empty path, if there is no algorithmic code in the path.  Fine regards Rolf 
Yes, this is the github link I provided above (same link as last issue but you can update the project to get the new module that contains the code)
Only a visual issue. And yes, happens every time I switch orientation. In fact,  I have just noticed it happens directly when I switch from vertical to horizontal.  Is the a lock orientation setting?... 
This is an Oracle database that I have query-only access. I'm glad you brought that up. I quickly tested a couple other scenarios. When I query a .csv file, I do get the filter list. I also get a filter list when I query a slqlite database. Interesting.  I don't see anything in the logs that points to a potential problem, though. Of the three log files (.log, dbeaver_sql_20190924.log, and dbeaver-debug.log), the only one that changed when I ran a simple select * was dbeaver_sql_20190924.log. This is what showed up:   !ENTRY org.jkiss.dbeaver.model 1 920 2019-10-02 10:55:55.607 !MESSAGE SELECT * FROM rtvccoe !SUBENTRY 1 org.jkiss.dbeaver.model 1 0 2019-10-02 10:55:55.610 !MESSAGE SUCCESS [-1]  The other files did not get updated when I ran that query. I'm not saying there isn't something further up in one of the log files, like at initialization, but I'm not seeing it if there is. Admittedly, I only gave the logs a cursory glance to try to find it and I honestly don't know specifically what I'm looking to find.  Let me know what else I can provide. Thanks!
Well I sometimes place a quarry near bedrock to only mine the interesting stuff, such as diamonds and gold. I found this bug by accident.  On the overworld this normally doesn't cause any issues but in the nether one could place a quarry on the bedrock ceiling (near y 127) to get on top of the nether world. 
Yea I'll take it for a spin at some point today
The config file is the same. I think it might have to do with the Mouse Tweaks mod, I think it was mentioned in the log.
Couldn’t find any logs related to this and I think it’s not happening anymore. Closing issue and will come back if It returns. Thanks

Tested ok. 
just tested 0.5.2 with latest Jenkins LTS 2.60.3 on a FreeStyle Project with NodeJS plugin environment: successful!
when app first starts , `  Internal.instance = new Internal() `at  line 131 is called, and then  `return connectionPool.delegate;` at line 141 is called.  After photo gallery windows is shown and returned back, when call is made, neither of previous lines are called.. I also checked if injected version of OkHttpClient is the same and it is..  I also noticed another crash (probably the same reason) during  the call that was made right before activity was destroyed.    It's different error, but probably the same problem, so I guess it's not necessary to create another issue for that... 
Here's how 6.2.4 looked.  I've highlighted over maximize as it makes the bug easier to see.  ![Screenshot-20191125092331-1606x885](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38067056/69528087-82df3080-0f65-11ea-8bae-4e5a59f2e4c3.png)  This might be a SWT bug. 
Sorry for late reply... I was not able to test it yet... Had a long business trip... Will test it soon.... Thanks for working on this issue. .. 
I clear builds by `clean`. And another dependency issue comes up..  I ran the `compile` on parent:    ---  I guess the purge is `dependency:purge-local-repository`. It did success on parent but takes no effect.  Related Maven settings:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/297343/14878498/379cb896-0d24-11e6-85b6-5df30a2820d2.png) 
@JakeWharton  I edited it to 2.5 after the first post. 
@pocmo You're right, it was.  I was running focus 1.0, and for some reason hadn't received the 1.1 update yet. I pulled the new version and it works correctly now.
Hi, Jon.  There is gist: https://gist.github.com/janzar/3698e595d1fb8fa9309c177315a2434f. It contains both log file and application used to generate it. I have changed pushy a little bit:  TokenAuthenticationApnsClientHandler:  long keyShift = 67L * 60L * 1000L; Date issuedAt = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - keyShift); this.authenticationToken = new AuthenticationToken(signingKey, issuedAt);  and removed some fields from log file. Test application works following: once a minute it tries to send a batch of 50 pushes. As I create token with time set to 67 minutes ago, after little more than 3 minutes of creation it expires. So all pushes in first three batches get response, but only fraction in 4th batch (pushes that didn't got response within 40 seconds are canceled by timer) and all again in 5th batch.
Very nice! Thank you @pmwmedia! Yes it works for me as well :) 
Hey..   I haven't tried the fix yet....I'll give it a shot soon.    I'm adding items with `addItem` function without calling `notifyItemInserted` after it. 
When I start the app , I get this warning WARNING: JSF1064: Unable to find or serve resource, css/default/icons.css, from library, bsf.  perhaps it may be a conflict with libraries , I use the library in pom.xml Bootstrap 3.0.2 , plus bootstraps of PrimeFaces and bootfaces . Total 3 libraries bootstraps  I'll fix itentar surely be my problem , thank you, and if I mention I was solved.  **EDIT: I found the .CSS that hide button**: .ui-datepicker-trigger {     display: none; } if I delete that style , shown button and calendaar works perfectly . From: http://localhost:8080/Example/javax.faces.resource/css/default/bsf.css.xhtml?ln=bsf 
@maggiolo00 I do not think that It's not related to the problem, but I'm using OAutomaticBackup and I create index with:    I will make pull request with the fix in couple of minutes when tests will pass.   In fact the problem is very simple: backup is calling OLuceneIndexEngineAbstract.reOpen, it's recreating TrackingIndexWriter but do not flush reopenToken. 
@laa this is server edition, not embedded. By not responding I mean: - It cannot be shutdown with `stop`, the only way is killing the process. - Either from Studio or from applications -after a restart- it responds to a few queries, then it seems to be frozen, no errors logged, no CPU usage, but it won't respond to anything. At this moment I chose to wait for it to shutdown softly, but it's been about 1.5 hours so far. - DB size is 88G  thanks 
Sent a similarly large block of text to Gmail; there's a very slight lag but definitely not as noticeable as in Simplenote. 
Happens every startup, same sequence.  
I'm afraid not. I was actually just speculating that that might fix it, I've never used JSCover before and I didn't know about looping with labels either before I looked into this. If I have time tomorrow and no one else has suggestions I might try to fork the project and fix it there. 
The newest version 7.2.1  
Globally sorted output requires working range partitioning #7  
I tried it on a fresh new Neon, unpacked from a zip.
I'd say it's quite possible .. but I woudln't expect it when you are confirming connection.
Thanks! Amazingly fast work!
Whatever you did fixed it for me, thanks. Nice work on the quick turnaround!
 Thanks for quick response.  There is a prompt before doing any downloading, and after that the data is cached, so it then behaves like any other data frame. This strikes me as the sort of thing active bindings were meant for, but I could be wrong.  Writing R extensions mentions wrapping C pointers and database access as examples. Either could cause problems if done without the users intent.   > On Mar 7, 2019, at 2:38 PM, Kevin Ushey <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > Thanks for the bug report! >  > In the case of active bindings, this causes execution of potentially heavy and interactive code, e.g. asking user if they wish to download data (hiding behind the active binding symbol). >  > This seems like a particularly aggressive use of an active binding; I wouldn't expect an active binding in general to perform heavy computation behind the scenes.

@kantenkugel As per my pom.xml file, 3.7.1_422.   
I have created a simple test project in https://github.com/ismakc/issue1125. It must be executed twice to get the ConcurrentModificationException  The application creates a peristent hsqldb in the target folder. 
Sorry for forgetting about the vital infos: Version is 2013.09.19.  Does the content of the field gets uploaded to GC.com at all when i use the "Bearbeiten" (engl. translation) button, but not the Upload-Button? I only use "Bearbeiten", never upload. So there can't be any remote content, as i would understand it. When i observed this behaviour i was surely not visiting the website. With that lousy GPRS reception out there i would surely remember.   I do not even see a „note“ field on the website for that cache. Is that a premium feature? I never used it.  Some other strange thing: When i just looked at the notes in the app, there was only an "Bearbeiten" button, no more upload. I could edit the note fine, removing the doubled portion of the note. When dismissing the pop-up-edit-box for the note with "OK" now i have two buttons again, Bearbeiten and upload. Does displaying the upload button depend on some condition? May it be connected to the other issue?  I now pressed upload, and it tells me about success, but still no sign of my note anywhere in the listing on GC.com.  Enjoy your holidays! 
From my understanding of what those users reported it does not seem to reappear after restart but only the next refresh after restart solved the problem. For now I asked for a complete list of the custom settings to find out if it is perhaps related to a special combination of settings. Debug log will be difficult, due to the fact that the used devices are all >4.1. 
@orimarco . But Yossi asked me not to assign these issues. 
@busbey I'm using ycsb-0.12.0, the pre-compiled version
I am not really sure how to do that, Unfortunately 
 @kofemann Already sent that to you and Paul last night via mail.... didn't it arrive?
i will try =) 
I just did a test with 2.164. Here is config.xml.diff   [config.xml.diff.log](https://github.com/jenkinsci/amazon-ecs-plugin/files/3061717/config.xml.diff.log) 
I also tested it with 3 commands like this: same results    Gonna temperarly update skript bc i dont like to use the beta's. will give a update to this issue wenn tested.
FYI: Another request with @SammysHP argumentation came in last week on support mail. 
It was. I'd left it set for a default of 0. As soon as I changed it to 1, it exported without error. I also tried the export with Fixed and Compressed, and that exported without a problem as well. Previously it would export both the regular version and the compressed version but had an error anytime the Fix option was included.  Also, for whatever it's worth, yes it happened at exactly that same point: Blue Orb of Dragonkind. Which was at the 98% point (according to the progress wheel) of exporting.  Thank you very much for your time and continued support of such a great tool.
12.0.9
I don't think it's the problem with ram. I think it is has something to do with running codenvy and che on the same docker daemon. When only che or codenvy at any given time I no longer have this issue. Can someone use both che and codenvy on same docker daemon with ws running in each to see if they can reproduce. Is there a clean up routing the che/codenvy runs on containers with certain names? When there is a ws that it does not know about it auto destroys it. There could also be an issue with multiple che or codenvy servers running on same daemon as well.  Example docker container name ` workspace20dk10jiriqw9qu5_machinesgckw3zwlvoo0rh7_admin_dev-machine` and docker image name `eclipse-che/workspace20dk10jiriqw9qu5_machinesgckw3zwlvoo0rh7_admin_dev-machine`
eek! I'd love to, but I'm afraid I don't know how to do that! Happy to if you show me how, otherwise equally I can wait until you fix it, that's not a problem. Cheers.
Hi @davideas  thanks for the quick answer! I can do so next week. But actually, you can simply inspect the code in your example app of FlexibleAdapter. The bug is e.g. visible in the "Header and Sections" example as described above.  Just use an S8 emulator or cloud device and you will see that the "Long Click on X" Toast is not shown on this device. I think this is enough for you to understand what I mean? I don't think posting my code would help you since the bug is apparently not in my code (as it happens in your example app as well).  PS: next week I can try your tip with FlexibleAdapter.enableLogs(...) and possibly be more specific with the bug as well. But I guess you know your code best, so a quick look from your side and confirmation that it's a FlexibleAdapter bug would help for sure
So far, this is the only time I've encountered something like that, yeah.
Oh, sorry, forgot to add forestry_1.12.2-5.8.2.387
Jackson version 2.7.6 (used by Dropwizard 1.0.0).  I can see that work around code in Katharsis for Jackson 2.7 AnnotatedClass builder is being called, but still unless Katharsis itself compiled with 2.7 Jackson it was crashing. Also, at least for me it required to delete Katharsis target folder  in order for this bug to appear  once I started to switch between 2.7 & 2.6. 
It doesnt work. Haxe compiler doesn't find the using without the fully qualified name. StringTools for example works because the fq is the same as the class name.

@aslakhellesoy Nice! I have been a bit busy but I will give it a go tomorrow evening, thanks! 👍 
nevermind I fixed it by swithing to Pex guess group manager is really bugged for 1.11.
I also observed this issue (+- a few seconds wallclock time accuracy with NITZ synchronization). I solved this by implementing an SNTP client using several NTP servers from http://www.pool.ntp.org/en . This way, the accuracy improved to ~50ms at worst, which is good enough i guess. I didn't look into UtcTiming elements so far, maybe that's a better approach. 
No, however that's a good thing. The new behavior is the correct behavior, it was actually wrong in 2.5.0. I mainly created this issue to track the change in case someone else comes across this behavior.  That commit does however fix https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/1525 
@cvance Sorry, it is all info, that i received. I can't reproduce it, it occurred only one time only on that device.
@jsroyal  I am on wheels right now. I will add screenshot later today.
Hi, that's true. I was under the assumption that it was a problem with just my phone. Since some else reported the same problem (see #430) I thought it was best to open a new issue.  I just deinstalled and reinstalled the app. And reconfigured by hand, but still no map.

Ah I'm using Gradle 1.6 because of https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2871. Note that is issue is already open for a year but will be fixed in 2.2 finally :-). But 2.2 will take some time as 2.1 is not yet released. 
For some strange reason the new bug zip didn't get made, I thought this one was it.  It's indeed an old bug zip. If I have this happen again I'll try to make a new one, it's weird that it didn't actually create it. 
Can't use that beta as library, since it's obfuscated ;) \* runs off to get BON working\* heh. I could just set this up properly too... Instead of the lazy way. 
Actually the protocol is in Swift, but this also happened in obj-c.    Actually, now I see that in the MyApi protocol I have methods with no parameters that are working, the difference is that I don't specify the selector there. 
Hello and thank you very much for getting back to me. I tried the 0.9.6 package, but the result is the same. What else could be the catch? 
Yep, same problem using IDs.

1.get more info about [Flutter](https://flutter.cn/) at https://flutter.cn/ ; 2. before:  3.My colleague said that: `Android Studio`-> `Preferences` -> `Languages And ...` -> `Flutter` ->` Editor ` -> `Organise Import on Save`.  is the truly reason.  on Android Studio (Version 3.5.2). but i am not sure. 4.so that the bug is that the Android Studio of different Version performed different. 5.thanks!
My debug method was simple.  I noticed that I was only reading 0 or 1 from the A3-A5 pins (when the input placed on them was high(5V)), so I physically checked the pins and saw that they were pulling the lines low.  The pins were physically low outputs, not high impedance inputs as they should have been.  I began placing a while(1) loop line by line until I found that the inputs stayed high impedance when the loop was placed so that only one output was declared.  I've changed the code, so it works, so I know exactly sure which output it broke on, but it was either pin 0,1, or 2.  On a hunch I moved the output statements above the input statements and tada, it worked.  This was basically the code I had running when it broke.   
Thanks @kevinykuo for the stack trace. I'm running RStudio Server in Docker and was having a hard time getting a terminal attached so that I could run `gdb`.
Scheduling code:   The scheduling method started on the start of the application, I experienced the crash accidentally when starting the application at midnight 00:08. On the other time of the day it's working perfectly fine.   createExtras method is for passing the start and end time for the daily job (since without this, dailyjob does not reschedule for the next day)
Especially the horizontal scrolling is really slow.  [example structorizer2.zip](https://github.com/fesch/Structorizer.Desktop/files/1767487/example.structorizer2.zip) 
Not every time. Its a one time thing for this upcoming update. I've written most of the code and will probably be making the change within the next day or two, so people(me included) will have to click the clear _clear database_ button, and rescan their libraries.  > Also, storing IPs doesn't seem like a good idea from a privacy perspective.  I just did some thinking about this, and you're right. But I still need a way to uniquely link an uploader's computer to the songs they've chosen to share though.   I think I'm going to go with the uploader's MAC Address. That'd uniquely identify the uploader, without compromising their network location.  > And what if multiple people are seeding the same song?  That's not an issue here; The original uploader is the person who creates the .torrent file, no one else can, because song's are unique. When another person clicks play, they're just grabbing the torrent file that the original uploader made. 
Here's the code, but i think that's not problem... http://pastebin.com/sGMLbUd3 
I'm running 1.4.0.2 and yes I have persistent playback control enabled. I'm on my phone so not sure but shouldn't the playback services be started using startForeground() to make it less of a target for killing?

|o|,,,it works now! You are right, I use  `Drawable backgroundDrawable = VectorDrawableCompat.create(getResources(), background, null);`  But also need this in activity `static {     AppCompatDelegate.setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled(true); }` or this way `Drawable drawable = AppCompatResources.getDrawable(mContext, mImageTitleResId);` I have not tried this  Do you want me to commit and review by you?
Unfortunately I'm not able to provide the project since it's private. In my project I have a method like so:    Where the incorrect package name is being generated from the CodaHale project.  I can try to reproduce the issue in a smaller non related project if that would help. 
Yes 'E' and 'EEE' to just show day name in week. Though I'm pretty sure I have had the same working in an earlier version.
Oh dear... Ya know, I hadn't actually tried that, and it seems to have worked. Now I feel incredibly foolish, the possibility completely flew over my head.  It's still a weirdly consistent thing, but much less of a problem than I initially thought then. :0 I tested it, they spawn just fine under every circumstance aside from in their towers, so it's definitely tied to that, and only effecting the evil dudes. If it matters- I have Recurrent complex, dungeon tactics, and ice and fire all, and biomes'o plenty in this current build, all of which fiddle with generation a good bit. 
It does happen on enabling and disabling. But when it happens seem to be random. Sometimes flight mode doesn't change for two or three "loops" of the script, then it works a while again.  Too bad that it can't be fixed easily. I helped myself now by switching mobile data on and off instead of flight mode. Should be a standard Android feature in my opinion, because not being online all the time saves lots of battery power.  BTW: What's the difference between exact and inexact timers? How more exact is the exact timer and is the battery drain much higher?
Right now I have only certificates from our clients so I can't share it. But the problem is with multiple certificates from multiple clients. Thank you  Complete code:

@yegor256 Thanks for explanation about new ticket. It's a bit more clear now. To the exclusion question. 3rd option is good choice, except one thing - transforming regexp from filepath to full classname is very unstable. Example 1: Input - `/src/main/java/com/qulice/maven/CheckMojo` Output - `com.qulice.maven.CheckMojo` Simple enough but how to cut prefix `/src/main/java/`?  Example 2: Input - `.*/.*Messages.java` Output - `~.*\.Messages` and so on ...  Don't think we need such a complexity in our code. To reduce it we may decide to specify exclusions for findbugs as they are for findbugs - per class patterns (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/filter.html). Tan it would be simple to create native findbugs config file using than exclusions. Have I missed something? 
I think this is a rare edge case if you have coordinates resulting in the same node IDs, often different coordinates that snap to the same coordinate on the road resulting in the same tower node (but sometimes also pillar node).
I was using the default, so I assume that's English. I may not be likely to find a zero-width space in many encodings anyway, I am boldly assuming. So changing language may be a no-go altogether.  Can the mapping between Unicode code points and encodings be somehow influenced? I don't think a zero-width space is mapped very well onto a `?` when there is something like a soft hyphen available (and yes, opinions may vary). If the rationale here is that all unmappable characters are shown as `?` can I perhaps configure that last resort somewhere?  I can work around this problem by using soft hyphens, which are actually rendered properly (and keep their function). They may even be more appropriate for my purpose (which is making line break suggestions as to prevent line overflows). However, the soft hyphens appear in TOCs (both FO/PDF and htmlhelp) as regular dashes, which of course, is not what I want. Do you want me to open a new issue for that? 
Yes the issue still exists in the current version.  I solved it by re-implementing the Filter base class. I used a ScheduledExecutorService to periodically execute the polling of the events on the eth client instead of a while(true) loop with a Thread.sleep(). The problem is that by using a fixed ThreadPool and the busy wait approach, the ExecutorService runs out of threads and its queue grows. I suspect that this leads to a complete blocking of the app process in android systems, since it uses too much resources. I attached my implementation of the Filter class. Please note that I only tested this with a few contracts with 3 events each. So far I don't have any problems, but I haven't tested this solution throughly.

i have 2 plugins (MTCore and Annihilation) in annihilation in plugin.yml i have depend: ["MTCore"] so it should be loaded after MTCore and it is. But when server call an event it shoould be called in MTCore first and then in Annihilation and it isn't  
I checked this issue again. Then the plugin worked as expected. Maybe the issue was triggered by another plugin.  I'm so sorry. Close this issue.
The issue is fixed, thanks a lot!
Not 100% sure, but I think it was the following: java -cp aeron-samples/build/libs/samples.jar -Daeron.dir.data=/tmp/aeron/data -Daeron.dir.conductor=/tmp/aeron/conductor -Daeron.sample.channel=udp://224.168.33.11:5000 -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true uk.co.real_logic.aeron.driver.MediaDriver  After one instance, I have never been able to reproduce it. 
Agreed!  I can't explain why it pains me so, but looking at my statistics and seeing how little I've scrobbled this year hurts my heart a little.  Wow, sounds awesome! Yes, I scrobble to both last.fm and libre.fm.  I don't really reference my libre.fm stuff as often since there is less historical data due to me starting to use it much later.  I just like the idea of not having my data owned by last.fm in case they ever become jerks (or get bought out by jerks) and prevent me from accessing it.  Thanks for the quick response and hard work!!! 
Cruuud. I thought it was just me at first, but I talked to someone else who was having the issue, which gave me confidence. Turns out we're both dumb.
Points in the foreground should be connected to each other by short line .But are  connected around the entire earth.

Yes, once I remove FE from the sponge server I can connect through bungee to it 
I think this predates `sealed`, but the enumerated type also has the advantage that where you can see the internal type, it covers the external one, so you can get from the `Decimal` to the `DecimalImpl` without trouble.

Hi!  I'm using Ulbotech protocol in Bin mode because Text format is not working in some of the reason. Text format wasn't working on standard Traccar versions like 3.6 or 3.7   When using text mode, the received commands are not processed on the server side.  It looks strange that by setting command to text mode, the traccar log is still showing it as hex.

I tested the behaviour like this:    See? "Exit code: 2". Wagon gets the exit code, it just handles it wrong. So please improve the plugin, would you? Thank you. The correct behaviour would be to ignore output on standard error and look at the exit code instead. This is true both on Linux and Windows. It is the canonic way to handle errors in shell scripts or other executables. 
I play a few turns until such time as there is a Dread Return & Balustrade Spy in the graveyard. I sacrifice three creatures to bring back Balustrade Spy, select myself as target, then click through the stack until Balustrade Spy is meant to reveal all cards in my library before putting them in my graveyard.  I can't attach the deck to this post. It was easily reproducible here until the recent Mac OSX issue (server crash). 
@snicoll Actually I just encountered the exception when learning Jersey :-) 
This is using the java sdk AuthAPI.signUp(...) method. In debugger I can see the following: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29469591/48803389-a4b43f00-ed76-11e8-91fa-a59644bcd3e4.png)  you can see that "user_id" in response body does not match the CreatedUser expected "_id".
oh yes, i'm using an ancient version of BossBarAPI.  1.0.6.  I'll update and report back.

I have tested the new binding from build #598.  So far I stumble upon two minor issues.  ### First sub-issue  **Usecase** The dimmed light according to config above is set to 93%. I want to INCREASE further to 100% by clicking the "up" arrow in the webgui which will send a INCREASE command. **Error** The set value goes out of scope (0-100) and throws an exception. The _big question_ is how the tellstickbinding follow the "Binding" framework or if its wrong implemented. Should the binding automatic adjust the value to 100% or should the eventbus resend a new 100% command? @teichsta Any comment?  An identical problem exist on the lower half. Eg. I have the lamp set to 4% and try to decrease it which will throw the same error.    ### Second sub-issue  **Usecase** I want to configure the light level with the down and up buttons in the web GUI. I have a dimmed device which got an "ON" state change to the eventbus. openHAB dosent know which level the device is on for sure due the wide nature of dimmer type to tellstick. BUT probably the dimmed device have a high dim level rather then a low.   **Today's implementation** When pushing the down button the value goes to 0. When pushing the up button values goes to 9. (0 + 9). The values start on zero in other word.  **My new proposal** To me its more natural to start on max and modify it from there due many dimmers will be on max when state is ON. Down button will start on 100 - 9 = 91. Up button will start on 100.  @teichsta, what is the best practise and design principles for openHAB? 
Thanks for your reply! I am using openstack4j-core-2.0.2-SNAPSHOT. Below are the function calls.     Thanks Taj 
After I input the command and clicked enter, there is no output.I waited for just 5 minutes, then got the warn message that the NFS was full.I had to kill the snapshot process.In the ES log,there is only "no disk free,snapshot failed".The log level is INFO.This is our production environment.I tested snapshot in our test environment,there is no problem. But our production environment and test environment is different. Is it possible because of the environment? what circumstances the snapshot did not consider the index name? 
My task successfully passed all test and checking two QA engineers. The mistake was disclosed only after deploy on production server. 
I'll have to give it a test in a clean environment later tonight. My production environment is quite heavy.
Those are new migrations...  I checked out the source code and added a system.out.println of "installed rank + version" of all migrations, before and after Collections.sort()  (in MigrationInfoServiceImpl#mergeAvailableAndAppliedMigrations)  Sorry for the confusion :-)

Feel free to take a stab at it, I'm just collecting the issues right now.
I agree with @abhinayagarwal that it is the easiest if we open the Devoxx conferences by default whenever the conference selector view is shown.
> Did you try restarting the bundle with the old version after removing the thing? Is this working?  I haven't tried that directly, but I will.  The only way I've found so far to clear it is to restart openHAB. I assume that's because the thing isn't in the jsondb, and so a fresh start of the systems clears out any internal knowledge that the thing exists. 
The robot need to have a valid task it can take on then it will hang my specific experience was with the delivery robot but some one reported a similar issue with lumberjack robots 
asteroidConfig: https://pastebin.com/BpetYn9g (not a minimal one required to reproduce, will try to provide one later today) It loaded properly I think, all ores added are showing up properly. (mods used: ProjectRed, Immersive Engineering, NuclearCraft, Thermal Expansion)  Regarding lag: yup, thought about that, but every other block around was breaking properly and I was getting drops immediately. Only observatory blocks were doing this.  As a side note: could you make GUI wider, so full asteroid names are showing up? GUI occupies a very small percentage of my screen now...  G.
Unfortunately it looks like i can't. for some reason the multiblock won't form (register) in creative and my normale world wont load i keep getting this error "The state engine was in incorrect state SERVER_STOPPING and forced into state SERVER_STOPPED. Errors may have been discarded." if you have any idea how to resolve this issue it would be welcome but i have no way off knowing if its related.  what i was observing though for the initial issue is as the item started arriving the first item would comes passe the stack test and start smelting then an other item would add to the stack but doesn't look like it takes the test. when the stack reaches 16 it keeps smelting. i noticed this because it recipes would never complete when using refined storage and even adding the ressources manually id not get the number of items i'd expect.
@essiembre , Merry Christmas.  It was not extracted at all. here are my configuration file. by the way, I am trying to use HtmlUnit to handle with javascript/ajax things, it works well for some of pages, but does not work for others, unstable.   
I was trying with 2.3.4.  After working around #1150 (by calling getAccessControlExposeHeaders() once before calling setAccessControlExposeHeaders()) I was setting "ETag" as an exposed header.  However, in the browser, the ETag wasn't visible and looking at the HTTP response I found that Access-Control-Expose-Headers was not present in the web server responses.  I put it down to the lack of an appropriate call in HeaderUtils.addResponseHeaders.  Looking at what I think is still current (https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/blob/master/modules/org.restlet/src/org/restlet/engine/header/HeaderUtils.java) I don't see anything to set the HttpResponse header for the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header .  I'd expect to see something like the same code as for the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header. 
Yes I rebooted. hmm since there are lots of other users I think it might be a problem... I am back to 2.0.25 and imported settings from 2.0.27 and Accounts work great. I asked at XDA if someone can provide a catlog... 
Yes, I just did. Still doesn't work.   Now using the latest EssentialsX version (not the one before).  /ess version: https://gyazo.com/8e16bc7c42712209e7e9c185e1b28f26  Also, it's somewhat unrelated but it is still regarding sign shops: Oak sapling, birch sapling, acacia sapling, jungle sapling, and dark oak sapling buy & sell signs are broken. The buy signs will take money but not give any items. The only sapling signs that work are spruce  Sapling Sign Setups: https://gyazo.com/c3d6cd6b03b532ede9b5af7729fbcc27 https://gyazo.com/e7b90a4e8adb96c70068268834b6f895  Edit: When I try to sell saplings it says "Error: You do not have 4x potted_dark_oak_sapling." so the issue is with potted vs normal saplings.  Edit 2: /i OakSapling, for example, doesn't work either.  Edit 3: /i Oak_Sapling works though and Oak_Sapling on the shop sign.

Thanks for replying.   I added the snapshot repo to my pom and included the following dependency:    It looks like the update hits the generic `/sys/renew` endpoint with the lease id as payload. This has resolved our issue. Thanks again.
Some of your latest updates broke it.

This bug killed all people on the map... Now, I have MultiWorld, everything is fine. 
Thanks for the quick reply! And ha, I figured you'd ask! We definitely want to use the 'native' options in Unirest over a custom client if we can. As far as I can recall, when we last looked at doing this, there were several options that Unirest didn't support. Below I've done my best to recall the options we need and look up their current support status, but there may be one or two I'm missing. Feel free to correct me on the support status as needed.  - User agent string: Supported via `setDefaultHeader()` or `addDefaultHeader()` - Connect timeout: Supported via `connectTimeout()` - Socket timeout: Supported via `socketTimeout()` - Max connections: Supported via `concurrency()` - Max connections per route: Supported via `concurrency()` - Disable redirect handling: Supported via `followRedirects()` - Redirect strategy: Unsupported (although this may not be needed) - Allow use of Java system properties: Supported via `useSystemProperties()` - Disable TLS validation: Supported via `verifySsl()` (looks like the Unirest implementation *may* work, but we'll need to test)  We also explicitly define a default `SocketConfig` with the socket timeout we want (in addition to the default `RequestConfig`) due to some historical bugs in the HTTP client library. I suppose we could reassess if this is needed, but I know it was an issue in the past.  Overall, it's looking like much of what we need is covered by Unirest. So I think I'll give it a spin and test things out!

This is the code i am using.   PDFParser parser; File file = new File(sdcard,"ac123002.pdf"); FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(file); parser = new PDFParser(fin);  I am getting exception in this PDFParser constructor 
In the case of our own code and our own tests, we already use `doPrivileged` in any locations which I'm aware of. But even if we weren't, we give our own code permission to read any system property.  Actually, we give JUnit the permission to read any system property as well, but _because it isn't using `doPrivileged`_, callers further down the stack get checked as well, and apparently no matter what we put into the security policy, those ones can't be marked as trusted.  We use the security manager to stop code (both libraries and our own code (since this is a testing framework, it seems reasonable to get extra checking for free where possible!) doing various things we don't want them to do, but mostly to stop them writing data outside of where we tell them to or exiting the JVM (yeah, it has actually happened before...) The former could theoretically be done by writing a custom NIO2 filesystem which wraps the real filesystem, but it would be a lot of work to make it support absolutely everything the real one supports. The latter is impossible to do any other way, at least as far as I am aware. 
I also added the legacy permission (authme.unregister false) to try and see if it was because of this.  About the debug perm:  https://i.imgur.com/gUg225e.png  The perm is negated in the default group (and the player was in the default group).  Do you think this is a bug with LuckPerms?  Thanks.
It's using TS 2.0.5, NetBeans 8.2 on Windows 7 x64.  Will try the updated build at work tomorrow :-) 
currently using the latest agricraft that is 1.3.1 and forge is 1291 that is latest recommended 
@krusche navigating back and reloading the page did not solve the problem when it occured, however, since i had the issue i closed safari and reopened a new one and when i go to artemis now it is displayed just fine!
Could also not reproduce with current Vaadin version... 8.5.1 seems to fix that issue!
you'r right. we fixed this problem. there is something wrong with plugins. the quality of these plugins is uneven.  we found there is bug in `springmvc` plugin. here the infos:  plugin: `apm-springmvc-annotation-commons`  package:   `org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.spring.mvc.commons.interceptor`  class: `AbstractMethodInterceptor` method: `afterMethod` line: `104`    this statement  `ContextManager.stopSpan();` may not execute, then this problem will be be triggered.  `ContextManager.stopSpan();` is very important, We think the plugin‘s author did not understand the meaning of this sentence.  we will send `pull request` soon
You were right. Sorry for bothering. 
By smallest entity do you mean when the stack is below the configured minimum stack amount?
> I did not have this problem on devices Android 7.0 (Samsung S6) and Android 9 (samsung Note 8).  Really? Also from cache details Navigation menu, not only from cache list?
I haven't try yet. I'll see if I have time tonight.
Yes, I read on the description about the entity desync issue, but it happened with player entities. I'm going to do this test in few hours because I just restarted the server (I wasn't expecting a fast reply :P)  > Which version of KCauldron are you running? > 1.7.10-1614.199 
Thank you - deinstall and cleaning helps. Now it works. 
It fails to splash damage. I was able to reproduce it by having a group of zombies, and attacking one with a sweeping edge sword.
The test case below succeeds with 1.5.0, but fails with 1.5.1, with the same error.  
 
As far as I can tell it's ECDSA key serialization when NSS is enabled.

> How exactry did you launch Baritone (which doesn't support forge after 1.12.2) on minecraft forge 1.14.4 ? It seems to be the reason it crashed to be exact. You need to be running Fabric for baritone to work on 1.14.4.  I used this, https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/issues/797. I used to use this on Windows, but as soon as I used it on Ubuntu 19.10. It no longer works and crashes like above. I can confirm that it still works on Windows 10 as I dual boot. Also can you now run Baritone on Fabric?
I said, /timedmessage list. That's the actual command. And I don't see how FastCraft would be causing an issue here since it's related to ChatComponentTranslation, and it crashes the client. 
Ok i'm sorry, i need to clarify this issue, apparently.  It's not that /back isn't doing the correct thing, it is?  What's doing the wrong thing is the respawn location when you have backondeath permission.  I'm being told the respawn location after death is somewhat random?  Not sure why that would be  https://pastebin.com/J8bzr7Yu  My recent experience has been to respawn in the last location I had tped to before I'd died last instead of the death location, that... is not very helpful.  I don't know if my configuration needs to be updated for changes in a later build to deal with a change or what.   Death doesn't have to happen, I'm having similar issues just logging back on... and being taken back to the last place I tped to instead of the place I logged out from.  This didn't used to happen so... thinking it may be a recent thing.

Sure, Should I attach the XML files too? Another thing, is there any significant difference between using CvHaarClassifierCascade and CascadeClassifier? Would that help?  The minimal code that crashes sometimes...   Until now I can't replicate the sudden crash error. This causes other errors, though. Like having, for example, 3 detections but the int and double buffers have only one place allocated.   Edit 3: If I include any flag, the app crashes even faster. 
Forgot to check that, yeah it does. How can it do that on runelite and mobile, but not on the vanilla client? 
yes 
This is how the screen is displayed when each video starts. <a href=https://zapodaj.net/bc8501b7b9c8b.jpg.html>IMG_20191013_143458.jpg</a> Previously, in previous versions of the application up to 157, there was only a black background with the words "loading ..." Would there be an option to restore the black background with the inscription?  The second issue concerns separate channels, actually banners, which are placed at the very top of the selected channel. These banners are not legible, they have large pixels and squares.

I believe this was due to a race condition in obtaining the address of the TdiEvaluate function and has been fixed.
Thanks for the pointer.
I compile the plugin yesterday about #83. 
>> Would you like to try adding that in a PR?  I  would love to, but I am swamped - I barely had enough time to diagnose this problem. Furthermore, I am not sure how the new method that handles it should behave:  * Should it store the data ? * If so - where ? how ? when will it be read ? (I did not check if S3Browser asks for it...)
@J-N-K Markus wrote "For Maven + Bnd on openhab2-addons it is already enabled." So it should work, shouldn't it? I'm not using a patched core for "openhab2-addons", no
In the underground structure that looks like that included photo. If you use the block breaker from actually additions to break the respawning ore block it will collect the ore into the actually additions block breaker inventory and it still drops the same ore onto the ground. So you get 2x the amount from the structure  Not sure if that is sufficiently explained now, maybe dupe bug is the wrong term. 
  Looks like its not actually finding the component node? 
The expected behavior is that it would give mouse_drag events for the button that's being held down. However, what's happening is that I drag one mouse button, drag/release another, and it will give me drag events for the latter instead of the former. That's the issue here.
@timtay-microsoft Yes, messages are delivered correctly to the HUB. Only thing was it was not showing it on the metrics for storage but when i dug deep into the Db directly,i could see those messages. **But sometimes it goes to infinite loop and i couldnot see those messages in the HUB then**  Protocol: MQTT Authentication: x509  Apologies,I couldnot check the logs on using the different protocol but yes, will surely do when time permits.

Hi @kim-vde , I have replied you privately over the email.
No, I did not export the override. When launching the server in standalone mode, the changed settings are considered (cfr the options on the command line).  When I export the env variable, then indeed the distributed server process starts with the changed heap settings:   -> please fix this incorrect behaviour.
I have  Eclipse Juno, version 4.2.2. And yes, I meant right-click, sorry ;-). 
  etc etc etc
Yep. I fixed my my code so that I send the request in a listener plugged on the handshake future but still get this `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException`. 
We are running tests right now.. but in fact that it is quite "random" for us, (because we are not familiar with Jetty's guts) it will take a while confirming the fix.  Then we will manage the PR.
It looks like there is a different problem. I was trying to put together a PR to fix the line length and I realized what @svilenvul mentioned - line length is not one of the checks in the rules.xml.  So digging into this some more, I found that the rules.xml is not being used at all. Instead, Checkstyle is executing sun_checks.xml (appears to be the default). It looks like the settings from the plugin are not executing, but the the goals are - it runs Checkstyle, FindBugs, and PMD.   Because the properties are not being used, it is dropping the checkstyle-result.xml in target/ rather than target/code-analysis/ so the merge fails and report.html is zero bytes. If I manually copy the checkstyle-result.xml to the code-analysis folder and run again without 'clean' it will generate the report, but it is of course using the default rules.  Originally I was executing as 
@eivantsov I am not able to constantly reproduce this issue. I will keep trying and report my findings here.   seems like `/instance/data/workspaces/{{ws-name}}/{{project_name}}/.git/refs/remotes` was missing. Also the remotes where missing from `/instance/data/workspaces/{{ws-name}}/{{project_name}}/.git/config` as well.   My local branches remained intact however
This error happens in both 0.7.0 and 0.7.1.
Yeah, sorry I think I figured it out. I believe it was a bug with how ae2stuff and ae handles channeling (I was using fluid storage buses and fluid export buses) where they were not connected causing the reactor to run through it reserves and ae not supplying anything to it. Sorry to bother you ;(, great work on the mod!
@cmoesel Thanks for the catch! I ran the cql-to-elm translator with the valid Time construct and it is generating the elm properly as expected. I picked the ToString example from CQL spec[1] and it has the invalid format.  [1] https://cql.hl7.org/09-b-cqlreference.html#tostring
Yea just checked it seems to be happening on all three whats causing this?

ok, i make little video..  
Preliminary judgment is that it may be due to the blockage of storm threads that lead to unsuccessful assignment. I am writing a separate test case to verify it.
Hey @joeatwork ,  Sorry for the slow reply, it has been busy around here.  Here's the answers to your questions: - On device.  We've tested on the Moto X and Nexus 5 (both Lollipop) and saw the problem.  It doesn't happen on our LG G3 or Htc One (KitKat & Jellybean). - I added that metadata and the problem stayed. - Yes, we had 5 codeless events.  I removed them all, deployed, and tried again.  The problem still remained. - The whole app appears slower.  It appears to be most obvious when a re-layout happens (such as the height animation).  But it is also super noticeable by simply calling getActionBar().hide() as well as other places in the app. - Downgrading wasn't entirely straightforward, I'm guessing the API must have changed since then.  So I gave up trying. - Actually, I'm able to reproduce this without tracking anything.  After removing every single event in the app, I still see the lag.  If I remove the initialize call it disappears completely.  Thanks for looking into this. Brad 
Well, there's a button to snap/unsnap when drawing templates, left to the rubber icon. I assumed it was there for a reason.   For the same reason you would unsnap a token you may want to unsnap a template ( a cone of cold that originates from an unsnapped token for instance).  
Hi Michael,   I don't think Lucene 4.x would work here, the error message indicates:  `This version of Lucene only supports indexes created with release 5.0 and later.`  Since this would prevail any further Lucene updates after Lucene 4.x, if you can write a better unit test, I think this is the best way to go (but with the more work for you :s)  Christophe 
The initial install on my G3 was early to mid January while my Tab 2 install was very recent so that could explain the difference; those higher rookie teams may not have been available when i initially installed.  I understand the need to minimize the server load and data traffic. Unfortunately for me this has resulted in incomplete data.  When I check the Team list for 5000-5999 I find I have a gap in my data.  I see team 5573 followed immediately by 5785 (The Shield).  5785 only appears because I explicitly opened them from the Rookie All-star award at some regional while testing my bug report.  The typical expectation for a "refresh" action is that the app will get new data and update existing data.  If the refresh action from the team view (not the event teams list) isn't going to make sure I get all the currently known teams then perhaps it should removed to avoid user confusion.  I will try flushing the app data and reinstalling after this weekend is over to see if that resolves this issue. 
> Can you describe these pages? There is no new config page in the app, so this happens in the   browser? Does this mean that the browser does not open the app, but redirects to another page?

@wu-sheng Because `registerConcurrencyStrategy` does not allow registration when there is already an implementation, so it must be reset before registration.  
Issue Resolved: Apologies, I should have specified that I am also using the wonderful STOMP client on top of the OKHttp3Client websockets: https://github.com/NaikSoftware/StompProtocolAndroid by Nickolay Savchenko (Nickolay Savchenko NaikSoftware). This library does an exceptional job of implementing the STOMP protocol integrated with OKHttp3 websockets.  This is where I fell short by using the wrong StompClient.over method to provide my url, which will create a default websocket instance that has a default socket read timeout (30 seconds ?). The  solution for me was to use the alternative StompClient.over method, allowing for a reference to an application instance of the OKHttp3Client. This allows the application set it's desired timeouts beyond any defaults.  Thank you to all of you who did try to assist me.

Yes, it works nicely now. 
The overall number of assigned block ids was not significantly higher, probably even under 100. Although at first I thought of the overflow issue, the number of allocated blocks was way to low for it..

I'm just trying to figure out how to filter and export logcat from android studio (any pointers?).   In the meantime, here are the memory stats.   First numbers are before the reboot. The second ones are after the reboot before starting ST. The difference seems to be the "data" entry. After restarting ST (and generating new keys) the numbers are back to their first values.

Hi Arnaud, seems to work. ;)  I will close the issue after some more testing.  It would be awesome if this library would support material transitions (content transitions) for non support v4 fragments. But that's probably too much to ask. :>  Thanks anyway for the library. Mark

I can't update Buildcraft for now, will do soon (probably tonight or tomorrow). But I did investigate a little more on this issue.  Using TickProfiler and LagGoggles I was able to understand a little bit more TickProfiler. So I think the "70,000" number, isn't the number of pipes but the usage in µS/tick.  I didn't reboot the server since yesterday and I came to this results:     </details>  It seems that _TilePipeHolder_ is using up to 58% of the total consumption.  (Note that I may be wrong, of all these interpretations, this is the first time I handle a server... So I'm still learning :') )  
I don't know how to get all logs. But in the material-design-demo if i go to the https://gwtmaterialdesign.github.io/gwt-material-demo/#splitpanel , then link Subheader and then link Split Panel, the function onReveal() don't work and title is "Subheader". ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2050606/24348597/e96b118c-12e4-11e7-8e58-4d81f94ba03e.png) 
I didn't look at how the card is implemented but the important thing is, that when moving -1/-1 counters from ones own creatures onto enemy ones, they aren't affected. Maybe this has something to do with ownership of tokens? But that's just speculation as i don't know the implementation like i said. 
As always, thanks for the quick response and detailed information for a fix. 👍 I will try this out as well and give feedback again. 
Hey @lorthirk, No, I closed all other browsers with Kapua and Kura.  Then I deleted all docker images, volumes and containers (docker system prune -a). After that I pull the latest develop, built it and deployed docker containers. Went straight to Safari and logged in - and this was the reuslt.  After that I tried to login within Firefox, Chrome and Opera - and everything worked OK.   Can you check this as you have Safari on your machine?  
@amirzaidi It's a 8-inch Galaxy Tab S2, I don't have the tablet with me now, I can send a screenshot on Monday. However on that device the app drawer background is light blue and the grey icon labels become unreadable on that background color.
it works,thank you.
I am having the same issue running on v1.4.0 on both device (Nexus 5X and Google Pixel). Since this is a fork from Google Camera View, I run the demo app [Google CameraView](https://github.com/google/cameraview) and it doesn't seem to have the above orientation issue. I am wondering what could have caused the issue.
@mbogoevici 1.2.0
As far as I can tell it was to mirror the change in spring-projects/spring-session#1308. The problem there was that they use a `OncePerRequestFilter` to wrap the request object and set a request attribute. Later code, when it saw the request attribute assumed the request was wrapped, but it wasn't, since an ERROR dispatch needs to be done with the original request and response objects. In this way an ERROR dispatch differs most significantly from a FORWARD dispatch.
Although all builds work even for me, I have the unit tests ignoring this error essentially.  The stack trace is sent out to the log.

Unfortunately I do not have a Dropbox account. What other ways can I get this file to you?  Also I did load the world and walked to those chunks. They are perfectly normal in-game and I can do whatever I please within them. 
@overheadhunter, I have Win 10 64 bit.  There are several files, Which file should I download and install?  
@serge-rider Perfect job! I've already seen the new source code and I'll check it as soon as I back to office next Monday. 
I am using the latest code from the master branch. And I also tried it on Ubuntu, got the same error. 
@E3V3A, in fact, in "Network Information" it shows my Provider under "Network Name", but strangely under "SIM Information" it doesn't show my "Opertator Name". Same is the case with the phone of one of my friends using an HTC Desire X. Just to make sure I'm not reporting a false positive: What does you "Operator Name" show? And what **should** be shown there (examples, please)? 
Hi @peterbae, I think we're happy working around the issue with another authentication method until the MSI fix is on the mainline release.  Many thanks for looking into this issue!
We encounter this issue already since around 15/Nov/17 all the time in a gateway which is permanently performing lifecycle-tests, so there is a chance that indeed a matching StorageService component is not available at that point in time when the `stream()` call is made, which in turn is called indirectly by the `AutomaticInboxProcessor` activator method. But it might also be the case that the StorageService is present, but its `.getValues()` returns `null` - trying to gain access to that information, also to which storage provider is used. The commit ID the ESH bundles are based upon should be 6d32c35f934b6b5a627cc4a32ff91564902bdc2a
Already did (saw that too) and it didn't help.  I also tried going to 0.8.0 and saw a similar problem. There I received a "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no nd4jcuda in java.library.path" and this was solved by adding the location of nd4jcuda explicity in -Djava.library.path.  Since 0.7.2 works without a hitch, there are likely changes to how dependencies are loaded from v0.7.2 -> 0.8.0 -> 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT.

I retried and it did not crash. Now I'm wondering what may have caused that.
a pre-processor would rock - even if they're evil.  I want something similar to:    The dep would prob be handled by a profile: if default profile, go with standard artifact - otherwise use the debug-classified (!) artifact. 
@joshiste during our CICD process, we have a phase where we run the app as a non web app on a random port. This is causing failure due to above exception.
I would like to create UDF that takes array as an input and return another array. As far as I understand based on https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/udf.html#supported-types there should be a support for a List interface as a return value from UDF.  Regarding usecases, I would like to transform data. For example let's  assume that there is a stream/table that contains fields/column with array of numbers. I would like to create UDF to get only even values and write them to a different stream/table.  PLAYERS_DATA:  Player_ID | Points ------------ | ------------- 00001 | [1, 7, 13, 2] 00002 | [135, 6, 4] 00003 | [12, 6, 9]  I would like to be able to run the following querry with GET_EVEN UDF to transform data: SELECT Player_ID, GET_EVEN(Points) as EvenPoints FROM PLAYERS_DATA and receive the following result:  Player_ID | EvenPoints ------------ | ------------- 00001 | [2] 00002 | [6, 4] 00003 | [12, 6]  The other usecases that are important for me are: - sorting values  Initial values | Transformed ------------ | ------------- [0, 5, 4] | [0, 4, 5] [0, 100, 1, 10] | [0, 1, 10, 100] - normalizing values  Initial values | Transformed ------------ | ------------- [0, 2, 4] | [0, 0.5, 1] [0, 100, 1] | [0, 1, 0.01] - removing duplicates - get all values for a given percentile etc...  Please let me know if you need further details.

Yes, I just caught a Ditto!
The event is only cancelled if the correct conditions are met. 
Alright, will do, has been a while since I have been doing these things so I forgot that I should isolate the problem first with any client side graphical mods :P Thanks, I will remove them one by one and see when it stops occurring.  EDIT: Oh, and it's not Smoothfont, I removed that first because I suspected it, didn't make a difference. So either XRAY or ClientTweaks, will see :)  EDIT 2: Apparently, it's neither, I think it may be PortalGun but in order for me to continue investigating, I will need to play Singleplayer and not Multiplayer. I will come back once I have more information.
Any help appreciated. :)
Yes, when I launch GAMA and when I close simulation mode: so two occasions.
@sbrannen   1. I'm basically doing this:    2. I do have `@TestInstance(PER_CLASS)` on some of my inner test classes because of my usage of `ParameterizedTest` and `MethodSource` ([more info](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-perform-a-productive-testing-by-using-junit)). All the other test classes (that do not have this annotation) fail too, though.  3. Sorry, it's proprietary, but I can make minimal examples out of it, if you'd need it.  PS: thanks for `@ResourceLock`! Unfortunately the repo I'm having this error in is all about testing our API, so all the tests are using REST Docs and this would probably nullify the choice to parallelize :)
I am using the master of [that repo](https://github.com/erperejildo/cordova-plugin-preview-camera)
Ok it fixed after update new version.  Thank. 
That was the URL used - apologies I shortened it in the issue text.  On our status call today you mentioned an issue with security enabled. I do have security enabled, so that could be the reason. Happy to test a fix
Thank you, this workaround works for me. 
1188 - I thought I cleared up everything but I'll have another look tomorrow evening. I was working on a game generated in that version.  Sequence was basic crafting table, using great maple logs to make boards and used same to upgrade table. Any attempt to then re-enter the table interface generated the dump.   Not sure what I still had on the table as I can't get the interface. 
The app works in all mobile browsers and apk built with targetSDKVersion < 26, but this obviously can't be released to the Play Store. I'll have to create an example app, leave it with me
They are `javax.naming` classes. Adding    So it looks like the issues are slightly different, but similar. 
I took a look at the logs in the mail server (hMailServer), and there is a clear difference between the dummy message and the alert message. I'm not an expert in mail servers or the process by which they manage messages, but it looks like the following is happening. - graylog2 requests to send mail - the mail server creates a session - graylog2 sends EHLO and authenticates - the mail server checks the FROM and TO - graylog2 communicates parts of the message back and forth with the mail server - the mail server logs "SENT: 221 goodbye" then ends the session - the message is then written to disk and a session with the SMTP Deliverer is started relaying the message via gmail - after being sent, the message is deleted from the disk  When a real message (non-DummyAlert) is sent, the session between the mail server and graylog2 gets interrupted. The "SENT: xxx goodbye" message is never logged. Below is the logging,although it isn't very revealing.    I have been able to line up the last `SENT: 354 OK, send.` message with the Java exception. There are no errors in the hMailServer log at all. 
Unfortunately our project is currently incompatible with spring-vault-core v2.x.x. This is because of _spring-vault-core_'s dependency on _springframework_ v5.1.0.RELEASE (or higher). Our project relies on a lower version, and upgrading would take a large level of effort.  I also tried to run using v2.1.0.RELEASE, and couldn't due to missing classes only found in spring framework v5 & up

The spaulders do not go into the slot, and I can load the world again. Seems like they disappear afterwards sometimes. 
Hi, thanks for the quick response. I just tried it with the `3.0.0` branch and the issue seems fixed. 👍 
@leszko, thanks for the reply to issue. No, i have not prepared solution yet and continue to use eureka-client.properties instead, but it is not very flexible for me, that's why your fix help will be much appreciated.  
No, I can't reschedule the check, since it's handled internally by Vanilla Minecraft, not the CommandAPI. I've done some testing with Vault and I've managed to get a working solution! I'm currently just polishing it off and running my final tests.  -----  To be honest, if you're using a permission system, most of the time you've probably got Vault installed for compatibility with every other plugin.
Yep And my web server is IIS too (like in #104).  Also, a special char in the filename does the same trouble. 
@rainersigwald Here's the additional lines when I turned on EnableLog:  
There are two issues: 1) When a project admin (who are not system administrators) is redirected to the system Administration page when they aren't authorized to be at that page, it is a potential security issue. 2) If the plugin only supports system administration configuration and repository level configuration, why is there a link at the project level?

We could certainly add a way of changing or disabling this feature. What is your setup?  I see. I'm using vscode. Is ghidra telling Eclipse to disable the timeout or does Eclipse do it automatically? If it's the latter then I'll report this to [vscode-java-test](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-java-test)  If it's an eclipse setting then it may be available for me to change since vscode-java is using eclipse jdt.ls.
 Thanks for response.  I am using android-ndk-r14b/  I don't think this is include path related.  Even the clang tool which is used seems to be wrong when going through android_library (using external/local_config_cc/wrapped_clang rather than external/android_ndk/ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/clang).  Note in bazelrc I am using --android_crosstool_top=@android_ndk//:toolchain-libcpp rather than blanket --crosstool_top=//external:android/crosstool.  If I build through android_binary rather than android_library things work well.  Also need to explicitly add lib path --linkopt=-Lexternal/android_ndk/ndk/sources/cxx-stl/llvm-libc++/libs/armeabi-v7a to build. (This is on top of include file workaround mentioned in #3923)

No, I don't have any specific use case in my mind till now. Now I see it's specially designed for standard Users only.  But should it be marked to the manager ? Because in that case manager users have much more permission than manager. Manager can't send/create commands if nothing is assigned to him but end users can. Isn't it a flow in the design of the system from the programming perspective? I think manager always have limit commands disabled.  What's your opinion? 
Version of the runner is 2.4.1 and version of SonarQube is 6.0.   I have a feeling I need to update the runner and see how I go.

On my emulator I am only doing fresh installations and there it works.  The problem is that the column is also added in db scheme 16 (with createSyncedFoldersTable).

Step 1: I have setup an AEM project using information available at https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/lazybones-aem-templates Step 2: Added another content project module to hold initial "authored content" , which is actually packaging and deploying content to "/content"  Step 3:  this project is "develop" branch of my git repo and there is lots of merges already happened . Step 4: Nothing pops out from filter.xml for either of the content projects   Please let me know if you want more details .

Well I've changed my image loading library for that part of the project. I tried to reproduce it in a sample project and found out a similar problem. I created two activites. First one has a button to start the second one. In the second activity I've the image view with the circular reveal animation. When I start the second activity for the first time, it works fine. But when I press back and start the activity again the image view stays invisible until the animation ends, and just flashes and became visible. Here is the sample code;   
Not possible, only that "extended standby" option is available.  I always have a few 'essential' apps running on background and they never stop doing their job with the screen off, but Chibe seems to stop working after screen off/lock, when I turn the screen on it starts working again. Similar 'alarm clock' apps always work...  e.g. Set Chibe hourly (i.e. next should be 5 PM) then alarm app to 5:05PM, Chibe fails, alarm app works.  Maybe you missed something to wake up the device?  Anyway, I gonna retest this tomorrow, well today, later!
Simple JAX-RS project: [compressionTest.zip](https://github.com/payara/Payara/files/599566/compressionTest.zip)  JMeter config file to reproduce error: [compressionTestJMeter.zip](https://github.com/payara/Payara/files/599570/compressionTestJMeter.zip) 
I could not recreate this.  I tried a new world, same seed, with Beta 3, ran around and found five villages all as they should be.  The only thing I can figure is that when I got your mod and added it to my world, the current villages were devoid of villagers.  New villages were fine, the others were all empty.  Not killed off, as I started that world the day before, not enough time, only day 3.  So I started a new world, with the same seed, and the same name, but I deleted the old game from the client.  Deleted the old worlds, started again, same seed, Beta 3, completely different world name, no issues.  All villages I had investigated are there.  Could there have been an artifact in the game that associated the old save with the new world?  I assume I can avoid that by not using the same world name.   I assume it had something to do with the names of the worlds being the same.  I know little about mods, but it seems logical to me.  Interesting mod, thanks for developing it.  Glad to be of help, even if it appears to be a rare issue.  Cheers!
Sorry for the late response though we were busy releasing new versions of our software and fixing the mess after updating plenty of external dependencies.   We updated the client configuration of the Pub/Sub command handler to throw away any incoming (or left over) commands while Redis is currently down as the commands aren't the most important stuff in the application anyway. We've therefore added the following lines to the configuration:    though we have to test it again and see if it fixes the issue. I hope I'll find time tomorrow.  Regarding your question of the object root for the majority of `KeyArgument` instances, we can send you the complete heap dump if you like. In that case we'd prefer some secure channel to exchange the file as the heapdump contains some sensitive data even though it contains only development related credentials.

It's hard to say, the issue before seemed to be when one of these lands re-entered the battlefield for a second time in a game. Now I'm not sure what the problem is.
The files that are looked for are configured [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/0611eb49c87f367d3e34a1a3bcf04eb70150d180/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/logging/log4j2/Log4J2LoggingSystem.java#L113). Note that it will be important to consider `.properties` file in the same order as [Log4j2 normally uses](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#AutomaticConfiguration), i.e. they should be considered first. [This test](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/0611eb49c87f367d3e34a1a3bcf04eb70150d180/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/test/java/org/springframework/boot/logging/log4j2/Log4J2LoggingSystemTests.java#L210-L214) will also have to be updated.
Yes. A workaround was to clear the app's data. Restarting it didn't help.
Yes I did actually, had to reset my phone

Aaargh, terribly sorry. Got sidetracked with the flu and hadn't gotten around to it. My error log holds all normal startup entries, like what's the hostname of the ip-address, are there any torrents running, etc.   `7289 -- Mon Feb 19 13:56:01 GMT+01:00 2018 -- 3 -- Skip the RSS checker service, as background data is disabled, the service is disabled or we are not connected. 7290 -- Mon Feb 19 13:56:01 GMT+01:00 2018 -- 3 -- Success: {"id": 2, "result": {"stats": {"upload_protocol_rate": 726, "max_upload": 80.0, "download_protocol_rate": 366, "download_rate": 0, "has_incoming_connections": false, "num_connections": 0, "max_download": -1.0, "upload_rate": 0, "dht_nodes": 167, "free_space": 198287822848, "max_num_connections": -1}...

The only one relating to search comes immediately after and reads like this:  `7293 -- Mon Feb 19 13:56:02 GMT+01:00 2018 -- 3 -- Cannot retrieve latest app or search module version code from the site: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "404: Not Found"`  
@buchgr any thoughts here? It would be nice if we could get a fix in for 0.26.0 if possible
Updated stacktrace under spoiler
Isn't that the same I said?  :) 
Hello @salk31 ,  Yes I am facing issue in my app. I only downloaded  zip file and added proper table configuration. All working well with mac(chrome,firefox, safari), ubunto(firefox, chrome), windows(firefox, chrome, IE6,IE8,IE9)  Now only  facing issue with IE10. I am not getting your GWT input.   Thanks!

2.1.0 – latest version in the develop branch. 
@TheThirdOne We are providing the repo link to students before the terms begin and they mostly will be downloading the latest release instead of the pre-release, and we would prefer if there's a version number (i.e. 1.3.1) to specify and work on.
Just tried, the oldest commit it'll let me compile (`3bfcae3c779e875ea5f74a82d1359cb8aeba96db`) still has the issue.
I suggest we relocate the logic of "complementing" the mapped software units to validate. This allows both validate and graphics you function normally without being to spent time on creating new code, since it is already built, we just need to relocate it. 
The version is 0.6.0, and line 248 cannot generate a CCE, so it must be the type.cast call, but then the exception seen should have been a  MalformedClaimException:

I did first `--memory=4096` then `minikube stop` then start with `--memory=10240` so I should try to delete first.   `kubectl describe node` gives:   
Hi @bsideup   Yes, I'm able to reproduce each time.  Here is the [repo](https://github.com/jgrandja/oauth2-client-nonblock).  Run this [test](https://github.com/jgrandja/oauth2-client-nonblock/blob/master/ui-app/src/test/java/sample/Tests.java) in debug mode and put a break point [here](https://github.com/jgrandja/oauth2-client-nonblock/blob/master/ui-app/src/test/java/sample/Tests.java#L144).  This will reproduce - at least with the JVM version I have. 
Seeing it yourself is probably easier than describing (just paste the doctype at the top of index.html)  Seemingly several bits break - it seems to be an interaction with `.cards-pf` which is overriding the background colours for every element.   If you force an override  with `body { background: #363636 !important }` you see the expected patterns (nice colour!). But obviously not a proper fix.   I’m still not completely familiar with the CSS debugger; been trying to trace the culprit more accurately.  > On 16 Feb 2017, at 12:36, Eric Wittmann <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > Which CSS breaks? >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/apiman/apiman-studio/issues/38#issuecomment-280319261>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAZ2Wc_8ugZns1neAqP1LdQn_3VEj_u7ks5rdEK7gaJpZM4MC08E>. >   
Sure @sijie and thanks for the follow up.  bookkeeper.conf 
@dubreuia frame deactivation/save all action (cmd + s)
My question is should the behavior from the GIF be happening? I clearly clicked on Save and the flow wasn't saved. In my point of view that flow should return 200 and empty String.  What's happening is that I am expecting 200 and empty string to be returned. What I get is 500 and no response.
@tonihei i see, let me check with the content team on the encryption. Is there anyway I can see and identify these in the logs myself?
@Bhargee "access$502" is a synthetic method generated by javac to handle field read/write from an inner class, or something alike.  @dwightguth you are right. I will fix the missing stack frames first. 
@gunnarmorling I can make a PR but as this is a side R&D project I dont know when it will be ready ..
I'm going on a Holiday now, but I have informed my colleagues about this. 
Not Chrome, the open source stock AOSP browser, the one that used to be standard before Google started pushing Chrome. It is still standard on ROMs that don't have the proprietary GAPPS installed. It does not share its UID. 
unzipping here is just for reproducing this error. i propose to use any post-install.xq or pre-install.xq. it doesnt matter, you just have to include a line like stated in the test. my question is not about how to do it, but why i can not do it in this way. why sm:passwd throws an error when used during autodeploy?
When I use `--report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime` with `--language:js` I get the exact same output as shown above. Without using `--language:js` the result is also the same: the image is created without warnings, but the JS script engine is not found at runtime.
Thank you for the answer. This bug is available if you call stop after a track with mMediaPlayer.setForegroundMode(true); It took me a long time to figure out what was going on, but then I found an instruction in the depths of the code explaining that I don't need to call a stop in this case. Now it works correctly.
I cannot reproduce the problem because of fix #3663.  The assumption that pushing the restart button will case a roll-back is incorrect. The only action that this button does is stopping the session. The import job is not synchronized and will continue with importing. 
Sample emailed.  Thanks.
Works fine. It works in HB if element is created not via HB API. See https://github.com/vaadin/hummingbird-demo/pull/206
Hello benas;  Yes your modifications is working till some point. Sadly all of the other annotations and the methods for checking the annotations should be modified if we want easy rules work behind a proxy like cglib. However I started to think that it is a very specific request and I suspect that it may not be that common. Anyways less talk and more code.  I have prepared an integration test just for checking if easy rules can work behind a proxy. You can checkout my branch from here : https://github.com/cgonul/easyrules/tree/integration_test_for_proxying  My new branch is up to date with your latest changes.  Here is the codes for integration tests : dffdf6b3d68d578d9d35b11530c6b71dcaadc6bc  In here all of my beans is served behind a proxy with the help of AspectConfiguration. When this happens the classes annotated with @SpringRule becomes the child class of the non proxied original classes. You can comment out the @Configuration annotation in AspectConfiguration class to disable the proxy.  You will see that the integration test is not succeeded. It fails with the following argument exception.  > Rule 'org.easyrules.spring.boot.integration.DummyRule$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$7d00def8' must have a public method annotated with 'org.easyrules.annotation.Condition'  Which is triggered from RuleDefinitionValidator since easy rules can not find the Condition annotation on the DummyRule class, since the DummyRule is created as a child class of the original DummyRule by the Cglib proxy.  (**how ever she can find the @Rule annotation since it is inherited thanks for your last modifications checkRuleClass method is succeded**)  This weekend I will work with this integration test and make easy rules works behind a proxy. The challenge for me is that you do not like AnnotionUtils from spring core dependency. I will try to localize it.  Thanks.  
news-20180614 is:   
sorry, i was talking about "wallcorner3" in the fortress tree. the rack issue happens in every building where more than 2 racks are placed next to each other. the shadow varies from level. at level 1 it didn't occur whereas at level 3 it does (builder hut). probably it depends on what blocks are near to it. the shigle have the same problem only when placed next to a wood block. also i forgot to mention, in the barracks (fortress type) the barracks tower blocks are placed rotated and not in the right spot. i had to destroy the block and replace it myself.  ![2020-02-22_12 25 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41806417/75091607-71f78880-556f-11ea-8a6c-a6d07c4367f3.png) ![2020-02-22_12 31 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41806417/75091608-7328b580-556f-11ea-9e70-5cceaec39d3a.png)

Nope.  
No, the problem occurs only for JPEG-compressed TIFFs.

@roytmana a similar method could be applied indeed. But I'm not fully happy with the way per-field boosting works for the _all field so I would like that we consider improving it before applying the same logic to other places. In particular, this doesn't work with all queries (eg. phrase queries) and is quite wasteful storage-wise (4 bytes per occurrence of a term whose field has a boost which is not 1: I wouldn't be surprised to see that it sometimes almost doubles the size of the inverted index for the _all field).

Hi gilberto, I'm using flow 1.0.5. I have push mode MANUAL and transport LONG POLL This is the code which causes the issue  I'm sorry for the formatting, I can't figure out why it doesn't work here at github...  `     private void OnUserListChanged(String id)      {         getUI().ifPresent(ui -> ui.access(() -> {                      UpdateUsersOnline();                      ui.push();                 })         );     }       private void UpdateUsersOnline() {          if (users_online == null) {             return;         }          users_online.removeAll();          List<String> users = Broadcaster.getUsersInfo();          for (String user : users)         {             Label lbl = new Label(user);              users_online.add(lbl);         }     }`  Interestingly it works find the first two updates after starting the server and the third time it fails.
I cannot launch dev mode with CLI in container at all:   
> DataContainers always support arrays, what makes you think it's not supporting arrays?  The container itself supports the array, but the Configurate serializers do not accept array types by default  The issue is that I registered serializers necessary for arrays, but they are not being used from within `org.spongepowered.common.config.DataSerializableTypeSerializer`
It looks perfectly reasonable from that log output and when I select that line in particular (granted, after I've added the index back in) it looks fine.  I count 10 columns.  I dug into this before I figured out the index fix. I don't know why it's expecting 8 (apparently it thinks `header == null`) or getting 9 (apparently that's what `condenseTrailingTokens` does)  If I pad that site to get the VC above and below they all look well behaved, whitespace and everything: 
It seems like nodeInfo itself is never null. Although I did not check each item, but most variable of nodeInfo is null if we can not get a row from HBase. I agree that nodeInfo.isEmpty() is more readable. I will update it after it passes regression.

Hi sjka, tested the change with the last Snapshot of OH build #989. The `return` doesn´t stop the execution of a rule. Maybe something still missing? Can you please have a look on it. Thanks very much.
Using norconex-common-lang-1.3.2.jar from beginning.  Could be a problem that I put -a key at the stop command?  If there will be running several crawlers at a time does it differs them by config path?

Hi!   We're working on making this into an reproducible test case, keeping the minimum needed for it to work and also checking if there is no other component that might interfere.  In the meantime, there is some additional info/clarifications: - what I named as _staging_ are experimental versions that we run _internally_ with _live_ accounts - on a few debug runs (on emulators) had also missing calls to Listener methods, sadly i'm not able to reproduce the case. I suspect this has something to do with cleaning the build and/or rebuilding the project. - i need to confirm if our implementation of `connectionAcquired()` has some `null reference` issues with `connection.socket()`  I'll keep you updated!
I managed to get the same log by hitting ctrl+c but it didn't cause the main issue. Later, I managed to have the issue happen without hitting ctrl+c. So the issue is not caused by the ctrl+c.

Sorry, for getting back to you so late, but here are the methods that are being referenced by those method ids.

We use maven as the build system for openHAB. My dependencies in the pom.xml look like this.   So, when I build my jar with the first set of deps, when it runs on my Ubuntu 16.04 platform, it fails with the error shown in my first post. When it runs on 18.04, it runs fine.  When I build with the second set of deps, it works fine on both platforms.  One thing I should point out... In both cases I'm specifying JNA 5.4.0, since that's the JNA version that openHAB includes. That's different than the JNA version specified by lazysodium 4.2.4. 
Hello @macdonst,  as requested posting more details...  The problem happens when my tablet have a wrong date configured and have no connection to internet. Registration or error, none of the events are called.  I changed the date of my tablet to reproduce the problem...  changed the year to 2010 - bug - registration or error, none of the events was called. changed the year to 2014 - bug - registration or error, none of the events was called. changed the year to 2015 - ok - registration event called (need internet to work). 2016  or more, i cant test more than 2015, because my tablet changes the date to 2015 automaticaly.  I`m using this example https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push/blob/master/example/www/js/index.js  just calling alert on registration and error events, using the same sender id 741175631277.

I had at the time, though I wiped everything because I do that when I get frustrated with software, lol.

Hello,  For the advanced recycler view features we use swiping and dragging, no other third party libraries in the same codebase but we use another listener for clicking. I cannot reproduce it often because it happens on different platforms (4.0 and 5.0), so far it happened twice.  I will also message you on Monday with the project that is using Advanced Recycler View to update the GitHub page.  Thanks, Damian 
Regarding the implementaion, Have a look at: https://github.com/danielpetisme/golosa/blob/master/src/main/golo/golosa/util/augment-util.golo  I definitively prefer the default collections approach. To be more flexible I use a kind of container (very very basic).  - You register the default mappings (could be externailized) - The functions try to invoke the sameType constructor - If it fails, use the default collection associated  It works pretty well( have a look at the test : https://github.com/danielpetisme/golosa/blob/master/src/test/golo/golosa/util/TestUtil.golo

We can try the latest version but we don't have a reproducible test yet. No, it doesn't occur consistently and that was the first occurrence of the issue. We have been using helidon for our micro-services over 6 months and never seen this issue.  Another question, our common library has the helidon config which is used in all micro-services for runtime config changes. If we upgrade webserver to 1.0.3, will this work with Config module of older versions? I read release notes of release 1.x that Config module has significant changes in 1.x from 0.10 version of Config. 
I confirmed I don't have the Cucumber nature on my project. But after I added it in Eclipse, the behavior has not changed.

Action can be performed on TestCase page. A user that is not TestAdmin can change the test case from WORKING to anything else (FULLY_IMPLEMENTED, for example) and save the test case. After that, he can change the test case behaviour without anyone being "alerted". However, the user cannot move the test case to WORKING if he is not TestAdmin.

I'm using a zoom level of 150% or 200%. And you're right, looking at the diagrams at 100% does not show the described behaviour.
I faced the issue on 1.0.0, but it seems that on the master branch the code is the same. The [DockerClientBuilder.build()](https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java/blob/cc5331d7de228601fa817f0212ee107953470075/src/main/java/com/github/dockerjava/core/DockerClientBuilder.java#L63) method locates a singleton instance of a `DockerCmdExecFactory` with a `ServiceLoader`. Then this shared factory is configured twice with the [init()](https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java/blob/408a320adefea160881dbf5036eaab09aa21a4f9/src/main/java/com/github/dockerjava/jaxrs/DockerCmdExecFactoryImpl.java#L45) method.

Looks like Architecturecraft blocks stored in the dank/null are causing this. Couldn't try to update to latest version as this was on a server that I don't own or manage so I had to try to replicate the bug. What I've found is that holding any type of dank null and scrolling to Architecturecraft modified blocks that come from the Sawbench (as seen here https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/minecraft/mods/ArchitectureCraft/Doc/UserManual.html) will crash the game. Then just having the dank null in your inventory will continue to crash whenever you log in. Rendering the dank null in any way will continue to crash the game (in a chest, on the ground, still crashes)   I have updated /dank/null and your library and the same crash still happens. Here is the crash log on the latest version, hope this helps. For now I'll make sure to not store any Architecturecraft blocks in a dank null. https://pastebin.com/VFZKfZq2

It refers to an issue where the content provider returned by google photos was not working correctly.  @misaochan might know about it. 
@mrniko  Thanks for your reply. I am not sure if this is only reproducible when the cache is full.  I tried to run the lua script manually and I found that probably this line is causing error. local msg = struct.pack('Lc0Lc0', string.len(lruItem), lruItem, string.len(lruItemValue), lruItemValue); Looks like lruItemValue is returning boolean and this section is under the condition that  if cacheSize >= maxSize. Please help take a look. Thanks!  Maybe this is the reason, Redis nil does convert to false in Lua scripts. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42123757/redis-lua-script-redis-callget-nonexisting-return-value I think this could be due to I manually cleared my cache but didn't clear redisson__map_cache__last_access__set, so they are out of sync?     
Hallo Björn, FYI, actually I mixed up ROMs, AOSP build for grouper / tilapia is availabe only via XDA on this tread: https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-7/development/rom-android-7-aosp-grouper-t3467514  Good news is that your test build fixed the keyboard issue on my device (tested with several keyboard apps in portrait and landscape mode, all fine).  
I'm using 1.2.1335-1  Unfortunately I am not the sys admin so I can't update the version myself.   If all that is required is a version bump. I'll wait till the preview is released and then request the upgrade. I guess we can close the issue if its fixed in the preview version.

We have our own copy of the IPCameraFrameGrabber in our source code because we were running out of memory on an ARM Chip because the IPCameraFrameGrabber creates a 4096 element byte array on each grab. https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv/blob/fc30fc8b5f1415d957727fb55fe549b248b29552/src/main/java/org/bytedeco/javacv/IPCameraFrameGrabber.java#L139  This was causing the JVM to run out of memory.  If you are curious you can see our modifications here:  https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/blob/37e7aeb5f2fadf9a3e5f7f8fd83ec8dc7de44808/core/src/main/java/edu/wpi/grip/core/sources/IPCameraFrameGrabber.java#L212  Anyways, back to the null pointer issue. I'm going to simply change it so that instead of returning null we throw an exception. I'm happy to make a PR with the same change in your version if that would help. 
Here are my gradle dependencies snippets for applicable libraries:    I think there is an incompatibility with how MockMvc handles forwarded requests. I see it's not really suported. But, it generally works from the restdocs perspective when I pass querystring params in the url, and when I pass the form content as body. If I try using `post(...).params(...)` then I can only make assertions on the `MockMvcResultMatchers.forwarded*` related parts.

It depends. If you add a Jabber contact (non-Kontalk) from a desktop client, it shows "unknown" because it can't map it with any contact in Android. If you receive an invitation (or a message) from an unknown phone number, it will show you unknown because of the missing number in Android contacts.

If I want to test usage I will name the Run/Debug as <code>myapp --help</code> and put --help as a program argument, If I want to test a connection I will name it <code>myapp --connection</code> and put -c tcp://someserver.com.  You get the idea?  As the plug-in is coded now, i get an exe called <code>myapp --help.exe</code> and another one called <code>myapp --connection.exe</code>, etc.  If I have twenty of these configuration I get twenty exes and I only need one!  Either you need to put in a field for program name or you need to allow for the ability to shut off your -o output flag so we can enter our own in the Go tool arguments field.

> The library itself uses Context.getApplicationContext() inside on the Context passed into RxBleClient.create(Context). I doubt that this is the problem  This helps a lot. I confirmed that it is OS related. It only happens in Miui 9.6.5, Android 7.1 Nougat. I tried in a Samsung with android 5.1 and it works just fine. And I found this explanation on stackoverflow [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5018545/getapplication-vs-getapplicationcontext) seems legit. And when I fixed the process, a thing that you can make in miui, it worked fine. Seems like it optimizes the process killing something important. No clue about what exactly happens but now I know how to fix it. Thank you.
yes I can confirm it's    "deprecated method" was the error message of compiler (maybe is a wrong message output)

I have struggled for years to comprehend the details of the SAM format specification document, and I admit that its opacity and lack of precision is still a perennial source of frustration and amusement.  Nevertheless, my understanding of the difference between "unsorted" and "unknown" is simply that "unsorted" means "sorted neither by POS nor QNAME" whereas "unknown" means "unknown."  In the case where the output contains alignment records grouped by QNAME, the sort order is obviously not "unknown".  In any event: - One should not be obligated to hack MarkDuplicates with  is no longer true, it should not be fooling around with the SAM header record, regardless of how one might interpret "unknown" versus "unsorted" in this context.  
Yes, I'd like to but I need to discuss with my employer :-)
From what I can tell, if you've installed once, subsequent installations will work without the warning. So I need to set up a fresh installation; I'll update when that's ready.
Something like that. There are multiple metals left in the smeltery, because there is that stoppage in the ingot cast. I'm not sure about the metal in the cast itself, if some of that was lost or simply rerouted into the pipes or the smeltery etc.  The details are getting a little fuzzy after a while. Dealing with this multiple times is so annoying that I just switch to a redstone clock as soon as I can.

I was able to reproduce with only Blood Magic, Forge, and Guide-API in a pack I just threw together on the twitch launcher. I even tried updating forge to 13.20.1.2425 in case it was forge somehow.
Sure. The main issue is the "jump" handling when you need to go more than one item forward on any side. My previous code example represents case when I need to set 6th index active by default right after component initialization. Basically it can't jump from 0 item to 6 in this case, instead it will set item with index 1 as active.   I've slightly updated sample code with this block for component init:  Technically, listed blocks related to "jump from the edge" cases only. Jump from other positions in the middle does not work either.
I have tried this in **EA 29-Jan-2019 20:26** and this works **OK**. My guess when you fixed case #5058 it fixed this misbeaviour as well. **Great Work**  **PS**. As far as I am concerned, you can close this isse now.

@SylviaDehn I created a new subscription and I checked again. The status of the subscription was "pending" but it changed when I opened the link from the email. Sorry, I did not know about it earlier (I mean confirmation e-mail link). I can log in to the aws controller dashboard and the status of my subscription is "COMPLETED" now.

@stephanrauh  I have tested and now it's ok, thank you.
Intended: on circles, the circle is totally faded including with the number when it reaches the start of 300 range and the note doesn't expand when clicked, only the score (300, 100, 50, geki, katu) shows up. on sliders, the number fades while the entire slider body remains shows up at the same timeframe as the circle.  Actual case: circles fade completely when the note hits the end possible range of 300, and if "Show Perfect Hits" is enabled, the note will just dissappear when clicked and if it is enabled, the note will expand when clicked and displays the score. same case on sliders when the number fades at the same time period of 300 
@nedtwigg When I run `./gradlew spotlessCheck` straight after running `./gradlew clean` and thoroughly cleaning all build folders, it doesn't seem to produce `build\spotless-diagnose-java` at all. The most it generates is `lib\build\*` and `lib-extra\build\*` subfolders which just contain the usual suspects: `classes\`, `dependency-cache\`, `libs\` and `tmp\`.  Interestingly, cleaning all the build folders and then running `./gradlew spotlessApply` runs without problems. It seems that it's just `spotlessCheck` that has a problem.

I just tried a Gradle build with the 0.15.0 release and the bug is gone.  Thanks for your time @geoand !
It happened one time and I fixed with replaced getViewType. It's now uses the derived Item class's hash for viewType. There is no stacktrace. I didn't saved. The excpetion was a failed casting when groupie tried to bind my viewmodel to an other viewholder. Beacause these two different item had the same layoutId.
Most of the time the crash does not happen on first startup anymore, instead on the 2nd launch of the game. It crashes with only Curios and it's addons installed about half the time, however when it crashes once it will not stop crashing no matter what until I remove it all. Somehow gets fixed after a few tries and fiddling with my mod list (removing everything then adding it back, removing curios, etc.) Currently trying the new build, no issues so far.

> I'm not very familiar with OSX, do other clients (vanilla, osbuddy, etc.) have this functionality? Do other (java-based) programs generally have this functionality?  Yes, there's no vanilla client for mac ( at least wasn't there last I checked ). Sadly no, OSBuddy also doesn't support it, its not just OSBuddy, its pretty much for every application, you can't run multiple instances simply by double clicking the application.  But I just had a thought like the Mobile Emulators are able to make multiple Instances, if that could be something we could potentially see in future? :D

I fixed the issue by converting pause() function in Action.java from public static void pause(){                         try{                             Scanner pauseScan = new Scanner(System.in);                             String temp = pauseScan.nextLine();                             Ui.println(temp);                         }catch (Exception e){                                     //Blank for a reason - Not supposed to do anything.                         }      }  to  public static void pause(){                         try{                             Scanner pauseScan = new Scanner(System.in);                              return;                         }catch (Exception e){                                     //Blank for a reason - Not supposed to do anything.                         }             } 
I have updated the code paragraphs to include all of the class annotations. You see that we also use Lombok. But Lombok we have sorted out to cause the problem. 
Checked it out and it works! Nice 
I'm not such a derp. :P Anyways, uninstalled your plugin, restarted Jenkins, installed your plugin and restarted again. Look at: http://itachisan.no-ip.org/job/color-test/14/console And the code snippet is: http://pastebin.com/9vuZZN0B  As you can see, just one of the multiple echos prints out the right color. And I don't get why this happens, as the other projects are fully configured for colors and on other Jenkins color is printed properly...! 
@kmandeville I don't think this fix should produce a new release, I issued a release May 29, 2017.  I'm waiting fanweixiao response about removing some deprecated methods and after his response a new release should be issued on July/August...
Since your the one who I imagine makes most use of the log then I think you should have the final decision. I should point out that this update clears the log (only when played via the UI) _every game_ not per duel.

If I delete the Cryptomator folder with the iCloud Drive IOS app on the iPad, and re-run Cryptomator, then I get the error "masterkey.cryptomator" could not be found. But yes ,the folder is re-created by the IOS app with just the readme file inside. Checking on the iPhone, the Cryptomator folder is gone (and then re-appears again).  So I agree iCloud seems to sync but not visible on iCloud.com or any MacOS devices. Seems like sync is working to me too but not to MacOS or iCloud.com. Very odd. Will keep pushing Apple, but so far they seem to have washed their hands of it. Disappointing.

Yes the heads work to make it! thats the not the issue! The issue is the **DROPS**. The default mechanic of minecraft, drops wither heads with a 2.5-5.5% chance without MobHunting.  Please read what I linked. https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wither_Skeleton#Drops  So what's happening, is there is the default mechanics can drop a head and ALSO MobHunting can drop a head.
It is working for me now as well.

Hi ripcurlx, thanks for looking. Without the torControlPort argument, both 1.2.5 and 1.2.7 fail (because Tails prohibits Tor inside Tor), but they _fail in identical ways_ so it's no problem on Bisq-side.  The only problem is when I try to use the system Tor via torControlPort.   ---  I only had limited time, but I've made one more test to isolate the issue: `sudo strace -f -e trace=connect -u amnesia /opt/Bisq-1.2.5/Bisq --logLevel=INFO --torControlPort=9051`  I did a little cleanup on the output and pulled the following relevant snippet (note that this is a successful run of 1.2.5, showing the "expected" behaviour"):  There are two **connect()** calls, and from the context we understand that the first one is an attempt to probe for a Bitcoin node on the local machine port 8333, and the second one is the connection to Tor's control port (supplied via command-line as 9051). The software works correctly.  When I repeat the test with version 1.2.7, I see the first connect() call to port 8333, however after the message "Connecting to running tor" `strace` shows **no connect() call** - to port 9051 or any other. The timeout occurs 4 minutes later.   This is consistent with my observation from running tcpdump on loopback, and confirms that the issue is located within the Bisq app (not a firewall issue etc).   I hope this helps, and provides a portable test to reproduce the bug even on non-Tails Linuxes.
Yes, I completely understand.  Linking this to https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/211 so I remember this when I write tutorial.  Closing. 
I had a similar impression when I had to decide if to add a new issue or not. I'm not sure though. The failure of the DITA OT integrator in this case is different than what @robander was experiencing.

Hey, thanks for the quick reply!  > Just to make sure I understand... The issue here isn't that MobArena doesn't behave as it should _in the context of MobArena itself_, but rather than it _overreaches_ and breaks some sort of functionality outside of its own context, right?  This is correct. When playing mobarena itself, everything behaves as expected. The problem occurs with teleports completely unrelated to any mobarena.  > So, MobArena sometimes cancels PlayerTeleportEvents that it shouldn't?  The oppisite is the case - MobArena _allows_ teleports that other plugins have cancelled - that is it sets cancelled to _false_ even though a different plugin previously set it to _true_.  > From this analysis, I'd say that the underlying problem is with the `mobarena.admin.teleport` permission. Can you try to negate that permission to see if that fixes the problem?  I can confirm that this is the case. In the original test I had the `*` permission (wildcard for all permissions) set for my account. Without that permission (which also implicitly unsets the `mobarena.admin.teleport` permission) the teleport remains cancelled, i.e. MobArena no longer interferes with the other plugin.  I can understand that sometimes forcing the event to be uncancelled for moving players to and from the arena is necessary to keep other plugins from interfering. But I don't see a reason to uncancel it based on a permission. Having a permission to _not cancel_ teleports for OPs inside an arena is great - but actively _uncancelling_ previously already cancelled events makes no sense IMO.  Thanks for looking into it!

we are using Greenwich.SR2 as the cloud release train.  We dont have an issue upgrading but will require a lot more testing. based on the bit of debugging that I have done, I am not sure the Spring Boot 2.2.x redistemplate implementation is any different than 2.1.x for ValueOperations.

`len` wont get a value in that case as `parseInt` will throw a `NumberFormatException` because its argument is `null` and not a parseable string.  6d0e680 should fix it in this regard, respectively "fix" as in throwing a "clearer" exception. I'd maybe even omit the `null` check as I cant tell right now what will happen now. According to the documentation the end of the stream has been reached when `readLine` returns `null`, so I'd assume the response body might not have a valid structure to begin with in these cases.
Yes. I start up my app which init CBLite on emulator and get REST url which return by getAttachmentUri  from debug console, then open the url in browser to check why view intent failed. When the attachment is image, the url download the image success, but when attachment is PDF browser start to download file but always stop quickly caused by failed to download file though no 404 error occurs. But if I write a react native module method to get attachment content by CBLite database API and write it to android external storage file system the PDF can be open. So I think upload works but the REST API of get attachment has bug. Maybe should report this issue to couchbase-lite-android. 
Well not work with the new version. What happens is that I'm using more libraries for my project what happens to my mind is that there are something like crossing libraries do not know if I'll be right.  Xq when I create a new project and use only the webLookAndFeel library works well the problem it is when I use more libraries.  Thanks a lot for the help

Che at least works, but the CHE-WORKSPACE_VOLUME does not get mounted.  Could you walk me through it? I really appreciate your kind help. I was a little bit puzzled that the cli creates files that the launcher does not create by itself. I thought the launcher was the container the user can run so that everything gets bootstrapped and runs fine.

I am also running LineageOS 14.1 (based on Android 7). AFWall, also, of course whitelisted.  So: > I's not a Lineage error, because my test device is running Lineage.  This, is, AFAIK/IMHO, not a logical conclusion…
It still exists on one of my local machine, but the program can run fine with this error. I will close this for now. 
OK. It looks like this is more complex than I thought. Kicking it into the long grass until I can come up with a nice example. 
I see this issue occurs every time in android(I didn't see IOS). So I think when you know this problem, you can fix it easily.  here is simple example.  let callDetector; componentDidMount() {         callDetector = new CallDetectorManager((event)=> {             if (event === 'Disconnected') {                 // Do something call got disconnected             }         }) } componentWillUnmount() {             callDetector.dispose(); } 
Certainly, here's my config file: http://cl.ly/code/3w1h1R0f0l2M (It contains some configs for the new features, but they will just be ignored in earlier versions.)

I'm sorry, I'm needing to launch my server like today and don't have the time to test it myself. If nobody else has the issue I can cross the bridge later when I try to get it live again. Wanted to give an opportunity to see if it was on your side and make you aware of it. Thanks for your consideration and great work on an awesome mod!
I can upload a fix on the github, but don't want to release it on npm. You will have to install it from the github like so:    If that's fine - I will do it soon. 
I don't have the code on me, but there is nothing to fancy to explain.  The project consists of a form in which you can upload two files (two separate file fields), and a submit button, which send a post request to an endpoint which has one parameter - the 'Form'.  In the controller I try and retrieve the files from the Form, but it returns nothing, the size is 0.  However, what I can do is retrieve the file names by iterating through the Map of values, although that is not very useful. 
Why would modifying the auto-download setting affect whether a URL or a "Download image" button is shown?

Thank you for your reply. I will give it a try. 
Attached is a simple test - it includes source code and jar in target subdir.  How to perform the test: 1) switch simple mode to OFF in paper UI 2) install binding and create a thing for it in the paper UI     - during initialization, thing will create one channel type, called static-channel type, spawn a thread and return from initialization       - every 10 seconds the thread will create a static-channel with random name/id, using the type ID created during intialization. Before that, it will remove the previous static-channel, if exists.     - additionally, the thread will also create a new channel type ID called dynamic-channel and a dynamic-channel, using the just created ID (and random name/id for channel type and channel). Before that, it will remove previous dynamic-channel type and channel, if exist.     - after first creation of the two channels, it will set thing state to ONLINE 3) Go to thing in the UI and unfold channels, there will be two channels updated every 10 seconds. UI reflects the updates in the channels very well. 4) Just after the channels are updated, click on the icon to unfold items and click on the plus sign to add a new item to the channel     - it will work for static-channel, since its channel type was created once during thing initialization     - it will not work for dynamic-channel, since its channel type was created 10 seconds ago, when UI was already open. It will throw JS exception in the browser where it can't find the type in scope.  Of course, such exact situation will not happen in the reality, but similar one happens - when user works on his/her setup and changes remote device configuration, at the same time having browser with paper UI open. The conditions needed to happen here is having browser open when channel type changes. In case of my real binding, this happens, when changing configuration of the remote device, it causes reconfiguration of the thing. If I keep browser open at the same time, I will need to refresh it in order to be able to add items.  Since channel changes are perfectly dynamically reflected in the UI, I thought it should also work for channel types.

Sure. To take a step back I would like rotating secrets when I specify RequestedSecret.ROTATE.  I would like to understand the logic in the code around checking for the existence of a lease id. According to:  https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/lease.html  A dynamic secret will always have a lease id, which matches my experience. Is there another mechanism for obtaining and renewing a rotating secret in spring vault?

This happens in SMP. 
@Midhun07 Sorry I wasn't clearer! Generally, forms post to the server URL that is in the settings. The XML of that form looks like this..   So in the case of a form submission where there is a form-specific URL and credentials are required, it'd be good if the error message referred to that form-specific hostname.   To test, set your device's server to https://opendatakit.appspot.com. Confirm this is working by getting blank form. You should see forms like Biggest N of Set, Birds, Cascading Select.   Now, rename this form ([custom-url.xml.txt](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/files/848378/custom-url.xml.txt)) to custom-url.xml and [manually push it to your device](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/#testing-a-form-locally). Note that the form XML has https://nafundi-test.appspot.com/submission as the submission url.  With your computer's browser, log into the https://nafundi-test.appspot.com with admin/admin. Go into Site Admin, then preferences, and uncheck all permissions for anonymousUser. Save Changes.  Now fill out the custom-url form on your device and try to send it in. It should show an alert that says you should enter the username and password for opendatakit.appspot.com. But that isn't correct! The server should be nafundi-test.appspot.com because that's what is in the form.  And to be extra sure things work when you are making your changes, try creating another user on the server with Data Collector privileges and make sure those credentials work.  When you are done testing, re-enable permissions for anonymousUser.
Hi, Clint:   I don't know how to upload .rar file into gist, so I updated my post in google mail list, and attached the logs of 20 nodes in my post. You can download it from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/mYW-ruxCJ8A   The logs are for 0.90.0.Beta1.     Today I tested the latest the ES version 0.90.0.Beta1, it has the same problem.   My test configure is as following:   20 nodes. 10.96.250.211,212,213 are master nodes. 211 is the leader; 214 and 215 are load balancer; other 15 nodes are data nodes.   My test step is as following:   1) after the cluster is up, I created an empty index: test1 curl -XPUT 10.96.250.214:10200/test1 {"ok":true,"acknowledged":true} curl -XGET 10.96.250.211:10200/_cluster/health?pretty=true {   "cluster_name" : "es-test-0-90-0-beta1",   "status" : "yellow",   "timed_out" : false,   "number_of_nodes" : 20,   "number_of_data_nodes" : 15,   "active_primary_shards" : 15,   "active_shards" : 27,   "relocating_shards" : 0,   "initializing_shards" : 3,   "unassigned_shards" : 0 }   The cluster stayed in this state for long time.  2) Then I created another empty index: abcd1234 curl -XPUT 10.96.250.214:10200/abcd1234 {"ok":true,"acknowledged":false} curl -XGET 10.96.250.211:10200/_cluster/health?pretty=true {   "cluster_name" : "es-test-0-90-0-beta1",   "status" : "red",   "timed_out" : false,   "number_of_nodes" : 20,   "number_of_data_nodes" : 15,   "active_primary_shards" : 29,   "active_shards" : 53,   "relocating_shards" : 0,   "initializing_shards" : 6,   "unassigned_shards" : 1   The cluster stayed in this state for long time  3) Then I created one more empty index:  curl -XPUT 10.96.250.214:10200/1234abcd {"ok":true,"acknowledged":false} curl -XGET 10.96.250.211:10200/_cluster/health?pretty=true {   "cluster_name" : "es-test-0-90-0-beta1",   "status" : "red",   "timed_out" : false,   "number_of_nodes" : 20,   "number_of_data_nodes" : 15,   "active_primary_shards" : 43,   "active_shards" : 78,   "relocating_shards" : 0,   "initializing_shards" : 6,   "unassigned_shards" : 6 }   The cluster stayed in this state for long time.   Thank you.  -Regards- -Dong Aihua- 
no, it does not appear to happen with just Stellar API 
@nosark Sure, go for it! Thanks for your help! Please note that this is likely to be a high-priority issue so if it's not fixed quickly, one of the core maintainers may need to take it over from you. Our next release to get this issue in is in January (v4.1, see [the calendar](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Focus/Android/Train_Schedule)) though so you've got a bit of time. :)  Unfortunately, I'm not sure what could be the matter here but you could start investigating by: - (from pocmo's suggestion) Looking at the git log for `BrowserFragment` - does anything look suspicious? Perhaps back out a changeset and see if it fixes the problem - Bisecting: check out different changesets on master to find out which reproduce and which don't to narrow down which changeset could have caused the regression (this is less viable because the issue isn't consistently reproducible yet) - Just reading the code! :)  Let us know if you need any assistance and don't forget you can find us at #focus on IRC generally during PST working hours.
Ok sorry, I used them for the first time late in the game when things are less clear so the mechanism was not apparent to me. Now that I know it, it's alright.

@fceller I am working with GraphEntity, I can create graph structure it is not a problem. But as I see there is no methods in GraphEntity to update/modify scheme, especially edit EdgeDefinitionEntity. From the doc you mentioned above, there is no GraphEntity.editEdgeDefinitions method. 
it seems that they're ignored for the effect. At least I got a couple of times where I have the board with 3 metal blocks with [1] move left to dissappear and other tree that were more recent, and block smash+ activated and then there wasn't any more metal blocks in the board 
The cluster has since been destroyed and the change is not on master.  Let me create a cluster with that change and I'll message you on Slack when it's up.
I can reproduce with both enabling and disabling the chunkloading in the config. When disabled, it's fairly easy to do. When enabled, you just need to reach the chunkloaders limit, which is pretty easy in a public SMP server. 
I didn't read it very carefully now, but examples and the section about registering cdi beans with the said annotation suggest that it's only needed in the cdi injection case. 
Hi Kevin, the point is to edit the text within the richeditor. In your video you are setting the content by the method "setHTML". But as an user of an input form you would like to edit your html text with the rich editor (type texts, set your text bold, underlined, take another font etc.). If you do that and call then "getHTML()" you will not get your changed Text, but only your original text you set at the beginning. I will try to take a video too :D  Kind regards, David 
I don't think an account needed to be selected at all.
So, after I added the NBT suspicion as an afterthought, armed with that knowledge I found possibly related tickets like #670.  I'm currently redesigning my AE system to get around the NBT issue, splitting off a third branch and adding MOAR minechem machines in the process. So far it's a success, the tick lag is gone and the client/WARNs with it.  NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M, aka shitty laptop card, but it seems it's not the issue. 
> Where is the template file placed? > Any JS file in `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/frontend` should be found from the jar files and be handle by webpack.  Yes, the template file is placed in that folder only.
how do I do that? 
Yes one second, let me load up 1.8.9.
Here is my setup:  in my main Application.java    Then in one of my activities, prompt is triggered by:  `Amplify.getSharedInstance().promptIfReady(mPromptView);`  the prompt shows up the first time promptIfReady is called, but does not show the second time it is called. On the second time, however, when the screen orientation changes, the prompt suddenly shows up.  Is setAlwaysShow(true) supposed to show the prompt each time promptIfReady is called? This used to be the behaviour in 1.0.0.  I am testing 1.2.0 with a custom prompt view on Nexus 4, Android 4.4. 
Now I have waited.... 1 hour 30 minutes. 
@Unpublished thanks for finding steps how to reproduce it. ~~You added "pr exists". Is this fixed within #3459?~~  ~As this is a rather annoying bug, I would like to release a 3.6.2 soon, containing this fix.~~ ~~Can you point me to the fix?~~  EDIT: read it wrong. Fix is in #4044 
There obviously should always be a way to resize the window. At the moment I fixed it in my code by adding setShowResizeCorner(true) in a ComponentListener under the componentMoved() method. Putting it in componentResized() does not work. Maximize now does not have the corner and unmaximizing again regains the resize corner, which is the correct result.  I think keeping the corner is the solution that I think looks the best.  Making window sides and corners resizable would (I think) need an aditional border of some sort and I don't think that would look as good.  The best solution is to provide options for all: Optionally make window sides and corners resizable and (the already implemented) ability to show or hide the resize corner.  It is however up to you.  As a side note, you are doing great work. Weblaf looks superb and it has been a blast to use it!

Yes I fully agree with that, we are handling this now outside RaH already, however white rabbit should not crash. In this case we use Usagi to map a column to a concept_id using the overview table of White Rabbit :)  I do not have the message myself, it was reported to me.
@smalyshev might be able to help you out.
Sorry about that, I thought the related PR has already been merged. Doing it now...
Yes, the yellow circle is shown, however, I think it shouldn't because the selected option is delete. However, lets leave this to @masensio since here we reproduce it.

I have etar version 1.0.9 from F-Droid installed. The problem with the log is, that the app crashes before a have any chance to enter it. Is there any other way to enable the log?
I wish we could add curly braces to solve this. The script is a client's auto-proxy discovery for their large network. We're a small app running on their system. So we didn't want to make their IT change their script.   I'll try some regex-foo and see if I can provide a solution for this case.

I think discarding the mouse buttons seems to be the best idea, since buttons with high indices are not likely to be used playing opsu! due to their inconvenient position. Practically all players will use L/R mouse buttons or keyboard input. I temporarily fixed the issue on my system by disabling the buttons completely. 
Okay, I made a sample training and attached it to the first post (just remove the .txt extension).  I forgot to mention that I have Android 5.1.1, too. The bug is 100% reproducible for me. No matter what kind of training/intervals I try, it will always crash at the first repetition. 
Thanks for investigating the issue. Yes, it seems that you have found the problem. If the calendar-widget opens the all-day event directly (using stock calendar app) it shows incorrect information spanning over two days (I do not use Google’s calendar). But if the event is opened from the stock calendar app without using the calendar-widget, the event is correctly placed in only one day. Do you think you can workaround the problem of the bad API to handle those requests correctly from the calendar-widget?
Yes they are.  
Done. I suppose my app must show me the floating button?

@findepi Thank you very much for your time with this issue. You are correct, I did have the coordinator misconfigured. Everything looks good now. Thanks again!
Really? Debugging enabled on release build?
When I look at the logs I get the following table create in the first case:    the first field in the compont key definition is not added as part of the table 
Woops, `player_leave` and `player_join`
What happens when we put Bootstrap components inside a GWT HorizontalPanel, as example? In bootstrap 1.x, It was a bug, I didnt tested in this version yet... 
If my opinion can be useful, I'd say that, taking a look at the aim of spring-boot, a default configuration for resource filtering is a good thing to have, but it must be the proper configuration, not something that clashes with other pieces of the Spring Framework; hence my proposal.  The parent project **spring-boot-starter-parent**, as per doc, should provide "sensible resource filtering" - so I think that it's good to enable filtering. If somebody doesn't want any filtering in order to do everything manually, he can just remove the dependency on the parent project and include the pieces he wants to.  At our company we've got some parent poms which we use in a very similar fashion of **spring-boot-starter-parent** , and we like such project because we could just drop them and use spring-produced ones, which are good and well maintained. In our parent poms we employed filtering just like the configuration I proposed, and I must say it is **extremely hard** for filtering to be triggered inadvertently - if you need to filter anything, you'll have to do something like    Which is unlinkely to clash with anything else. And using it to match the version, the build number (like @dsyer suggested), along with the changeset, is precisely what we do (with great joy).  Don't fear the filtering :-) 
Sure, I save list position like this:  @Override     public void onScroll(AbsListView view, int firstVisibleItem, int visibleItemCount, int totalItemCount) {         this.firstVisible = firstVisibleItem;     }  @Override     public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) {         super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);         outState.putInt(KEY_LIST_POSITION, firstVisible);     }   @Override     public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {         super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);         getListView().setOnScrollListener(this);         if (savedInstanceState != null) {             firstVisible = savedInstanceState.getInt(KEY_LIST_POSITION);         }     }   private void renewListPosition() {         getListView().setSelection(firstVisible);     }   
Sorry but i still get the same error http://paste.ee/p/3Mkh0 if i add galacticraft again it works fine but i dont like that oxygen system... 
Sorry, I completely spaced on rechecking this!  As of this morning I have checked with Mekanism 5.6.0.639 & EnderIO 1.6.4-0.5.3.129 (Latest off the Jenkins) under 1.6.4 with Forge 953... and I can confirm that it is STILL an issue. Your item conduits can insert INTO a Mekanism machine, but they cannot receive goods FROM a Mekanism machine. I've tried turning on Auto-Eject for the Mek machines, and just setting your item conduits to 'Insert/Extract' (bi-directional mode) but that didn't work. Tried with Auto-Eject and Extract... Extract but no auto-eject. Nothing across all fronts, unfortunately.  I kind of thought that if I just put your item conduits into 'bi-directional' mode and set the mek machines to auto-eject, it would all sort itself out. Alas it does not, tho.  Let me know if you need specific combinations tested! (Promise I won't lose the reminder email this time :P) 
Thank you. With your workaround now it works. 
@michael-coker I was using chrome. If it's not showing up now maybe it was just something random...thanks for looking into this. 
I can confirm, that this error doesn't pop up on my quickly reactivated openhabian running RC1. Following up openhab/openhab-core#903, the error on the Docker instance might be related to directories outside of /openhabian and req only a slight modification of the dockerfile. 
These tests take ages and produce many logs, more than what my terminal can saved. I just copied the last errors found:  It looks like it is always the same problem: OFFLINE vs ONLINE.
It happens with any block I think (Coal generator, Double Crasher, Double Furnace, Atomic Reconstructor confirmed). Here's the crashlog (player tried to place ExUtil thing): http://pastebin.com/gTjGNxJ2 
Yes, its fixed. Thank you very much.
Hi Steven,  sent you details by email. 
Thanks Axel.  Two reasons:  1. Oracle database 12.2 version provides a set of functions that you can use to manage the complexity of passwords.  https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/dbseg/configuring-authentication.html#GUID-F09749BF-2881-4EE5-B59D-041E4796BAC4  On enterprise level, it is quite common to use these, or customize them as per the organization security requirements.  2. Not sure if I'm looking at the correct source code file, but I feel it is hardcoded to "flyway". In my opinion, it should be at least configurable parameter. https://github.com/flyway/flyway/blob/master/flyway-core/src/main/java/org/flywaydb/core/internal/database/oracle/OracleSchema.java

That's fixed++   I'm away for the weekend, but I'll be back on Tuesday to find more bugs :)

hi @danglotb. I'm not sure how to get the whole stack trace, can you help? (I've tried to add the -X option to mvn, but I didn't get more). Thanks a lot.

Here you can download the sample application [testapp.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/1371062/testapp.zip).  The test app is a very simple application that exposes the actuator endpoints. If you run the application as it is, the management port is different from the server port and if you perform an HEAD request on the endpoint http://localhost:8889/management/refresh you receive an internal server error (500 error code).  If you edit the application.yml removing the management.port and management.context-path properties and then execute the HEAD request on the endpoint http://localhost:8888/refresh you receive the Method not Allowed error (405 error code) as expected.  This different behaviour represents a problem into the integration with the Spring boot admin application.  The app has the same behaviour if you don't specify the version 1.5.7 of the actuator library, using the one imported with the dependencies management. 
Execution: http://192.168.134.197/CerberusQA/ExecutionDetail.jsp?id_tc=32251196 Note that this tests uses a static Data Library for the Login (it is OK) and a SQL Query for the Product (not working).  Let me know if you need more information. 
just added it a second ago! :D  it's Paper-"b7dc6fb0" (MC: 1.14.4) (Implementing API version 1.14.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT)
No, I don't think there is such settings. Burp itself is terrible at Unicode. I simply intercept some JSON response and add those characters. I suspect that pasting Unicode isn't supported either, so I paste Base64 encoded text (`0IDQgNCA0IDQgNCA`), and hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B` to decode it in proxy intercept tab. Neither copy nor paste of Unicode works in Burp.  This bug only happens to HTTP response, according to my experiments.

Absolutely, what's the latest ? This works .. eclipse/che-server:5.0.0-latest - 5.5.0 ? What's the latest for that one ?
Actually I encountered this issue while working on issue #94. I was checking functionality and encountered this one. So I opened this issue. 
Works great, thank you!
Device is Allview P5 Quad  http://www.allview.ro/produse/telefoane/lista-telefoane/p5-quad/descriere/  Android 4.1.2/ kernel 3.4.5 c:geo 2014.09.02  It's been a long time since I had this problem, but today I got on a bug reporting spree :-P 
It seems like the latest update for Ice And Fire has fixed the problem, but I have to imagine that it's a coincidence, not an intended fix. 
No. I increased the rarity on a few, but all are enabled.
@eivantsov you're right, now it works fine.
Validated works thanks! 
  On that, ignore the items is part of another problem I was having with updating bootsfaces, I ended up leaving that part of the code that I had put for some testicles. But that's settled.
Just installed Blender 2.73a and it fixes everything! It builds the project and I can see the textures on the model now. Sorry, I thought 2.7 was usable with it.  Thanks again! 
I can try to recreate this. Unfortunately it happened on that device with Samsung's Android rom before I flashed Lineage OS on it for testing. Over weekend I'll try it on a few others and if not then next week try to reinstall samsung and run it again. 
I updated it anyway. I know some of these may be duplicates but it's a chore to try and search each one when Minecraft and chrome are lagging your computer as it is 😆 
It is ~2,650 testcases, across about 200 test classes.  Most are very fast-running, small/lightweight/low memory tests.  Just a handful of them use a lot more memory and run for several seconds.  The suite takes about 3 minutes to run when using gradle to run it across 4 JVM processes in parallel.  So really those numbers are sort of divided by 4 in the process that actually hits OutOfMemoryError.  (In my upcoming experiment to pare down the list to try to narrow down the problem, I'll be turning off parallel runs to help unmuddy the waters.)  I should also have mentioned that we are running everything using Java 8.  And I reproduced the same issue on both Linux and Windows.
Thanks for your reply! It's a standard Jenkins job, not a pipeline. When I use the pipeline snippet generator with my configuration, I get `dependencyCheck additionalArguments: '''--format XML --format HTML --prettyPrint --out target''', odcInstallation: '5.x Latest'` where "5.x Latest" is 5.2.1, which was installed by Jenkins with "install from dl.bintray.com".

Will do today when we try the next caches :)  I have UnifiedNlp installed, so it should be able to get non-GPS positions - but then wifi/cell tower is not nearly good enough for geocaching anyway, so whatever 
Hi Nghi,  Here is the complete model. `time` is the built-in variable (defined by `time = cycle * step`: representing the time in the simulation).  I was expected `t` and `time` to have the same value ... but I do not understand how is computed the `t` value :-)  
Good question. I couldn't tell. What would be a fast VNC server setup to test?
 >  initalizing the client works seamlessly, it connects with the provided consul address to the cluster, connection established ( and connection stays if no sniffer is used ) >  > Node-Sniffer for Java-Rest-Client fails  > parsing the new hostname/ip:port format properly.  then the Node Sniffer kicks in and does its round, parsing the response from the nodes endpoint. here it receives the publish_address in the es7 format hostname/ip:port. the json parser inside the node sniffer parses the value into a String and creates a new URI - here it fails, everything after the slash is considered as a path, the port is neglected and an URI with hostname and port 80 (-1) is created. the sniffer returns the new found nodes, updates the client, no connection anymore.  I will provide the settings file of our cluster if necessary. 
I tried to reproduce it but wasn't able to. It seems the issue has been fixed! Last time I remember seing it was 2 or 3 weeks ago. Since, we moved our frontends to n1-standard-2 instances, maybe it's linked?  I let you close the issue if you want to. I'll reopen it if I see it again in the future.  Thanks! 
Sure thing, I'll do that today, hopefully I won't mess up, that would be my first pull request. I just learned how to synchronized your repos yesterday! It should be done by the time you get up in Marseille:) 
@clintongormley I was using Elasticsearch 2.0 and got the following error  script_score query does not support [file]  It is possible I was doing something else wrong but when I changed "file" to "script_file" it worked ;) 
Well we have 200+ mods and this happens on a specific schematic.  It also crashes the host machine if the same schematic is used and the materials button is pressed.  Same crash log.  Should I be looking for the block of liquid somewhere in the schematic?
Did you try not rebooting, and just re-logging to see if the color broke? 
Sorry ma1co this is a user error on my end.  I tried recording via i720 and it recorded up to 2 hours.  So maybe it doesn't work for all video formats. 
Yes @johspaeth   The test case passes when we change the reference type of `engine` to `AESLightEngine` along with below assertions.  
Version no is 2017.11.06.966. Today, I have upgraded to this version.
@aesteve it might be the case, since we also disabled CBOR for localstack.
I've made a video, replicating the bug on a server: https://youtu.be/3obFdMUsCC4  I'm exchanging simple cobblestone with both diamond and redstone. I'm unable to get serverlogs The bug does not happen when I'm in singleplayer, only on a server  I'm playing the "All The Mods 3" modpack.
Version 7, update 45 (build 1.7.0_45-b18) 
With the new version of the analysis, the analysis correctly reports the finding for the method `decryptAES`.    In total, the detected violations increased by three. One violation for the secret key, one violation for the IV, and one follow violation as the key used in `cipher.init` isn't generated properly.  One question @johspaeth, @kruegers : Shouldn't it be "same" violation for the third parameter as the IV isn't generated correctly as well. At least, that would make sense for me.   Details in the [report](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis/files/2317410/CogniCrypt-Report.txt). 
I upgraded last night to Xubuntu 15.04 to see if that helped (it didn't), previously I was running Xubuntu 14.04.  JRE is 1.8.0_11-b12, although I'm pretty sure 1.7 yields the same problem - I can confirm this if it helps.  Servlet container is vFabric Tomcat Server 2.9.6 which is based on tomcat 7.  I've tested unsuccessfully with JavaCV 0.8, 0.9, and 0.10. 
yes fixed, thanks 
@sriharshachilakapati Just tried to recreate it and I couldn't. Only removed another Class with a main() method (I thought it wouldn't be a problem as it wasn't running but obviusly I was wrong)
Window appeared on my upkeep, and no matter which button I pressed it'd only quicky refresh. 
The device is Samsung Galaxy S3 4.0.4 (an official rom). I noticed another thing - I didn't manage to reproduce it on a Nexus 4 4.4.2, I'll try other devices soon. I'll remove all my disposes see if this helps. 
Still the same error. But maybe now the world is corrupt... 
Thanks, Nick. I'll let you know when I know what the problem is with the code generator! 
Sorry I wasn't exactly clear. I was not able to get ffmpeg working correctly, but I was able to use the java only .bat from 0.2.1-alpha without issues.

my elasticsearch settings?   
No it actually continues to run. It has a Swing GUI and everything else works fine. It just doesn't listen for keys from the hook. I have an error dialog that pops up on a NativeException. Sometimes it pops up and sometimes it doesn't but the bug is always there until I restart the OS.  
I'm not holding on to the call instances, so I'd need something that I can check in the callback. I'm cancelling calls based on their tags. Maybe `Request.isCanceled()`, although I guess that's not quite right. What would also work is have a specific subclass of IOException to catch so that I don't have to do this:

> Does it do that with any other video file? It just looks like that SWF file is corrupted...  @saudet I use FFmpeg instead of FFmpegFrameGrabber to loading the same swf file（in Java program）, and it works. And other video file doesn't have the problem.
I am using choco 4.0.4 - something important related to nogoodprops changed during the two minor versions?
Will record a video for you later today

Finally I could test your new release! Thank you very much for digging into this!  As you suggested in your mail, it works with the new release when I disable the "Use Google Play services: Provider-installer" option in "SSL settings". 😄  After thinking about it I tested with the Play Store version 1.93.3 again, now using the same settings... and it works as well! And I was so sure, that I tested that already. Still confused, that 1.93.1 worked with Play services enabled... 😕 
@normanmaurer Thanks I will check it out and let you know. 
> Can you try to select less text? There is a limit of 2000 character :-D Instead rather add more feedback elements with less selected text  I see, I was not aware of that. It makes sense though (too much payload I guess would strain ArTEMiS in the long run?). It's not a bug then, just a hidden constraint. Resolved.
It seems the array is defined that way, but for this particular network interface the assignment of `sll_halen` must have been set "incorrectly" as 20 (or correctly as 20, but the array was incorrectly defined to be to small for this particular interface!). In any case, they should have been compatible...  I do see the exception in issue's title with an error message saying:  `arr.length: 8, offset: 0, len: 20, arr: <8-bytes-as-hex>`  Note that, `ifconfig` on the computer with the card emits a warning along the similar lines:  `Infiniband hardware address can be incorrect! Please read BUGS section in ifconfig(8)`  (and when the address is listed below this warning in `ifconfig` output, the last 12 bytes were all zeros)  BTW, just to be clear, I'm not saying this is a "bug" of Pcap4j. It's more like an incompatible setting of values in `sockaddr_ll` struct that's coming from libpcap - so it would make more sense that this is fixed there (or in the OS code/structures you linked), but in anycase, safeguarding our code here in Pcap4j wouldn't hurt, and would result in a much faster resolution I think! :)

il will try to dig my home computer for a log tonight. (i think i renamed the log after i came back, so i may still have it). Otherwise, to fix the problem on my home computer, i  deleted the EVA_Propellant.cfg, and it seem to work but crashed later on a invalid checksum.  I also tried to do a "sy down" from a fresh "sy connect" directory but the sync failled on a "invalid checksum". Look like something is corrupt now.

**I originally configured the alert as follows:** Field content value condition Trigger Alert when a message arrives that has  the field "EventID" set to "4725" and then wait at least "1" minute until triggering a new alert. When sending an alert, include the last "1" messages of the stream evaluated for this alert condition.  **But then I changed the alert configuration to the following:** Trigger alert when there are "more" than "1" message in the last "1" minute and then wait at least "1" minute until triggering a new alert. When sending an alert, include the last "1" messages of the stream evaluated for this alert condition.  In both cases, I get the alert once and then all alerts stop, and if I restart the graylog services I can receive the one alert again. I'm not sure what else to look at.  Thanks for any suggestions or help you can provide.

Hi tim,  Played around tonight, what about setting the event time to the epruntime current time when the context is replay and the event time is greater than the epruntime current time? 
Did that and still have an exception saying that javascript files couldn't be written.  The issue doesn't occur if I use the previous version. So it has to be caused by something that changed.
mtotschnig's issue is exactly the same as mine.

Unfortunately this issue is different from the one that we have already discussed on the ML: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rdf4j-users/eER3QQwoPOw/HpcYfadYAgAJ  Let me explain.  The issue on the ML concerns the project `rdf4j-runtime`, which is no longer available as a JAR artifact. This problem affects dependency management by Maven (which I use to build my projects).  This issue concerns the project `rdf4j-runtime-osgi` that should build an OSGi bundle containing all classes and resources corresponding to RDF4J's runtime: you can think of this bundle as a sort of fat JAR aggregating all RDF4J's jars (without the dependencies) plus some metadata (in `MANIFEST.MF`) of interest for an OSGi framework. I use this bundle when deploying my OSGi-based applications that use RDF4J.  I think that some change in the build process of  `rdf4j-runtime-osgi` has erroneously excluded most classes and resources from the aggregate.

Yes, for each MC versions I created a solo game, saved it, and then quit MC. Tried also with MC 1.6.4, and amidst works correctly. Tried also with MC 1.4.7, and amidst crashes.  But I found something interresting, there is a problem between MC launcher 1.6.61 (I do not tried with other launchers) and MC versions lower than 1.6 :  In the launcher, I create a profile lower than 1.6 (1.5.2 for exemple) and then I redefine in the profile editor an other game directory. Then I start MC and created a solo game, cut just one tree, save my game and quit MC. After that I reopen MC and my solo game have been disapeared.  I open my file explorer and the world files are correctly stored in the new directory. Then I'm going into the original saved game directory and I find a second directory corresponding to my world, but this one is really badly configured. I suppressed this directory and copy my world save from the new directory to the original. I start MC and it's magic : my solo world now exists. I open it and play again before save it and quit MC. Then with my explorer, in the new directory, files dates correspond to me playing time. But in the original MC directory, files dates are wrongs.  Si I deduce that MC loads game from the original saved games directory, but stores it in the new directory. With MC version higher or equal than 1.6, this problem doesn't exist.  I don't know if there is a relation between this fact and my problem with the use of MC < 1.6 but I find this coincidence really strange. So I created a new profile in 1.5.2 with the original game directory, created a world, played just one minute, saved it and then quit, but amidst crashed again.  PS : I know there are a lot of english faults ... I'm sorry and hope that you will understand what i tried to talk about ... I'm french ^^

I tested with the latest development version and it doesn't open pdf file second time. It opens only first time. So there is same bug.
Luigi, The sequence is correct, but on my db, there is no uuid property.  Only a property named __uuid which contains a value of 'uuid'.  Our data is gone!  Looking at json file all data is intact.

As described in p.1.2.1.1 official documentation (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.1/pdf/Development_Guide/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform-6.1-Development_Guide-en-US.pdf): "JBoss EAP 6 is a certified implementation of the Java Enterprise Edition 6 Full Profile and Web Profile specifications."

The my web.xml specified as standard for Servlet 3.0:    My atmosphere app is work correctly, except only impossibility getting AtmosphereFramework from servlet context. 
The game seems to be loading without Thermal Foundation. But obviously it show that this mod could not be found. On another note the dev build is been buling for 18 hours . I assume thats not normal?  
Hi,  I tested using the latest SNAPSHOT, same issue (wether with spring boot 2.0.0 or 2.0.1). Also, the case appears each time (for the first as for the following).  What do you want to say when you say "Does it affect your WebFluxes" ?  I can take some time to prepare a reproducible case to give you more facilities to figure out the problem if you need it ?  Thank you for your help.
How do I get this list of bytecodes?     There are classes that have like 5 errors in same method. I will try  to reproduce it in shorter class  when I get home. 
**what happens exactly?**  The app crashes if you search for a video a second time. (if search history is enabled)  **Describe step-by-step**  1. Go to the privacy session in the settings. 2. Uncheck "Disable Search History". 3. Restart the application. 4. Click on the "Search Video" button 5. Perform search of any video normally. 6. Click the "Search Video" button again.   Do it will crash, with (or without) Internet, because of Searsh History. If disable the resource of "Search History" will not crash.  **What is the version of your app?**  My Smartphone is um LG E470f with android OS version 4.1.2 kernel 3.4.0 The version of instaled Skytube is 2.964 (of 2019-09-09), downloaded per F-Droid per link [ https://f-droid.org/packages/free.rm.skytube.oss/ ]   This time I tried to improve my English essay post with the help of google translate to improve your understanding of this crash.
What do you mean "image = null". It is only occur in one device when I test with about 3 devices. Thanks 
I think the suggestion Radu posted (i.e. continually increasing) makes best sense because chapter numbers are usually quoted independently (e.g. ch. 9), not as a portion of the containing part (e.g.  ch V.2)

yes, the error is still popping up every time I try to log in

I'm running MusicCabinet 0.7.24c.  The version of DSub doesn't seem to matter since I update automatically so I'm always on whatever is the most recent on google play.   I'm still trying to figure out how to reproduce the problem.  I went to check my phone and it did occur but I can't make it happen on command.  My usual usage of the app is in my car so I will have songs queued up and playing through the aux. port.  Once I get where I'm going I pull the cable from the port (autopauses the song).   I'll use other apps fine throughout the day and once I go back to use the app a few hours later I will usually run into the issue where I can view everything but the tracks in an album.    I tried to use the "Send log" and send it to my google drive but it captures A LOT more than just things related to dsub. I would have to remove a lot of information to make it something I could send.  Is it possible to narrow logging down to something only on dsub's end?  
Sure this would work and be thread safe. My thought at initial look was that these classes were not intended to be threadsafe to begin with. And that it would be a requirement of the callers of pause() / resume() to ensure thread safety. On further review, the "compareAndSet" operation was making it thread safe to do. If maintaining thread safety of the Terminal implementations is the goal then we should merge in your change instead. While rare, I can think of cases an application would require multiple threads to handle the pause()/resume() methods.
right, it is a server side issue.

Ah, twould make sense to include that. I am using 4.8.5.147  Edited on original post for reference.
Thank you. I edited a code as you suggested and sent a PR.
The GCal binding (not really a binding) could implement its function without the ConsoleInterpreter.  It has a simple syntax ([wiki](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/GCal-Binding)) where the description field of a Google Calendar entry is in the format:    At the start and end time of the calendar entry, it will either send a command or post an update to the named item with the given state or command.  So GCal could be made to work correctly under OH1 and OH2 if a subset of the ConsoleInterpreter code were incorporated directly into it.  In fact, it would make more sense not to use the ConsoleInterpreter, since the ConsoleInterpreter sends messages to the console, as if someone is issuing commands there.  Another reason not to use the ConsoleInterpreter is that it performs more function than what is documented in the wiki, which seems unsafe in terms of what the user might expect.

Thanks for this amazing fast response. I've just tried using the newly created `spring-data-webflux` from PR #938. My WebFlux application runs successfully but it seems that deserialization is broken for non entity view types when using `bodyToMono`. The deserialization done with all fields assigned to null.

Thank you for the quick response.  "Response Formatted" and "JSON Response" are missing in these cases. I double checked and compared the response body with the body from OkHtth logs and turned out that Peofiler's json has missed some part in the middle.  Copying it with the context menu returns the same corrupted one
No I can't. I should have checked what players were doing at the moment when I was getting those errors.  I tested swimming and running.  That error happened every 4 seconds.  I don't know if this is related or should open a new bug but I'm now getting every 3 seconds this:  `[20:46:29] [Server thread/WARN]: [ExtraHardMode] Task #61 for ExtraHardMode v3.7.1 generated an exception java.lang.NullPointerException `

Reason is simple, the SVG parser stumbles accross `-inkscape-font-specification`. Please find attached a simplified SVG showing the problem.  [crash.zip](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/files/3120898/crash.zip)  
The way I noticed this was due to an error I made while working on the async source downloading and accidentally truncated the container state files. But yes, it can also happen if the user deletes/moves these state files, or due to us making a mistake and change the name of the plugin (which results in a different folder to be used to the files) or making some changes to the deserialization process that leads to error when reading older state files. I won't consider this issue critical due to hopefully small chance of it happening, but if it happens, fixing it is rather tedious.
I did report it to them as well first, any tips for me to pass along to them to try and make them compatible on their side?
Hi @a-hacker,  thanks for the quick response. If it's that hard to access the plugin's saved data, I do think such a button should exist somewhere hidden in the options. But in any case, yes, I can probably manage building the plugin myself from some branch containing this feature. I'd be thankful if you could put that together.
Installed from google play. Will try turning off background refresh and will see if that helps.
@thboileau The problem has been resolved in 2.3.10. Thanks for the rapid response!
Hello, The version is v1.3.6 when i installed it for the first time last week. After you replied my answer, i reinstall the plugin with the version v1.4.0 again and then i found the same problem again. 
Removing the label also resolved the issue.  So it does appear to be the combination of the label and the let statement together.

I found out the problem. It's not related to a particular android version. If a phone call is on and you open the video call with open vidu and then you turn off the phone call, android doesn't set the output audio, so you can't ear the other user. On iOS this doesnt happen. 
I tried to extract something I could post, but failed. Then I removed the affected folder from my workspace and re-added - and, presto, no problem any more.

Hi,  I still dont know... As from the beggining, using the alternative player or the old one worked for me...  According to Google :-) my board is am805w with mali450 graphics https://androidtvbox.eu/x96-mini-android-tv-box-powered-amlogic-s905w-chipset-now-24-99-promo/  So i Never investigate on this. Maybe i am wrong, i didn't found a resize feature? The video appears like a small windows (i am not in windows mode...) without border on the center right side of a black screen. Maybe you can guide me to send you debug logs, etc...? I would be more than Happy. But since the old player feature is going to disappear, maybe juste allowing playlist to be all played with the alternative player would be a simple solution for those like me...? I can't tell about how much people encounter that 'bug'.... Regards, Fred
yep,  I don't have a strong use case either. I just wanted to clean up some stuff on my local machine and have pressed the "delete course button" in ArTEMiS (UI) and it failed.   I just wanted to note this "issue" down.  
Strangely enough: After I tear it all down and [made a different setup](http://puu.sh/ApXiH/21e91bc47b.jpg), it worked. I'm really not sure because I did everything the same, except I used a new set of Values. I didn't changed anything else...  To another point: Is it possible to add a XOR (and maybe a NXOR) modifier for Boolean? That would be really convenient.  I'm really sorry If I caused trouble here. I'm glad it works now...
From State 1 it goes to State 2, instead of showing State 3. I hope it makes more sense now.  ![state-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20538778/20617192/680be4a0-b2df-11e6-8b90-9a37ef2540a3.png) ![state-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20538778/20617193/681317ac-b2df-11e6-917e-aa04a71376d9.png) ![state-3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20538778/20617194/682e94dc-b2df-11e6-9da9-5db1275cd8d4.png)

Yes. I tried both with and without the cert. Burp works (also with it's cert), and the proxy settings are the same just different ports. I think it might be related to Java.

Hello all,  @DemonTPx - right, I'm on AWS RDS Aurora MySQL 5.6.10a - that is the only version which is supported by Aurora Serverless in my region.  @maxvisser -  Since it is a serverless version, there's no access to the instance, but the DB could be accessed from other clients via the same SSH tunnel and using the same configuration.  I've just checked using dbeaver v6.2.4 - the problems still persists there.
The absolute latest experimental build, and the build after the header fix. It's very inconsistently reproducible and goes away with a restart, but it always comes back eventually.

I am using Buildcraft.  Odd thing happened.. I can reproduce this all day long in a production/test world.  I made a new world just for grins and I cannot reproduce this issue.  I'm able to get buckets out of gasoline drums all day long.  Any thoughts on this?

Well done man ! 
@ripcurlx , I got the popup and I deleted the offer and created a similar one anew. If I switch from % to fixed price for BTC, I'm still able to recreate this issue ![Screenshot from 2019-05-03 18-23-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45173186/57147724-e7bc1900-6dd0-11e9-9da8-d53ca7c527e6.png) ![Screenshot from 2019-05-03 18-23-51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45173186/57147725-e7bc1900-6dd0-11e9-9e8a-6bf8e5b79bc5.png) ![Screenshot from 2019-05-03 18-23-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45173186/57147726-e7bc1900-6dd0-11e9-9dbe-1463a63864e3.png)   
Thanks for the response!  The instabug-reactnative is the only dependency in the project. It should be reproducible by creating a new project, installing instabug, linking it, and then running on Android.  I’ve reproduced it in two separate apps (example app linked to above).  Has instabug been confirmed to work with the latest version of React Native?

Thanks for the quick response. Unfortunately I can't share the file because it holds sensitive information, and therefore I can't use the online validator either. I downloaded the 64bits for Windows - We run Windows 7 Entreprise. I will see if I can dig further and maybe reproduce.  
The only way I can think of making it farmable is by making the stem drop a cap and the fully grown one drop two caps and then having them placeable, but that sounds weird.
Sorry, my bad I missed to copy binaries/applet file. Thank you. 
@kbagchiGWC Hard here means it didn't happen to all our real end user.  I firstly found it in Fabric, then we reproduced it during our test.  This morning, I reproduced it in the voice-quickstart-android project.  You can reproduce it by simple doing:  Make a call, hang up, make another call, hang up, and so on.

Hi! I think it might have been a problem on my end... I ended up deleting and recreating the .pgd. Works great so far, but I'll reopen if I run into problems again!
Sorry, the project is a larger project that I can't share. It's been mostly built by other developers.   I can try to give a little more context to see if it helps at all. We're using Struts 2. The project structure consists of parent artifact with several modules. I've included the above configuration in the WebApp child module. Not sure if maybe other plugins could interfere. If nothing comes to mind, I'll try to re-create the issue in a test project. Might be some time before I get to posting that though.

Hello, I've tried using it but its not selecting sim. Calls not connecting as well. Sorry for the delay in response.
> Could you clarify what error you're referring to and what fixes it on master (if you know)?  This commit is the one that I believe fixes the PendingTrace cleanup: https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/commit/e51708023437b168b42e8592e4c12680016126b4#diff-28ebab7e0711a0924cd60c0e28ab0f06R253   If I've read and understood the code correctly, prior to this there were two span cleaners. One that was a static member of the PendingTraces class and another that was instanced in with the start of the scheduled thread. As PendingTraces were created, they were getting pushed into the class static member but, since that wasn't the one running in the thread, the traces were never getting cleaned up.   I see that it's built up using weakreferences. I can't explain why it's holding the memory or how exactly the JVM decides to clean those up. What we've found in practice is that we have a large number of PendingTraces on some of our production servers and it's not getting cleaned up even when forcing a GC via VisualVM. On a smaller scale, I see the same thing with the steps to reproduce I described before. I see the PendingTrace in VisualVM and forcing a GC run doesn't seem to clean it up.  >Meanwhile, you can disable the client instrumentation: -Ddd.integration.jax-rs-client.enabled=false  I'm looking at switching to HttpUrlConnection instead of disabling this. There's other advantages for us to make this switch as well.
I did a clean, then searched for MANIFEST.MF.  Not found.  I changed it to this:   Got this in the final manifest:      SCM-Revision: ${git.commit.id}, ${git.commit.id}     stuff: somestuff  No, the jar doesn't have the git.properties file, but it was stored in target/classes.  I'll try building a test case for this tomorrow.

Okay this is very odd. I downloaded the source via the releases, and downloaded the latest over there. Once I extract said zip, I get a lot more classes than there are in this repository.  Edit: I just figured out that the releases is about the whole repo, not branch dependant, whoops!   I guess it is a fail on my end. Im sorry for my derpyness, Ill just the get the API directly from this repository since this is supposed to be stable :p   However, I found out this is happening in the nextGen branch (I definitely derped earlier), since that is the latest release. Here is a list of the API's which import from inner classes: - buildcraft.api.blueprints   - MappingRegistry   - Schematic   - SchematicBlock   - SchematicEntity   - SchematicMask   - SchematicTile - buildcraft.api.core   -  Position - buildcraft.api.filler   - IFillerPattern  I kinda hope Im right about those, otherwise it is really embarrassing for me.. Anyway, I hope I kinda helped and now I can develop my mod :)  And off-topic: this really is an  awesome mod! 
> How does this happen? I think this PR just get merged with tests passed.  My guess is that  forgot to update.
Thanks you for looking at this.  I reduced the DDL down to 4 tables and on my install it still shows.   Postgres version: `psql (PostgreSQL) 9.6.2`  The DDL I used for the screenshot in this comment is:   Result: <img width="1402" alt="screen shot 2017-04-09 at 21 43 14" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1697731/24840447/98ac4c5a-1d6d-11e7-8ace-f21b72e34da2.png"> 
Activating abilities and casting spells etc. at the end of an opponent's turn would probably occur more often than doing nothing during an opponent's turn.  It's the last possible moment to use any mana available, and would be very useful. 
I would prefer the email, but that should also work. You should be able to see some red stuff, click on it to expand it and take a screenshot of that. 
Yes, assign it to me ... but I didnt start yet 
You are welcome @davivel . I just tried it in Android Studio once more, with an emulator. Of the 40 times that I chose 'ReRun Selected Configuration' I noticed that the problem appeared only twice. I tried it in my Xperia Arc and the problem appeared nine out of ten. So I set about finding the delay that would solve the problem for Arc as it was more reproducible. Adding various delays, to the runnable in startSyncFolderOperation of FileDisplayActivity the following table can be constructed:  | Added Delay (ms) | Successful Refresh (dotted animation appearing on startup) | | --- | --- | | 50 | 0/10 | | 100 | 0/10 | | 150 | 2/10 | | 200 | 7/10 | | 250 | 7/10 | | 300 | 9/10 | | 350 | 10/10 | 
I am slowly working through mods through a busy week - obviously just Astral on its own doesn't do it 😜   Is it based on Random Tick? I could ramp up the speed of that to test faster 🤔
@khotyn  The problem is described as follows: `org.springframework.beans.factory.ListableBeanFactory#getBeanNamesForType` is a common method invoked frequently when refresh spring application context, such as autowire constructor injection. This method is used to get bean names according to the specified type. It will scan all bean definitions and fetch bean type.   If this bean is a `FactoryBean` , Spring IOC will generate a shortcut instance(early stage of bean instance), generally, the shortcut instance will return the type of object that this `FactoryBean` creates, however, if null is return, the shortcut instance will fall back to full creation. It may be lead to some problems, once the `FactoryBean` is fully created, then the subsequent `BeanPostProcessor` would not apply this `FactoryBean`, such as `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`  
There is no CREATE TABLE clause, only the code above. Is there something i missed?  thanks for your time 
Here are a couple of examples:  `NegativeArraySizeException` : "01020000000000FFFF" `OutOfMemoryError` : "01020000000000FF7F"  
> Do you run Che as root?

Edit: I realise this doesn't show off the IC2: Uranium issue, but it's much the same. I just found it easier to test with Manyullyn  Found this in the latest release of Forever Stranded: Losts Souls Modpack.  However this was confirmed by creating a new profile and loading the mods listed below. The last three aren't necessary, but they list the heat source in JEI as x6 for Manyullyn, and The One Probe shows multiplier as x0. Loading the crucible with cobblestone also does not generate lava.  - TConstruct-1.12.2-2.10.0.75 - Mantle-1.12-1.3.2.24 - exnihilocreatio-1.12-0.2.2 - jei_1.12.2-4.9.1.175 - JustEnoughResources-1.12.2-0.8.7.41 - theoneprobe-1.12-1.4.22  HeatRegistry Attached: https://pastebin.com/hzAGs4KL ![2018-05-22_12 19 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30785466/40338798-9912f048-5dba-11e8-93b7-2e8d0474f204.png)   
@srkukarni some schedulers might support different features than others w.r.t. the ability to support profiling, heap/thread dumping, etc. Ideally they would all support these things but we don't require that they all do currently.  That's a separate issue though than what I was referring to. I want to be able to step through code in a debugger in my IDE, which means being able to insert JVM args like `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005` into the java command for example.  Here's how I've manually hacked into the `heron_executor.py` `_get_java_instance_cmd` method (in my working branch) to make a java instance start with these args: https://github.com/twitter/heron/pull/1807/files#diff-2a669e084143b86b5766a49245f8e357  Being able to pass an argument or probably to set an environment variable when submitting a topology to have this effect would be really helpful when developing/debugging in localmode.
1. Singleplayer 2. Very accurate 3. Sky Odyssey  Well, I did a restart and it has been good for nearly an hour. Not sure if it is fixed, but it seems a bit random. I didn't change anything.
To me, the most convenient would be the long wait support, but it's no big deal if there isn't; In my case I can workaround it easily by scaling the values.  The bigger problem was the time it took me to realize this was the source of my problems; Hence the exception suggestion. 
according to FMD it is 1.4 (1.5.2_1.4.2.1)

For the Nether world, I just have it to be default.  I ran "/mv create skyworld_nether nether" and used that. 
Sheesh, has it been a month already? Sorry for taking so long.  As of the latest TiC build, this doesn't seem to occur. Thanks for keeping this mod maintained!  Now I just need to figure out why my modpack can't load a world on the newer Forge versions so I can update TiC. [Edit: Updating mods is important, the pack loads now]
@MrDodojo  I don't have Chrome installed, I do have [Bromite WebView](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) But I'm not sure if that is the cause of the problem.
The result is not checked for signing key e.g.  After injecting the key no exception occured and everything worked well. Of course, the issue is for communication requiring message signing.

Ah, got it, yep, it sounds like my `target/classpath.txt` got out of sync. Not sure what happened, but I moved over to `es4x-cli` and after doing `yarn install` I see that `es4x postinstall` ran automatically and `target/classpath.txt` has the latest/great jars listed. I'll close this out as not reproducible. Thanks!

In my case zuul-powered service is the first one to handle the request. Maybe that matters. I will try to provide sample project 
I am able to reproduce the error. It seems to be a limitation of the file names.  On the same setup I am able to diff a file named example.db but not a file named 172.1.1.1 
Sorry about the long delay in getting back to you. The link I downloaded from did not make the version clear, and as it turns out it was 1.11.2-4.2.0.16 I had downloaded. updated and the issue is now fixed. Thank you for your help. Closing Issue.
Of Course:    If run a sample project generated by AS, it's work well. If generate same view in project, the error still there.

I do not have console access; I am actually another plugin dev who the server owners contacted about this.  It looks like the inventory clone isn't doing the trick. Normal horses have a `HorseInventory` object that has specific definitions for the saddle and armor slot, and these don't exist in the `Inventory` object inherited from `LivingEntity`. I know there is also a `LlamaInventory` that does the same thing. But all the other horse types, I haven't found a good way to access saddles. Type casting the inventory won't do either.  I haven't been super pleased with the 1.11.x APIs from Spigot for these reasons...
We're building with gradle, and the relevant part of our resolution strategy is that we don't allow dependencies with conflicting versions. E.g: `configurations.all { 	resolutionStrategy { 		failOnVersionConflict() 	} }` We can solve this by excluding transitive dependencies for a given dependency, and lock down the version by defining an explicit dependency. This we must live with when separate dependencies have transitive conflicts, but we prefer not to do so for a single dependency in isolation.
I tried the version: everything ok again. Can be closed. Dot set? I never used this...
I will try some more tests to determine. I noticed it on the one I posted, so I mentioned it. I will follow up with some simpler test projects to demonstrate this.
My Android phone is  8.1.0 and I have tested on Genymotion Android Emulator with Android 7.0 but got the same exception.  Update: **your fix worked well on Android now.**

Yes, what's the best way to submit a patch? 
I was using the store data and just doing the same things the QS tutorial does, except I was experimenting with mapping and reorg'in the Product data. I believe the long collection names were just the ones that get created by persisting the model. Because I hadn't noticed them before, I went "Hmm, what's in here?" and got myself in all this trouble.  I've tossed all that atm, but will update this with explicit steps once I have a clean tutorial project again.

I tried with both upgrade and doing a fresh install on the Nextcloud app. It could be to do with the odd file-system layout on the original fairphones. The internal nand is partitioned into a 1GB "Internal Storage" and a 13GB "Phone storage" (this is before you add an SD card).  https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/201327645-What-is-the-storage-layout-of-the-Fairphone-1-  I previously had the Nextcloud app on the "Phone storage" internal partition.
It was enabled by default not explicitly. Thank you! Disabling hardware acceleration in the activity fixed the issue. What it does to the performance we have to wait and see.  The official Android doc site mentions this problems too: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html  
I've modified SipServletRequest.java as suggested, but unfortunatelly the issue still exists. I've attached the log file (I've turned on TRACE level logging for org.mobicents.servlet.sip classes): [slessEL01a.zip](https://github.com/RestComm/sip-servlets/files/104939/slessEL01a.zip)  In this scenario the application server sends OPTIONS messages periodically to the endpoints, first NPE occured at 2016-01-26 14:17:13,395, sortly after we've blocked all endpoint addresses via an iptables rule. 
filename: LuckPerms-Sponge-3.0.71.jar it looks like the most recent version is .74, will update and and check to see if the problem persists.

@eivantsov and @sleshchenko thank you for pointing me in the right direction.  I have been able to dig deeper over the past couple of days into this and been able to achieve some progress.  The pods were not being created by the infra provider even though the Che logs stated the workspaces were being created. I found that this whole issue was mainly due to this [method](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/a2473aee7545392eaeab4b3b0e3d8f1e464db110/wsmaster/che-core-api-workspace/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/workspace/server/WorkspaceSharedPool.java#L42) which uses the the value [che.workspace.pool.exact_size](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/a2473aee7545392eaeab4b3b0e3d8f1e464db110/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/che/che.properties#L58) to determine how many threads are created for asynchronous workspaces tasks (eg. starting/stopping). By default this value is set to number of cores*2.  If a lot of workspaces are created, they sort of pile up since the no. of workspaces is larger than the number of threads that can be created, and before the pods are even created and the workspace start is actually carried out, a lot of them exceed the [che.infra.kubernetes.workspace_start_timeout_min](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/a2473aee7545392eaeab4b3b0e3d8f1e464db110/assembly/assembly-wsmaster-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/che/che.properties#L352) causing the above errors and workspace start failures.   The logs on the other hand do not reflect this internal queuing up and workspaces and only say `Starting workspace 'admin/workspace-name' with id 'workspace-id' by user 'admin'` before proceeding to throw the error `Failed to start Kubernetes runtime of workspace workspace-id. Cause: Waiting for Kubernetes environment 'default' of the workspace'workspace-id' reached timeout`.  Not sure if the logs can be made more verbose and accurate but that would probably help.  
Ok,its just like this  please wait me uploding thx   
When typing in "rivier", there is the autosuggestion "Aankomsttijden water vanuit de rivier" (which is the title of a dataset). When selecting this autosuggestion (so the search term becomes "Aankomsttijden water vanuit de rivier") and pressing the Search button, there are no results. When searching on just "rivier", the dataset does show up in the results.  I think these are all the language settings: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8331091/7838230/15c37742-048c-11e5-83f0-b3c24eade6ea.png) 
thanks hylke for the link. I tried those solutions and a few others. Here are some observations 1. The jixb-m2e connector does not want to install on my current version of eclipse and m2e (there seems to be some version mismatch) 2. The above solutions are good to mostly ignore those build options in eclupse but not to get maven m2e plugin to include them and perform binding and packaging. Also, the jixb in GSN has configuration lines to bind files in a specific directory. I tried searching online but could not find a way to include config information in <lifecycleMappingMetadata>. 3. I managed to run GSN from cmd using maven command after playing around with the start.bat and stop.bat file. That works well. I will shortly checkin the updated .bat files.  The question is now, what version of eclipse, m2e and jixb converter was used to setup GSN. That way we can resort to a common operating platform.  
@spinscale  1) - I don't know if it's happens on a non-scripted field - I don't have any fields that are always the same ratio of another field for comparison  2)  https://gist.github.com/yehosef/f96dc491bcd5ee9bf7d3 is the query I also included the index template - perhaps it's related to doc_values.    3) I'm not sure if I can share the data right now - if you contact me at my name at gmail, I can probably give you temp access to the marvel/kibana install. Because store is off for everything, you can't see the values but it might help in the debug.  If that doesn't help we can look at giving access to the data.  To give some background - this is a testing server to test load/capabilities for a server.  We have storing all fields to "off" and are using doc_values.  It's a single 16G machine with 8G heap - 220M rows, ~60G storage.

I have a server developed by nodejs with socket.io 1.4.5 ( working with both js and C++ client), i'm trying to convert my server to netty-socketio 1.7.11 When i done some feature, i test with web client, use socket.io ---> it's work well with all feature : connect/ disconnect/ event, broadcast ... But when i use my C++ client, i get error when connect to server. I'm try read in C++ lib and see :  https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/cocos/network/SocketIO.cpp    but, in java when read b64 use Integer type :    List<String> b64 = queryDecoder.parameters().get("b64"); ... if (b64 != null && b64.get(0) != null) {                     **Integer enable = Integer.valueOf(b64.get(0));**  --> this throw exception :(                      ctx.channel().attr(EncoderHandler.B64).set(enable == 1);                 }  I don't know i need change lib in cocos2d-x framework or add try catch in this to work, because both libs I also use binary version :(  Thanks for listening and support!!! 👍

On my phone ATM, let me do some testing first, I will come back and post my results. Like most problems with fundamental features: they need to work with the live server. Our live server runs ~75 plugins, but the feature only recently broke, and essx wasnt updated (my best guess is a conflict with TokenEnchant).   I will post the results with interactions with diff plugins, and hopefully fix the problem that way.

In swagger UI, the behaviour changes for this test:    As I said, with JAX-RS's `@PathParam`, the behaviour is the same with or without the `@Consume`, but if you use RESTEasy's `@PathParam`, Swagger UI requires a body if you add the `@Consume`

My thoughts, as well. I'm running against a multi-module project with the Enunciate goal added to one of the sub modules. I've tried building just the module, as well as the entire project to no avail.  The project is using Sping 3.1.1.RELEASE. 
  It's possible that I'm wrong. But I thought that the above is a different type of "secure" alert box that cannot be interacted with from withing ios-driver. 
@kevinushey Yup, removing the emoji from that line seemed to have fixed it! Thank you, that's so interesting that it would have such an effect.
Doesn't seem the case. To test I have done this:  1) Select distinct uuid from metadata --> 90 values, same as the total records  2) Do a CSW GetRecords with maxRecords=100 to get all results (90) and with a xslt process extract the uuids   3) Compare the uuids from 1) and 2). The uuids are the same  The problem happens when pagination is used. 
I have to sheepishly admit I haven't written LibGDX unit tests before, I've been needing to get around to doing it for my own project anyway so I guess now's the time to figure that out :P  Through some further testing I can confirm this only occurs with the PooledEngine, I have reverted back to Engine and created my own 'create' methods as such (so as not to break the rest of my code in the mean while) that just return new instances...    ...and everything is happy. This at least narrows it down specifically to the reuse of entities in the PooledEngine. 
You're saying that for a config that should only matter server-side, I have to change it clientside as well? What? Not to mention it says itself Gamerule is used for new worlds, meaning it applies the config Gamerule on creation. The Client shouldn't matter at all for that.

Yes, I think so. As its flaky and we will (hopefully) build only a few times on 1.4.x, master alone is ok.
  the byte arrays get modified by the tests 
LOL no worries...I wish I had more information, but I haven't tried it again since that happened.  We've stuck to just the straight Hermitpack installation from Curse with no other mods added to the server.  On my end, I did add WAILA and it's associated mods (WAILA, -harvestability, and WAWLA).  As far as I can tell, we have only vanilla horses.  EnderZoo is part of the pack, but it doesn't add horses.  (I didn't even know there was a mod that added horses...I've seen the cow/pig mod, but that's it.)  I'll see if I can tame a horse I'm not attached to like I was to Bullseye.  She was an awesome horse, and I've setup a small memorial to her in my village that I've taken over.  BTW I love your mod...I seem to find some new toy every day to play with.

@Nimrodda Thank you for the quick response.  It works fine with swiping the pages.  In fact I've also observed that it doesn't notify about all of the subpages when you go back with back button.  `onStepChanged()` is called for the `5` element even if you press back button 4 times and finally you are on the `2` element. After a delay and pressing back button once again, it logs `1`:   
Hello @giraud!  I followed your suggestion and invalidated caches - all good now! I did try that before, but I also updated IDEA this time. Perhaps either a batched update process, or maybe the plugin was depending on something that wasn't in the old version. I have preference folders for 2016.2 and 2017.3 in ~/Library/Preferences.

Great, thank you for such a quick reaction. Version 2.8.9 build 2326 seems to work fine. I once got some exception but am currently unable to reproduce it. It will probably come up again when I pass this version to the team. Hopefully I will be able to provide some valuable debug then.  I had to symlink the plugin directory (`ln -s plugins-2.8.9 plugins-2.8.8`). Without it I received an error indicating the ganttproject (GP) was unable to find resources.  I tested various scenarios: * externally lock with USER_1, TOKEN_A, GP unlock with USER_1 - SUCCESS (OK), * externally lock with USER_2, TOKEN_A, GP unlock with USER_1 - DENIED by 403 from the server after GP's attempt to unlock (OK), * GP lock, save project - SUCCESS (OK), * GP lock, GP unlock - SUCCESS (OK).  Saving with acquired lock works. I can see the "If" header in the packet dump.  Padlock is visible whenever there is a lock on file. My login next to the padlock is visible only if GP acquired the lock during the current session. Stale lock (after killing -9 the GP) is not recognized by GP as its own lock (no login next to the green padlock) and it seems perfectly logical (just noting it).
1.12.2-0.9.5 of ID and 1.12-2.3.6.13 of thermal, looks like the newest ones.

I haven't experienced this problem. How often you experience this problem? Can you explain how can you reproduce this problem.  wait you're gonna use c++ dll injections? Wouldn't that trigger the game's handle detectors? I mean its not opening any handles and modifying them, but it's certain that its modifying something it's injecting a dll.   I'm not exactly sure how to reproduce this problem, but I'm in Windows 7 so I think it's an OS exclusive problem. (I would move to Win10 soon just enjoying the 7's company till it ends in 2020) But it's exactly that download a beatmap on an actual browser that osu!mer is assigned in and try to exit the browser then play a multiplayer game then download a beatmap then osu!mer would download the beatmap but won't import it.
I cannot find the file you have mentioned (I'm running the modpack from the Twitch launcher if that changes anything).  EDIT: I still haven't found the file but I did find something - when shooting a shuriken (it spawns particles behind it) with endspeed (meaning it doesn't drop) into unloaded chunks then load those chunks it errors for each shuriken shot as they just hang there until I load the chunks.
I don't really know how to explain this either, but I'll try my best.  It seems like Essentials only blocks commands by plugins who have registered it. Plugins like ChatControl or other others that lets you "create your own command" technically don't register the command. They just match what you type you chat and execute the command.  Take ChatControl for example, you can create your own command. However, those commands aren't registered, therefore Essentials can't even pick it up. 
We are using Version 1.7.0. Thus, this is somehow an issue in our environment. I'm going to debug into it.  Update 1: slingRequest.getAttribute("com.day.cq.wcm.componentcontext").getParent() is not null, don't know why, still investigating. But seems not to be a  component-error handler issue.  Update 2: while calling a not existing page in CQ 5.6.1 the IncludeOptions in WCMComponentFilter are null, thus the currentPage is null and the a context stack is bulit with two component contexts (a PageComponentContextImpl and a TopLevelComponentContextImpl). I've disabled all of our custom made filters, same behavior. Thus this behavior seems to be by design. Maybe, checking componentContext.isRoot() is not enough. Maybe, an additional check for TopLevelComponentContextImpl is needed? 
2.5.0 didn't change this as far as I can tell. The exception happens in OkHttp code, where `java.net.URI` is indeed used (stack trace with 2.5.0):   
The SDK version is 19,I just change LinearLayout to ScrollView,and here my code.Thank you!

Good Dy Mr Arduino, this should good posted too, you have no concern for cusotmer concerns whatsoever.

No, I did not rotate the images in CEWE. There are rotated fotos in the pdf document that are landscape in the original file and in the foto book, others are landscape but I chose only a straight formatted part of it in the foto book. 
I just tested and now it works perfectly now. It would be great to see a new release with this fix in maven central soon. Thanks for fixing it !
nope i get it only for VinObdCommand. The only commands i run before are LIneFeedOff, EchoOff and AutoProtocol.  I have run the '09 02' command from other ELM327 clients as well and it seems like ':' is the part of response sent.  Got this explanation from a site(http://tunertools.com/prodimages/obdpros/manuals/obdpro_datasheet.pdf):  CAN systems will display this information  in a format shown below   > 0902  > 014   > 0: 49 02 01 59 56 31   > 1: 4D 53 33 38 32 32 36   > 2: 32 31 36 36 35 36 33  
OK, apologies for being vague. In order to invoke the issue, in my pom I specify:  gwtquery 1.4.3-SNAPSHOT enhance-plugin 1.0.5  The issue is that when I drag an element, in IOS I just see RETTT in the console many times. This console message is generated in com.google.gwt.query.client.plugins.events.EventsListener, in it's onBrowserEvent() method.  I tried it on my Nexus 7 and no issue, but on my old ipad IOS 8.1.1, the drag doesn't work, and when I attach the ipad to my IMac, I see the RETTT in the console.  **\* What is quite interesting is that this issue even shows up when I test in SDM mode in Chrome with Touch emulation enabled. When I select Nexus 7 emulation, no problem, but if I select iphone6 or ipad 1/2, I have the issue.  So is it related to my .gwt.xml ?  Here's my gwt.xml:  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <module rename-to="GWT_Module">    </module>

Yes, using Wiifi. It happened with the last version.  I deleted and re-installed  the app several times, but examples are not installed, neither can be re-downloaded.

I guess it only happens on some maps that change the hitsound volume per object. It crashes as soon as I click on an object, the map I linked previously is guaranteed to crash for me.

Hi @Sancretor .  Just define a project name with `:`, i.e: SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe begin /k:"my-valid_project_key" /n:"My Valid: Project Name" 
Hello Jurgen, I will close this issue because it was related for sure to the size of the image we wanted to save but the size was incredibly big and unrealistic due to our miscalculation.
It fails in decode mode by saying:   Invalid dictionary entry format (missing separator). If you take the dictionary at:  https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/tree/master/languagetool-language-modules/pl/src/main/resources/org/languagetool/resource/pl/hunspell  then it won't be dumped properly. The problem is that the frequency as a flag is unknown to the dump tool. See also https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/issues/34 
The interface is still up and running, even after a few minutes. Device is still accessible over eth0 without a problem.   
I've had another issue very much related to this one. Will try to find time today or tomorrow to write up the exact steps to reproduce. (I think the processor order might be involved.)  Stay tuned.
Tried to push from my Eclipse, but doing it for the first time with Git. Please let me know if you see it. 
@kenwheeler I just tried on my Android phone. Normal conditions. 
I don't have launch configuration. Right-click on html file and Debug As -> Firefore. Creating launch configuration works.
 In 1.14, config files are now saved per-world. To find the config for this mod go to your .minecraft folder (if using Windows, go to %appdata% to get there). Click on "saves", select the name of the world, and go into "serverconfig". There you will find a file named "golems-server.toml" which is the config file for this mod. Hope that helps
Change the code:     public List<LocationUpdate> findLocations(String deviceId,              Date startDate, Date endDate) {         // return findLocationsFunctions(deviceId, startDate, endDate);         return findLocationsQsl(deviceId, startDate, endDate);     }  This will induce the error 
ah thanks.  Actually I was playing with damn vulnerable websockets, docker version  you start it with docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 tssoffsec/dvws you have to put dvws.local in the host file (otherwise websockets do not work)  When finally I had everything working, kali updated ZAP to 2.8.0 and it stopped working again. (I configured ZAP with port 8081 as a proxy listener)  What happens is that when dvws.local is redirected to https://dvws.local, all requests that use websockets simply do not go through. Not sure if it's relevant, if it's a zap issue or a dvws issue.
 
SonarQube: Version 7.9.2 esql-sonar-plugin: Version 3.0.0  I will try out version 3.0.1 
@marcingrzejszczak Sorry, missed your original notification.  The error that I think would be more useful, is one which says authentication failed with the remote repository. And I think it should fail regardless of whether you have the stubs locally or not (If I had them locally, I wouldn't get this error, but it would silently fail to get the actual latest)  
GC194KV in my profile will show that the CO set up an empty Final Coordinates waypoint to be filled when I solve the puzzle. I now have a PN waypoint with the final coords and an empty FC waypoint. While I can fill the FC waypoint with coordinates, I cannot remove the PN or edit the name to FC. If I edit, calling it FC, then the PN is recreated and I have yet another PN waypoint.

Ok, the sketch is really big, it's my project romanesco. So I give you juste one part of the project, you're the first to hear a piece of news romanesco before I drop this one in few weeks on Github,  :) https://www.dropbox.com/s/x29ex2s4ayz72r2/Scene_24b.zip if you want see the full project downloadable in the alpha 23 you can look on the web site http://romanescoproject.wordpress.com/ and if you'ave comment about my code is welcome :)  I think something to resolve that, it's when we have the dropdown menu to suggest a new word(var, void...) and we select one of them, PDEX take all the word in the sketch not just a previous part, so in my case the result it's dirrectly "clickShortLeft" and not "clickShortLeftLeft " because when I change the var with the dropdown menu the cursor text are in the midlle of the word....i don't now if it's clear, because it's hard to explain with the words and the english is not my mother language ! 
fixed it. it doesn't work on internet explorer but i can see all the messages after sorting them from newest to oldest on google chrome. is there a way we can see all the messages, like a next page button, without having to specify a filter or order?
This is the environment section of the raygun report:             "architecture": "arm64-v8a",            "availablePhysicalMemory": 1797,            "availableVirtualMemory": 0,            "board": "sdm630",            "brand": "Sonim",            "currentOrientation": "Portrait",            "deviceCode": "XP8800",            "deviceName": "XP8800",            "diskSpaceFree": 0,            "locale": "en_US",            "oSVersion": "8.1.0",            "osSDKVersion": "27",            "processorCount": 1,            "totalPhysicalMemory": 0,            "totalVirtualMemory": 0,            "utcOffset": -4,            "windowsBoundHeight": 1920,            "windowsBoundWidth": 1080  This is the relevant part of the StackTrace:      main.java.com.mindscapehq.android.raygun4android.RaygunClient.postCachedMessages in RaygunClient.java::611     main.java.com.mindscapehq.android.raygun4android.RaygunClient.send in RaygunClient.java::384  Oh and as a bonus, now that I am looking at my report again, I notice that the OS had too many open files at the time.  So I would guess that the reproduction steps is to induce that state again. I send my logcat up with Raygun reports and it got this:         java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"logcat\": error=24, Too many open files  And as File.listFiles() is documented as returning null on IOExceptions, this tracks as being the cause.
@marcphilipp Thanks a lot! It works as expected now. As a side effect the config's error tolerance has been changed. The next example has passed the test in the past but fails now (see the lack of ampersand in the lastest value): 
I'm running on a Win7 machine with JDK 1.7.0_45.  (I see similar output with jdk 1.8.0_60, but slightly different.)  I'll upload the files from running with 1.7. 
I have just tested it on an account which is ranked player, status does not change. 
@spacecowboy I forgot to add that I'm using the [Neo4j Python Driver](https://neo4j.com/developer/python/#neo4j-python-driver)  Here's the neo4j `session.run()` section. Everything works except when I want to add a long super long string, at `app_file_base64`:  
Working example (maven project) is available on github: https://github.com/kubalavl/jooq.git. You can find there junit class Jooq118Bug.java which demonstrate problem. Hope it helps. 
thanks for your reply! I see now that the html codes did not show up in my original message (should have checked sorry). Basically, to clarify < / body > and < / html > are not there (without the spaces). The last line is < / div> - and for the custom export I have also other stuff that is part of end.layout and is not there.  
@hideki, just ping me and I can help you get setup quickly.

Nope, not seeing this particular issue anymore. I'll re-open if I do and try to get better repro conditions.

Awesome, that sounds perfect.  
Sure. 
OK but I'm sure the user can type some search string into YouTube app's search box in less steps...
I receive the error when the query is selected before run.  ![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16996529/33166655-bfdf3d06-d086-11e7-9f2d-b34080c76f1f.png)  ![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16996529/33166674-d69313d8-d086-11e7-8e9b-7facddf56608.png) 
I have noticed this in multiple data sets.  I think I first noticed it  in version 1.10.2.  I think it is coming from MS Amanda and it is associated with low confidence peptides that don’t match any other proteins in my database.

I assumed this issue was resolved after our recent fixes.  Does it happen for all datasets? And for all search engines?  And do you know in which version you started to see the problem reoccurring?

This should now be fixed in master. Please reopen if you are still seeing issues. 
I'm still trying to reproduce the error.

I cannot remeber very clearly about the steps. But the trace is short I remember. I tried hard to reproduce this issue, but unfortunately fail to provide you a good test. 
I have this in my application.properties: `liquigraph.url=localhost` `liquigraph.user=neo4j` `liquigraph.password=pass`  The connection string for the bolt connection to the database I use is: `bolt://neo4j:pass@localhost` The connection is not done via `DataSource` though, but via neo4j-ogm's mechanism (org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration). 
Hi, thanks for the fast reply! Here's the console output: [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/SgcLqP6t)
The advanced Oxygen Compressor allows air to be pumped into it. (Extraplanets) The electronic Compress allows items to but piped into it. (Galacticraft Core) The refinery allows fluids to be pumped into it. (Galacticraft Core) If you need me to test more I can.   Also while troubleshooting this myself I stumbled across anther bug. If you put any Mek tank with fluids into the fluid purifier, it only gives you 1 bucket full and changes the item into the pink and black block and renames it Bucket 325:11 and becomes useless.
Okay, I'll remember that the next time. There were some smart actions in the play. But to extract the own key cards could be fixed in future?  Am 27.

right, thanks 
@vRallev i'll do it tomorrow morning , no problem.
Hi Andy,  yes, it's version 3.5.0, the one which was updated on my phone on the 13th.   I just did some tests again a few minutes ago. The strange thing is now it seems to be working again? I had these issues the last two days and it was reproducible every time. But it's still the same version and now it's working. Weird ...   Well, thanks for your reply, Andy!  :-)  
What do you mean by inplace rebuild? Reindex into the same index? If so, it is recommended to reindex data into a fresh index (so less deleted docs in lucene). 
yes optifine

Wow, impressive speed @iSoron . So yes, it's much faster. Almost at the 1.6.x speed, which is amazing. Startup takes now around 2 seconds instead of 35. Checking individual entries is faster as well.
here you go https://pastebin.com/QTwpEhpD it happens on join and reload of config i never reload server btw only restart

After my initial post I realised that anything after 37 (or perhaps 47) might not be supported. So I refactored all of the colors in my script to range of 30 to 37.  The problem is the exact same. It still only removes the escape sequences, it does not replace them with colors. Using these same codes with just 'echo -e' works fine, so I believe this is Python specific.  I call the Python script with '-u' to disable caching, and print with:   > sys.out.flush() > sys.out.write(-Some color coded string-) > sys.out.flush()   just to be extra sure....  The user profile that runs the script has its default shell set to /usr/bin/sh. I've tried using '\e', '\033' and '\x1B'. 
Just sat around on a map until it did it again. [Heres the video](https://my.mixtape.moe/obvlqh.mp4)

  The general principle is to start several threads to add the same data. **The id of the TestData table is a custom field with a unique index**.

Hi,  My apologies. I've only had 1 coffee today :-)  OK, here is a more detailed description with screenshots.  I think I've narrowed it down to Syncthing stopping when I tick "Only sync on wi-fi".  Attached are 4 screenshots showing the error, the fact that the notification icon should be shown all the time, the options I have chosen, and then what happens when I choose "Only sync on wi-fi."  As you can see, I am connected to my wi-fi, and it works.  Over to you... 
I'm trying to get each client to have its own thread. 
I upped the monster in global.conf and ran /sponge -g reload     But it doesn't look any better... many nearby pigman still remain neutral for a long time after my attack.
I do, and it's exported from the Firebase dashboard.  I have a feeling it is to do with the upgrades to the Android dependencies made in the latest commit referenced above.
@youfacepalm is doing so a known issue?  It's also worth nothing that we only saw this crash on API 23 devices, not 24 or 25 devices.
I don't know if haxe or haxelib were involved at that moment. 
Hi @skabashnyuk ,  My issue is related with a plugin -> che-plugin-vfos-menu-ide  https://github.com/mstavares/che_issue
Thanks Cushon! :) So, I've changed the order and now it is giving me another errors, ex:  <img width="1106" alt="captura de tela 2016-07-13 as 14 31 39" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1733227/16813118/946cfa68-4906-11e6-9ac8-82d59019779d.png">  Also, I checked that are some classes that are in wrong packages, ex:  AnyOfTemplateExample is in com.google.errorprone.refaster.testdata.input package, but it's declared in com.google.errorprone.refaster.testdata .  Is it ok? Why are those errors occurring? 
Dashboard Interface. 
Language de or en, and it seems the voice doesn't matter, bits1-hsmm, bits3, bits3-hsmm, dfki-pavoque-neutral-hsmm all produce this behavior.  
**SOLUTION:**   It was an line that only contained the word   "And"   
Added package name.
Do you want me to send a sample file? If that's what you mean. 
@TylerJewell   Thanks. So you're saying that I cannot use `/srv/che/jcarter/{lib, workspaces, storage}` directories?   And che will store all the containers and projects data in `/home/user/che` on my host? Is there a way to avoid this? Im running bunch of dockers and my goal is keeping all the data for them in central location, ex: `/srv` 
Version is the current latest available (openmodularturrets-1.12.2-3.0.1-264.jar)   Here's a short recording of the issue with the range upgrades. After I stopped recording I found the range of the sentry gun went up despite the range upgrades having been removed.   Here are some clips of the issue in action [1](https://gfycat.com/PowerfulUnderstatedGnat) [[2]](https://gfycat.com/TidyPoshBats)  The sentries don't seem to generate anything in the log.   P.S, I can't shift click to fill ammo inventories  
Dumb question: how do I get the logs? 
Removing toString might work, it could just potentially break some backward compatibility (e.g. transform map files which map "Undefined" to something else).  And it does not solve a deeper problem: If you post UNDEF on a StringItem, it will not reconstruct an UnDefType, but a StringType instead. So I wonder if we might have to introduce some reserved keyword and put the UnDefType at the top of the acceptedDataTypes in StringItem...? 
Just tested with the latest betas on Curseforge. Things appear to be working now.
Before the 1.8 update: 1. Give yourself a custom mobspawner (/give player mobspawner:mobvalue 1), where mobvalue is the mob network id, for instance pig is 50 2. Place the mobspawner 3. Essentials will check if a mobspawner has been placed, check the placed items datavalue (in this case 50) and then change the mob on the placed mobspawner  This is no longer possible, as the data value can no longer be stored in mobspawner items in your inventory. Giving yourself a custom spawner will simply reset the data value to 0. 
This happens one time per few runs. This exception is thrown concurrently to exception from Agrona's AgentRunner - which is also fatal.  Code is here: https://github.com/lech-glowiak/Aeron/blob/master/aeron-system-tests/src/test/java/uk/co/real_logic/aeron/FailExample.java  That is output on specific run at Windows 7, i3 processor, JDK8.   
I think it's random.

Hi Harald,   Thanks for your suggestion!  It did work and have my data imported into PeptideShaker :).   Kind regards,  Stephanie
Meaning that it behaves like it is waiting for me to advance past a breakpoint, but there is no UI for me to do so.  Example: I start up the app, when there are breakpoints, and the first output for the app is:  Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8000  Once I connect the debugger, Codenvy switches the perspective to show my breakpoints, etc. but nothing more happens--it doesn't reach my breakpoint. If I try and send a curl command to my application in another terminal window, the command hangs.  Then, if I click "Run -> End Debug Session", then, the rest of the startup output for my application is displayed, and my command on the other terminal window completes.  Another example with this same setup is, while the debugger is connected, I run a kill -3 in another terminal window and the output is not shown in my app; however, once I do "Run -> End Debug Session", I subsequently see all the thread dump output to my app.  I will get you a screenshot shortly.
@nicolas-raoul I removed the "Search this Area" button if connection is lost. Currently if connection gets lost it shows a snackbar With the message but "Search this Area button" is still there. Clicking it makes the nearby stuck at it even if the connection is re-established.  IMO removing "Search This Area" button whenever connection gets lost would be a nice option.
@sjudd  Thank you.  > What version of Android were you using?  The problem was confirmed in 5.1, 9.0. But I think it is an issue independent of versions.
I wasn't clear enough.  1. My phone is being displayed first in Group A, which is the group that went through the migration and had the trouble initially reported. So this observation might not hold after the fixes you applied.  2. After upgrading to 4.10.3, I received a message in Group B that got threaded in Group A (the most recently used MMS group). The only common member is me. That seems like a bug.
Was finding the logs earlier, and have added them to the original post (had some issues with adb disconnecting, not related to tvheadend or the app). I doubt this is a network issue, as surely that would affect the "Media Player" player as well?  I can go over my networking kit's logs (all enterprise stuff) if you want. 
Sure!  The command /minecraft:gamemode spectator has the same behaviour: The user falls into the void. It seems, there's no difference between the minecraft native command and the EssentialsX one, over this issue.  Furthermore, I have noticed that this bug seems to appear and disappear per player with no reason, the day I opened this ticket, Utrerano (_one of the users with "Moderador" rank that suffers this_) suffered this problem, and, for example, this morning he didn't experience it on the main world (worldcraft), but on the SkyBlock one. So I asked another player with "Moderador" rank, SancaVIP, to test it. He experienced it on the main world and on the Skyblock one as well. So I suspect it **may** be a permission-related / world-related conflict. I've uploaded the personal permissions of this players:  Utrerano's permissions: https://gist.github.com/MetalGearDaner/0778d4d4f70c05b5d6d5adf341deda2a SancaVIP's permissions: https://gist.github.com/MetalGearDaner/d367c30258d6cb31eb507d85e51eee7d  This is the list of user-accessible worlds: - worldcraft - worldcraft_nether - worldcraft_the_end - recursos - ASkyBlock - ASkyBlock_nether  Thanks for the help! :)

I've just forced JDK 7:  https://github.com/fcduarte/deckard-gradle/commit/41f524fbb19227df22dd419d3e8e1eddffa1e7b4  same error. 
Cheers, I appreciate it. This has really given me some headaches over the last two weeks.  Could it be that it has something to do with my Ubuntu VMs not having enough resources to keep all threads and ssh connections alive? I find it quite weird that I never observed this issue on my (way more powerful) Windows machines. 
I can try that, but we run builds once a day. So I wouldn't have results until tomorrow. 
Sure, is that the "openhab.log"? Sorry I'm pretty new to this.
That is exactly what I expected - appendices should behave pretty much like part. I have a long book, and the bookmarks look weird if chapters are wrapped and appendices are not. But so far, at least with DITA OT 1.5.3, I couldn't get an extra heading. The appendices element either caused the transformation to fail or it didn't change the output at all (neither the TOC nor the bookmarks).. Is there anything I can do right now to just get a heading from the transformation (currently I'm adding a bookmark in Acrobat)? 
`mvn clean verify -Pnative -Dnative-image.docker-build=true` ends with following trouble because Linux targeted binary can't be run on macOS. So it doesn't help me much now :( I can try tomorrow on my Linux box.    The problem with the QS isn't that native binary can't be built. It seems that the binary starts properly, but tests are not started against binary. Like if it is waiting for something. 
Hi @michael13162 yes, I can reproduce this on my laptop. I have tried opening up SBOLDesigner and tried clicking the 'X' button and am still unsuccessfully able to close SBOLDesigner. If it helps, I can show you this in person. 
@nezihyigitbasi I'm pretty sure that `C` does not precede `À`, at least for a decent number of languages. If I'm not mistaken, the "naive" sorting will always put special characters after the "normal" ones due to the order on the UTF-8 table. To have proper ordering of text, you need to use a collator.   I don't necessarily agree that the min/max statistics should have the correct alphabetic ordering, but if more writers have the same default behaviour as the spark one, presto should at least have an option to deal with it. I'll check if hive also generates that same statistics for my data and I'll report back. Thanks for the quick answers. 
Hello! It shows in preview. I'm not yet trying to run the app. Is it normal?
Hi @sanketmarkan, thank you for your interest in this aspect.   My recommendation is to start from the WorldRenderer interface and in particular the WorldRendererImpl class: that's the entry point of the rendering system.   If you look into WorldRendererImpl.initRenderGraph() you'll see a long list of nodes being added. The existing Debug system plugs into the FinalPostProcessingNode but I assume it will be eventually removed from there.   Please notice that the rendering system will undergo some further refactoring during the GSOC. Consequently the new Visual Debug System will suffer from a moving goalpost syndrome. That been said, the node-base architecture will remain and you will be able to rely on that.   Some logistics: - Are you already running from source? - Feel free to use this issue to discuss things further. You can also use the forum or we can set up an appointment via irc should you require it.  - Keep in mind I'm in the GMT+1 timezone. 
Yeah, that's a good point.  So the widget plus some adapter that listens to the network state conveniently? 
Hi Chris. To cancel you need to press the X at the top.
Can confirm that only orwall has root access, and that I tried restarting orbot. I see that there's a new orbot, and so I gave that a shot, but still no dice.  I actually unselected all apps, restarted the device, and both with and without orbot running, firefox and the defaulyt browser give proxy errors.

Hi @rengwuxian,  the problem turned out to be less regular than I thought. It might not be related to the base line.

@Valodim: - I obtain K-9 Mail from the F-Droid repository.  The latest version offered there is 5.010, alpha and beta versions of K-9 Mail do not seem to be uploaded there as unstable releases.    Do you mean to address the most recent master / unstable / development release (currently K-9 Mail v5.109 alpha) in https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/releases with, "the latest alpha"? - Depending on how long you plan to maintain the K-9 5.0xx current / stable / maintenance branch, it may be unfortunate not to fix it in this branch as well.  - Anyway, I am sure willing to test a K-9 5.1xx alpha version, if necessary: Will I be able to downgrade from a recent K-9 5.1xx to 5.008 flawlessly?  Or do I have to expect configuration breakage etc., when doing so?  @cketti: I am not an Android expert.  Can you please provide a bit more concise description, where I may find that "stack trace [which] should be logged somewhere.", and  a hint, what file name (components) I shall be looking for. 
Hi Karol,  Sure! It can wait on my side, don't worry =).  Dani
Too late:/ I just restarted the cluster. How should I do that next time?  I have this log on one node:   
No, but it also doesn't happen often. I will try to get a new build made and see if I can find a way to reproduce, or at least reproduce it slightly more often. Low priority bug anyways so it can wait until after the stable.
 if I put on any set of armor (chest) the shadows in the shaders disappear. shaders work but the shadows from the sun disappear.
Yeah, Sorry I wrote this thread before I knew that option existed. It worked and StellarSky's skybox is now showing, but no one can see the constellations from AS now, So not sure on that front.

Dear Sir @tobiasKaminsky , Thank you for your answer. I've just sent the requested e-mail. Sincerely, N.
Found the issue; A conflicting config from another mod, causing the compartment cells not to be registered. 
There is a protected method call on the abstract parser class that should be done at the start of every parse method if we want to support it, IIRC.
Unfortunately I haven't had time to look into again. Hopefully I have this week.
No, his comment after the proposed solution is: "But I decided not include these changes into library." Which I don't understand, as it's a valid issue. Perhaps most users of his app don't return the text that the MythTV Services API does. Or, most people don't search the protocol for RSTs. 
I don't use a file, I'm just capturing the screen from the host side then recored it then send it to the client, the problem ocuures on client side, the example above works perfect with javacv 1.3.3 but the example does not work with javacv 1.5.1 no statment execute on client side after grabber.start() statment unless the inputstream that associated with the grabber closed.
It's funny, but when I'm trying to send a bug report within the app, it can't be send due to the same connection issue... I'll try to fetch some logcat. As soon as my devices are non-rooted devices (unfortunately :-(  ), it will take some time to setup ADB within computer...
@deathbeam It happened while I was using Konduit as well, but I don't know the proper upstream to report to. This issue only started about a month ago.
@krzyk I've edited the description and removed info about duplicate. And yes, I don't think we should punish with any violation people following rule described at http://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html.  And stacktraces won't be much longer, it's usually just one more line per every rethrow. 
@mkouba   > My guess would be that this NPE is caused by the bug you've already fixed in another PR ;-)  I thought the same. I did a quick test, but the fix for the other PR did not seem to solve it. I will double check it now that it has been merged.  > ArcTestRequestScopeProvider should be more robust and log a warning  my initial thinking was not to solve it using a test and a warning, because I was afraid to hide a root cause and potentially not using this opportunity to correct a bug (if any) somwhere else.  > Would you care to send a PR?  but yes if everybody believes that the right solution is simply to make the code more robust, I can take care of it.
As said with 0.90.0 this never happens ... I use graylog2 0.91.1 with no special configuration ... just untar, launch and start a gelf http input...   Those are the same messages with different ids ... every message I sent is marked with an incremental value ... both of them have the 85950 value but different ids ...  
thank you removed the TIC and returned to normal. 
The typical meaning of "export" is "to a file format without all features" Following typical current UI practice, you could either rename to "save as" or have separate "save as" and "export" buttons.  "Export" is an optional notion in user interfaces, which is being slowly obsoleted by more sophisticated save dialogs; "Save As" is fundamental functionality.

Yeah just after I committed a fix I started to look at merging #312 in and noticed you had fixed it as well. I've reverted my fix now and will merge #312 in.

Wow @mattoscln, that sounds really reasonable! Thanks a lot for your input
Thanks for the reply @swankjesse! While in our specific case exception messages are not a concern - only thread names which end up in shared thread stacks (e.g. via jstack) - I understand the hesitance to make this change.  I'll do a bit more thinking on if there are any alternatives for us.

Yes, I delete the platform complete, also the plugin. After that i reinstall the Plugin with: <pre> ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio npm install --save @ionic-native/fingerprint-aio@4 </pre>  And readd the Platform with: <pre> ionic cordova platform add android@8.1.0 </pre>  If i try it in an new ionic 3 Project, the Build Process works. Dont know why.
@vosolovskiy It seems that `SELECT ANY SEQUENCE` was my problem. Thanks very much for your help.
Seems to be working now – need more tests cases to be sure, but at least SDK passes tests and no weird errors have come up. 
Drag it to the side.  
You can try with the example test: "Benvenuto nel mondo della sintesi vocale."  Without a dot it works, but when dot is present an exception is thrown. 
Sure. 1. At 30 Hz, things run okay but once in a while you'll notice erroneous values come through. For example a variable that has the same value written to it all the time (zero), will once in a while have 15, 23 or some random number written to it. At 50 - 80 Hz it becomes more common, the value set to zero will spike in value every 5 seconds or so, and above 80 Hz, the connection will break and data will cease to be sent to the phone. 2. The gibberish in the serial monitor only happens when the connection never initialized, or after it breaks. So at 1 - 80 Hz, the serial monitor is accurate, but there will be random inaccuracies in the data transmitted. 3. AltSoftSerial is the current choice as it uses the high resolution 16 bit timer. There's another one out there, but it isn't packaged as a library, but as a sketch and it uses an 8 bit timer. It will have the same issues AltSoftSerial will have with no clear advantages.  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujzE3Q5ouqW-ZQgrlPGH9eMvqKJAiWSmGBGrKPW7fVCT/Screenshot_2014-10-12-15-11-53.png)  @ 75 Hz. The gold spike to the left is at the value that 0 is supposed to be written to all the time.  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujzE3Q5ouqW-BhkSVdwZKeIrbbNXk10Rb1ujfIrbpnEs/Screenshot_2014-10-12-15-11-29.png) @ 50 Hz. Random spikes. 
My think is -- the `FINISHING` state is either short (nothing to commit)m or cannot be interrupted (because apparently we cannot abort transaction during its commit phase). So I think that `FINISHING` state should be uninterruptible and attempt to fail/cancel query in this state should be ineffective (ideally: should throw).  I am aware this isn't ideal (committing can take considerable amount of time). But the apparently only alternative -- fail query but continue work and retain all results -- is less appealing.  cc @dain @electrum

I'd like to increase the number of streams consumed by my app to around 20, but this means I'll have 400 LeaseRenewer threads :grimacing: This _can't_ be necessary or useful.
I see it opening and I can navigate it but as soon as I click to "choose" a file, it closes, I get that exception and the app crashes or freezes. 
After I remove the `allprojects` and it works fine. Thanks. 
OK the dev-version works for me, so the issue can be closed.  To reproduce the error is quite difficult. It just happened in my private account with thousands of files in the trash-bin. The filename where it eventually crashed was `2b(Kd=0).png` There were 4-5 files with that name.  I was able to track down that it was because `third_parties.daveKoeller.AlphanumComparator#compare(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)` always returns -1 if both inputs have this value, eventually stating that `element1 < element2` and `element2 < element1`, which is not possible in a total order.  Technically, most sorting-algorithms should still terminate correctly; it should just result in unnecessary swaps. I'm not really familiar with Java and how it detects "Comparison method violates its general contract!" when sorting. Maybe the detection depends on the position of the files in the list, or it's size (more recursions/iterations of the sorting algorithm)...

Thank you for your quick response, Pete. Today morning I tried to provoke this error with different classifiers. The error occured with 'Random trees', 'Artificial neural network' and 'Logistic regression'. I think the more settings I change, the more likely the error will occur - but I couldn't figure out if a single setting is the reason.  With my usual approach I train the pixel classifier on a project training image. If I could successfully save the classifier and load it for another image in the project, I get the following error messages for ANN and KNN:  ANN classifier: ![err_ann](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59967282/73450688-34d01a00-4366-11ea-9c8f-7e08251c6261.png)  KNN classifier: ![err_knn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59967282/73450694-37cb0a80-4366-11ea-98f8-17df5cefcf52.png)

Hi, yes I mean QAF ignores scenarios and not execute it. At least ignoring the first scenario as was tested with a Gherkin file with just one scenario, but likely it is ignoring whole Feature file.
Actually, I may have jumped the gun with this issue.  I'm not exactly sure how I managed to fix this issue, but it actually works fine.  I did recently update my Android Studio, maybe somehow this is related.  I will post again if the issue reoccurs.   Sorry about that.

Why che keeps creating more workspaces and yet till now?
Thanks :) `config.enable.serverMapRealTime=false` ,the problem is solved.
Yes, the app run perfectly. Doesn't return any error. 
Yes! I already made the change yesterday from a test artifact to a build artifact that that resolved the issue. However, there is no out of memory issue on the logs. 
Thank you for the analysis. My environment is as follows:  - Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393] (32 bit) - java version "1.8.0_101" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode, sharing) - OH 2.1 release version  But I can also see the issue with snapshot 2.2.0 # 1014 (did only try the item endpoint with this build).  `Charset.defaultCharset()` reports "windows-1252"  Let me know if there´s something else I can do to help to track this down.  with kind regards, Patrik
Yes, both. It's using lucene 7.2.1 and handles the updating of the index fields. For every update index call i try to fetch the already indexed document from lucene and than add the new field to it. For that, i have to store (not only analyse and index) the fields into lucene. Creation of the document field will be with `Field contentField = new TextField(field, text, **Field.Store.YES**);`  The main issue is with `indexWriter.updateDocument(new Term(CONTENT_ID, jsonId), document);` because updateDocument will by first delete all documents containing the term and then adding the new one. (See lucene javadoc on updateDocument.) BTW.: i like nitrite very much...

Okay, definitely sounds like it's worth trying! I tried the method [you described here](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14164), and the first part is clear for me, but the second is a little confusing. What is Che CR? How can I modify this field in this file exactly? Should I do it prior to creating my Che project on OpenShift or by configurating its properties afterwards?  I also tried using the grouped-certificate comprised of the company's certificates. That didn't work at all :( I guess I gotta use the specific certificate. Some trial and error should cover that.

Hello Jan,  When I used port 4304, I received the following error messages    falsely wise, I then used the httpd port 2121 but the thing went online  Via [Issue #69481](https://community.openhab.org/t/solved-onewire-offline-communication-error/69481), I came up with the fact that my **owfs.conf** causes the problem.

May be it's redundant, but I would like to attach an explanation here with hashLoadPercent = 64 and LOCK_SEGMENTS = 64 too (my case). ![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9496595/56404898-91f55600-6293-11e9-9d79-417a5565b2f2.PNG) When segmentMaxFill becomes negative or zero, the 'entries' array is doubled whenever a new element is added and the size of the array rockets to be a negative value (1.073.741.824 -> -2.147.483.648) because of Integer Overflow. In my case, the number of element is around 20 millions, but the exception occurs when 10.674.603 elements are added. Hope this helpful for you.

Yes of course : Normal result with a previous version of MariaDB: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10708817/63752012-b819ab00-c8b0-11e9-942f-cb9ffbdf6f89.png) With a recent version: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10708817/63751902-8accfd00-c8b0-11e9-91f2-87216b88823e.png)
Yes, I prefer the latter, too. Even better if you can clone the ClientInfo object and set the MediaType in the clone as the only one MediaType; so that the original client preferences remain unchanged as JavaDoc says for the ClientResource.get(MediaType) method overload. 
I will create a new image directory (it's not crashing any more on the current one) and send you a logcat.

You're right! It works for Maven 3, but fails for Maven 2. We should probably enforce Maven 3 in the pom.xml somehow, but that is a separate problem.  Thanks! Closing. 
> For the record we could also set the canvas color to be the system background color.  That's amazing, I did not know that! Let's do that for starters (set the canvas background to use the dynamic system background color). I think doing that will remove the mismatch between the canvas and RichText, but I think we can make this bullet-proof for the aforementioned examples by removing the background fill altogether from RichText.

Sure:   
I've tried with both the Nordic and CityWorld and don't have that problem. It only occurs in the areas where it's betweenislands and thus has no blocks generated in it from the start (unless the issue deletes them). 
This looks like it has been fixed 
yea i'll prepare something next week, thanks for looking into it
Hi Daniel Wegener,  I am able to produce and consume the messages using kafka producer and consumer installation files (.bat examples from kafka installation) without any issue.  I tried with Kafka clients 0.9.00 with kafka 0.10.1.1, when I set the root log level to TRACE or DEBUG, i am getting same error. org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: Failed to update metadata after 60000 ms.  When I set the root level to INFO or higher, then application is able to produce messages to kafka and able to consume successfully.  Can you please guide me on how to overcome this limitation on using DEBUG or TRACE.  Regards, Venkat

@davsclaus indeed I have a version of ActiveMQ running in my Karaf instance. We use our own provisioned version of karaf 3.0.2, which boots with ActiveMQ, Apache Camel and some other things right off the bat. 
the player in question has been trying to play with 12 year old computer and repeatedly tells me he has has to connect 3 times to finally actually stay in the game. But it is just him that reports that, none of my 100's of players report the issue. Your probably missing a simple null check in one those 4 places. At least i hope it's simple.  And congrats on the big bucks, I'm nipping at your toes, but I have loads more java and forge to learn.
Fair enough. I think we try it as you suggested. Will you make the changes for the `README.md`?

Still the same with build 1423, On server start the loaders are not functioning. once i log in and go to each dimension all is good even if i log out for a while. i will try with world anchors later to see if its the same right now this is with chickenchunks. Any thing i can get info from for you that helps, I'm not seeing anything in any logs? 
I'm doing a full testing, for that reason I've assigned the issue to me.  But was pretty logic, since we divided the bundle in two, to add the newly created bundle into the distribution. Obviously those things happen. So, no problem on this. I wanted just to track the activity.  I will push a PR soon with the fix.

Hey, Unfortunately, I can't handle this task.
I ran mvn -X clean test > error2.txt and this is the resulting file.  If you search for  com.allianz.cisl.ext.agcs.jackson, which is a private package not present in maven central, you will see that maven correctly finds it in my local repo (Compile classpath line 1080), but during test it tries to download it again from central maven (lin 1806).  Hope this helps [error2.txt](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/files/3694627/error2.txt)  Previously the issue concerned quarkus-bom package but if managed to run mvn test with a direct connection, then it has downloaded the package once and the issue no longer occurs.

Sorry for the late answer, I did some tests First I reset the scale only and it seems to work, but only once actually... After that the same behavior happened.  So I did reset both the scale and the app. But since then, that's even worse since the scale doesn't recognize me anymore and there's still no data saved into the app

At the same time, the INTERNET is disabled.  **ExoPlayer:** 2.8.3  If anything, I can provide a demo app this problem.

mmm I just compiled with mvn on CLI and the error was different and related to the EIS interface .toString() which seems it was deprecated, and somehow worked with SARL 0.6.1 but not with 0.7.0. But it is about the EIS not SARL; I changed the code to a different method and it compiles well.  The error message on the ECLIPSE IDE was not indicating that, it was giving an error at the level of the whole Event class.  So, I think this is not per se related to SARL @gallandarakhneorg , sorry. Thanks and I am closing it. Seems to compile now well.

Saw this in 9.3.x - you can replicate pretty easily by adding these 2 headers to the usage found in the `AllowSymLinkAliasCheckerTest.testAccess()` method.

Hi @deadok22  The hanged application is ejabberd server not intellij-erlang IDE. I uploaded log.  [log_server_hang.txt](https://github.com/ignatov/intellij-erlang/files/504831/log_server_hang.txt)  Note that the ejabbered server is "hang" not "crash". It seems stuck at some point, but intellij-erlang did not prompt me to further operation like: step-over/step-into/continue/... 
Sadly, no - I've been unable to reproduce, and lost the failing test result :(  In any event, the failure was that there were fewer job requests than expected.  Probably the change you just made will fix the problem.  I'll close this, and re-open if I see failures again.
No idea how the code broke, but... pictures say more than thousand words eh?

Leaving this ticket open because I think we should eventually merge the broker into the backend, it's way simpler.
Hi @Coduz, I have no ideas for now, I will give it some thoughts and report back. 
I don't have percolate queries stored in percolator fields. For the example mapping i only reduced the fields to the absolute minimum necessary to reproduce the bug. Fields used by the percolator and those stored in the documents are kept separate in my actual use case.
Hi! Yes, of course. How can I download it? 
If PicoCli doesn't support us in this event, I suggest we update the documentation to show that the framework doesn't support trailing back slashes and ensure that they do not appear.  We should check if this is a product of the shell or java/picocli itself. I.e. running `java -jar .... "C:\temp\"` in the windows command prompt vs via intelliJ.
I came accross this, while working with the grammar in issue #5 There asking to debug would first give the error message and clicking debug again simply presents the window where you choose text and starting rule and hitting OK then says: preparing... timeout.  The timeout of course happens because no classes were generated.  I belive the same would happen if you succeed to generate classes with debug, delete them manually and debug again.  On the bright side, as long as I really keep modifying the grammar it tries to recompile everytime, it seems. 
Ok it took a few tries but I was able to reproduce it with spearows. Happened before with pidgeys, rattatas, caterpies. Here's a screenshot of before/after xfer and candies stay at 42 ![postxfer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1081802/23317879/c74c968c-fa95-11e6-9161-d432dc57149e.PNG) ![prexfer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1081802/23317878/c74be106-fa95-11e6-8036-9e2875e537e1.PNG)  
I apologise for the delays in a reply, but we have found the following out:  - Pterodactyl does not make the folder read only when the server is running - We tried your fix with `# LibLoader.jar` but to no avail - same error as before - The error specifically states that Forge can't lock the base of our container, so I'm not sure what's going on there - We have other "mixin" mods (mods that don't originate from the pack itself) working just fine, so we don't think it's the Tickprofiler mod's fault.  However, I am now out of ideas to try to fix it... and the fact that a fresh spongeforge server running on my local machine works fine baffles me.   
Yes, I just reproduced it, I used the tables of the chromosome 6 questionnaire, I can't reproduce it with small tables (like the phenotype tables of the chromosome 6 questionnaire), I don't have other large tables to check it with.  Selecting first one table (questionnaire part A_C) in the dataexplorer, then another (questionnaire D_H) and then a third (questionnaire I_L), and pushing previous and next button after that is the easiest way to reproduce, since the error does not occur always.   I used google chrome.  
@cschockaert I added some information and new issues.
My Android is a CyanogenMod 7.2 (Android 2.3.7). I'm not quite sure about the reboot but I will keep an eye on that, when I do a reboot the next time, if this requires also recreating my account or if it maybe happens already before. 
It's always been enabled no?

Hi, I've reset my local repository to ` * |   1909d80 (HEAD -> master, tag: 2.2.0, origin/master) Merge branch 'release/2.2.0'`  and rebuild. I don't get any NPE exceptions this time and analysis run fine.  The sample project is now on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/mresetar/monitoring-sample).   Previously I did get some NPEs which I was trying to fix wit the following fixes. - [This one](https://github.com/mresetar/sonar-esql-plugin/commit/9b6e16ba15e4172ef50830f2512019361d9bee89) was caused by parentFile being null. I'm curious why the pattern `parentFile.getName().matches("^[a-zA-Z]*(_App_v|_Lib_v)[0-9]")` is used? In my case there is no App_v or Lib_v ending in project name. Because parntFile was null I added the fix to look for .project file. I don't know was that fine or not. But fix is not working as expected with multimodule projects.  - [Second one](https://github.com/mresetar/sonar-esql-plugin/commit/9a595e2e6fe76e553ebd300684dfeb53da9241b0) is probably connected with first fix not working as expected.  I guess you can ignore this ones for now.  I've made also 2 changes to gitignore and gitattributes you may want to check out.  Thanks for the plugin!  Miro
I've tried Dev version from F-Droid and it worked. Kinda. At least I was able to log in using the old method.
I'm using 0.4.3—I actually avoided upgrading because the cpp input pruning code change looked unstable—but from code inspection it looks like the issue has been present since the dawn of Bazel through today. (You have to get into a very special state to see this issue.) This issue looks like a problem with `PersistentMap` and doesn't involve anything fancy like input-discovering actions as #2490 does.
Ah, I see. And yes, I opened it in Eclipse before for sure. And I also think that this might be a quite common scenario... ;-)  Anything we can do about this? The long list of errors showing up doesn't look pretty... :-)
Various errors occur, some while creating an NPC with the template. Some while creating the template itself and some while making an NPC with a template. And the skins never carry on to the NPCs created using the template.  This is my template file. the bandit2 template works in all ways but the others all give various errors.  I hope this is helpful [templates.txt](https://github.com/CitizensDev/Citizens2/files/504464/templates.txt) 
Placing or breaking modded items. Like placing a piece of marble.  
Both.  I started out by adding the site as a new software site :  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482152/4148521/aa286d70-3426-11e4-9ff7-c31e94f44e78.png)  But it does not find anything installable on that location  :  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482152/4148517/9bc21f38-3426-11e4-85e6-e0211379e8b3.png)  So I went to check the location with the browser and it returns 404. Sure it can't work when there's a 404 returned. You normally can peek into the contents of an update site. 
I'm sorry I can't: it's quite a big project and I don't even know where to begin to isolate the problematic code.  But I suppose it's some bean unable to be instantiated, maybe because it can't configure itself from config/application.yml  If you have some hints on how to proceed I'm all hears: for the time being I just develop using RC1.
Hi,  A small update: in fact it works when I just make 1 step of the client, then 1 step of the server to receive the message. But As soon I make the second step on the client model, I get the Socket closed exception. 
Because OKAPI is usable for reading non-personal data without ever authenticating (which makes perfect sense). Therefore we can always read OC caches without the connector being active.
@M-AJ It's VisualVM 1.4 running on macOS.
Thanks for the quick response and fix!
I still have received a test suite,but I'm not sure if this problem have an influence for test generation.
Ahhh there ya go. I was wondering if those extra keys were causing the problem, but wasn't sure how they got added in.  This is from the send method 
@geoand same problem with `0.28.1`.
This is with a fairly sizeable modpack, but the only change was adding the API Enhancer.  Smart Moving **without** the API Enhancer has no discernable performance impact.  I can throw up a minimal test server tomorrow and retest with just vanilla plus Smart Moving plus the API enhancer and see if the same thing happens.
the tables are created via Hibernate in LMFDBUtils https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-uby/blob/master/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.uby.persistence.transform-asl/src/main/java/de/tudarmstadt/ukp/lmf/transform/LMFDBUtils.java  - this is not done for each table individually. - apparently H2 has no problems with this way of creating tables, while MySQL has.
Yes, downloaded Apicurio, Keycloak and setup according to the instructions.  Yes, breaks every time after logging out, linking, unlinking and went through from scratch setting things up a couple of times.

@dhirajsb @rhuss I've rebuild the server without those 2 `app, type` and it metrics finally appeared. Only `app` label seems to be not enough. Probably  a bit of fiddling in prometheus config should do it, but I'm really lost in that one.     
I will try, this was during a quick test on a temporary phone.  Would it be more appropriate to close this as "not enough info" and I can re-open if it happens again with the full stack trace?

thanks, it works! 
I am using '1.7.0' 
Got it.  The issue is when you have routes defined with wildcards, such as:  `get("/app/**", () -> "a");`  If I comment out this route, the exception is not thrown anymore. But still, no documentation is generated for my MVC routes, although I can see your debug logs when parsing the source code.  When opening the route provided by the module, I get an infinite message "loading RAML".  PS: is there a way to disable this debug logging?

This wasn't actually too terrible of a fix to implement.  Also, I don't think defaulting those radios to the first value makes sense. What happens if that field is on another tab? It seems to easy to submit unintentional data.  Closing as now this is resolved.

Here is the same application as above but ran twice: one on 8080 (service1) and the other on 8081 (service2) by changing `server.port` and `spring.application.name`, then pointing one to the other for the calls to `/1`, `/2` and `/3` by changing the port on the `WebClient`  The same behaviour can be observed as when the app is hitting itself  ![Screenshot of Zipkin 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkRobbo/cloud-schema-bug/master/Screenshot%202020-01-10%20at%2009.39.25.png)  (We also have this live in an environment with a large number of microservices and this obviously takes this problem to the extreme with everything being nested)

How about outgoing connections? https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt/pull/63#issuecomment-366218735  > If some peer is serving more than one torrent, then the connection initiator will have to choose which **one** torrent he wants to download from this peer.  Seams like BT have no 'connection initiator that choose which _one_ torrent he wants to download from this peer'    But uTorrent can upload many-to-one and can download many torrents from one peer. It is quite common situation (in 2018).

No it was working perfectly on 0.17.4 and below. It can't be my network fault since i never changed anything I can still watch video with subtitle enabled and download video, just only subtitle i can't download. Maybe it's caused by this changes? https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/2957 
I tested the fix by invoking the new code indirectly through the [de.dentrassi.maven.rpm](https://ctron.github.io/rpm-builder/index.html) Maven plugin and it successfully created a .rpm file larger than 2GB (the file created was 2487127517 bytes). I can no longer reproduce the problem, so I believe the fix works. At least on my system and use case.
Yes for sure.   I also noticed that the file is placed in `.stagging/www/js/plugins/AppAvailability.js` while other plugins are placed as `.stagging/www/plugins/com.plugin.name/www/Name.js`  
Ok seems like I was a bit hasty when pinning down the issue and creating an example this morning.  There is a reproducable issue but it is has nothing to do with slices but with maps: Assignment to struct fields of map entries is legal if the entry is referred to by a pointer.  Code ro reproduce (for real this time):    Apologies for leading you in thr wrong direction and thanks in advance for the fast responses and the **awesome** plugin.  Edit: plaground link: https://play.golang.org/p/Uucu_oN98l 
Exception stack is below. thanks.   
I tried to reproduce this issue by starting a music and stopping it during 1 hour. No error happenned but it seems that the error occurs when the bot has already been running for a few hours.  I have also tried to send silence instead of nothing using this code:  This did not fix the error.  **Timeline:** - My bot started at `2019-02-20 22:29:41.951` - The first error occurred 4h30 after, at `2019-02-21 03:03:30.862` - The last error occurred 10h30 after the first error, at `2019-02-21 13:36:35.275`  During this period, 13.436 PortUnreachableException were thrown.  Also, but I'm not sure if it is linked, my shards stop reconnecting after a while. They get stuck on `Retry attempt ... in ... ms` but I keep getting the PortUnreachableException. As quantic said, PUE are sent by epoll thread pool so it makes sense it could hog all resources.
Hi @NoNews,  I mean, scenario: the app is showing the permission request dialog to the user and, in this moment, the user clicks the button in the middle (https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPdkA.png) to move the app to background. If the user moves the app back to foreground (by clicking the third button), the dialog does not show again (as would be expected) and the onResume executes method onRequestPermissionsResult passing an empty array. Current NoPermission code moves the flow to the onSuccess Runnable and allows the user to pass without having accepted the permission.  Later I paste some code at home.
@HelgeStenstrom  I am not sure how it can be measured but definitely there is . Well there is [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) and [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/)
@samtstern I call it first thing in onCreate, in my application class.  Also, before I try to use any firebaseAnalytics call, I check that the FirebaseApp (the "[DEFAULT]" one) exists. But even if I tried to initialize it in some other place (for example when I get a response from my server), even by losing some events, should it be a problem?
I'm playing around with oc now, but i'm not at the level to control the reactor. So i did not tried the computer yet. But i'm glad that the computer port works with oc. 
Thanks for suggestion on --debug.  That showed we were pointing at two locations and one of these locations included some unwanted migration files.  Short term fix was to rm those files in build script and once we did that the "Ignored" issue went away.  Longer term fix is to add a gradle property to pass in the --locations.  Not to worry about the U22__allow_null_ordroutinginfo.sql as "Missing" that file still needs to be added to our build artifacts.  It's safe to close this ticket.
I sent links to your dev.exoplayer... email 
i have a paras nearby. the notification shows -24494832 minutes. when i open the app, and click on the pokemon (its the only visible pokemon) then only the name is displayed. not the timer. 
Nothing appears to trigger it, it is what happens when you spawn an npc and try to get it to find you. 
@spericas check this https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/1124
Fixed in the Release 1.1 I've just published :) 
The difference is that the `--out-file` I provided had a `.vcf` suffix. I have to provide some suffix here, because otherwise Exomiser deletes whatever is after the last period and replaces it with `.vcf` (e.g. `--out-file my.output.prefix` results in `my.output.vcf`. If I provide `--out-file path/to/out/vcf/file.vcf`, it tries to generate `path/to/out/genes.tsv/file.genes.tsv`.   One potential solution that might clarify things would be to change `--out-file` to `--out-prefix` and not have any suffix-parsing/overwriting. In the meantime, I need to switch to specifying `--out-file out.file.dummysuffix`. 
@marcingrzejszczak still no luck using those snapshots.
Nearby uploads did not require significant changes to regular uploads, I think it's very unlikely that the small changes made would have caused the failures. Also, the review re: failed uploads was made while production was still in 2.6 - if that user was in beta, I'd think he would have used beta feedback instead of quitting beta just so he could post a regular review.  I will try and look at what might be causing this when I work on the upload overhaul. It would be very helpful to know where the images were stored etc. though.

Yes, at least for Godot 2.1, it was "build successful"  I couldn't even export template for godot 2.1.4 even without the module, idk why, but it's a different problem  I haven't tried to use it in a project yet, i need some more time to understand how it works first.  Is it somehow possible to get it to work with 3.0.2?
That's a quick response! I forgot to say that multi-column-search should be true. multi-column-search="true" creates the filter fields for each column.   What I understood is a specific column is filtered. There is now Showcase for this on your page. They all have multi-column-search not set so basically default value false.  You just need to have one row, my previous example col1: John and col2: Dow.  Enter dow in the second column and the filter will exclude the row.  Thanks for having a look at this. 
Well, until now, only when I'm using Flubber this error happens, and I can't reproduce this error with another library. Maybe could be an error in the IDE...
@Nutomic K. WIll later today. :trollface: COuldn't donm't have root to be able to log the app. 
Hi Axel,  I'm attaching the sql file to create an empty assembly (I changed it to txt to upload).  I'm curious, how would you use this assembly?  Thanks  [EmptyAssembly.txt](https://github.com/flyway/flyway/files/2596497/EmptyAssembly.txt) 
Duplicating these steps on a server on my home network resulted in no error and the successful creation of a workspace.  I didn't anticipate ports being blocked over the course of a couple of hours and the only thing that I had seen that had changed was the software version.  My apologies and thank you for your time.  A follow-up question: when you refer to "the ephemeral port range"  are you referring to the port range 32768 to 61000 (typical Linux kernel range)?

Dubbo Spring Boot 0.1.1 and  Dubbo 2.6.2
1. I have patching enabled, it is set to biome 1 (plains, which is overriden by settings in BoP) 2. These biomes have existed since the first version. All of the biomes as of 0.4 are accounted for by this mod. (Botanical Garden was added in 0.4) 3. There was another crash like this (sometime after I encountered it the first time) that is somehow tied to ore gen from CoFHCore if it is to be believed. http://pastebin.com/SKg1mHJm 4. Would a full client log from when one of these crashes happened help at all? https://gist.github.com/Sunconure11/fa91f7f25ad8871922eb7882e3049c88 
Hi Leah, I've tried it with the 14.111.1 version, but unfortunately it doesn't help.
I've found a work around for the issue by not registering the gpdsc files to fGeneratedPacks unless it actually exist. This will also solve the issue with the listener which then is activated when the .gpdsc actually exist on disc. However, saving the rteconfig before the gpdsc will leave the GUI red for the CubeOption until a new selection event occurs. For this I've found no solution.
@brianhks , are you planning to release v1.3 anytime soon?  This particular issue is still bugging us: we've reduced the impact somewhat by increasing the limit to 10 mio datapoints, but nevertheless there's always guys querying more datapoints. So disabling the limit completely is not an option for us because this would lead to huge pressure in our C* cluster.
Nothing in that area was altered. I reinstalled the v2.2 released on Spigot and the issue seems to be gone. Not sure whether it was a restart or jar change that fixed it.
The bug is reproduced using both alpha10 and beta1. Requires quite a long list of records.
It doesn't help. I also tried moving Jetty from `providedCompile` to `providedRuntime` (which is default value for `providedConfiguration`) and JARs still get placed in both `lib` and `lib-provided`. 
Sure, I did reinstall it again after deinstalling AmazIT. And started the app at 19:10 Logcat is attached.

@davideas First of all, thanks a lot for looking into this!  What we would like to do with this list is that after loading the requested set of items (page) on screen startup, load the previous page as well automatically and add to the top, so user can start scrolling upwards if they liked to. It's currently disabled, but you can enable it in our app by uncommenting this line: [link](https://github.com/schedjoules/android-event-discovery-sdk/blob/f143950f9decad808a5e493a0a217bc3647ea17f/eventdiscovery-sdk/src/main/java/com/schedjoules/eventdiscovery/eventlist/itemsprovider/EventListItemsProviderImpl.java#L317-L317) (and then use "Event discovery 10 days from now" button on Main screen) So in this case it's independent from scrolling, we would like to add those items without any user interaction. Using a progress item on top and bottom is already in our backlog to implement, not sure if that would solve this though. Maybe I will try.  Looking at your example to reproduce it in your demo app I realized that the Header is not added to the list, which I also found in bold in the wiki afterwards, I totally missed it. It says: _"..The Header item doesn't have to be added directly to the list.."_. Does it mean that it must not be added? They are currently added in our app, I tried to remove them now but then they are not shown - tried to play with setDisplayHeadersAtStartUp() enableStickyHeaders() showAllHeaders(), maybe I just miss some order. If you say it's better not to add them, I will try to update after comparing with your demo.  Maybe I will also try to build from your branch with the partially fix commit to see if that simply fixes our issue.
Sorry!   **Jobs Version:** `4.15.5`
I opened ClientTest.java on windows 8, may therefore be there was this bug.

@davivel thanks for the hint, owncloud/core#6037 does fix the issue for me, indeed.  Closing this bug report 
I have Version 2.6-rc1 installed on my personal laptop, and it's fine, so it might be my work laptop. I'll check tomorrow. 
Thanks for fixing this so quickly, I tested with latest build, and it fixed my issue. Please help to schedule release
Using Postgres. The log clearly shows the error where LIMIT is added.
- I tried every versions: same behaviour - Each time - I don't think it comes from the auto-loading title. If i disable it, same thing. - Settings are correct - It works if I disable the share dialog  I think it's Lollipop related, because Shaarlier is also installed on my tablet (Jelly Bean 4.1) and it works perfectlly.  Hm, I could try the version 1.2.1 but I don't know how to compile for Android :/ 
1)  I receive data from a backend that I need to encode with specific set before appending them to an url later when actually loading it. Since it's on a performance critical path and dealing with many thousands, I do the encoding before saving to database. OkHTTP code fit that needs of specific sets and is way faster and allocation efficient than OS versions (Specially since I then need to do some replace in the generated string to fix the applied set)  2) Less important as less critical path, but I do need to generate simple static string urls with encoded login/password and place holders with manual encoding allocate a lot less than create a full blown httpurl and convert to string. (For that one I could use provided httpurl api) 
Just installed. Old measures aren't being retrieved. Will try new measures later.

@tlrx I had seen it but it seems to be implemented by `JSonXContentParser`, which returns `new BytesRef(CharBuffer.wrap(parser.getTextCharacters(), parser.getTextOffset(), parser.getTextLength()));` (which does a utf8 conversion) and none of the subclasses override it. 
Spider eyes look normal, with a slight glow to them, sorry bout not getting back to you sooner.
sorry sir. I don't think I have a good plan. Because in other databases, I'm not sure they follow the standard. As versions upgrade, other keywords may be added. So we have to have a unified standard that is compatible with any database, which is more complex and requires a lot of research.

ah, I guess we did that to be consistent with landscape mode. Landscape mode on small tablets has a FAB, but it's the "add task" button and the "complete task" option is in the details toolbar. So in order to be consistent we kept the complete option on the toolbar in portrait mode. However, I think we should show a FAB in that case now.
I did use the link you provided and it seems to be working now.  The number on the file name is the same version I had, but I assumed it just needed to be renamed.  That does fix it though.  Good work!

My hope is that IntelliJ is smart enough to honor the `version` attribute on the `xsl:stylesheet` element but yeah it's something to watch out for... I can't see any way of manually choosing the XSLT version.  An example issue it detects is the "undeclared template parameter `space`" in [wc.ui.text.text_space.xsl](https://github.com/BorderTech/wcomponents/blob/799c9f17db64cb1a617003b9308e75c44db2a203/wcomponents-theme/src/main/xslt/wc.ui.text.text_space.xsl#L22) which calls the template [wc.ui.text.n.WStyledTextContent.xsl](https://github.com/BorderTech/wcomponents/blob/799c9f17db64cb1a617003b9308e75c44db2a203/wcomponents-theme/src/main/xslt/wc.ui.text.n.WStyledTextContent.xsl#L9) that seriously looks to me like it doesn't have a `space` parameter...  There are over one hundred other such issues detected on this analysis alone.

> computing a centroid point for each triangle, and then averaging them in some way  Isn't that basically what the current implementation is doing? :thinking:  I think, for these degenerate polygons, when using an algorithm intended for regular areas, you'll by definition end up with a point that can be *anywhere* since you're basically at some point dividinging zero by zero for the weighted average.  > I wonder if there is a way to rearrange the calculation to make it numerically stable?  I was wondering that as well. But as far as I know (me not being an expert in this field at all), when working with floating point numbers, the best one can do is to minimize such rounding/truncation errors (e.g. by using more clever [summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)).
The problem still exists in 2.2.10. Also it seems that in 2.2.x the cluster strategy is generally set to "round-robin". Shouldn't a distributed setup always use "local"? 
@bensku i'm using  CraftBukkit version git-Spigot-596221b-9a1fc1e (MC: 1.12) (Implementing API version 1.12-R0.1-SNAPSHOT)  @bi0qaw and @TheBentoBox  for example i'm using this code  Edit: For beter visibility i've pasted this code [Here, click me !](https://hastebin.com/amuyarojeh.vbs)  separately the special bone powder works but with an item like a shield or something else it does not matter if it's the main hand or the secondary one it does not work, I even try without the "in hand / off hand"  thanks to read me
Hey @Harshil7924 and welcome!  Have a look at our [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Dev-Setup). In particular, you should familiarize with our [Entity System](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Entity-System-Architecture).  For this issue you might start investigating at `org.terasology.logic.inventory.ItemPickupAuthoritySystem#onBumpGiveItemToEntity` which handles the item pickup.

In my logs, some of the function names appear as net.minecraft.world.World.func_72939_s rather than net.minecraft.world.World.updateEntities, but other than that the messages I get look exactly like that.
What I saw when I looked at this was the  switch statement in the alias provider, and that wasn't called.  I will take another look at this later though.

Well idk to what it was related, but it seems to be fixed now... 
Thanks @mrniko for looking into the issue.  During this process we are not doing any writes. I'll verify the spikes issue in latest Redisson version and update thread.   Regarding Latency increase, i'll provide additional details. 
Restlet JSE 2.3.0 from the maven repo. I'm also including (using gradle):     compile group: "org.restlet.jse", name: "org.restlet.ext.json", version: "2.3.0"     compile group: "org.restlet.jse", name: "org.restlet.ext.fileupload", version: "2.3.0"     compile group: "org.restlet.jse", name: "org.restlet.ext.guice", version: "2.3.0"     compile group: "com.google.inject", name: "guice", version: "3.0"  Also, using the internal server, although this is a testcase, so I'm connecting right into the Application instance. The test cases (client) are in the same source tree as the server, so it's all the same version.

Awesome! It first occurred using Timetracker 2.3.0, but upgraded to 2.3.1 in hopes that it would fix the issue. The JIRA version is 6.4.6 build 64021 on java 1.8.0_40 from Oracle. I hope that helps. 
That would be helpful indeed! The ADQL is as follows:  `SELECT ivoid, short_name, res_title, reference_url, base_role, role_name, email, intf_index, access_url, standard_id, cap_type, cap_description, std_version, res_subjects FROM rr.resource AS res NATURAL JOIN rr.interface NATURAL JOIN rr.capability NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN rr.res_role NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT ivoid,  ivo_string_agg(res_subject, ', ') AS res_subjects FROM rr.res_subject GROUP BY ivoid) AS sbj WHERE (base_role='contact' OR base_role='publisher' OR base_role IS NULL) AND standard_id='ivo://ivoa.net/std/conesearch' AND intf_type='vs:paramhttp'` 
Is this the log?   
@TylerJewell - when I made the Git actions on Test2, Test2 had the context @eivantsov you do not need the import a project. You just create the project and then follow the steps I mentioned in my description. The challenge I face is that I want to push both projects to the **same** remote, i.e to the same Git repo.  When I push the first project to the remote, the project info (i.e the project name is "lost"). In the repo src is the root folder.  That is why when push to the repo a project with the same structure, Test2's src will overwrite Test1's src or there will be merge conflicts. Either way it is NOK.  Also if I add a new folder to Test2 and push it to the remote, if I do a pull on Test1 afterwards the new folder will be brought also in Test1 project.  Thank you for the support!

It happens the same, in the video you can see the version 1.11.2 of spigot  https://gyazo.com/e3120837b7fc2df2f955334c55cba7c2  https://i.gyazo.com/cd79ed493a5e22ed40285b3df15f8bd9.png
Hi @renyuneyun The application is the `sms backup +` application, and the intent is the action that triggers a backup.  Note that the "Run commands" profile "am broadcast -a com.zegoggles.smssync.BACKUP" makes the job, while the "Send broadcast" with the corresponding parameters does nothing at all. This makes me think that the problem is in Easer and not the other app, since a command is able to run the intent. But I may have missed some mechanisms. Please tell me if I can be of any help.
@cescoffier tried this in 1.0.0.Final and still getting the error. If I change the requestJson to be a byte[] instead of String it works.
A TiCon pickaxe, and they drop nothing at all. 
Its a timeout reaching the API server (see stacktrace, its in list())  Let's close this for now and see whether it comes back
Hi Nghi, Thanks for your answer. I start to understand the co-modeling, and I think you are right and I made a confusion between experiment instances and simulations. So definitely not an issue.  Cheers  Benoti
I see, at this point, the specific episodes aren't known, just the titles, so TitleRegEx is the only choice.  But how does a title that contains characters from the regex set get matched?  Since the encoding of  ()'s works, it appears that they're decoded before the regex is used. That's why putting a \ in front of them worked for the original case here. I thought that would apply to all of the regex characters that were part of the actual title (that should be matched without any expression.)  I found that this works:    That is, all of the regex characters in the title were replaced with periods. The %20 above were actually spaces when testing from my browser (plus signs work too, as expected.) 
Doesn't get truncated, and doesn't _seem_ to break anything. Just weird because we have a limit and it's not enforced. 
If there's an efficient way to make a list of my installed mods I could post it but idk of such thing. Oddly enough after trying the fix provided from #587 it seems to not spam the log nor have any latency. 
I'm currently running version 1.5.2 (I've tried running 2.0, but am running into compile issues and can't get v2 to build) 
Yes it does. 
I ran it as java -jar BaseX842-20160321.145321.jar -d (basexgui would run an earlier version I have installed)  I got the following stack trace (I'm not sure if it's related but since it mentions the clipboard I guess so):

This is related indirectly. We have contexts in the hierarchy that ultimately do not depend on `GenericApplicationContext` and some methods where not available. @jhoeller provided a pragmatic fix for that that explains why there are two new methods to implement in 5.2.   It looks like this will be interesting for `AnnotationConfigReactiveWebApplicationContext`.  `AnnotationConfigReactiveWebApplicationContext` should stop extending from `AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext`. There is a class affected in framework and I am waiting for Juergen to apply a consistent fix here.

Sorry for the confusion. This is the real issue: - add manager #1. Set max devices to 1. - log in as manager #1 and add manager #2 - log in as manager #2 - Add device #1 and save. The device is saved correctly. - Add device #2 and save. It doesn't save. That is correct but it should show an error. If you try to add device #1 while logged in as manager #1 it shows an error. 
@AndyScherzinger I uninstalled the app and removed the owncloud-beta folder.. yet getting the same error..

The could is the Postgres macaddr type. 
+1 spinscale  @spinscale's thought. 
@clintongormley maybe not all :) does Elasticsearch have a specific allowed set of field name character? ideally it should follow that as much as it can, right?  mainly used as an example to remind me what to change. I am still in the process of investigating how to properly declare these specific unicode character types within Joni
I've had a further look, but still none the wiser what the framework code is doing that we aren't. For now (since I'm not using this code in production), I'm just going to put the `Domain.GetComputerDomain()` line in the appropriate place. The SSPI API documentation from Microsoft is dismal. 
@freimair I suppose, but I'm not sure where to find/create a log. Could you point me in the right direction?  I did notice that another Github issue that was submitted is similar to this one and that user submitted a log. Maybe that one is useful too here: https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/issues/3517
Yes it happens on the sample app as well , no the android api or google api emulators don't have a problem with it , on debug I do not see anything strange. I am using sdk 11 , the xperia has ics 4.0.1 on it

No, I only know what I'm seeing here, and the apparent inability to ignore it.  I tested this in a few IDEs below.  They all show different information than Flyway.  Perhaps it's the driver interpretation?  In any case, this blocks us from proceeding with the POC we are doing on the trial for PRO.

So making a loosely coupled design (not perfect though) hard wired again so that it integrates better in the old fashioned design? I am a bit hesitant about that.   Actually we are talking about WPS **4.0** right? Don't know about resources available for discussing current and future architecture and how to wire components and (probably more important) for implementing whole stuff.  Do we have a refactor strategy available, at least listing all core components which will have to be refactored? Is [Iceland](https://github.com/52North/iceland) the only next step? Seems to be a bit fuzzy (at least for me) what consequences this will have too.

Thanks for that.  I just tried to use that latest jar, did a complete clean setup of the proxy I built to query verdict and it still failed unfortunately.  I'm running the following query just to try and get it to work:   `uptime` is a simple table, with a single `string` column and a single row.  I've tried a few other variations as well but it's not working unfortunately.  Are there perhaps other tests I can try? 
Sorry, It seems I was wrong I could catch the bug on studio 2.3.3 and plugin 2.3.3 still. I'll try to make a sample soon. It annoying to reproduce the bug because I need to scroll excessively. I also notice that on all crashes free RAM was about 2-5%  I got full dump:

@cescoffier this did not fix it, same issue appears again.  I read something, that is has something to do with the classloader and the way kafka loads its services. ( `org.apache.kafka.common.utils.Utils#getContextOrKafkaClassLoader`, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37363119/kafka-producer-org-apache-kafka-common-serialization-stringserializer-could-no )  I missed out some information for you: Maybe it is important to know, that my Serializers/Deserializers are in a separate maven module, which is referenced by the main module. I already tried using the default "JsonObjectSerializer.class", but that didn't work either. My simplified serializer looks like this:

Well, to be honest, this should be a Connection property, rather than a Connector property. But the way we have the Concur connector now is that you can only change the OAuth settings at the Connector level. So this makes the `Host` property at a setting at Connector level -- otherwise you might setup OAuth URLs to point to _implementation_ environment and Connection host property to point to _production_ environment. (It's also a quirk of Concur to have OAuth apps that don't span multiple environments, as Salesforce, Google and Twitter do).  With that preamble, we only have this need for the Concur connector, we don't have it for any other connector we currently ship. And it seems that it's super specific to how Concur has things setup. In the long run we might find other systems that work this way, then we need to think about OAuth settings at Connection level I think.  I think users will set these properties mostly once, I think users will mirror the environments they use in Syndesis, meaning production Syndesis instance would target production environment of a system, and test Syndesis instance would target test environment of a system.
R3 and the 1.7 Release happened on a few of the last dev builds too.

I was thinking of changing the code in NettyRoutingFilter to also check if the response is a ServerHttpResponseDecorator, and if yes, get its delegate.

Yes, I lose it.  To make it clearer: A-Z sorting is the default, but for me, it realizes in this strange "clustered" ordering I described in #2303. When I explicitly set A-Z ascending sorting, it becomes somewhat better: the folders in the folder become truly alphabetically ordered, and the files take up an order that resembles an alphabetical one more, but there is still a degree of this quirky clustering. If I leave the folder and come back to it, it reverts to the first version of the "clustered" ordering.

https://gyazo.com/de036f1fd85b8983359cf7f29adc00d1  Gyazo didnt last long enough for it to reset twice but it doesn't always reset at the same temperature, it seems to be a fairly short time that varies by about a second or 2. This is an outside picture of how I have it set up: https://gyazo.com/fc19be7ea1b8da86ca79827d32dc4b97 I have 2 export busses from AE2 exporting the deuterium and tritium into the reactor. And to power it up, I placed a powercell from Thermal Dynamics on top of it. The blue blocks are infinite water sources from PressurePipes, they put out something like 60mb/t of water into the coolers   Edit: I just noticed both tanks in the reactor have deuterium, this is because I put it back to how I first started it up just to see what would happen 
I have tried using only what MyTown provides and then also attempted the ForgeEssentials mod.  It worked with allowing MyTown commands to be ran but also allowed students to break blocks inside of protected areas and gave OP commands as well.  It could be my lack of knowledge with FE and how it works exactly but it felt like it would require running through 1000+ commands one by one in order to get FE to work properly with the EDU setup and combing through every command to learn exactly what it does.  I tried their denydefault but kept getting syntax errors (again, limited updates due to forge 1291).  I tried mytown.cmd.outsider.\* and mytown.cmd.everyone.\* by itself with default FE permissions and with mixes of many attempts of other setups - all led to dead ends and frustration w/o permissions working the way I thought they should or wanted.  There could also be something behind the scenes with the EDU version with permissions but documentation on it is pretty much non existent.  I have started combing through the code for their wrapper and launcher but have limited time lately as life is a bit busy.  I'll keep chuggin along to see what happens.  Any advice or thought is appreciated.  Thanks!!   
I will try to.. I am in the middle of a release now, so my time is literally non-existent. But I will try to do it just after that.

Our Valkyrie is currently on the master branch for JSC software and the develop branch for IHMC software. However, this hasn't worked for a while now on the real robot. I've never had a problem with it in simulation though and I've been on a few versions. 
John, I believe in this situation it would suffice.   thanks again for looking into this problem. Konstantin 
I have not yet checked why exactly the CXF-Servlet is reading after the exception, it is used to provide a SOAP webservice and wants to convert all exceptions into a SOAP-fault to send to the client.  As to reproducing:  The first read throws the IllegalStateException for me as well but I do not get the following ones you posted, I use putty in RAW-Mode as "HTTP-Client" in my tests and there is one more detail I did not realize:  If I just paste the short invalid POST request and do nothing more I get a timeout after 30sec and all is fine, however if I send some more content afterwards (eg pressing ENTER) the threads starts looping and there is no more timeout. Even when the socket is closed there are no more exceptions.  I can also trigger this by sending a larger amount of data, my guess is that there has to be more data than some internal buffer-size (8k?) so that there is still something to read for the second call. 
Sure. I'm not at home right now, but when I get home tonight I'll post it.   Thanks for the response!  
Thanks. Please do not misunderstand: I've been happily using ANTLR, including previous versions, for years, to create parsers in Java. I've been testing ANTLR's limits lately trying to implement a poorly designed grammar (too many ambiguities - produced by someone else) while modifying the grammar as little as possible.  Regarding rule parameters and return values - I would have expected a full description as a section under "Parser Rules" in the Grammar Reference Your example of getting rid of left-recursion would be better if it also showed the effect on tail recursive rules. One of the harder issues with any parser generator technology, including ANTLR, is implementing the parser to generate good (from a user's point of view) error messages. I'd like to see a very full discussion of that in the book, with plenty of examples. - David     From: Terence Parr notifications@github.com   To: antlr/antlr4 antlr4@noreply.github.com    Cc: David Cok cok@frontiernet.net    Sent: Friday, July 10, 2015 6:50 PM   Subject: Re: [antlr4] crash on adding an argument to a rule (#953)  you will note that the soon to be released version that response to that issue now generates a proper error message.what is it about the book that is unclear about parameters ( other than left recursive arguments)?

With the value set to true, the tests don't run at all: they just seem to hang with their corresponding spinners spinning away. I did try pausing execution, and it looked like it was cycling between three different lines in the time4j library. Looked like it was maybe waiting for initialization, but I unfortunately didn't make notes of the lines in question.  With the value set to false, the tests fail quickly as described. 
I checked, we only unbind from ButterKnife when the fragment's view is destroyed, and it doesn't look like that's happening. 
Thanks for the fast answer. Here is the pastebin.  http://pastebin.com/f8JAyx50
(as you already saw,) I created PR https://github.com/deeplearning4j/rl4j/pull/38  With just that change and no others I get the same exception: ` org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidInputException: Cannot do forward pass in Convolution layer (layer name = 0, layer index = 1): input array depth does not match CNN layer configuration (data input depth = 240, [minibatch,inputDepth,height,width]=[1, 240, 320, 3]; expected input depth = 1) `  This seems different than issue https://github.com/deeplearning4j/rl4j/issues/37 which seems to indicate it is running vs with the conv+history it just crashes.
@spyhunter99 @cbalster Hi, thanks for your help. Here is the Fabric stacktrace :   
The first issue is very weird. I discovered that there are actually 3 different "states" I can get it to be in: - Click/tap a file -> Nothing shows - Click/tap a file -> Go to a different app -> Go back -> Partly shown - Click/tap a file -> Swipe from bottom (up to around 1/5 of the screen height) -> Partly shown but misplaced  Attaching screenshots in the mentioned order: ![screenshot 2018-10-25 at 22 13 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5497761/47503062-2d3cde00-d8a4-11e8-8d21-d7deca8e7b49.png) ![screenshot 2018-10-25 at 22 14 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5497761/47503063-2dd57480-d8a4-11e8-9ae8-5ccc88ada7ec.png) ![screenshot 2018-10-25 at 22 14 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5497761/47503064-2dd57480-d8a4-11e8-8af0-b03837f47850.png)   
Thanks. Updated to 2.0.3-SNAPSHOT, the bug fixed.

My bad, I was not clear enough. 
well it didn’t work and I was doing it right but it seemed to fix itself when I overloaded my game with other mods.so it kind’ove works only the food doesn't go down in the feeder still also my velocorapters keep spawning out of the cage.

I am running Ubuntu 18.04, mostly updated.  I'm not using any plugin for discord at all on Bungee.   It would be lovely to have this working, unfortunately, that's the only thing I've seen in the log when starting up Bungee, so I'm afraid I can't be of a whole lot of use to you in that.

Don't know if it would be compatible with our boot version and other third-parties... Basically, I believe, making read transactional may be enough, but as for me the idea with while-true loop is not obvious. Don't see when it could be helpful to execute same flow till it returns 0 executed actions...  I may extract my PostgreSQL cluster config and try it on Minikube with very basic demo app for latest release to check. But can't say when I'll have enough free time to do that, may take a few days.
1. I have an HP Spectre x360 13t running Windows 10 1903, though this issue has always occurred, even before 1903. Specs are as here:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21211494/61143022-bf1e6280-a496-11e9-90dc-4c9b79da11fa.png) I think I heard HP makes their own display drivers or something like that, instead of using the Windows ones, so that could very well be part of the problem too.  2. Switching to software rendering didn't change anything. Nor did switching to OpenGL.

Oh, yes!, that worked..  interesting. So even though I set the timezone, i need to add it to the format.  Thanks 
thanks for your answer.  i'm trying to make web application which can auto-fill behalf of the users.  is selenide library not working in spring web projects?     
Hi Pete,  yes indeed. It works if pixel size information is available.   I work with jpg´s without pixel size information at the moment.   Thank you for your explanation! 
Version 8 Update 91, so it should be the newest version.  Until now it did not happen in maximized window mode. Any idea what it could be? 
I have managed to reproduce this on different Android versions (4.2, 4.4, 5.1).

I used the Companion block found in the Chest. I placed it down successfully, but when I clicked on it (I can't remember if it was left or right), my game crashed. It happened as soon as I clicked (instantly).

Hi @jakubklimek , Thank you for your prompt answer.   The file I send is used by Pipeline input component.   I made the changes as you suggested. The lowercase boolean values raised an error in Python as was recognised as variables. So I capitalised the first letter to be an eligible python dictionary.   Then the json=payload as long as I undestand serializes this as json data to post with the request.   However the pipeline still runs with the debug data on. It seems to somehow been ignored. Is there somehow logged what was received as request on LP? Maybe this is a python related issue. 
I'm using the v2.0.1
Thanks for your quick reply.  I'm still struggling with the localization of the heading of an argument group. Using a literal string as heading text (using the code fragment given below) works great for me:    Hopefully you can clarify what's the correct way to get the heading text of an argument group localized.  > I like all your suggestions to improve the docs, in addition we can also add an example to `picocli-examples/src/main/java/picocli/examples/arggroup`.  Great to hear that.   > Do you feel like providing a pull request for this?  Yes, I will try to prepare a PR. I can't promise it though. 
Yeah, sorry about that. I copied the unmodified code. Anyway I just used RotateImageTransform to the code to optically inspect the result in the specified images.
_Could it be drive related ? The reference projects are on another drive than my actual project. In any case, see log below (i have omitted project dirs for clarity). It's working on the first opened project on D: drive, not on the one on C: drive. (tested with x=y spaces removal)_  EDIT: I tested some more, and it probably has something to do with project settings not yet been read and the default settings being used, because when I reopen projects it works (even if in the default settings everything except save and `CTRL-SHIFT-S` is unchecked)  Also FYI: there is a shortcut command to get to the idea logs in the menu help>show log in explorer> gets you to the directory (or is this windows only ?) .  
We use a Dana RS.  In any case,  the last bolus statement lines has the info of the current bolus,  not the previous one ![IMG_20191102_085634](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30212759/68060059-c079e080-fd4e-11e9-8f5a-86b032472a99.jpg)

Hello PavelKulagin, Hello DominikDary,  thank you for your help. First I tried the solution from Pavel manually then I adjusted the SelendroidServerBuilder and SelendroidConfiguration class to do the following during startup: - I can now not only give the .keystore-file, but also the password and the alias during startup (they were hard coded in SelendroidServerBuilder) - Furthermore I added MyApp.RSA and MyApp.SF to the deletion list in SelendroidServerBuilder (its a hack I know ...)  My homebrew selendroid server starts, deletes the files, resigns with my keystore :-)  But I still geht the INSTRUMENTATION_FAILED error. :-( I recognised that the app ist not even deployed to the device, therefore I deployed it via adb install to retrieve a new error: - after install I cannot run the test since selendroid says the device is in use - if I restart selendroid I get the following:  Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM io.selendroid.io.ShellCommand exec Information: executing command: C:\Projekte\Mobile\Android\sdk\sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe -s emulator-5554 forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080 Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM io.selendroid.android.impl.AbstractDevice startLogging Information: starting logcat: Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM io.selendroid.android.impl.AbstractDevice isSelendroidRunning Information: using url: http://localhost:8080/wd/hub/status Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: Software caused connection abort: recv failed Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: Retrying request Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: Connection reset Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: Retrying request Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: Connection reset Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: Retrying request Mai 29, 2014 2:20:50 PM io.selendroid.android.impl.AbstractDevice isSelendroidRunning Schwerwiegend: Error getting status: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset Mai 29, 2014 2:20:52 PM io.selendroid.android.impl.AbstractDevice isSelendroidRunning Information: using url: http://localhost:8080/wd/hub/status Mai 29, 2014 2:20:52 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: Connection reset Mai 29, 2014 2:20:52 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: Retrying request Mai 29, 2014 2:20:52 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute Information: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: Connection reset Mai 29, 2014 2:20:52 PM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute  I would be very thankful for further suggestions.

you apparently answered your own questions :P 
uhm i dunno, but it happened only 1 time.
no, no. will try now. 
I agree, an additional check for the cluster ID should reduce occurrences of this issue. I will attempt a PR (and maybe I get other ideas on how to improve this when doing this, in which case I would add a comment to this ticket here before implementing them).
yes, as long as I move around the stuttering is pretty much constant and occasionally you can hear the sound cackling or popping.
Here's the log: [lsp.log](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-debug/files/3966544/lsp.log)  I also fixed the URL to link to the project workspace if you want to try it yourself.
It seems partially but not completely fixed.  The screen with the sliders still reports the minimum values, and the text output for the battery storage still reports the minimum limit... however, it seems that the battery is charged to the appropriate level, and a plasma cannon seems to actually reflect the settings when used.  (That is, for the plasma cannon, the tinker screen reports the minimum values, but when fired, max charge plasma damage does actually go up to what it should be when the damage is maxed, and turning up the explosion effect does result in explosions when the plasma balls land.)

No, go for it! I made another slight modification to the script since it wasn't showing the last item in certain cases. However, I've noticed that the RTL stuff is still broken, particularly on larger screens and I haven't yet been able to determine why.

If it is a conflict, I have no way of knowing, because it works on all my server's members that have windows/linux operating systems..just not the mac users. It would have to be done at a later date, and they're not too happy, because I already spent time uninstalling and reinstalling stuff and such. Is there a mod conflict checker or something? Or better yet, a way to make mac run Java better?..lol clairfy core mods, if that will lower the work load.

No, indentation in the project was set to 4 spaces, that’s what I meant by RStudio ignoring the project settings. I should add that when I saw it was 4 in the project settings, I erased the value, put it on 4 again and saved the project, but that did not fix the bug. Only changing it to a different number, saving it, and then changing it back to 4 fixed it.   I do also have _Auto-detect code indentation_ turned off, but my understanding is that it shouldn’t have mattered anyway, its tooltip said that this should only apply to files that are not part of any project. In any case, having it on or off did not change anything about this bug. 
@ronblum In the case of the variable extraction that appears to be correct. However, in the case of the function extraction it doesn't appear that a valid call to the newly created function is added. Moving the function would result in this code:

The issue is not that we have to guess what type of Sequence we have; that is unavoidable. The problem is that _the type guessed by getSequence() is not neccessarily the type of the Hsp returned_. Ideally the logic would go something like "if( T extends DNASequence && string looks like DNA) {new DNASequence(string)} else if( T extends RNASequence ...." However, due to type erasure there is no way to get any information about T at runtime.  All the work-arounds I can think of would require to changing the API. 
Hi @drewr ew, I hope you don't mind, I emailed them to you as they contain data I'd prefer not to post publicly :)  @s1monw no stack traces from this in any logs on any ES node.

as you said , if genre isn't yet implemented , the problem is to implement genre  anyway - if genre is blank or unavailable api/index/video.json?type=series&include=genre-Action  should return 0 items  the example is : api/index/video.json?type=series&include=genre-Action which return all series  
Yes it is a very special procedure to reproduce the problem. For me it was adding the mapper 1st then the aggregate. We have many ways to write the integrations right!? 
Mvn clean install Regular ( non empty) state
That doesn't seem to help. The only way I got something running again was to leave the beta and install the latest released version, which worries me that next updates will break on my device.  I also tried to reboot the phone, but that didn't help.  Run conditions shouldn't be a problem. Anyway, I tried to run on the usual WiFi wile plugged in and nothing loads.  While the app is stuck loading I cannot even check the settings, which doesn't help me do diagnoses what's going on not to try and change something

Check my repo supersonic-cpp, it's my own. So, do you see how could it be that the path ends up containing the string "null"? Cause I don't! There's explicit checks for ==/!= null in most places to prevent that.
@ahmedaljazzar It's okay if I use directly `setLocale(locale, context)`. Restart activity with correct language. But when I use ChangeLanguageDialog, restart activity with current language. Nothing has changed. Still showing current language in language dialog in next time activity launch.
Because it could be problematic in the future for servers that are taking longer to update, it would prevent players from playing entirely for a period of time, so I prefer to still inform, in case the bug isn't fixed by the update itself ^^

1.8.9 actually. When I have the time, I'll check if I can get it to work in another way. I'll inform you if I can identify the problem. I'm a bit busy this week though. Perhaps on the weekend. 
@eolivelli Sure. I will send a pull request later.
Same code, but `jooby-undertow` instead of `jooby-netty`, it works. Thanks, this is a good enough workaround for me right now :)

Hi, When I try it without my change I get an occasional hang (something to do with user preferences) and the last time it tried to load the URL from the current directory so in this case failed to read file C:\MemoryApps\http:\localhost:8080\LastGC.log  Looking at the code I couldn't see it working it seemed to just pass the argument to the method expecting a file name.  With the change I have it working though I got an occasional fail to read the file (my jnlp passes a null argument) (it may be a webstart bug as there was one reported around these lines though I thought it fixed), so I have now changed to passing and reading a system property from within the JNLP to gcviewer  and that works every time.  I still am investigating an issue where I have an occasional issue where it fails to read user preferences and null pointers on loading recentURLs, I've changed the code to just empty string if it can't load from the file rather than crash and that works fine.  My use case is as part of my test results I have a web page of GC logs, I previously had the option to copy the link as an URL into gc viewer manually which does work but it was suggested if I could web start gcviewer and pass the URL requested in that would be nicer and I do have it working in principle.  thanks for the reply   Chris  PS I needed the replace but that may just have been with the way I was testing, I don't need that replace in real world usage. 
more tests now this morning: first refresh of all live maps manually, then start of test allways starting with clear cache. 1 - same as reported, but i watched and could see in system reporting in top line download some obf. 2 - same as reported, but i watched and could see in system reporting in top line download some more obf. 3 - same as reported, but i watched and could see in system reporting in top line download some more obf. 4 - no more obf, no more "unnecessary refresh" 5 - no more obf, no more "unnecessary refresh" So it is clear, but i am astonished about often dnl of files within 2 or 3 minutes. sorry.

I tried this,  and /ignore - set up as an alias - still results in "Unknown command".  You are correct about /eignore?  I wasn't aware this was automatic, from the documentation it seemed to suggest that I MUST set up an alias if another plugin had a command of the same name for that to work.  Specifically:  `# If you have two plugin with the same command and you wish to force Essentials to take over, you need an alias.`  Anyway i got the idea that putting ignore on the override list would also be necessary if I didn't want to use /eignore but wanted /ignore to utilize the essentials:ignore function.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't the alias be essentials:ignore $$1-
Yesterday it seemed to be happening when I cancelled at any point. Right now it's only happening consistently if I cancel between observation and photo upload, i.e. when it says "1 new, 0 updated." I do have to wait 10-20 seconds for the unexpected sync to kick in, and it seems to complete really quickly. This is an observation with a photo but not project observations, no fields, not even a location.

@marceloverdijk  Thanks for the quick reply. When I commented out and built loadDirectory and loadFile, it was processed normally. It's not just a simple jdk problem, it's because Android does not support java.nio.file.Path. I have identified issues with similar issues, including:  https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/345  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41787774/class-file-for-java-nio-file-path-not-found
Executing `hostname` throws correctly `openHABianPi`. Did you test it in a clean installation?

Storing in Android contacts is unreliable for some devices, so I'll do that just as informative data for the user, but not for actual use in-app. Also, integrating with something else like OpenKeyChain would be nice; it could confuse some users but other might benefit from it. 
@nynymike , me and Zamil were checking it today. The issue with "duplicate uid" still was preventing us from testing it properly. But judging by William's last comment in corresponding report - https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxTrust/issues/102 -  it has just been fixed, so we'll be able to check its status in one of the upcoming releases.

@marshhxx, yes, that's basically what solved the problem for me. I didn't really import a modified JAR. I just downloaded the source file from the repo, put it under the same package in my project's source, modified it, and rebuilt the project. 
Alright, thought it might be easier for you to find out the correct message.  It i deed shows {petname} in blue in the chat. Forgot to screenshot it yesterday.  How do you mean merge exactly? 
Yes, I just tried it in the newest build. Created the exact same tank, and saved it. Attached is a screencap of each window from SAW. Also note that neither the Hovercraft or Displacement Superheavy Options have the side armor properly allocated, with the sides becoming 2 locations each. I just noticed that remaking it.    ![Mecklenburg preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48396292/61583916-acde9d00-ab04-11e9-8c66-046908bc2bc8.png)
here is the feature list:   I'll need to check to make sure we can share the classloading trace in the open.
Will do, closing for now until I have the time to try this out. 
Well you somewhat do ignore it. Your NEI plugin shows that a partially damaged gold armour can be inserted into the smeltery, but when I shift click it in, nothing happens.   The recipe definitions in your official source code hard code meta value as zero (undamaged). My recipe definitions added the ItemStack as typed in my original post. 
The problem lies with parsing the following prior XML bit:  <!-- Using the binomialLikelihood we specify a 50% prior mass on no predictors being included.--> 				<binomialLikelihood> 					<proportion> 						<parameter value="0.2928932188134524"/> 					</proportion> 					<trials> 						<parameter value="1.0"/> 					</trials> 					<counts> 						<parameter idref="location.coefIndicators"/> 					</counts> 				</binomialLikelihood>  Do you need me to e-mail you a full XML file?
sure, but that will be next time i log in here. (tomorrow night) 
 I am accessing cloudfoundry through a proxy server so I am using a `ProxyConfiguration` as well.

Whoops, yeah that looks incomplete.  1. create a text field with index_phrases = true 2. create a custom search analyzer with the synonym_graph filter 3. Index something and do a query with the analyzer created above  (I'm currently on holiday away from my workstation, but the above should result in the error)  
It still doesn't create directories inside my repository nor downloads any artifacts. Creating .gem\bin manually and copying the cucumber script yielded limited success. After another Maven run, further subdirectories of .gem had been created, but no gems had been downloaded.

Hm ok. It's only the SteamGameServerAPI part that is not working for him. He has "Ubuntu Mate 1.16.2" installed
Yes, I just updated from 0.1 to 0.4. Now I uninstalled the 0.4 version and reinstalled it and everything works fine. Maybe some issues with the settings. Thanks a lot - great app!!! 
Thank you for your help.

I don't think this is broken? SetTime works for me without having to change the brightness? 
I'm using kolab notes 2.0.8 on Android 6.0. The export function generates the following data: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><note xmlns="http://kolab.org" version="3.0"><uid>edcbad34-c93e-441a-b154-b0b3f96a46e3</uid><prodid>kolabnotes-java</prodid><creation-date>2016-06-20T13:25:11Z</creation-date><last-modification-date>2016-06-22T11:25:11Z</last-modification-date><classification>PUBLIC</classification><summary>Test</summary><description/><color/></note>`  I've looked at the code and found the following: - When choosing export from the menu, the `AsyncTask` named `ExportNotebook` from `OverviewFragment` is executed. - Here, in https://github.com/konradrenner/kolabnotes-android/blob/e8ac5992c78de6bd841986da425be9b500e48ed6/app/src/main/java/org/kore/kolabnotes/android/fragment/OverviewFragment.java#L1403, `NoteRepository.getFromNotebook(...)` is called to get the Notes from the Notebook. - Then, all columns from the note are loaded: https://github.com/konradrenner/kolabnotes-android/blob/e8ac5992c78de6bd841986da425be9b500e48ed6/app/src/main/java/org/kore/kolabnotes/android/content/NoteRepository.java#L165 - However, `cursorToNoteWithoutDescription(...)` is called: https://github.com/konradrenner/kolabnotes-android/blob/e8ac5992c78de6bd841986da425be9b500e48ed6/app/src/main/java/org/kore/kolabnotes/android/content/NoteRepository.java#L176 - ... which does not take into account the description attribute (the method name gives already a hint)!

Yes, Tinkers' Construct fluids also render without their tint. https://i.imgur.com/fDgfZRC.png  I also found that molten uranium from IE renders without a color. https://i.imgur.com/GD2Hl6J.png
It doesn't throw an error anymore and the call to getAuditLog works perfectly fine! However, I have noticed that when listening for a BanEvent the user field in the BanEvent is empty, i.e. the id is 0, the username is null and so on. I tried this both on my actual bot and on a clean new example bot - same result. The guild field of the BanEvent is correct though.
It worked! Thank you very much.

Yes I am using Citizens2 and ShopKeepers. The error only started happening when I updated StackMob.  I understand that its not caused by StackMob, however, the error is. Hence, It would be good idea to handle it. I made a PR check it out let me know if its ok 🙂 #78 
@dariuszseweryn   Unfortunately, adding  does not prevent the queue hanging.
The stacktrace is self-explanatory, one can see from the flow of the source code that no converter is being employed. Here's the markup `             <b:datepicker id="sd" value="#{testBean.startTime}"                           format="dd.MM.yyyy"                           ajax="true" update=":f:config">               <f:converter converterId="calendarConverter"/>             </b:datepicker> `  and the converter class:  ` @FacesConverter(value = "calendarConverter") public class CalendarConverter implements Converter {    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(CalendarConverter.class.getName());   private final SimpleDateFormat DATE_FORMAT = new SimpleDateFormat("dd.MM.yyyy");    // and so on `  the converter is created but neither of its methods is being called.   @zhedar, what do you mean by "we didn't implement this use case"? The whole story about converters is that you actually don't need to worry about different use cases, just tell me what your component expects and it's gonna be my responsibility to use proper converter.  
Hi, `System.out.println(graph.getEdge(v.getId()).getClass());` displays `class com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.orient.OrientEdge`. However, the second line throws a `ClassCastException: com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.orient.OrientVertex cannot be cast to com.tinkerpop.blueprints.Edge`  I runned the second line step by step. In the next() method of OrientElementIterator, the isEdgeType() test returns false:    Hope this helps. 
`com.orientechnologies.orient.core.exception.OConcurrentCreateException: Cannot create the record #17:0 because the assigned RID was #17:1 instead DB name="testdb" DB name="testdb"`  and nothing much, but result is it doesn't work. it doesnt create data.
Soory. It seems to be problem of the Apache server. After deactivating nextcloud the problems came after some time back.  Have the reinstall the server and in the moment it's working. Can't investigate the problem anymore. 
Sorry, I wiped syncthing's data so i could try to reproduce this bug, but I forgot to make a backup first. 
hi i created a test project at https://github.com/chongma/test.  i couldn't get the b:dateTimePicker to render the calendar at all in the example.  not sure why.  so maybe the modal is a red herring

@ConorTheDev it happened to be when I adjusted my render distance but only for a second or two, and hasn’t happened since.  A lot of people have reported it in the discord also.  You might as well ask them.  
Sure,  The java Main class is very simple and it is not included in the .jar file:     I've renamed the file to jar.zip, because Github rejects .jar file extensions.  [org.xjsinterop.dsl-1.0.0.jar.zip](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm/files/1011929/org.xjsinterop.dsl-1.0.0.jar.zip)   
@asolntsev   no feedback from chromedriver. Maybe it's related to the recent chromedriver.
It looks like this problem only happens when you try to define a task that modifies the main class.  Maybe you could help me debug this problem at some time. 
That reasoning is correct, but the behaviour does not follow that exactly. Sometimes the UI shows a panel as selected (e.g. the focus is in the filter box) but Ctrl+W wont close it unless an issue is selected in that panel. Yes, closing a panel should move focus to another panel. 
@ronblum In the course of trying to document this I realized my mistake! It seems if you have a  tag included in the highlighted text that Rstudio can recognize as documentation (like `@example` or `@param` or even `@` by itself), then using ctl+shift+c will result in `#'` inserted instead of `#` - could you confirm this is true? Or am I still missing some nuances in how the shortcut works?  I didn't see this behavior documented when looking at the rstudio IDE cheatsheet, but perhaps I missed it? I had assumed initally when I posted the issue that there would be a separate shortcut to add #' to lines of code instead of #, which was incorrect.  I think this implementation is logical and no feature request is needed. Feel free to close issue.  To make this clearer to others who may see this, this is the behavior I have discovered. If I have 3 lines in an r script opened within Rstudio:   So plain comment symbols (`#`) were inserted instead of documentation symbols (`#'`). This last chunk was what I was trying originally, which lead to my misconception. 
I'll give it a try. Setting up an empty server with FE as the only mod. 
Everything seems fine, no crashes of any kind :) 
using   compile 'com.github.devlight.navigationtabbar:navigationtabbar:1.2.3'  I just started a new project, and I tried  your library, but I keep getting that error.  thanks  
Cant confirm becouse I cant run my server without TT, I think its TT becouse its also handeling network stuff.  If its not how would I be able to fix it? 
It would be needed in a sense that we want to know if the data is loaded but is empty. If at any time the data is not loaded that can imply two possibilities: 1. Data was empty or 2. Data was never loaded due to some other unknown issue.  In the later situation, if there were no errors or warnings by the system, one has to go and cross check why the data was never loaded. This can be avoided when we load the data into the database irrespective of its nature.  This is particularly required when there is a batch execution of similar csvs every day or every week.

You can see the code in https://github.com/proofpoint/platform/blob/master/http-server/src/main/java/com/proofpoint/http/server/HttpServer.java  SHA1 stream ciphers are not currently a problem.  HackGzipHandler works around a Jetty bug that has subsequently been fixed. I have not yet gotten around to pulling that out.
Oh ok, I saw that last time I looked at a crash report and apparently misunderstood how to read them, now I see the "caused by" line.

Thank you @serge-rider.  I didn't know the dialog was resizable because, it's not something common for dialogs in Windows, maybe you could put an icon in the corner like the diagonal lines in TEXTAREAS:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/197329/62970812-52242280-bdde-11e9-86ac-f5f5e269f48c.png) 
I think that's a good idea, if/when we can arrange it. 
If I disable the extensions, I don't see this behaviour.
Please see the commited unit test in my fork, if you debug it and change the offset array input for second `extractOne` call from `[10, 8]` to `[9, 8]`, it will serialize the example message body properly. 
You should be able to use the SHA1 hash of the filename quite safely - keep in mind git uses SHA1 hashes for every object inside every commit and doesn't have an issue with collisions.  http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-probability-that-two-two-commits-of-different-git-repositories-have-exact-same-SHA-hash 
Thank you very very much for your efforts.  The second version worked. Only thing that was weird was that the migration/upgrade process took less then a minute and I read that it takes 10 to 30 minutes. But after a short view my permissions seem to be correct.  Perhaps you are interested in that I didn't have a /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/xprivacy.db\* file.  Again thank you and best regards to South-Holland :) 
Yes, that's correct. I'm using my own Docker image (which I have used without problems up until ES 5.5.1).
You need change the phone language, and after that, you need reinstall or refresh the metadata. I tested it  with development branch, in real device and in the emulator. And i have this bug always. I tested it against hnqis and hnqis-dev-ci with my user.

Hello,  I have changed the configuration of the river with :    The attribute "json_support" has been removed and yes, the array esFiles is no more empty, I can see in the logs Deleting from ES baseproduit, produit, d18e3335a16d174fb3111988357aa6ec  However, my document is never deleted in the index.  After some investigations, I could find the root of the problem. It's due to my windows environment.  Indeed, the id of the document is created by signing "c:\json-river/465.json" --> id = b4576076c0f4be5bbf3e29f36bc8af4d But, for the deletion, the process signs "c:\json-river\465.json" --> id = d18e3335a16d174fb3111988357aa6ec  In order to fix this first pb for windows environment, you can change with File.separator in your code line 711                 // We index             esIndex(indexName, typeName,                         SignTool.sign(filepath + File.separator + filename),                         source);      The json_support is exactly what I need and it works perfectly to index JSON documents instead of my documents in Base64 What is the good way to make it work for deleted document ?  Thank you very much. 
1.0.1 behaves the same, and so does 1.0.0. Both freeze.
They are all there when you open the schematic but when you print, it prints everything around them but not the conduits themselves. If I turn off the schematic then all that's left are spaces. So it's replaced by space. Same thing for AE2 cables. Should they be rendering?

Yes. This was run from head with only running compile.sh and modifying examples/cpp/BUILD.   
I asked same question too, will update once the answer comes. He asked from twitter, I don't think he has a github account. 
ya i can ignore but client not accept bcz, it's not start playing...!
YEs we do same Please make sure to add Action **_without Image**_. Also we are testing on 1.2 mybe ur dev build of 1.3 already fixed this. 
I forgot to mention we are using Spring Security.  According to the stacktrace it's going through the `WebSocketServerHandshaker` - so I suppose it has something to do with the websockets. I was not able to reproduce it locally, I just see the problem from the server logs. App is is deployed on K8S cluster behind proxies...   I know this kind of problem is pretty hard to solve. I wanted to report it  and to get some hint. I will try to disable the security layer.   Eg. this similar one had to do with Chrome requests: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/242 Yet another https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/340  It would be nice to have better logging support for these exceptions. 
@machi1990 cool!  To run the TCK tests you just need to add `-Dtcks` to your Maven command.  Then just take a look at `tck-suite.xml` and see the comments on the disabled tests to see which ones you should enable once you have the fix.  Let me know if you need anything else, although it should be pretty straightforward to tackle this one (I am guessing anyway since I haven't actually looked into the code that would need changing)
I used 2.1-SNAPSHOT d76e920270 Also tried the official 2.0.1 download, all the same behaviour. So you can create an edge between two vertices in strictmode without any in_ and out_properties and don't get the "Field cannot be added" error? 
Hi,  I have copied the stack trace in the provided gist link.  Please let me know if you have any problem accessing it.  Thanks 
Those are not the same issues. This is the custom command command lines, the other issue is the auto-run on startup command name.
I will try it and write back.  But if you will ask, what I like more: `Content-Length: 0` or `Content-Type: text/plain` (Also, It seems to me that adding empty body implicitly adds `Content-Length: 0`), of course I choose first option. 
I agree, it seems it's data relative issue.  Do you mean add logging to source code?  Or you are saying about enabling logging on the rest package at log4j configuration? I can not see any logging record in the code.  Thanks 
@E3V3A Neighbour cells info works. Network Information is displayed in Device Details under SIM Information. Moreover apps like Netmonster display this info, no problem with RIL. 
Hello janakmulani,  the old parameter line was: `<j2se version="1.5+" java-vm-args="-Xmx512m -Xms128m -XX:SurvivorRatio=6 -XX:NewSize=96m -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30"/>` there every parameter was ignored.  After removing `-XX:SurvivorRatio=6` the other parameters are applied: `<j2se version="1.5+" java-vm-args="-Xmx512m -Xms128m -XX:NewSize=96m -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=30"/>`  best regards, cohe
Sorry the pack I was using didn't have the fix, So I didn't know. 
I think that makes sense.    In general, the goal is that the condition classes compile, so whatever makes that possible. This won't be directly possible when the condition method has parameter types that are private. So, when the target class is private, as in   My guess is that you can lift these to a public supertype in the condition method (keeping the correct types in the JSON). There may be conditions that cannot be expressed properly, but, regardless, I think you should be prepared to drop some conditions because they cannot be made public. 
If I tap the notification, I'm being taken to the app without any file or upload progress. So no, I'm not able to access that view.  My device model is a Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300, Android Version 5.1.1. ownCloud 1.7.1 (latest from Google Play). 
git does not work as I downloaded it from github directly  Full log here : https://paste.ee/p/qDvhD 
We can wait for the next release, of course !...it really is a very minor issue :smile_cat: 
Thanks for fast response,  I added another linear layout to center the content and solved the problem but tapping outside of the box on right and left side does not close the box now because there is an invisible container :)   Here is the problematic version before i applied temporary container addition :     </LinearLayout> 
Yup, the moment I change the talon mode to velocity, for some odd reason, it freezes lags and eats up the CPU of the driverstation through....shuffleboard.
i'm sorry about that. it's hard to catch this issue as it is not happen oftenly. will update you once i have this issue again.  
@jvalkeal: The shell is a sub-module in core, so whenever we release SCDF-core, it is implicit that we will have an equivalent shell release. I was hoping to make a simple improvement to resolve the shell version automatically and add a download link in shell/ui.   There's a lot of chatter due to incompatible shell + server combo. We could make it simpler for the users to download the right shell release. Perhaps when we will have a lot more APIs to support, we could revisit the versioning angle. Thoughts?
Get this crash when setting the key: https://pastebin.com/YP8ue8bk, but then then the key is properly set if you don't enter a world   As soon as you enter a world and open inventory this is another crash (like the one in the first post): https://pastebin.com/9p1LjWs8   This is my settings file after setting the '<' key on "Sort Chest": https://pastebin.com/dA8mzPcN
1. Using the web UI, I created a folder. I added a test1.md file inside it. 2. On the android app I clicked Sync on the folder. A Green tick appeared, test1.md was downloaded. 3. I added test2.md in the /android/media/org.nextcloud.com/.../test folder using a different phone app (Marktor) 4. I clicked sync on the Nextcloud app.  This time nothing happens; no crash, no whirring circle or pixels scrolling; no notifications; but NC does not see the new file, nor does it upload it.  Just can't figure out what 'sync' is supposed to do on the NC app beyond downloading the latest version.
I have an actual leak. :) The leak is actually `toPosHolder` that register itself to the `OnPreDrawListener`, but is never removed from (``clear()`` is never call for ``toPosHolder``, only ``fromPosHolder``). So the global layout tree `OnPreDrawListener` list keep a reference to ``toPosHolder`` indefinitely. :)

Yep :-) but if the max is set to 2, we have the same "issue" :-)  
Give the database items table structure (no timezone given), I would say it depends on server timezone and/or on PHP date.timezone config param 
It randomly ocurred when playing a beatmap on auto (testing @yugecin's slider patches). There was no crash dialog. Also, I read the LWJGL source code and it seems to use Xlib to create windows, so no Swing involved. (The errors are from xcb because Xlib is internally using xcb)
For testar only
Would you mind posting here the link to download it? I've never known exactly where to download the latest build :( when I download them I don't know where to see what build do I have  Thank you 
so i tried to add more kits than this but it keeps resting to the older version sence i added more kits than the row used  ![2017-09-12_17 41 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31812551/30351591-d38fcc04-97e1-11e7-839c-f9085cf73497.png) so i tryed to add kits to the secound row but idk how

OK you are correct it is not reproducable all the time.  Maybe you can try this, it seems to work for me most of the time: 1. go to android home screen 2. swipe kontalk away from recent apps history 3. turn your phone into landscape 4. open kontalk 5. open the first conversation in the threads list 6. go back to the threads list 7. again open the first conversation in the threads list 8. press power button to turn display off 9. unlock phone 10. if there is no message that kontalk stopped, repeat steps 6. till 9. until Kontalk crashes.  All the steps from 3 above should be made in landscape mode. On my phone I have slide to unlock set. Maybe this does influence something. So maybe you set slide to unlock when testing. 
The link to logcat.txt is still in the first post =) 
No, I have no particular reason to use Jasmin, I just followed this tutorial: https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki/Creating-a-class-from-scratch I've switched to the BafASM backend now (that's what you meant, right?), but I get the same error (see stacktrace below). I'll make a PR, as soon as I got the time. Thanks 
No vieversion or anything similiar, only 1.8.x are allowed to join. If it matters, we use bungee. We just tested 1.8.9, 1.8.8, 1.8.0, all are affected, so I assume all 1.8.x are affected.
Note that when adding a semi colon at the end of each select; tabs are correctly named.

This is on Linux with openjdk version "1.8.0_91" The launcher is version 3.2.3.1  I had a quick look at the launcher's code. It looks like you have your own code for deleting files, which looks similar to the apache commons file utils.  Would it be an option to use the original file utils for doing the job? If yes then I can do a quick test if this would fix the problem. 
@mauron85 Sorry for the late reply. I am currently using rn 29.2 and the modules version is at 0.1.1. I will try the alpha today 
This happened two times on two different PCs The first time, there was no prior installation of the client nor of the game, so programdata files just weren't there. It crashed at launch because of init.lua missing, etc, and I had to host a custom game so that it would download required files. The second time, there was an outdated FAF patch version since I hadn't played in a long time. Updated the client, tried to match Ladder against askaholic, the game crashed on launch because the patch version was different than the one I was trying to connect to. Had to create a custom games so that the client would update my FAF patch, then ladder worked.
I failed to mention: The files are images and contain the graph.png. As I've said before, a new copy is created _every_ time, graph.png is requested. Basically, just browsing the server and refreshing creates them. So, yes, I guess they are temporary files that just don't get removed.  Have you not seen those? In IntelliJ, they are shown as unversioned files, which is why I became aware of them in the first place.
I mostly think yes.. Cause before in canary it always showed that storage permission needed leak

Ahh yeah, in the web GUI it says "Global Discovery Servers" are "OK" which I assume means that the announce server is fine?  Also I do have local discovery as enabled for both (along with global discovery and UPnP) but the nodes still can't seem to see each other. I have them both configured with each other's device ID and the folder ID is the same for the one folder I'd like to sync (which is shared among them). In my firewall on the phone I can see traffic from my other device on the LAN incoming but no outgoing from the phone, and also no incoming on my other device running windows on the LAN. 
I can't tell whether it's a regression, since I'm using it for about one month. Project uses Eclipse's `.classpth`. There are several maven and gradle projects in working tree, but maven and gradle support is disabled.  Project consists of 220 jar dependencies (`<classpathentry kind="lib"` in .classpath) and 80 source entries  grepped all sources and calculated number of srcs   Most projects consist of about 10 source files, 10 projects about 100 files and one of more than thousand. 
Sorry for the late reply. Trying it now. Will let you know how it goes. Thank you
I am using Elasticsearch 1.1.0 
I'll provide you a smallish example. I can't send you the whole project ;)
@marcingrzejszczak I have updated my pom to use the latest build snapshot, still got the old failure. https://github.com/hantsy/spring-cloud-sample/blob/master/contract-producer-amqp/pom.xml#L26
I think building a minimal jar file and shipping the assets folder is good for a number of reasons.
Should be fixed by https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/commit/9dc3ecdac294595cb7c475e745672a12ac0b0768 
Ah, forgot to mention that restarting the app or even rebooting the phone didn't help.
I will pay attention to that next time it breaks. As far as I remember I can only say not all writers on the same network break down at the same time, at least not always, that much I know.
Just checked, here's the German error message:  "Der Log-Eintrag wurde scheinbar nicht gesendet. Bitte auf der betreffenden Geocaching-Webseite prüfen."  Sound like pretty generic/basic text.  But I found out something: Yes, it is not a generic problem. It seems to be related to Twitter Publish ("Diesen Eintrag auf Twitter veröffentlichen"). If I uncheck this a comment on the TB (I could not check "Discover" and "Grab" on my own TB) went through without any error back to the main page of the TB.
Thanks for the explanation 👍  This is just a side project of mine, so there is no real timeline. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to a fix!
Thanks @gsantner,  Yes @vanitasvitae, this resolved the problem; it has been a couple of days since I posted a comment. 
Hi many thanks, I removed the JSON file and it has recreated a valid file and the dependency check runs as expected
There weren't any machines or anything attached to it, nor any close enough to have done it anyway.  For inventory management however, Forestry backpacks (shift+right click on block with the backpack to dump) and Quark are present on the server, so there's that possibility. I will test with both of these later when I get the chance.
The queries vary and are against a few different tables. None of them have GROUP BY, some of them have ORDER BY, some of them have filters, none of them filter by pk.  339 entries in `sys.operations` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7115725/31396899-6db17e1e-ad99-11e7-81b0-1051d277a5a2.png)  Unfortunately, I cannot update the cluster to 2.1 quite yet.
There is a crash on first run lately, related to a config, I have not isolated what that is from.  I don't think your mod thinks it is first run, it gets my settings.   
I opened a bug here https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=519256
@ForNeVeR thank you for your answer!  No, our server doesn't use any custom flags.   Now question is why it gets **KEY_TF_AUTH_FAIL** error from plugin, but doesn't from cmd?

Stock rooted Galaxy S3 4.1.2 GT-I9300 baseband i9300xxemc2.  Logcat is gonna be a problem... I left it on for the 15s that I needed to reproduce the issue. It's 1.8Mb. I need to figure out what's spamming my logs. And maybe get you some relevant information. Won't likely be able to do that before I get back, I'll keep looking and update. In the meantime, I wonder if anyone else can logcat this.

A Haxe project is created first. Next when some characters are typed after html file creation, IDE freezes certainly. Is an error log needed? Which log file should be shown? 
Usage:    
Not sure, we might have had similar issue on other classes. It's clearly worth fixing before 3.2 in any case.
I am using slf4j 1.7.21 + logback 1.1.7. I am only using a message formatter from spf4j to do some custom message formatting.  the important things are:  when running in debug log mode: 1) jetty somewhere logs a HttpChannel object instance.  2).... lots of other logs (enough to fill the logback async logger queue 3) jetty logs a debug message in HttpChannelState:111 since queue is full this log statement blocks while holding onto the monitor of the HttpChannelState object. 4) the AsyncLogger tries to log the log message from 1) and as part of formatting the message, calls HttpChannel.toString which calls HttpChannelState.getState which will try to acquire the monitor of HttpChannelState. Unfortunately this monitor is hold onto at step 3) forever. (the AsyncLogger is stuck now and it is the only guy who concumes messages from the queue...)  hope it is a but clearer now... 
Yes. Always. 100%
What is the action bar?

I don't mind either way - I think it would be ideal if we could do it by the phones hardware but only if it doesn't over complicate the code. Otherwise I think something like fixing a max width and height would be good.
Hi Andrew, I have tested on dev-v2 and the behavior is the same. Not seeing the add and getting "com.google.android.exoplayer2.imademo I/ImaAdsLoader: AdEvent: {type=adLoadError, errorCode=1009, errorMessage=The response does not contain any valid ads.}" in the Logcat when the progress bar reaches the post roll ad. I have tested the vast tag again and it's still playing correctly in the Video Suite Inspector. Thanks
Hi @leantk,  indeed. If I do first use Git and login, clone a repo and such. Next time I do try to select the TFVC from the main screen:  ![2016-12-23 08_34_54-welcome to intellij idea](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3026551/21543548/c81b829e-cdc7-11e6-9fa4-86f23628b16e.png)  Then the app gets stuck, I do NOT get to even see any other window.  The same goes vice versa in case I use the TFVC then try git.

Both iOS and Android. The iOS client is built with Tabris 1.4, the Android one is older (don't know the exact version).

Hello, thanks for your reply.  According to the answers I see on this [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23149417/proguard-project-txt-not-found-in-android-studio) question, It seems that because I imported this old Eclipse project into Android Studio, proguard-rules.txt did not actually exist in my project directory. Instead I now replaced it with a default-made proguard-rules.pro file.  I also made an example app doing the same steps over again (with the default-generated proguard-rules.pro), and fortunately I got it to work this time. Seems like the issue is resolved. 
I see this on a Pixel XL running the latest Android O beta. The popup shows up after clicking on the "open" snackbar action - instead of the "do you want to install this?" screen.  This is how it looks like when I try to download an APK from APKMirror: https://youtu.be/CVlrd4okAxI
It is indeed possible. I can't really know because I got this old phone from someone else.
Thanks for your answers.  I've tried to build 1.6.1 from sources without success. Problems with my competence on ANT. But I've remarked that from 1.6 to Head, sole maven plugin and doc have changed not the jflex.jar lib.  As a result, I give you all the materials I can.  Here is a simple test snippet. The input tested is a valid Ada program from ACATS :   
Yeah can confirm it appears every time I delete and re-add.. for both rgbw and white widgets too. Strange that it displayed properly on the GPE ROM 
Why I propose to have 2 types of comments, annotated and not annotated?  Because I want to have comments that both look nice in the .k source code and produce nice latex, whenever possible. If I want to use a latex special character in comments, I don't want to escape it like \%, it don't look nice anymore. I don't want to see in k comments statements like "Performace increased by 5\%." Moreover it is easy to forget to annotate such characters. Now if latex backend would know to annotate such characters automatically, then we would have the same text in latex as in comments.  However, this approach is not applicable in all cases. Sometimes we want to add specific latex formatting in our comments, like \begin{itemize} \item \end{itemize}. In this cases we need a different latex comment marker, to instruct latex not to annotate special characters.  Why I spent one hour? Well just try the example I wrote on the beginning of the topic. Looks like latex backend put % on the same line with the code generated for endmodule, and broken the latex document. 
Hello David. Thanks for your response and sorry for screenshots. Indexed_chars is set up as 100%, because we need full content of any document. I'm not sure, how I can reproduce it, because as I understand, crawler sends bulks to elastic, not every document. Do you think, that if document is bigger 100Mb, there is no way to avoid this exception?

It would be to me that the generated document is bigger than 100mb JSON which looks like insane to me. indexed_chars only extracts 100 000 characters by default so I'm super surprised this is happening. >  > Any chance you can reproduce it with a single document? >  > What is the full fscrawler settings file looking like? >  > — > You are receiving this because you were mentioned. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread. >  
No exceptions or anything. Interestingly it works fine for some sketches but not for others. I've uploaded the sketch in question here: http://www.astroeq.co.uk/FileDump/BLDCMotor.zip 
Hey I'm really sorry I completely forgot about this. Here a video of the bug. https://nextcloud.abifog.com/index.php/s/xokGzy6x4w4RB4F  BTW, I think this can be fixed by explicitly disabling split screen support for GOYP like the uber app. When its launched in split screen, it overrules all other apps and maximizes. Something similar should happen when GOYP is triggered by launching a selected app in split screen. 
Waiting a bit longer might actually have helped. Or it might have been a result of otherwise disabled wlan0 coming back online at roughly the same time (but not in Kura). Also switching `Pass DNS Servers through DHCP` on and off doesn't have the same effect as on wlan0 interface. With wlan0 named is started/stopped as a result of the switch.

I shorted the multiblock down to just a generator and a generator controller and had the same results.  SSP Image: http://i.imgur.com/5tS3boh.png  After some time troubleshooting; this ends up being a crossmod interaction with.. Botania?

@overheadhunter, I just update it and it works! Thank you very much and thanks for all contributors! Cryptomator is awesome! 
I think we just differ in opinion about how desirable mass prompt is. I would prefer to be notified/prompted quite a bit when first running apps, so that I can get a feel for what they are doing in real time, rather than trying to anticipate every app's needs ahead of time. Sounds like that isn't an intended use pattern for Xprivacy, though.  I am curious as to why Prompt is considered an exception setup here. Sounds like there is something I am missing. In many desktop security apps, there are settings for how much you want automated and how much you want to deal with via realtime prompts. I usually set them to lots of prompts. Is there a reason that is undesirable in Android, other than the aggravation of getting a zillion prompts the first time you trigger a new event?  
How can I get and use fixed version? 
If "X-Header" has multiple values removeHeader("X-Header") will remove all "X-Header" values. I want to remove a specific header/value. For example if we have:  X-Header: value1 X-Header: value2  Say that I want to remove only "X-Header: value2". This isn't possible today?
I know its completely identical and thats the reason Im confused too. I replace it woth the new that looks completely the same but the new one is fine.   The ModPE.showTipMessage doesnt show up when its called. Is it becaise of the color codes? If yes then Ill retry if its really the colors since Im using § instead of the CHAT... code 
@anthonydahanne : I updated to make it clearer, it does not depend on passives sorry ;-)
It was that thank you a lot!
Hi @janpio! I appreciate your responsiveness!  I have yet to actually experiment with using alternative JDK implementations for Cordova Android development. I thought I would ask here first to see if there was already official guidance because I thought that this topic may have already been discussed given its legal/financial implications. :-)  I'm not certain if a version of OpenJDK would work for Cordova Android or if there's an implicit dependency on the Oracle implementation. If an OpenJDK version will work, what distribution will work the best? I wonder if we could somehow use the OpenJDK that comes with Android Studio (if it's JDK 8) or if it would need to be installed separately or require a different distribution (perhaps desirable for decoupling Android Studio from being a Cordova Android requirement).  I may not get much time to investigate this for the next couple of months given higher priorities. However, if anyone else who comes across this thread has insight to share, please don't be afraid to comment!
I disabled the setting, and now the client behaves as expected, but what is "custom window chrome?"
I discussed it with Ben Jones in the group, he thinks it is the way this device initializes.  He plans on looking into it more when he gets back. 
Must have happened when I extracted the interface via IntelliJ. I removed the annotation from the interface which resulted in the passing test you described while keeping the async behavior in production. I tested the same for spying instead of mocking and the conclusion was the same. I could kick myself for that one. Sorry for wasting your time and thank you for the quick response! 
Right, so let's say you do an xpath and it returns nothing, I should be able to do:   but doing either results in nothing being displayed at all worse is if I'm relying on `node.empty?` to check if there are no results. but it won't work becuase `node.empty?` seems to return nothing just as much as doing `puts node`.   p.s. I just noticed that the `puts node` isn't printing out `[]`, rather it's the `puts node.inspect`, my mistake, but `puts node` should at least display a blank line (or nil) or something so you can check if the results object is empty.

Nothing. The next prompt shows up, that's all. Additionally, nothing shows up in Event Viewer. It's as if the program is starting and then closing normally before displaying anything.  Also, the java edition opens and appears to work, but when I load a custom seed, it just sits at a black screen for a good five minutes before closing.

Happens for me both with Ascending and Descending order on Artists. Does not happen for me with Ascending or Descending order on Albums or Songs.   On artists the sort order is consistently wrong in the same way - for instance "The Chemical Brothers" always shows up after "Aerosmith" and "No Doubt" shows up after "The Chemical Brothers", even if I sort Descending and go back to Ascending.  Thinking about reinstalling the app, because songs within an album are playing shuffled and I can't seem to find a way to turn that off.

I downloaded the App via F-Droid.
@k88hudson So far, I think we've just been increasing the z-index as each element is added and remember that order. We have some spec for changing the z-index, which I'll try to find right now. 
I'm using dbeaver 3.6.7 and postgresql 9.5.  I'll give you an example on how to reproduce my exact problem. 1. connect to a pg database 2. open new editor, this should by default have search_path=public, since no schema is selected as active. 3. run the following sql:   1. close the editor 2. refresh the database (so that the new schema can be seen) 3. set the mytest schema as active 4. open a new editor 5. perform the following queries:    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6532949/15281046/d62599e4-1b37-11e6-8a3a-863f6b8a7415.png)  as you can see the search_path is set to public only although I've created a new sql editor when a schema was set to active. 
jetty-client: 9.4.2.v20170220.  Bug was introduced in 9.4 RC3 by changing SslConnection.toConnectionString() Seems that debug log is not enabled in unit test.  Tested simple GET request to https://www.google.com (with keystore).
I was testing a few mods until I discovered it was the mod called "BetterSprinting++MC-1.7.10++v1.1.3.jar" causing the bug; which is kind of weird, considering this mod is to speed the creative flight up to 8 times more

Images at http://imgur.com/a/hJDbm The problem occurs if the mouse goes over the red diamond. That widget does not have a text filled in so toString tries to use a null pointer. One image is before I fill things in, 2nd image is after adding materials.  The machine processes one cycle and then stops.  25mb of water is used and 25mb of liquid growth medium is produced and piped out.   (I guess that's a bug too since it has a valid recipe but isn't processing it).  [crash-2017-08-23_10.21.48-client.txt](https://github.com/ForestryMC/Binnie/files/1247945/crash-2017-08-23_10.21.48-client.txt)  Edit:  Figured out some more info.  It wasn't just one cycle -- the machine ran until water got down to 475mb and then it stopped.  I want to let the water run dry and reuse the same machine to process a different recipe, and it refuses to continue until I give it more water.  So IMO it is indeed two bugs but I'll leave just this one report for now.  :)
OK, I tried that, including timings for the GC. It holds a lot longer, but still dies in the end:    However, that’s when the thread died, I don’t know why. 
This is what the user sees in 7.3. I'm sure we can do better in the time remaining.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25067106/54539614-d88e2280-496c-11e9-9ea0-e89ba6fe6aff.png)

Looks like it part of the problem. MyHandlerCache seems to be binding correctly at startup, and deadboltHandler is there. But when it encounters @SubjectPresent in the controller, deadboltHandler is now null.   
No matter this is a bug or not, it is definitely an incompatible change, because the above example works with Bazel built before 9c5b310
Thanks @Cliffus , its not super urgent, just using this ExpandableTextView on a project I am working on. I'm pretty sure it has to do with m layout as it is a bit complex.   I've attached my jobcard layout file to this comment, as well the main layout that my activity uses. This activity combines the jobcard layout used by the custom adapter and the main layout. Please let me know if there is more I can provide to help you help me :)  [activity_main.txt](https://github.com/Blogcat/Android-ExpandableTextView/files/382821/activity_main.txt) [jobcard.txt](https://github.com/Blogcat/Android-ExpandableTextView/files/382822/jobcard.txt) 
There are three different behaviours I'd find more intuitive:  * The relative sizes to each other are kept to display the same information what was shown in screen 1 on screen 2.   * Adding to the first one, one could introduce a minimal width each column should have and if not everything fits into the available width, introduce horizontal scrolling.  * Save a default layout for each screen. When the user changes column width or shown columns update the default layout to a user specific. When dragging the window arround use the most recent layout.   Those are some possibilities I could imagine...  
Now it works. Thanks. 
It was a plain text file, specifically my contacts as exported by Android.  I think its called "Contacts.vcf"
These are my variables:   This is all. I suspect it is a bug (I've read about <a href="https://github.com/evernote/android-state/issues/18">this other issue</a>, maybe related), or maybe Dugger2 is doing something (it is terrible to debug when there is dugger)...
Hi, It doesn't work as this time I recieved following message   call:convertxm 2g JVM_XMX The system cannot find the batch label specified - convertxm  Thanks 
I wouldn't mind it. I'm thinking about getting rid of the fossils mod because I already have JurrasiCraft, which works just fine with Jewelrycraft just fine. I can also message them to see if they can make it more compatible with your mod too. 
Yes, that's how I did it. When I place the controller, it lags, doesn't show up, and crashes.

After getting your response I continued to test and found it was only one group of chickens that had this nature, I created another group of chickens and it worked fine. I went back and it refused to breed that group of chickens. The hearts would go above the head but not split. When I killed that group, only one set of items dropped from it. I have yet to reproduce the bug.   If I can find a way to reproduce it, I will let you know, but as of now, it may have just been a server hiccup.   Thank you for all the hard work.

Thansk for clarifying! 👍 
Thanks! No, I did not—it works once I follow the instructions. There's no link to this page on the SUSE tab of the download pages; we should add it, like we have for the other Linux environments.

@arvindsv I noticed that with the plug-in but I didn't raise it was because it was working with 18.7. So, I presumed something about how the server handles it has changed.   Now, if you look at my report, you will see that the form params on both versions are same. However as it enters the rails layer, the input payload has got restructured a bit. If you can help me with how the request gets processed until the rails controller part, it would help me debug this further too.   I can revert to an older plug-in version as a workaround before either fixing here or in the plug-in.   Let me know.
Sorry, it seems to be my fault. I made new pairing with my miband and the sync started to work after that. Curios that the alarm was working without that.  Update: The problem is that you cannot use both apps (Gadgetbridge and Mi Fit). The tracking data get lost after using Mi Fit so Gadgetbridge can't update it.

Well, maven is fine, but I'd like a jar without the dependencies packaged. The one that would come out of maven if you removed the shade plugin. I think the best option would be to create one jar for inclusion into other projects, with a pom that specifies the dependencies, and, in addition, a standalone jar that can be used directly from the command line. I guess, both of them could be uploaded to maven central with different artifact types. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to get this to work with maven as I have abandoned it in favor of gradle some time ago.

Well I dont know much about the key modifiers used in Windows/Ubuntu, but the whole seemed quite consistent for me on Mac. Now, I barely use the arrow keys.   Of course we need to rationalize them (so that the same modifiers have the same effect on both mouse and arrows).  No problem for me (if it is documented) to remove the menu for switching between rotate/translate with the mouse.  The ROI is quite ugly at the moment, but potentially VERY useful. I will probably open a whole new issue (or we stay on this one). It works like in the movie below. I think this possibility to have a way to draw an area (in 2D or maybe 3D ?), to measure its size, and to select a whole set of agents is really interesting.   Now, its limitations are mainly that it only works in 2D. Having the same in 3D would be awesome (but clearly too much work, not on the OpenGL side, but on the logic side of the display of agents: we dont record in OpenGL where each agent is drawn and so the ROI bases its calculation on the shape of the agents, which is not always true).  ![screencast 2016-04-02 12-58-15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/579256/14224808/92fa1acc-f8d3-11e5-99a4-340889e74b1f.gif)

Hi Tom,  I created a Wireshark capture.  You can see that the request is coming from my android phone (192.168.0.69). My laptop (192.168.0.91), where WireMock is running receives the request and send back a 500 Server Error to the phone.  I'm pretty sure that the failure is caused by the     java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = 1... WireMock returns 500 because of this, and doesn't even get to try to call the proxyied api.  [gzip_failure.zip](https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock/files/1945965/gzip_failure.zip) 
It does, sadly. Recalculating didn't do anything.

Yellorium Piece/Chunk: Thank you both for your responses and concern. Much appreciated.  @SirLyle - Yes, the modpack is FTB Revelation ported into MultiMC with modifications and updates. When ER and Forge updated a warning upon game load of "ex nihilo yellorium piece/chunk removed" appeared. I send the bees to TE nullifier mid-game, but it is such a waste of catalyst (more than 50%) when much labor goes in to hammering for gravel, sand and dust in early game.  @ZeroNoRyouki - Yes, ingot and dust does appear plus all other "normal" ER items and blocks. Forge 14.23.4.2759 and ER 1.12.2-0.4.5.49 work fine with Ex Nihilo. Does the new version of ER fix the redstone port input issues? (ex: reactor on when it shouldn't be)  I replicated the issue with a new MultiMC 1.12.2 instance with only the following mods:    Forge: 14.23.5.2808    Extreme Reactors: 1.12.2-0.4.5.65    ZeroCore: 1.12.2-0.1.2.8    Ex Nihilo Creatio: 1.12.2-0.4 The game displayed gold and iron piece/chunk... no yellorium Added IC2: uranium piece/chunk activated Added TF: aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, tin and platinum activated Still, no yellorium piece/chunks.
All the bugs are fixed except for a case resulting from scenario 4:  > connect a True and an (==) to an (||) as inputs, then connect the True to the (==) as input   Viskell currently crashes (probably endless recursion, judging from the stack overflow) in an attempt to check this program in which a connection is made higher up in an expression tree (after which it is no longer a tree but a DAG). Note that this doesn't hold in general: for example, (type) manipulating a list and then zipping it with the original list works fine. 
Yes I did. non results.  I cant understand why not?. because fragments get destroyed and recreated each time. 
Thanks for fix, I've tested it and works as expected.

I forgot to mention that we use Telegraf to pull the HTTP JSON metrics and write it to cloudwatch.  In our case telegraf not able to convert the measurements , which is the bug confirmed by telegraf. So here is what recommened by telegraf team as a quick workaround. So looking for some guidance on what needs to be implemented on server to adjust the values to 0  before they enter in telegraf?  Recommendations from Telegraf: "Update the server that your httpjson input uses as its source to adjust the values before they enter telegraf. We will try to get a fix done for this before the next release"  [[inputs.httpjson]] servers = [ "http://localhost:2960/metrics" ] 
They changed places.  if:  then: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25145468/44717608-22ddae00-aac6-11e8-92fd-8f987b4e86a3.png)

No, the crash reporter I'm using sadly doesn't attach the logcat. 
@SaezChristopher it was intentional because it's part of the merging process made by jcenter, I've sent them an email to see how to fix it and/or how long it takes, last case, I'll deploy it again as soon as I get an answer.  this was done because when people were searching for `io.sentry` on jcenter, they were finding 2 `sentry-android` artifacts and the newest one (2.0.0) was at the 2nd page, and most people don't even go next page, we decided to merge it so one could see all versions in one package from 1.x to 2.0.0.
its working now. Thanks!

cose i'm working on a 1.4.2. version and got submits already there. Thought it would be easier for one of you to just do the quick edits who are keeping up to date with the branch. 
It turns out: This is a UI/display glitch that occurs if a recipe is present on the server but not the client. So they have to be in sync.  It would make sense, I think, to add a recipe for the Repair recipe. (It's "enchantment.repair", not enchantment.thaumcraft.anything, not sure why.) And, implicitly, to allow for recipes being conditional on a mod's presence. 
Both commands work. Resetspawns won't do anything if you don't define the arena obviously and also if you haven't disabled the arena, but I imagine that's how it's meant to be. 
lol, I should have said the previous version. I'll try this new version and let you know my results.
I can't really post the build.gradle files, since it's a pretty big project with many subprojects, etc. I ran gradle dependencies from the project that is failing. The output is pretty big, is there a way of attaching a file to the ticket? 
I tried with the native JS lib without readonly and as you said, it is a bug in the native library.  I am going to try to create a workaround in the GWT library for this... As I am not a Javascript guy.

I did manage to fix this, and I'm pretty sure it's going to be difficult to reproduce.  But here's some more info.  The rule looked like this:  ` rule "Test" when     Switch_Family_Room changed then     logInfo(SWFR, "This is a rule") end `  However, the error was originally firing when any of my pre-existing rules fired.  I had everything working, but was adding some new items to the system and ended up needing to restart and that's when the issues began.  I originally had the "script interpreter can not be obtained" errors for them, so I upgraded my OH install and was greeted with this error.  In order to fix it, I ended up first moving all of my rule files.  When that didn't work, I restarted again with them removed, and that's what got things going.  I've since added them back, one at a time, and they all seem to be working.  It's almost like some bad data got stuck in the rule pipeline.  I know that's not very helpful for hunting down the bug...and feel free to close it now that it's working again. 
I tried to reproduce the Exception, but I couldn't anymore.  In the meanwhile I had updated to 2.5.0 M4.  For the iButtons it is an expected behavior that they are not connected. Therefor it is not en error if they aren't connected. Nevertheless OFFLINE is correct.  The state still is not available in my items. It is always NULL. The thing itself is ONLINE.  Here are my current definitions and the TRACE-log:

Kind of tight for time, though I do appreciate the scaffolding for unit testing that you provided.  I do think though that my description of the problem is complete enough such that you should be able to take one of your unit tests and reproduce this. 
The code below runs on my machine in 0.65 and 1.60 second segments, but switching back to the first graph from the second took approximately 20 seconds (counting in my head), and took approx. 75 seconds going from the first back to the second.     MacBook Pro (15", Mid 2018) 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7 16 GM RAM 
I download demo application and modified the samaxesjs.core.js, add a test function only return chinese string. Run mvn process-resources will throw error. You can download from [here ](http://winix.name/minify-maven-plugin-demo-1.4.zip) 
We should use a standard escape character and make it consistent across DG modelling syntax whenever we use a delim character within the model. For example a "\" set="%ssn,%number(3\,2)" 
I will send it in a few hours :)
You are right. I might have moved the map around, or zoomed out and in before I had 500 caches. Still I can pretty good reproduce (as on my home location there is only one unfound cache) that caches disappear from view.  Maybe you could try with any location by: - Open live map - Set strategy "Fast" - Zoom out or move until 500 caches are "buffered" - Slightly zoom west/east (in my case this works best) to see whether caches go missing

Hm, from what I see you are using a very old version of jaxb and when I see it correctly, since several versions it is already included in java8  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/JAXB.html  And also have a look here,https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.11/docs/release-documentation.html#a-2-2-11  There seems to be a sample somewhere which inlcudes some namespace stuff  Look also here, this is a newer gradle plugin  https://github.com/ewerk/gradle-plugins/tree/master/jaxb2-plugin 
Yes, i could.
Sure. I'm using Windows 8.1 and the latest version of Java, 1.8.0_25

Ah, then I guess I should probably take care of this one...I don't think there's an easy way to make or edit .plist files on Windows. 
Actually application is 10 lines long. However our core library which includes operating system API produces much of the code because of a task container created for each application before running it. API is huge 100s of classes. System requires a single application file, so we embed TeaVM runtime also to the code.  Here is a figure for 10 lines of application ( not 3, almost 4 times larger) GWT -> 220K TeaVM -> 850K (without minify 2.3M)  I have a teapot demo for GWT which is a pretty good size application, GWT produces 330K for it (this includes images in the code, around 20K). I haven't compiled it with TeaVM yet. One thing may be the string concatenation that produces quite a lot of code.   Unfortunately, library is huge, and I cant release it to public at the moment. Lets get the bugs settled and make things running on our end first. I will work with you on the reasons of the huge file size. You may also supply a maven configuration property for also compressing the output. The generated files would be myapp.js and myapp.js.gz. That would help a lot. 
That is what I'm doing, I've a bioDialog method which has the following in it:    I know it would deviate away from the bioPrompt api, but maybe a way to make a call to dismiss the dialog would help. From reading it may be that when the activity pauses I've got the activity finishing and I've read that the error can happen if your calling finish with a dialog still open.
No problem for me. I think also the future and strength of MAGE is the PvP , not the AI. 
@jandresakis   No, SimpleCache stays the same.   But you will need to clone DownloadManager with changes that will 1) create a new SimpleCache folder for every download 2) delete cache folder (related to the specific download) from disk when necessary. And you will have to clone DownloadService to make it work with cloned DownloadManager.
Actually the boards are old Freeduinos (Diecimila ATmega328) , using a FTDI chip. 1 year ago, when I started with Arduinos from the scratch, I had to install the FTDI drivers, and then it worked (IDE 0.9 and/or 1.05,  Diecimila Board,  Win XP32.).  But then I started to use Megas und Dues and the Freeduinos  were sort of forgotten.  Now I reactivated them in order to make a UART-to-I2c converter, but it didn't work no more. IDE 1.6.3, still Win XP32. I even installed a new FTDI driver manually from http://www.arexx.com/downloads/CDMv2.10.00__PID_FIX.zip - but no changes.  When I target Diecimila, I get the error as shown above, when I target Unos, then it says the avrdude is out of sync.  So what should I do?  How can I try this -F thing ? 
@shakuzen I'm not entirely clear what the case was before 3.9 but the best reference I could find is that they changed the code off of this pull request and comment explicitly describes a change from nanos to millis being reported https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/10930#issuecomment-315681738. They haven't documented it as a breaking change as far as I can tell even though IMO it looks like it should merit it.
@Tajnymag im actually reading through them right now.  First day commenting, still learning the flow. And i currelty have 1.5.4 version , but still same problem

Hi! Thanks for the reply. Looking at the javadoc it says: `If this pathname denotes a directory, then the directory must be empty in order to be deleted.` I guess this is the problem, being the directory full with decompiled sources. Thanks Luca

Exception is caught in lldb, but fails in gdb. I will try it on linux.
after further testing, it does seem to only work reliably with the "Quantum Flux" Item Magnet.  version of the mod is 24.1.4 pre, using 1.0.1 api.  version of quantum flux being used is 1.9.4-2.0.7

I've tested it using Derby 10.12.1.1 in embedded mode using a fresh install of DBeaver 3.6.1.

I uploaded a video, because it's very hard to explain... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnfx81ODbQk PD: I noticed i'm using GregTech certus quartz because the mod replaces it. Still i don't think that's the problem. 
@jbolinger It's generally not sample code (which is properly code-formatted by indentation). Rather, it's generally proto comments documenting services, messages, and fields, that are translated into Ruby comments. For example:  Source proto: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/datastore/v1/entity.proto#L42  Generated Ruby: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/google-cloud-datastore/lib/google/cloud/datastore/v1/doc/google/datastore/v1/entity.rb#L29 
It is solved for me now! I was taking a picture and noticed I was using a water OUTPUT hatch instead of a input one. However the machine can builds anyway so I did not notice before! 
Yeah, it has been fixed a while ago.
@laszlocsomor I didn't have this issue. I could set a `complete` default by omitting the last argument. Maybe it's different on your system?
Excellent! All these exceptions are gone after retesting the scenarios with a local build containing the latest master. :smile: :1st_place_medal:

Hmm, unfortunately I do not know of any libraries that facilitate this, but I'm sure there are some.

I see. Unfortunately the Xbase documentation seems rather vague.w.r.t., type inference. 
This came up from using a weird (non-Java-standard) serialization mechanism. Instead it traverses the object graph, so a customer with an order history will pull along basically the entire catalog. However, the issue I ran into was something different…session activation was busted IIRC due to Hibernate’s lazy-loaded collections having trouble finding the SessionFactory after weird deserialization. It may have been something else, this was a while ago. I filed the whole thing under Doing Weird Stuff Breaks Things and didn’t notice this sub-issue until recently.  The anonymous customer is only stored in the session if it has a NullOrderImpl cart, so that customer is small. It also doesn’t have any Hibernate classes in the object graph to interfere with weird serialization or weird deserialization.  > On May 27, 2015, at 1:24 PM, Phillip Verheyden notifications@github.com wrote: >  > I pushed up a fix for this but now I'm a little confused.

Sure, I should be able to do this tomorrow  
No,they are different. When i remove an item from a RecyclerView the method of convert called then the gifDrawable set to gifImageView again and GIF stopped.when i  postDelayed set  gifDrawable set to gifImageView it works

@tobiasdiez : This time was with an different ID, and with a third one, too. 
recreate is a method from Android Framework  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#recreate%28%29
This was 9.6.0. 
I am not sure there is a bug here at all, we are just a bit stuck on why we can't hear the user.  We don't have an Android Q device handy ATM to test with.  The audio is definitely making it out of the user's device as we get it in the recording on the Web/JS side.  The bandwidth on the audio stream is good and the level is not 0.  We do client side recording there by grabbing the streams and merging them using: https://github.com/t-mullen/video-stream-merger  It is possible that the recorder is interfering with playing the audio, but we don't see this show up other times (many, many calls).  I could certainly share our code, but I am not sure it is relevant here.  These were the rooms: RM309040c6fa19193b61e671d2f8b11966 RMdf681fe71dd64dbb6c202b4dba0e3a68  Since this happens on a user device we don't have logs.  If you add the ability for a custom logger we could provide lower level Twilio logs (I mentioned this in an iOS github issue as well).
Yes, sure, forgot that one  
@chkal with the last snapshot it works, thanks for the fast help
Same result with 1.1.6.RELEASE and 1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT . 
Thanks for your e-mail, Michel.  Unfortunately none of these changed something.  The server base URL is already set and the user authentication was set to Default, which means False. Setting it to true I got indeed an access error   
The distributed Jetty server doesn't change the default value of the above setting. Despite the Javadoc documentation , it's default value is `true`.  HttpConfiguration.java ``  @param delay if true, delay the application dispatch until content is available (default false) ``  Changing it to false seems to fix the issue: 1. the ``doPost`` servlet is now called immediately after all headers are received; 2. the ``onError`` event is raised on idle timeout; 3. the server answer with 500 Server error.  The fix seems to work also in the original web application that uses CometD: the ``AsyncJSONTransport::AbstractReader#onError`` method is called on idle timeout.  Can you confirm that it is fine to set the setDelayDispatchUntilContent setting to false on a CometD application? The server handles both long-poll and websocket client connections.  
> @sleshchenko please don't make me play "spot the difference". What is incorrect about the highlighting? Also, is this not about formatting?  It's not about formatting bit about highlighting. I added a bit text description into PR description  > Note env field is highlighted in the same way as referenceContent value, but in fact, it's not a part of referenceContent value but a root field of component object. On the right hand side - you can see the right highlighting.  It works incorrectly also on github and atom in some cases(when referenceContent is a first field), but for Che this problem is even more "critical" since Dashboard (or maybe Che Server) sorts fields in way that highlighting is kind of always is broken.  > Also, this the "old" editor, right? Not the new one based on monaco?  Sorry, I really don't know. It's a editor that is used in master branch by Dashboard. @tsmaeder Could you share more about new based on monaco editor? Is there somewhere PR in dashboard that changes editor?
Yes, it was another plugin. Thank you. Could you also look at [this](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/bentobox/issues/297) issue? Its really annoying and problematic, when players are not fully added to island :/
I can create a new account on our test instance but you may have a faster dev experience if you create a data shape with a large number of fields. 
Thankyou for your response  No the app doesnot crash, yet I am facing a problem where the rtsp link works on my home network but always fails when multiple clients are connected in the same network i.e the live stream shows up on the player when in home (my device connected alone) and the stream doesnot show in the university.

The more popular, more recent 2013 Nexus 7 had one, but the OG 2012 Nexus 7 did not: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_(2012)#Critical  It's fairly rare for devices not to have a rear camera.  These days it seems more common to omit the front  camera instead when OEMs are looking to cut costs.

Thanks for looking into this. We cannot easily update from owlapi-3.4.8 , because we use some classes/interfaces that changed in newer versions. 
Oh, I am so sorry, my mistake. The problem was found in py2neo. The neo4j is a helpful and powerful product, thank you for your reply.

Yes, that what i mean. I have not tested with a button yet to see in the button works (will do tonight) but what i'm seeing right now is this:  When i flip over to a certain page i'm seeing my image and below it my progressbar (which is not moving). So this is the snapshot being taken on demand after my image finished loading (the progressbar is not hidden afterwards). I release the page and the page stays the same. When i move this page again the screenshot during the animation is still this same page with the stationary progressbar (spinner).  so whether i'm moving the page and watch the animation or after i release it. In both cases i see the exact same page with the progressbar at the same position. So my conclusion is that i'm looking at the same screenshot in the animation and when i'm not in the animation. And i would expect that after the animation, the actual page must be visible in which case the progressbar should be spinning 
Unfortunately, I did not notice a certain pattern. I got a new phone about 2 weeks ago. During this time, this appeared 4 times. This happened both when using the "nextcloud" application itself, and while using other applications. Once this error report arose simply when I looked at the screen without launching any applications. In the phone settings, the application is allowed to work in the background.
What is not clear? I did not understand! 
From the top menu, click "Configuration" --> "Pipelines". Also, please make sure that "Configuration" --> "Pipelines 2" doesn't allow the special characters either.  Please refer to the [User Guide](https://openmpf.github.io/docs/site/User-Guide/index.html#create-custom-pipelines) to learn how to use the "Pipelines" page. The "Pipelines 2" page is experimental, so there's no guide. I can provide further assistance with that if you need it.  Also, I realized that the following part of the User Guide is incorrect:  > Selecting "Create Custom Pipelines" from the Workflow Manager menu brings up the Pipeline Creation View  I will fix it.  Start by looking at `PipelineController.addPipeline()`.

Hey @taban03 - it's been a little while since I tried, but I think that's exactly what happened.
Doesn't quite work for me on Unix. Problem is that putting quotes around the command breaks command substitution:    Didn't test it on Windows.  Or do you recommend trampolining using something else? 
@costin Thanks for responding. This is an issue regarding the actual number of indexed documents in a fresh index in ES (0 documents, created just before the indexing job begins) being different than the number of documents that were given to ES (by spark) to create/index. So spark gives ES 929,660 json documents to index, however sometimes only 924,000 (roughly) are indexed. I have seen the actual number of documents in ES fluctuate between missing up to 5000 or missing as few as 3. On other instances it has had too many documents, up to almost double--still with a fresh index and the same number of documents input. There is no decipherable pattern and the same documents are used for every run. My last run: ES reports 1,409,124 documents, but spark submitted only 929,660 for indexing. The index contained 0 documents to start, nothing else is writing to it, it contains 1 shard and 0 replicas. The number of shards and replicas does seem to matter--the trend is with a higher number of shards, a lower number of replicas and a lower number of total documents attempting to be indexed, we will see the exactly correct number of documents under those conditions, but that is very difficult for me to verify and extrapolate those results in any significant way. I have also tried using both the new native RDD format for spark in the beta release, as well as the old output format based format inside of spark in both the beta and the 2.0.1 releases.  Although I don't think it is related to #268, as a side question, how can I see those metrics when using spark? From the documentation, it looked as if the metrics used the hadoop counter infrastructure, which to my knowledge would be independent of the spark job. Is it possible to see these when using the spark API?  ES version: 1.3.0 (9 data nodes, 3 masters, 1 load balancer) Spark version: 1.0.0 (1 master, 9 workers) Java version: 1.8.0_11  Spark and ES are running on the same nodes (spark on a subset or the ES nodes). Working on posting some logs.  Thanks again for your help and response.

It seems annotations (or possibly all FindBy operations given the changes in selenium) break. When testing android, elements populated using `@AndroidFindBy` stay null, and when testing iOS elements populated using `@iOSFindBy` cause `org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException`  Unfortunately I am not in a position to investigate further, nor confirm whether it is just presenting itself with gradle or not.

Sure! I started with a note with this content:    I think this may also have to do with timing. I waited a couple seconds, switched to Preview, and immediately saw the preview with that new content. But when I closed and reopened the note it didn't include the added content.  However, if I added the content and then immediately switched to Preview, I had to wait a moment for the preview to update with that new content. It looks like in that case the change is saved when I close and reopen the note.

RootPanel.get().add(new Navbar()); RootPanel.get().add(new Label("hello"));  This works; that is, the label "hello" is shown under the Navbar.  RootLayoutPanel.get().add(new Navbar()); RootLayoutPanel.get().add(new Label("hello"));  Navbar is rendered correctly, but the Label "hello" is rendered directly on the navbar itself instead of under it. Also, no buttons on the navbar can be clicked.

Well, this can be seen as a small subset of #66, but this one is easy to fix. Something like if(class_name.startsWith("android.support.v") ) deobfuscate=false;

We are currently slurping in the whole native (= androids) media database and will scan any 'volume' reported by Android on a full scan.  Making the scanned paths a config option is definitely on the todo list: see good-old #22 
Hi @monkey2000, I ended up downloading the dumps directly from dumps.wikimedia.org. I think we should provide this as an alternative (at least in instructions).   Regarding the reproducing and testing, yes, I will but it will have to be in a later day - sorry I am on a deadline so will do this probably towards the end of this month. I will check back with you at that time. Sorry about that.  
@Nadahar scanning is only possible when cache is enabled.  Yeah my suspicion is like you said, that we are keeping references to objects that are no longer needed.  I haven't seen an error yet because the memory use keeps going until it freezes  I've been going backwards in time to see when it appeared and I've found a version that doesn't have the memory creep, 4.4.0. I'll keep narrowing down when it first appeared and may be able to find a fix that way instead of profiling.
That seems fine to me! I can't think of another case that would include a comma currently.
This is in a git repo - this is from a single pom.xml at the module root.  I'm trying to follow this guide: https://www.alooma.com/blog/building-dockers  Apparently they reference both plugins in the same pom.xml, but I can't seem to get the latter plugin to resolve the ${git.commit.id.abbrev} properly.  I can see the git.properties created and it has the correct values.  It's just Maven itself doesn't seem to know what to do with that particular variable.  Thanks for the edit/tip on the md style, was trying to figure that out... 
Testing the v1.1 branch, I got around 5 clean runs and then a failure (using _ant test_)    I'll try to figure out what's going in the next couple of days. 
I was actually able to install the update by:  1. Removing the buildship update site from the preferences. 1. Going to the Eclipse Marketplace page for buildship. 1. Selecting "update" on the button.  The update site has also reappeared in the list but now I don't get any errors (presumably because I now have the update).
Nope, that's a different issue. This registration must be perfomed in the SM Metrics extension.

thanks for reply. here are the gifs I used: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ghBZcVHgnKd2YxQ0lKZHNHd00/view?usp=sharing  I find it hard to reproduce the issue in a small sample app. I guess glide use too much cpu or memory which cause resource intense. I try to use android-gif-library which do not cause such issue. All I focus now is how to effectively release the memory and cpu when those gifs go off the screen. Maybe that would do some help. 
> What happens if you pressing Ctrl and pointing the cursor to Testee and someMethod, are both become clickable?  Yes, that works as expected.

Well, my guess would be that it makes the underlying assumption for the parametric checking (no changes in graph structure due to parameter changes, the result of inserting the parameter values result in a DTMC, i.e., outgoing transitions sum to 1) easier to enforce. I.e., if you have     it would implicitly treat that as `p/(p+q)` and `q/(p+q)` which maintains the second assumption automatically. The first assumption (no graph changes) would not hold for `(p+q) = 0` but that is currently not checked / reported.  However, arguably, the solution would not actually be a solution in the sense that you could plug in any value in the valid region as a constant into the PRISM model file and obtain a working model that satisfies the property... I guess that should be documented. Or we could have two modes, one with normalization and one without and then actually determine the constraints on the parameters where both assumptions are actually valid.

Yes, I was surprised to see something that would cause the container to crash/exit. Hopefully more detailed log info will help.   I don't need to mount all of the files, so documentation on how to exclude some folders (like /vendor) would be helpful.  However I think we need to learn the cause of the problem to make this more stable for everybody.

Ηι, Sorry for the delay in answering. All timeplans we have are private and i can not share. I asked yo send me an example but this can be opened with warnings. Maybe the file length is the problem. We have mpp covering years and are a bit long.attached the small to see the warnings. Snother issue is that Gantt fills a lot the TEMP DI of windows (appl-local). The issue is that when the program is closed some temp.Gantt files remain.

It seems I can't get it to load in 1.15, it might just be my setup but it just doesn't load. Also, apologies for waiting 3 days to respond, I might have forgotten...
I know that quoting the path is possible. This fix here is just an alternative to it I wanted to try.  In the end I don’t like both of them. Both solutions are considerably worse than how this command was implemented in MC 1.12.2. I feel that we have to redesign this completely, especially to get back the autocompletion. I am thinking about removing the “wol file” and “wol shared-file” commands and instead making a new command (something like “wol editor” or “wol browser open”) that just opens the browser showing some kind of file chooser or some text field with autocompletion implemented with java script. This text field could also be added to every editor page to make it easier to open another file. “Move” and “Delete” could be implemented as buttons.
mysqld  Ver 5.7.22 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server (GPL))  select st_geomfromtext("POINT(42.33118 -71.11777)")
thank you. it worked.  good question which version it is. how do I check this?
i did a cursory search through debug logs but did not find any errors or shutdown happening in the resteasy or my custom handlers.  basically, tried to post the issue to see if anyone else has already seen it.  i'm currently trying to track this bug from another direction, trying to eliminate possibilities that there is some sort of blocking operation, but i'll update this issue with my findings. 
Here is the code.  https://redocly.github.io/redoc/openapi.yaml   The problem occur when I edit the source code after I have imported the Swagger code.  Follow the steps to reproduce: 1. First I imported the code by paste the url. 2. Then I clicked on "edit api" and "live documentation". I everything works fine. 3. Now I want to change the source code, so I clicked on the buttion "source code" and changed the title (just added one more character). Then the error occur when I click on "live documentation" agian.  The error message: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8996276/63435240-db62d700-c426-11e9-89cb-2a0531e16bf6.png)  In advance- thanks for the help.
This is an old issue. I'm not using Bungee Skellet anymore and I see you updated the plugin so it could be fixed.
I tried the to reproduce the Screenshots above but it worked correct. (I clicked on the Tag "system thinking" in the column for Jan, got to the next page and went back by using the back button of the browser. Same with clicking on one the Tag "France" and going back for the Service.) But there was again the homepage text in the wrong place, see below.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18674205/15814010/beee1174-2bc3-11e6-98c4-1999740be226.png) Using the back button to reconstruct this, the homepage text appeared in the right column, like this: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18674205/15814028/dc7d25ae-2bc3-11e6-8d31-7db015c5a3fb.png) Then I tried to reproduce this, but all worked correct. Strange. 
Clean install of version 1.8.2 showed this issue. 
Basically in the sample app, the screen after a successful login has a delete account button. I think the SmartLock implementation might need a little tweaking. If the account it expects to find is already deleted, then the error is probably not being handled correctly.  Here is the screenshot.  ![screenshot_20160803-224343-2-480x483](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/73044/17374907/66360aaa-59cc-11e6-8e24-534455829340.png) 
i've been trying but find the iPhone very reliable 
That's a good question and I have no idea. Sometimes my owncloud vps is slow anyway so I thought there may be time out or something with the app. Just guessing...   Unfortunately my phone isn't rooted so I can't get logcat.  
Harald,  What files will you need to reproduce it?

No certificate warnings at all.
You're right ! I did not saw it was a 'docker' strategy ! In fact the issue is that this run once strategy is available for all nodes, even the non-docker ones !  Thanks a lot.
Verified. Thanks for the quick turnaround and the good work on this project! 
I played around a bit and found out that it seems like a problem from derived implementation of TextEditor class used in problematic jbosstools plugin. I will try to dig around more. 
Every time.
I am using the class path "com.alee.laf.WebLookAndFeel" to set the look and feel dynamically at runtime. This is testing on the program LateralGM.  It only occurs on restart where the look and feel is set and then setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider is called with true at the end of main()  ![LGM Web L&F](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3212801/11094577/723536b8-885e-11e5-9e2a-a201063266f8.png)  Here's a full stack trace with java version printed by the Error Dialog.   
Try again, as my grammar change is checked in now (as is the above test, but with an @Ignore). The grammar change allows an array to be returned by an expression (i.e. remember how we were trying to allow array references to be expressions in the grammar?).  So the idea is that you can have an expression, like a CASE statement or a built-in function return an ARRAY type, like this:      The getDataType() should return an ARRAY PDataType, but my guess is that it's returning the element type instead. 
@eivindveg I restarted multiple times, also re-installed the app. I eventually figured out through the code where the database file was and deleted it. 
The ResultSetUtil#convertByteArrayValue method references to MySQL JDBC driver 5.1 version, it just checks first of byte array.In 8.0 version, it changes to byte array -> long -> boolean, you can find the implement in [here](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/blob/release/8.0/src/main/core-impl/java/com/mysql/cj/result/BooleanValueFactory.java#L78), I’m not sure which way is better, what do you think? BTW, this method has only been verified in the MySQL database, I don't have an environment for other databases.
I guess `\r` are here to prevent matching an eventual existing `Icon` file which is not the one from the OS, how unlikely it could be.  I guess the original template is this one: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/OSX.gitignore  But the 2 `\r` of this one are parsed into `\0` somewhere. I'm not sure but that might be related to a57acd46f149218c, which was solving issue #13.  I don't have any clue in mind on how to solve this. But I guess that, pragmatically, having `Icon` without any `\r` may be less likely to cause troubles than `Icon` with `\0` which may break things regarding tools you use. What do you think? 
I did not look how the library use the reference, but I looked where the information is lost.  When a new `java.lang.URL` is created, the constructor does all the parsing job, then a `java.net.URLStreamHandler` is called to finish the parsing. The reference part is properly parsed by the URL.   When we start a spring boot application with the `spring-boot-loader`, the `org.springframework.boot.loader` is registered as `java.protocol.handler.pkgs` and  `org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.Handler` is used as URLStreamHandler. But this handler does not use all parsed information of the URL [source](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/da550efc6ba8cce601e2ce34432d1224184a2477/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-loader/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/loader/jar/Handler.java#L214 ):   The reference information is available in the `context` object but the method always set a `null` value.  I don't know if this behavior is voluntary or if it's mistake.

1. The server is set on 4GB. 2. I don't know if I understand what you want. If is server empty, trains allocate memory at a rate of several MB per hour. In 1 day after start server using 1GB more that it was on start. 3.  I don't have problems with lags.
I ran the desktop app from Android Studio. When I run it from terminal with `./gradlew desktop:run` I get an exception:    I'm unfamiliar with `openjdk` so I reckon I'm not using it. How can I check to be sure? My java version: 1.7.0_09 
Hi, I'm having some troubles running my code with the SNAPSHOT build (the front-end doesn't want to connect to the server - perhaps I am doing something wrong), but by looking at the commit - why don't you use [ThreadLocal.remove](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html#remove%28%29) instead of `set(null)`? 
Sure, i tested this on v3.8.1 1.11.2. [Crash Log](https://pastebin.com/gzVHmM5b)    This is what happened when i did /give Thaun_ `randomthings:runebase` . It gave me `tile.runebase.name`. I could place it down, but it was weird beacuse it did not render anything.  In the second image i placed the runebase ontop of a runbase.  ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4j5028c.png) ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/aZGyyKq.png)
Much better. Would the following code even work? Seems like it would only check once - don't want to give the user the wrong idea.

Unity 4.6. OSX 
I've sent you the file and yes you can reuse it. 
@nallar   Yes the chunk count appears to be perfectly normal, I was thinking maybe Cache or something was related.  I'll hopefully be able to do another test run soon, not going to upset my players for the moment. I can't reproduce locally so my server is the only thing I'm able to test on.  This particular issue does not bother me (as I've had it set to false since I found this out), but I know it is required for things like quarries to work between restarts so people having this option set to true might be suffering. 
Well problem is that it crashes the R session in RStudio before I can ask for a traceback() - so it just gives me a window "R Session Aborted"... But the problem should be easy enough for you to reproduce...
@qwerty4030 the parsing happens on the coordinating node (the node that receives the request from the client) but `Aggregator`s are created on the shard so we can't create the `Aggregator`s during the parsing phase and perform the validation with them. I think we will need to create code to do the validation using the `AggregatorBuilder` objects instead since this is what we have available on the coordinating node at parse time.  As for the discrepancy between order in the terms aggregation and the histogram aggregations, it would be nice to have them consistent. Maybe we could have both use the same `Order` classes rather than having separate implementations but I fear that this will be fairly tricky. 
@wu-sheng  A little bit of code change，a pull request has been sent.
Screen native.  Its this line of code that makes it fullscreen: `cfg.setFromDisplayMode(LwjglApplicationConfiguration.getDesktopDisplayMode());`  In the desktop main class - https://github.com/TeamSweepy/Greywater/blob/master/Greywater-desktop/src/com/teamsweepy/greywater/Main.java

it does it with all   try this one http://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/719969998
stefandollase you may be correct. I most likely assumed something that I wasn't even seeing. I have since checked and it's because the Open file dialog doesn't show the folder path I mistakenly thought it was going to the main saves folder under .minecraft, it isn't it IS, in fact, going to the proper saves folder for that profile. This is a non-issue. Please close this. 
Hi Sorry I didn't see your previous message. Since the update I haven't had the issue anymore.
@bclozel here you go https://github.com/lazystone/spring-bugs/tree/22973  It works on SB 2.0.9, but if you change SB version to 2.1.x here https://github.com/lazystone/spring-bugs/blob/22973/build.gradle.kts#L6  Then test will fail.
Thanks for fast answer!  I've removed old version `rm -rf /usr/share/dbeaver`. Then remove package, and then install again `.deb`.  Same errors:  When start from menu: [1536304167425.log](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/files/2359945/1536304167425.log)  When start by command in terminal: [empty_name.log](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/files/2359948/empty_name.log) 
now it's fine 
I am running 2.0.1-b469 I think.
@Stypox  this app-debug.apk is from the 5th of October. Is it still actual? Won't it introduce more bugs?
@h3xstream  In some cases we will not have compiled classes available for java files. In this case we does not want to fail the sonar analysis and continue with the WARNING message from findbugs. 
@h3xstream you're not asking me, are you?   I guess the basic problem is, why a `getClassName` call returns a method name. That sounds awfully wrong to me. 
I respect the decision to keep it - but it is simply the principle of deleting a file: when delete, delete forever, from everywhere. Perhaps I could fabricate a few extreme examples in which this small "feature" could expose secrets but I'm sure you know what I mean. 
MariaDB 10.1.26.
Yep, just checked, only happens on firefox it looks like, chrome works fine.  This is just installing to hawtio running in a fabric on a local build, so it's the current master of both, no proxy/remote connecting.  I'll take a look and debug further monday after having some beers to forget about this week :-) 
Yes, I did.  I did additional tests with versions ehcache-3.0.0-20160203.125949-245.jar and 3.0.0.m4.jar, and both didn't work. 
I think I might have found it. Thanks anyway :)
I must admit I missed the point that the maven plugin can use a newer release of the core. That will be sufficient, even though it means maintaining 2 version properties instead of 1 in the pom. :)  Regarding coupled versions: I do know other software with multiple integrations, where this is solved by always releasing a new x.y version together for core changes, but to allow totally independent x.y.z, x.y.(z+1) etc. releases of the different parts. I'm aware that this may falsify the meaning of semantical versioning for the non-core parts, if they add huge unrelated features in z+1. It's somewhat of a compromise between exact versioning and more easy to recognize for end users.
It is not an interface as far as I know. It is an AspectJ generated class. It does work with Cobertura 1.9.4.1 but not with the latest code in the git repo (checked out about 2 weeks ago). Perhaps I can send you an example of the generated class instrumented with 1.9.4.1 and an instrumented class generated with the latest? This might be tricky to get to the bottom of. Let me know how I can help. Have you worked much with AspectJ? 
I found this one when it had a problem parsing space between Initials tags for a Contact. I guess blank white space is legal for some properties.

That's it. After cleaning the cache it worked as expected. This solution apparently was too easy for me ...  Maybe it would be a good idea to prevent these pages from caching as long as it is in beta state. Or at least to set short expiry dates, e.g. maximum 1 day.
Works perfectly - thank you!
Hey hey, using this one: https://github.com/indiecastfm/react-native-audio-streamer  It does use Audio Focus, which I think prioritizes things. I actually find that if the main activity is closed by memory cleanup, the React Native Music Control keeps open, but automatically stops playing. I'm going to try monitor the logs a bit closer and see what I can come up with.
You are right! It is Ok now! Thank you,  agrinard! Quang 
I hesitated for a while, deciding between bug and feature request. Only the level of surprise caused by this limitation made me call this a bug. It might really be only a usability issue, if we're tracking such things.
Hi,  I always run it with redis. Here is my code to get the count of registrations.  Iterators.size(lwServer.getRegistrationService().getAllRegistrations());  However, after registering 200+ devices, after a while, the number became to drop. It might go back to the original number and, then, it will be dropping again ...  it will give some wrong small number eventually ...  However, if I get the number of registration directly through redis-cli, the number of the connected devices is correct.  It means something wrong with the piece of code. Iterators.size(lwServer.getRegistrationService().getAllRegistrations());  I also try to use hasNext(), next() instead of Iterators.size. It gives me the same result. Hence, I strongly suspect the iterator implementation of leshan has some issue ... Maybe, it needs to reset the iterator or something.  Myself, I implement a lua script to get the total count. Maybe, leshan should adopt that.  Thanks :)   
Yeah, I finished it :) A slightly different version.   @Major- Mind add me on skype? artembatutin 
Aravind's theory may be correct. I also tested it on Galaxy S2 its working alright. Btw OS version on my S3 is 4.1.1

Testing team use live executions very frequently to debug had to spot issues from Cerberus screenshots and also as helper when there's complex scenarios and several steps prior to the step where the issue happen.  It's not blocking but the possibility to view a live execution, makes the debug process a lot faster an efficient. Our testing team use it all the time.  Screenshot still displayed.  As you mentioned, I would suggest to make it headless by default (because it should reduce resource consumption and the complexity on robot host) but with possibility to overwrite it for some robots. If you predict the development will be long we surely appreciate to remove it temporarily, otherwise, we can wait for it a couple of days for it, no problem.
This is with the version uploaded yesterday (for 1.7.10). The rest of the log is loading info I doubt you will find helpful. 
@stefanomorson I was able to reproduce it following the steps described above.  Try this:  0. Browser should be full-sized before test.  1. Go to child accounts, select one of them and go to _**Settings**_ tab 2. Select _**Role Service**_ and verticlly resize bottom window (the _**Settings**_ window) and shrink (horizontally resize) the whole browser window. _**Now all the unnecessary sliders should appear.**_
I wasn't planning on it but I can if you just want the one file changed, no new unit tests.  What branch?  And did you want the Apache license link to be https instead of http or just fix the missing colon?

i mean that when SERVICE_A call SERVICE_B, SERVICE_A create a span named span_ab as a bridge between SERVICE_A  and SERVICE_B, then SERVICE_B has a parent span named span_ab and a local span span_b. when the request is over , SERVICE_B record the last log at methed below :     Because span_b has a parent span sanp_ab,it always goes to the branch 'if (parent != null) {',and MDC remain it until gc.yet ,it does't matter at most time,but i think  it will be better if we can clear MDC by hand.it's just my advise. 
Single player. No other mods. 
now i can't see this problem, maybe is fixedm but if  get again this problem i open new issue , i use latest version of oldcombact
Here it is:   
I tried Finchley.RC1 release but the behaviour is still the same. The Content-Encoding header gets removed and the content still remains compressed making it unreadable for the downstream service.  I think the issue comes from the fact that the ProxyRequestHelper#isIncludeHeader is used in ProxyRequestHelper#buildZuulRequestHeaders AND ProxyRequestHelper#setResponse methods. I think it should only be used in the ProxyRequestHelper#setResponse method so that the "Content-Encoding" header remains in the request forwarded to the downstream service. What do you think?
Attempt to read from beyond end of underlying data source can be reproduced with test images inside the repository.  Number of requested bytes cannot be negative: ![jpk00004](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8988676/5427828/6e7fba30-83ae-11e4-93c9-3b648e2d8226.jpg) ![jpk00005](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8988676/5427829/6e825be6-83ae-11e4-9771-cc79c8eba3b5.jpg) 
It seems that there's been a redirect in place at RCSB that did:   So it looks like biojava wasn't handling URL redirects correctly for this case. That'd be another fix we need to correct the caching problems.
@qparis so you want a DTO for the `script` inside the `ShortcutDTO`? I don't think that's possible because it depends on the engine (e.g. "wineDebug"). If we create a `DTO` for it, we cannot have user defined engines anymore. The previous solution just printed the values for every key in the json and did not try to map anything therefore it did not have a problem.
It concerns the methods marked as FIXME, like for instance this one.    Its already some weeks ago that I handled this, but I think its like this:  I assumed that the original idea is that sourceToTargetDefaultMapping does not have a forward mapping (like all the other sourceToTargetXXXX mappers).  However removing the `@InheritInverseConfiguration` makes the testcase fail with: `expected:<'[01.01.2014 00:00] UTC'> but was:<'[January 1, 2014 12:00:00 AM] UTC'>`  After some analysis I found out that this mapper (again presumably accidentally) relies on `targetToSource`, which in its turn relied on `sourceToTarget`.   I fixed it when I was introducing the `@InheritInverseConfiguration` to what actually happened prior to the introduction, not to (what I think was) its original intention.   ## `  BTW: this is the reason I stated that the old behavior of the reverse mapping was quite unpredictable.

Well, my answer wouldn't be easy. So, the following env var needs to be set in `docker run` for API node. By itself, this env var represents a public (reachable through the internet) IP address of the LB container. So, missing steps here are: 1. Deploy API container at the end. 2. When LB container deployed - check its IP address (that could be `docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <lb-container>`). 3. Add `-e FN_PUBLIC_LB_URL=http://<lb-container-ip>:<lb-container-http-port>`  The most crucial part here is Fn CLI simple test. Since this type of the deployment is not usual to anyone expect us, you need to show the following things: 1. Create a new context with API container IP address. 2. Deploy hello-world. 3. Inspect a function, highlight the annotation because it would be different compared to regular annotation you'd get from FN running through`fn start`. 4. Call a function with both an `HTTP trigger` and `invoke`. 
This happened on a Sony Z3 running Android 6.0.1 But I don't think it's related to the Android version or the phone.  Note that this is happening only on the first of the month. On the second I've checked and the display was normal.   Anyway this is really just a minor bug. 
@stephanrauh Thank you for your reproducer. I extended it that way, so it corresponds to the reported issue.

Yeah, I can take a stab at it!
Any updates on this? 
we have ten servers with:     Intel E5(4 Cores, 2.4GHz)     24 GB RAM     2 TB HDD  must I set up a coprocessor in hbase? does the geoserver parameter coprocessorJar need to be set?
We can add a simple `AtomicBoolean` flag to the `Tracker` object, and raise it when `setUserId` is called. Then in the following call to the `track` method we could check that flag after the call to `injectBaseParams` and if it's *raised* inject the "deviceParams" and lower the flag. What do you think @d4rken ? (I ran a little test and seems to be working fine now)
@MorrisJobke phone model and android version would be great 
that fixes it, if anything changes i'll let you know.
probably error with struct appears due to incorrect mapping (table 'test') anyway, any attempt of import results with error [tr_log.log](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/files/4031073/tr_log.log) 
.
Thanks Gael  I still use GWT 2.4, I have tried 0.43 version but test did not run at all. It looks like incompatibility in gwt classes.  When I switch to GWT 2.5 I will let you know about results. 
I have been working on this for the last 10 days now. I have created a test case for it and have also re-factored the BlockwiseLayer quite a lot so that it now handles all of this correctly AFAIK. In the course of doing so I completely removed all *special behavior regarding blockwise transfers* from the Matchers as well.  I will push the branch with the changes later during the day so that you guys can take a look. But beware, I made a lot of changes :-)

Please try to reproduce. 1. Set System/Configurations - Search Configuration - Query time range limit - eg. 2 days 2. Go to input click on Show received messages 3. check the time frame selector field.  Some screensoths (14 days only)  https://screenshots.firefox.com/dTduzSI6GTCfm5LJ/10.14.0.90 https://screenshots.firefox.com/MuHZczo5qeia5RiV/10.14.0.90 https://screenshots.firefox.com/A0rqGop8ZRic6Czz/10.14.0.90 It show the "last 5 minutes", but is shows the 2 days search in the results (as you set under "Query time range limit").  If you disable the limit, you click the received messages it shows "all messages" and search fo "all messages".
That could be. I found this output harder to figure out what's going on than others. I do know that I gave it multiple attempts to 'wait' but its never came out of it.

It's very simple to reproduce, and in doing so, I find that the problem becomes even more fantastic. In the demo project, there are two sections of keystore configuration in bootstrap.properties, as follows:  > #encrypt.key-store.location= classpath:/config-server.keystore #encrypt.key-store.alias=config-server #encrypt.key-store.password=test123 #encrypt.key-store.secret=test123   > encrypt.key-store.location= classpath:/server.jks encrypt.key-store.alias=mytestkey encrypt.key-store.password=letmein encrypt.key-store.secret=changeme  Pointing to two keystore files, server.jks from the generated command given on the document, as follows:  > keytool -genkeypair -alias mytestkey -keyalg RSA  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein  When started with this configuration, the exception did not appear and it appears to have been loaded.  So I made minor modifications to the generated command above, and generated config-server.keystore. The command is as follows:  > keytool -genkeypair -alias config-server -keyalg RSA  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" -keypass test123 -keystore config-server.keystore -storepass test123  When you start using the config-server.keystore configuration, an exception appears above.  I don't know the difference, maybe the name?  Zip file of demo project: [demo.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/files/2555818/demo.zip)       
Okay so we've rolled out the updated version onto the server, and all the things I _was_ losing.. are now found!  Trouble is now other things are being lost periodically.  At present I will occasionally search for "Copper" and see 3 types of Copper Ingots (as in .. from 3 different mods) in my system despite the fact that I know I only have 1 type in my system. So I pull out the 2nd and 3rd ones with smaller amounts and once on my cursor they magically transform into say.. Copper Wiring. Or Copper Plates.  If I put these items back into the system.. they transform back into copper ingots from other mods again. Really strange.  Please let me know if you need anymore testing. I would love to give you a map download so you could test it but unfortunately I don't have access to do that. I can do testing however.

That is weird. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 running Fluxbox. The file in question was one with Chinese characters mixed with Latin containing ? . The Chinese equivalent of ? Worked fine.

Version 24.09.2011 I turned off my nuvifone A50 and relaunch it. Nothing beter. I uninstalled cgeo-opensource and re-installeted it. I download some caches and it works. After several minutes I returned on the dowloaded caches and pictures were no more (in the logs and spoler) there only appear a neutral picture with a lens of camera.

@PhilJay sorry for not being more specific with the report. The issue is indeed that the first graph pictured does not start at 0. The reason I believe this is a bug is due to the fact that I am passing (0,0) as a value but it is not showing up in the graph that has large negative components. Even setting the last value to a positive number does not fix the issue. Is there perhaps some other value I need to set that I'm just not aware of? 
The error appears randomly on the console...I dont exactly know how to replicate it
@snicoll Both IDEs can create start projects without problem! 👍  
It's version 2014.08.29  Premium member  It's the caches that are shown on the map when I go to live map, most of them (or all) are stored in a list. This problem existed on version 2014.08.28 as well.  I've tried to sort on all kinds of things and then distance again. But still no luck. It's seems like it works to sort by other things but not distance. 
I am not sure, how can I check?  I use: Eclipse DSL Tools  Version: Neon.1a Release (4.6.1) Build id: 20161007-1200

https://youtu.be/DiwscPGBQ-w  Apparently I was wrong about it happening only on other player's clients - when trying to record this video, I could only get it to happen when I opened the door myself, and when my friend opened it for me repeatedly this wouldn't happen. Not sure why.   This was in the pack "Dungeons, Dragons, and Space Shuttles" but I was also experiencing the same problem in the pack "Builder's Paradise." 
Thanks so much for taking time to explain and fix the issue Best regards

Hello,  Thanks for your attention.  This was a simple test where I posted an XML to the GridFS collection called raw.files and passed in some optional metadata. properties={"source":"STATSTEST", "sourcepath":"/sourcein/data/example","filename":"testfilename"}  When you first GET API the document like below http://localhost:8080/sportsdatahub/raw.files/562e45edfb111501ceb5de79 The above properties are retrieved correctly.  Now I update the source value above to "STATSTESChanged" as an example. I did this via a robomongo. When I now query it still returns back the previous properties. Not the changed.  I did not see this in any other collection but only the GridFS collection (example : raw.files)  Thanks, Ashish Gidh  On Mon, Oct 26, 2015 at 12:26 PM, Maurizio Turatti <notifications@github.com  > wrote: >  > Could you please write us in details what are you doing, so that we can > reproduce the same behavior?For example, when you say you update the > metadata what operations are you performing? >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub > https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart/issues/60#issuecomment-151196556 > . 
Well I since then removed those machines... But it is basically 2 columns of 3 vat's eacht.. 3 producing hooch and 3 producing fire water... With the correct filter settings (only export fire water), it still put water into the drum... Checking the filter settings, they only had firewater whitelisted.. Put down another new drum... Again, exported water into it. 
Thanks @danglotb for helping me, everything does build fine now but I still encounter some issues during the `mvn test` (see [error_debug_log](https://github.com/STAMP-project/dspot/files/739255/error_debug_log.txt)). I'd be glad to provide any relevant info :)  
My android system version is 5.1.1 I've tested it and yes it works fine. 
Great, thanks! I'll reduce my specification to a minimal example exposing the problem and submit a pull request.  Since I should do it against the `2.0` branch: Should I keep the specification in the 3.0.0 format or rewrite it as 2.0?
I think you're right, @jgfidelis . I just checked and sharing directly from Spotify to stories (Spotify has a direct IG share feature) has a similar issue. It brings me to a login screen, and I never end up being able to share the song even after logging in (no "unable to share, must be logged in" message in this case though).  You can bet that if it's breaking Spotify's sharing that it's a bug. 
i i think so, but is is hard to reproduce, because i don't know the situation
Sure, I  reproduced the case in a small project. You can find it here, into my github account : [sixrandanes/error-redirection-actuator](https://github.com/sixrandanes/error-redirection-actuator)  I also use spring-data-rest & spring-data-rest-hal-browser.  Hope it helps, Sylvain 
I'm currently using version 2.6.2.
@pron nop, still nothing reported by `verifyInstrumentation`. I will try to make a simpler example!
Sure! https://youtu.be/uE0_57qgZD8  I think the event fires twice for no good reason in this case. ( Maybe it fires the crafting event here for each of the 2 axes ?? , since the regular shapeFormed fires only once for the diamond axe, as shown in the video. )
yep its fixed now
Yep, 8 bits of alpha, 8 bits of luminance. I generated this image with imagemagick's convert command. Turns out its the default format for greyscale png, but you can force it to save in ARGB too, which I did for now. Thanks for looking into it! 
Sure. Let's try with master first.
No, it also  happened with the version immediately before your most  recently committed changes to the JIDE version.

Yes I did try #5, it did not work out. That is the complete stack trace. I'm trying to figure out how it works so did not try for DSE. However, I tried with DSE drivers to connect but it did not work out.
i'm using the latest linux (xubuntu) 64bit  here is an extract of my configuration as shown in the eclipse-about-dialog / configuration : **\* System properties: applicationXMI=org.eclipse.ui.workbench/LegacyIDE.e4xmi awt.toolkit=sun.awt.X11.XToolkit eclipse.application=org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench eclipse.buildId=I20120608-1400 eclipse.commands=-os linux -ws gtk -arch x86_64 
I've had this problem in 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and now 3.0rc1.  Simply setting the 'apps' collection's permissions to "crwxrwxr--" prevents unauthenticated access over REST to the entire database.

Should I start developing a Toast Manager class to handle all toasts? So that developer can create a toast and send it to toast manager. After which rest would be handled by the class. 
@ezaquarii I'm not quite tech enough to do the screencast without help. However, I just got to this message and did a new test today. I was out of town all last week and can't remember when I did it, but I disabled the three main google docs apps, then _!!!_ **I uninstalled them!** I couldn't believe it worked! I recall trying to remove them in the past and it only let me roll back upgrades. This time it was poof, you're gone.  Now, both `*.odt` and `*.ods` open perfectly in the app without any man in the middle attack by Google. Interestingly though, I couldn't open a specific `*.xlsx` file with the app that opens fine in the Collabora program in a normal desktop browser. I have many `*.docx` and `*.xlsx` files that opened as expected with one touch in the mobile app both in the _pull from the cloud_ and the "On Device" areas. The problem file threw up the app chooser to set what opens it, but the only choices were "HP ePrint" and "PRINT" by Canon. When I touch the vertical ellipsis for that problem file, I had options for "Open with" and "Open with Collabora Online Developme..", and the latter selection worked as expected. I then deleted the local copy of that file and it opened in one touch as it was supposed to in Collabora.  Does this close this issue? Or would you like me to reinstall those apps to diagnose something?
There is no official date yet, probably sometime around September. 
@ns1123  Hi, I still not to start worker or any setting for worker. I am trying to run master with this config and encounter this error. Thanks.
> When Devtools switches the `ResourceLoader` that customization is hardcoded in the context so it will always behaves wrongly.  This is exactly what my issue is. I am indeed overriding the `ApplicationContext` itself because it only works as a facade when `GenericApplicationContext.resourceLoader` is `null`, otherwise it uses the resource loading capabilities of its superclass, since `GenericApplicationContext` derives from `DefaultResourceLoader`. Therefore, when custom protocol resolvers are registered with the `ApplicationContext` itself (actually, the `DefaultResourceLoader` it extends) they fail to be consulted once Devtools injects the custom `ResourceLoader`. Therefore, I chose to reimplement `ApplicationContext.getResource` to easily showcase the fact that this method is never called.  You are correct in your suggestion to change the testcase the way you did, as you then implement the workaround I illustrated. What my tests show is that if `GenericApplicationContext.resourceLoader` is not set, then the `ApplicationContext`'s implementation is not used, therefore its behaviour is lost.  The main problem here is that `ApplicationContext` in some cases is not just a facade, but an actual implementor of `ResourceLoader`. If you ask me, a better solution would be to remove `DefaultResourceLoader` from the inheritance chain of `GenericApplicationContext` and always delegate to an instance property. This would however be a breaking change and I understand that this cannot be changed at the moment (neither is it in Spring Boot, but in Spring Context).  Is the problem more clear now? Do you need anything else from me to help? 
What I ment was adding new conditional flow step inside of one condition in existing conditional flow step. So it would look something like this:  webhook -> conditional flow 1 -> log  conditional flow 1: condition1, condition2, condition3  condition1: flow start -> conditional flow 2 -> flow end . . .  conditional flow 2: condition 4, condition 5 condition 6   In current UI implementation you would get lost pretty quickly and navigation between those conditions would be really hard. I agree that some special selection/columns for conditions needs to exist and your suggested solution with simple UI changes may solve the issue.  
I can only get the french versions of the counter strings :  "\Mémoire\Écritures de pages/s" and "\Mémoire\Lecture de pages/s".  Also, I can't add any of the counters related to the swap file ("fichier d'échange") in perfmon.
Bad news - i forgot to output to a file and had debug enabled, which overflowed my console. I reran and captured the output and no log line could be found.  Reran with the original version: no error.  I'll try running a full fsck using 2.1.1 just in case there are some others lurking around. 
Yes  I have seen on all physical devices that I have tested it .

Hello sir, this issue is tied with [#1935](https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/1935#issuecomment-292100149) but I am not completely sure.  I have changed in manifest package name and also in code. My package name now is: `com.lazarvgd.fastcloud`. Maybe the source of the issue is the fact that in Manifest file packgage name is: `com.lazarvgd.fastcloud`, but in structure I see `rs.lazarvgd.fastcloud`?  I am sorry because I am asking stupid question, but I am junior and not experienced developer.  Thanks :)

No, it was just a test of saving and loading, performed in onPause and onResume, so it saved and then failed to load 0.5s later. 
It looks like the same problem occurs on both Ubuntu 14.10, MacOSX 10.9, on which both very recent version of eclipse is installed (from the Eclipse Luna SR1a "IDE for Java Developers" download).

 [Fire Emblem 4 Changelog.zip](https://github.com/lushen124/Universal-FE-Randomizer/files/3229493/Fire.Emblem.4.Changelog.zip) Claude passed down Thoron (he had major Tordo blood) to Arthur (who was a Bard).  I don't believe you get Volcanon in Gen 1.  Also, another one that I think just worked out was the final boss of Chapter 8 was that he remained a General, and was able to use the Killer Bow he still had on him. Not sure if you programmed that exception in . Not sure why KB wasn't randomized. Or maybe it was, and it was just lucky. (He didn't drop it.)  
The purpose is achieved on the second case as I'm getting OK on overall execution, although is not really user-friendly and can lead to doubts if the user is looking to the execution for the first time. I wouldn't reach this solution honestly but it was suggested by Filipe and made the trick. In my modest opinion my suggestion would be simpler to understand. When a property is not calculated following some condition it should be considered as it wouldn't exist.  Although I understand that FA should be generated on the second case because it fails to get a certain element I wouldn't know how to work around this type of case, so maybe can be useful to leave it like this.
Yes it does. But not hidden.

Hi,  indeed it isn't the right comparator for me. I need something like |v1-v2|, but for now I just used the exact comparator and it works as well. I might implement some more comparators in the future if needed. I'll share them with you.  
[log.txt](https://github.com/tuomount/Open-Realms-of-Stars/files/1076853/log.txt)  I might be wrong, but I feel like it could be related to the project's structure and its dependency on JRE 1.7, since 1.7 isn't available on Windows anymore. It's been obsoleted by Oracle in favour of 1.8.
Checked with these settings, waited it out on local docker 8.2.0 with `command: -c 'shared_buffers=1024MB' -c 'max_locks_per_transaction=1024'`  Takes 15 minutes to import pointing study dataset for 7 patients (but about 150 categorical code lists)
I didn't disable anything from Evilcraft.  I have a mod that lets you change the vanilla ender chest into a color coded ender chest. But it changes nothing of the recipe, and is done by shift right clicking with an Item on the chest.  I think I have no mod, which changes potions, but i'm not 100% sure of that. 
Here is a client log from a brand new instance with just the latest versions of the mods in question. Last time I may have accidentally grabbed a crash report from an older version of JEI that I was testing with to see what version the bug first appeared along side.  fml-client-latest.log: https://gist.github.com/rockdemon696/49b6ba715c9baa3ba1af 
Cannot test it directly as that was production system :)  But `glassfish-corba-internal-api 4.0.1-p8` still creates ThreadPoolExecutor with unbounded queue. So unless JCA WorkManager uses different thread pool manager, the bug must be present.

It's happened since 1.0.24 -> 1.0.33 ( pre 82cc9a4605 ) and still occurs after 82cc9a4605. This has happened in every case. 
When I go to  'Report an issue' and try to paste something (long-press/hold) in the Title section the application just dies.
You are right; quick-fix (alt-space) suggests changing the signature in the interface, which is not under my control. So either close this issue, or suggest quick-fix like in non-inherited methods ("Add return type hint")
Mod version : placeableitems-3.3 Forge : 1.12.2-14.23.5.2838 MC version : 1.12.2  Video  : https://youtu.be/UYggJb4Z8u4 Basically all you have to do is keep spamming to place and break the sword and it will duplicate.
@matpag yep, it works fine when there is right amount of indices but I'm more interested why there's no `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when + 1 index is added.  
Sure - here you go:  
On my Pixel, the following creates direct buffers with array.    Maybe you could check both conditions?  `if (buffer != null && !buffer.isDirect() && buffer.hasArray()) {`
The normal interface: http://puu.sh/gJ9s2/8b7e378987.png The interface terminal count: http://puu.sh/gJ9sM/64ab4eda25.png I want to stress that NO OTHER CHANGES were made other than the single change pictured below. The multipart'd interface: http://puu.sh/gJ9u1/1ac554560d.png The new interface terminal count: http://puu.sh/gJ9v5/5daa9cc608.png Again, only THAT SINGLE CHANGE is made. Back to the normal interface: http://puu.sh/gJ9xX/64b3709599.png And the new interface terminal count: http://puu.sh/gJ9yn/47acc460b7.png  It may do this with other blocks as well, maybe even cables.  However, I only tested this effect with interfaces.  This is very very very bizarre to me, and it took us quite awhile to figure out why all of our interfaces weren't available.

No,this screen behaves fine.The main issue comes when i click on it and the new page opens.Right now it is working fine but an hour ago i was not receiving massages instantly.I had to go back one step and open again to see new messages. 
no I didn't actually, but why would that be different? 
Sorry, I'd assumed it was an isolated problem based on https://github.com/spring-io/start.spring.io/issues/191. I thought we would have heard about it before if it applies to the Cloud starters that, I imagine, are more commonly used. I guess it's unusual to use one in isolation though?   If the problem's more widespread then, yeah, it probably makes sense to handle it centrally than have loads of issues. Whatever works best for you.
I have no internet at home so I can't really update currently. I download almost all of my mods on a seperate device, so installing  A newer version of  Minecraft means bringing my bulky computer to my friend's house.
> I'm actually thinking about adding -B to the _is_gold_supported, so we use gold that is associated with clang installation.  The issue I was seeing is that there _isn't_ a `gold` associated with the `clang` installation. On Travis, `clang` was installed in `/usr/local/clang-5.0.0/bin` but `ld.gold` was in `/usr/bin`, and there wasn't an `ld.gold` binary or symlink in `clang`'s bindir. So if I'm understanding correctly, that won't help.  Since the `-B` option can be passed multiple times, what if you pass `-B <clang bin dir> -B <which ld.gold>` to those actions? Then it'll find `gold` associated with `clang` first, falling back to the default that `clang` would have used anyway if it's not present there.
Thanks for investigating.  Yes, it seems to happen with all queries.  These are named parameters. I'm happy for the previous value to be remembered when I run the script, but when I change the value assigned to the named parameter, it's currently reverting to the value from the previous run.  As mentioned, this is PL/SQL script, e.g.something like    I am executing the code by highlighting from the entire code block and then pressing Ctrl+ENTER.  My OS is Ubuntu 16.04.

There is a test in Kotlin in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/46. It doesn't look like the bug has any outward effects normally in Java since the only thing it seems to break is PropertyValueBuffer.hasParameter() which isn't normally called.  Here is something I managed to come up with to reproduce it in plain Java: https://gist.github.com/kpdonn/368a760ab52a9bbb0b334c2a37fae0d2

Great Eric, seems to work fine in 3.1.0.xx-201809160114-e48! Thank you!
That would fix the test case, since it is predictably running touchDown during the LifecycleListener's pause event, but I don't think it would prevent the issue from happening in practice if a Timer could still possibly be created during the "danger period". What about suluke's suggestion from #1548? Setting Timer.thread to null during the pause event seems like it would work.

@Malinskiy I've now tried to reproduce the issues. I didn't succeed. However, it was quite a long time ago that I've tried, so maybe I'm not doing it well.

OS X El Capitan, Unity 5.3 and 5.4.  I'm not sure if a GIF would be super useful, the steps are simply:  Add a break point Press Attach to Unity and select it in the list Press play on Unity  The Consulo console will say Successfully Attached to Unity, but the breakpoints won't fire.  Pressing pause in the debugger will pause Unity however, so it definitely seems attached. This is the same on three different computers of mine. 
Okay, I'll test it and get back to you 
@pmlopes no problem, in my app I use my own auth class since I need digest authentication with database users and I fixed this issue  using a global static hash map of nonces with synchronized getter/setter.

I am using the Zotero addon for Firefox, not the standalone version. I have Zotfile setup to move all new attachments to a folder in my SpiderOak from the default Zotero location. The steps to reproduce are launching Firefox, navigating to a journal article with a pdf that I would like to save, and press the 'Save to Zotero'-icon in the browser toolbar.  I tried it more extensively now and notice that the error persists for all articles I download, until I open the Zotero pane and right click >> Manage Attachments >> Rename Attachments. This works without error messages and, curiously, makes Zotfile work automatically with all subsequently downloaded articles. So after I have done the manual renaming once, I can use the Zotero toolbar button to download article pdfs and Zotfile will automatically rename them.  I do use NoScript and some other addons, not sure if that would interfere somehow.

Uhm... Not really.  At the moment there is only one debug configuration called "Rust" which allows to run an executable which is the output of a build process.   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889291/51439677-8b1b6f00-1cb5-11e9-8ee2-e930e89f9f5d.png)  This doesn't work if you want to debug a `#[test]`  - using "test" as the Build Command does not work as the build command is executed *before* launching GDB - using the "normal" Executable doesn't work as `cargo test` gives the executable a different (random) name for the test executable.  The profile I'm talking about could be just the same, just made more clever so it figures out what the name of the test executable is.  - Build command could be `test --no-run` which will create the debug executable - *Use default" should figure out somehow that we don't want to run the main executable but query Cargo (how? Perhaps something that we need to ask the Cargo team?) to find out what the name of the Test executable is.  This is how it looks if I fill the fields by hand (and it works too):  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889291/51439794-5f00ed80-1cb7-11e9-8171-194ddbdde4a8.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/889291/51439860-0847e380-1cb8-11e9-925b-5df731e34afc.png)    To be fair, the whole debug launch is a bit clunky. If I had an option, I would like it the same as Java, where pretty much every configuration can be either "Run as..." or "Debug as..." although I think we're hitting the limits of the CDT debug framework here.

Well I was wrong about supressingException. It works fine at least in my test case. Website becomes very slow when DB shuts down, but it's nothing with cache2k but JDBC pooling internals.

Now, if I turn the screen, the image will go beyond it (I use BIV in Fragment): ![i get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11472748/35774125-92681a22-0999-11e8-92f5-5d7142739c2b.png) I want the image to be placed in it when turning the screen: ![i want](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11472748/35774133-abd62bac-0999-11e8-823b-aef7eb2376fe.png) For this, I override `onSizeChanged` so that when the screen was rotated, the scale and center were reset. But it does not work. It works for the original SSIV, but does not work for BIV. The problem is not `oldh != 0 && oldw != 0`. I can write like this:  But I still get this result: ![i get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11472748/35774177-9f9fbf28-099a-11e8-9e5f-e3b3b859b5b5.png) I conclude that the reset (`getSSIV().resetScaleAndCenter()`) does not work. 
Just tested it. With this release version, I'm having exactly the same problem. Can't undo until I open (and close) an experiment. This mean at startup of course, until I launch a simulation.  Here also, no redo even afterlauchung/relaunching experiment.  When I say opening experiment, I don't have to run any model, just go to the "simulation perspective" by choosing an experiment. 
Hello, I find it quite simple to use the API and I appreciate the flexibility one has to handle a specific situation (e.g. I could read the first bytes of the body to check for a specific version of a file format). I find it way more interesting and flexible than the alternative `Map<Type, Function>`.  However, I am not convinced of the _call the next_ strategy. It means a programming mistake in one parser could prevent the ones following in the list to be executed. I personally think this should be a responsibility of the underlying infrastructure (e.g. the parser could return an `Optional<Object>`: `Optional.of(...)` if the parser can handle the request and `Optional.none()` otherwise).  What are your thoughts on that?

Sure. When you launch an SL model in console mode, one of the modules gets set as the default. This is the one that you can operations on directly. There is no way to control what module gets set. There must be some rule for it (maybe it's the last to be edited?).  After launching the console, this default module can be changed using `default [module name]`. This feature would add a selection box (similar to the one for entry point launch configurations) to select the default module.

But it does know that the token has expired. That's why it's getting a new token.  And anyway -- why should it be normal to include (token) credentials in a token request? Only someone with a key should be able to get a token, which means either an unsigned token request done with basic auth, or a signed token request with no auth -- realtime rejects unsigned token requests done with bearer auth anyway, even if the token is valid. (At least, it should. If not then that's a security hole). So at no time does it make sense to send token credentials with a token request, surely

Yes you are right it tries to read from this file `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp/temp1_input` , this file is present but the weird part is that it is actually throwing `an invalid argument exception` when it reads the file.

Seems not. The problem is even more than that. No CDN-related logic is activated at all, which is typically a build problem.
One of the pitfalls that might come up is, that some action are multiselection-able and some are not. So for instance "Rename" makes no sense really if you select 10 projects. Actually a lot of actions that are followed by a dialog are things you probably dont want for multiselection. So that might lead to a concept where you need to annotate your actions whether they can be executed with multiple nodes selected and change the right-click popup menu accordingly.

Find indices for given deletion action 2. set index block write = false 3. delete by query 4. set index block write = true 5. _optimize?only_expunge_deletes=true 6. system/indices/ranges/rebuild 7. done  Index after delete by query (search is working normal):  ![index 0 good](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15243394/18380373/4b1160b8-7677-11e6-8210-cae1292a3cd4.png)  Index after optimize to clear space(search is working normal): ![index 0 good after optimize](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15243394/18380380/5ca6121a-7677-11e6-8960-11016f2adf3e.png)  Index after range recalc (Search stopped working): ![index 0 bad after rebuild](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15243394/18380406/767b1898-7677-11e6-8466-64afaa160366.png)  Search query: `{   "from": 0,   "size": 150,   "query": {     "bool": {       "must": {         "match_all": {}       },       "filter": {         "bool": {           "must": {             "range": {               "timestamp": {                 "from": "2016-09-09 08:16:13.616",                 "to": "2016-09-09 08:21:13.616",                 "include_lower": true,                 "include_upper": true               }             }           }         }       }     }   },   "sort": [     {       "timestamp": {         "order": "desc"       }     }   ] }`  Index Metadata:  `{   "index_name": "graylog_16",   "begin": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",   "end": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",   "calculated_at": "2016-09-09T08:13:39.702Z",   "took_ms": 0 }`  To get some results i have to set the search range higher, when i do that i get this: `Indices used for this search: graylog_16 graylog_53`  EDIT: When i Close the index, everything works normal.

@normanmaurer I checked with below code                  SSLEngine sslEngine = client.getSslEngine(); 		socketChannel.pipeline().addFirst("handler", new SslHandler(sslEngine, false));                Future f1=sslHandler.handshakeFuture(); 		f1.addListener(new GenericFutureListener<Future<?>>() { 			 			@Override 			public void operationComplete(Future<?> future) throws Exception { 			  if(future.isSuccess()){ 				  System.out.println("Success"); 			  } 			  else{ 				  System.out.println("Failure---"); 			  } 				 			} 		} );  and i am getting Failure , so what could be the reason, how to resolve it?
Create a project with both Java and JS compilation enabled. Add a Java class. Now use the Java class from Ceylon  code. 
@hideki , actually it turned out it's not because of the size of the document. It's because canSendCompressedRequests() returns false. Sorry for the confusion. 
I don't, but see the internal bug for more data. The CI run was for the change that we pushed as https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/aae614aa45f17ad3932aec59d52d6bc7074d814d.
I can confirm that interpolated value is `null` now (as opposed to `"null"` string), however `required = true` is still not respected. In other words, I expect `MissingParameterException` if the option value was not provided, I don't expect `null`.  And to reiterate, I don't specifically want to use `defaultValue` attribute. I am looking for a way to define an option that will check explicit command line arg (`--mypath=...`) first, then check environment variable (`$MYPATH`), then fail with clear error message if neither is available (and obviously use  `--mypath=...` or `$MYPATH` value if available). Do you consider this a reasonable usecase or this isn't something picocli is meant to do? 
No problems with master branch. I can restart master and slave servers without errors.
yep, I looks like the changes in the "paging" branch solves the issue. The jar generated from there produces an output which meets the expectation. I haven't had time to run any more tests yet.
This is a standalone aka "jetty-home" setup with no customized session handling.  
I can see other players' messages and /tb tools works, but changing the userPrint value to the suggested values does not change the fact that the tools do not display messages. Also, the only plugins I'm using are the Essentials plugins, VoxelSniper, WorldEdit, Mobdisguise, and Tim the Enchanter. All of them can display text, but only essentials alters chat in any way. 
@zmaster587 Suit damage isn't always consistent. I tried the same thing, and indeed: No damage. Not at first. Then I spawned some zombie pigmen, and after getting hit a few times: ![spdmg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26017430/35314254-cbd406b4-0079-11e8-9b4a-81db98da7302.png) 
I don't remember seeing a test fail, as it gets the path based on the package where `JaegerTracer` is located:   https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/blob/master/jaeger-core/src/main/java/io/jaegertracing/internal/JaegerTracer.java#L605  It would be a good test to have, though. Ideally, it would compare the version from Gradle's `developmentVersion` with the one it gets from `jaeger.version`.

For a lot of my use cases, I need a fixed time interval between points.  Geotagging DSLR  photos is one case.  If I am stopping and starting a lot, then interpolating a position between GPS track points based on time is unreliable if there are too many seconds between points.  Currently, I need to carry a garmin GPS as well as my cell phone to collect the more detailed trail.  The screenshot below shows a geoparazzi file in blue and a garmin GPS trail in red.    ![Canyonleigh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5060805/67382297-9860e380-f5d0-11e9-894f-a14b60d8c5b9.jpg) 
@foghina  the device crashed is ASUS T00J. Since the API of the Fresco are different between 1.3.0 and 1.5, and our project originally use 1.3.0, I do not try to upgrade to latest version.  I tried to rebuild the 1.3.0 by adding the flags '-mstackrealign -mincoming-stack-boundary=4', but the output library libstatic-webp.so has nothing different in the size and the function entry, and the app still crashed when using that library. I guess that may be not the esp disalignment leaded to crash. 
How do I update to 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT? Just change the build.gradle and reload project? 
Hi Jules,  yes I expected that it will use the HPO terms associated with the OMIM id.  The error message is really confusing. It gives the impression that some files are missing. Maybe we should add a better error. Like: Please insert HPO terms for method phenix.  Or convert the OMIM-ID to HPO-terms.  
I use GfTextureView and it works fine.But I still hope to use imageview because I don't want to use different weight in listview item. Thanks a lot.
Yeah good call - if we convert everything to YML first, hopefully it should parse out any comments for us.
15.9, although iirc it might've been the same for 15.10 as I had tried to test it in my own personal and more updated modpack.
https://youtu.be/Rxq_-7udx8g  i was trying to say that after the main settings page having those three options (general, analytics and ui), the back key should take one to the files view. but instead it returns to the previous pages i had opened under the settings.
I'll test it with just Ender IO installed and see if it still happens.  Steps for reproducing are: 1. Place Item Conduits next to two machines 2. Place Ender Energy Conduits in the same space as the item conduits 3. Change the settings of one of the conduit connections to he machines 4. Copy settings from the changed conduit face 5. Paste the settings to the second conduit face
Sorry, It took me a while to get the data to launch another mining mission. I launched a mining mission under 1.1.14b and it was not pretty as it caused a server tick and corrupted my world. I launched a backup and upgraded to 1.1.15 and it duplicated the mining ship on the first world load, but was good after that. I launched a mining mission without an issue. I did take me several attempts to get the observatory to show the second tab (breaking and replacing different blocks). For your reference, attached is the crash log for the server tick.  Keep up the great work!!! [crash-2017-04-11_10.46.22-server.txt](https://github.com/zmaster587/AdvancedRocketry/files/916543/crash-2017-04-11_10.46.22-server.txt) 
doesn't batfish_build_all do that?
Current version from the Play Store; I know the log is normal, I just gave it for context so that you'd know where the HTTP handler craps out.  There's no locale or user mismatch that I can tell, both are running UTF-8 and I've got nothing fancy in my username or password, lest an angle bracket (<) proves to be an issue.

Thank you for your quickly response.  Yes, I used forcehybrid to generate the app.  I have tried to use the same code of the example and it has the same error.  This is my code:    
@tterrag1098  I am running this version here http://ci.tterrag.com/job/EnderIO/352/  I really wish there was a error in the console or something so I could help you better man . There is not though , but I will post a screen shot of what I am talking about if you want me to .  Also I had a dense me conduit connecting directly from a controller to 9 molecular assembler , and on every restart of MC I have to break the whole line and replace it too .  DO NOT read below unless you have time . I don't want to wast your time it is nothing dealing with this .  Also man I know off topic , but are you the guy that makes tppi tweaks ?  If so the latest version does not work with all the latest mods . I would love to make a mod pack with that mod for 1.7.10 , because it always has seemed to balance a mod pack out . I used it in 1.6.4 , and loved it . Also I love that everyone that plays the same mod pack can talk to each other. Do you have plans on making a irc mod alone ? I know there is ericirc mod , but I don't know how to go about using that mod to let all people playing the same pack chat with each other with out renting a server .   I used to pay $200 a month for a killer server with dual xeon e5 2697 48gb ram and 3 400gb intel ssds in raid 0 along with 2x4tb drives in raid 1 backup for a spigot mc server that always had 100+ players on it , and a few websites for personal use that I built and sold gaming PCs on, but times got hard , and I could not afford it anymore . 
I don't think it's a OS/Server issue - I'm using tomcat 7.0.27 with 10GB ram, nio configured to 1000 connections, windows server 2008 x64.  I do share resources - if for example a user is conencted to 2 different channels, instead creating 2 resources I create 1 and share it (I don't want the client to have 2 streaming connections.)  What effect will it have if I remove the synchronization? 
Well this is quite peculiar, I set it back up the exact way it was before and no crash now. Below is how it was set up though. Not sure the difference between hooking it up today and hooking it up 3 days ago though. _shrug_  The connection with the transfer pipe was accidental and I didn't mean for it to connect but failed to see it when I first placed the transceiver down  ![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5308389/1323508/28664214-3484-11e3-84f4-d298d0565aa8.png) 
I've posted two versions of a test stream, one where the media segments have a 'tfdt' box, and one where they don't.  With 'tfdt': http://www.bok.net/tmp/dash/smooth_tfdt/stream.ism/Manifest  Without 'tfdt': http://www.bok.net/tmp/dash/smooth_no_tfdt/stream.ism/Manifest  The effects are pretty obvious with the demo ExoPlayer example: the video will freeze every few seconds for the 'tfdt' version.  
I am using plugin version 1.4.2 in cordova 5.3.3.  I have checked  each scenario by removing all the plugin etc. Today, I also have tested it to create separate new fresh app and installed the plugin in both apps. The same issue occurs if we try to install both apps in the same device.  
Yes, The Berkley Database. When the web application crashes for any reason if you try to deploy another war (for example with a fix), you need to restart the Web Application Server (in my case) as the database stays locked. Maybe using the ServletContextListener (when the application or servlet gets destroyed, undeployed....) the database can be unlocked before that.  Is a very small improvement in the code but should be a few lines of code, will some research on this and post the results 
It needed a complete server reboot, a BattleArena config reload causes it to break. 
I will update, deploy and check. If it hapoens again I will provide the dump  Thanks.
Hi, okay I understand, this makes sense. Thank your for this explanation...  Looking forward to remove those error lines as it pollutes a little bit those useful logs ;-) 
The dialog does appear and is disposed. The issue occurs on the second or third dialog created by the test class. Add a breakpoint and the issue goes away. Add the code above in onTearDown and it seems to go away too - so it would appear to be a timing issue (I'm guessing something uses a class finaliser in swing - so what we expect to be disposed may not be yet ... maybe adding the second cleanup causes it to be synchronised). It's very odd and is repeatable on both linux and windows 8.1, so the issue is in the java rather than the native libraries. 
Google Play Services 10.0.84 (440-137749526)
Sure, test device API 4.4.2, whenever I click to edit title or description it gives me: ![npe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3127881/36339965-aa35fd3e-13e1-11e8-8bc9-b3ab8d976b4f.png) NPE on line 232 of SingleUploadFragment.java 
That's the symptoms exactly, maybe it's only other crashes and softlocks that causes it. Let me do a bit more reproduction testing. Notably, when I restart the game, I end up at my bed, so the teleport completes before the crash. Somehow.

I made a simple test db first containing elements with one-letter text   only (like <p>x A x B x C x</p>).  For real data, i.e., with text   containing real words, indexed and stemmed (German), the phenomena   occur.  You could try the attached file and these queries:  for $i in //*[text() contains text ("Mühle Teufel" any word) ftand  "und"] return $i  for $i in //*[text() contains text ("Mühle" ftor "Teufel") ftand  "und"] return $i  The strange behavior of ftand and all words I noticed some weeks ago   and therefore switched to ftand instead of all words.  But then I got   stuck with ftor.  Maybe this is also related to issue  https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex/issues/359 
Only deleted files. New copied files are scanned correctly.
  Yes, looks like it is because of `@EqualsAndHashCode`, shouldn't it compare if the objects is the same using `==` instead of `equals()`?

Good point.   Well, I intercept only "my code" (in "my packages"), not the code from Groovy itself. "My code" does then the calls to Groovy, which are not intercepted.  The `.ignoreMethods(isGroovyMethod())` didn't work for me here in this case...   Hmmm... 
I've sent via email. 
I suspect this was mostly related to a permission problem, it resolved using the solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076893/get-neo4j-version-from-dump)
I would say two arrays are equal if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order.
No, i have enabled 
Yes, adding @Introspected to TokenFormData resolves the issue.
Assuming this already is the intended behaviour, we should see whether what @tmgodinho found is a bug in this part of the system. 
Yeah. Here's the arrangement that causes this error the most. (along with all its parts) https://www.dropbox.com/s/9whb3do1fy0p9kb/rubicon.rar?dl=0 It's not the only case where this happens but it _is_ the most common example of it. 
Hi @davidecaroselli   thanks for the quick reply. I pulled the latest version and the translation seems to work fine. But there is still an issue with the output:  original trans-units: 
Found the problem: in my manifest  android:hardwareAccelerated="false" 
Yes, this is 1.5. Looks like things were reworked in 2.0. I don't know if our project could migrate to 2.0 immediately.
we have a POM called `grails-dependencies` that basically is just used to refer to other dependencies. When this is declared as a dependency in the app, the POM is included in the built JARs `lib` directory.  I don't understand how this can be "pilot error", it is quite common practise in Maven to publish just a POM that includes the necessary dependencies without publishing an associated JAR file. 
I've seen the zero key missing in the Kindle HD 7 emulator; I am not sure of which Kindle model the other complaints came from - I know the Kindle series have both Android 2.3 and Android 4.0-based tablets. 
I'm now registering log the following way:  
Hi Jesse,  Thanks for your reply. I'm not sure if I've done this correctly, but it seems curl can cope with the server responding early with a 403.    Note that I changed the URLs and truncated the request body shown here, ... standing for the zeros I generated. The entire conversation is 147770 bytes long, so since the input is 10485760 bytes I can assume that we got truncated early and could not stream out the full body.  Cheers, Fabs 
Don't worry, I'll build from source=) Cheers!
There was no exception in the log. It didn't even show up under the correct log level.  Swift installier is a theme installer comparable to substratum and paid. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brit.swiftinstaller
Oh no, it seems to be a heisenbug: putting a breakpoint has caused it to work :-(
@eivantsov Thanks, I'll try with more RAM.  I had given it 1GB to start, but I'm wondering if that was maybe not enough.

@luacs1998 Still crashing, there's the log: https://pastebin.com/45ZqLJML  EDIT: Actually it was another mod which caused this and I fixed it with using Sponge Bootstrap.
Not using a mac. 
I found out that the finish line had to have a vertical plane rather than just horizontal.  I will still find out the problem with the random teleportation.  Also is there a release date for the update?
There is no way, to my knowledge, as each mod can add their own drops, at their own percentage chance, without telling anyone else about it. Enough Resources, I think just hardcodes the loot and the chance.  It can also use the new json based loot tables, however this is new and not all mods use it.  This is the one thing I didn't want to do as I wanted it to work with mods as you added/removed them. 
Catching it in debugger and evaluating request.getRemoteAddress() returned null.  Additionally, patternList is initialized to a single pattern of "0.0.0.0" although I haven't setup any ip-patterns in application settings.   Perhaps IpPatternsRule should be conditional on existence of micronaut.security.ip-patterns?  I don't see any reason for it intercepting requests if not explicitly configured.  All requests are localhost to localhost. Most are ok, while small percentage result in NPE.

@apetkau Thank you very much for the timely response.   WRT: `confil`; at the moment, you can install it using `conda install -c thoba confil ` or by adding the channel `https://conda.anaconda.org/thoba` to `galaxy.yml`. `confil` depends on `kraken2` which can be computationally expensive when testing locally.   I will also remove the tool and try re-build and test against Galaxy version 19.01.
This problem usually happens to me in any video. is the picture that is on the screen before giving play to watch the video
You have to swap the item in your character inventory with shift click from the tool bar. I deleted the mod but I'll reinstall and show.
Sorry for the late answer.  I'm on DB2, but it looks like you could reproduce it!  Thanks for the extremly fast reaction and your good product!!!
We have an existing implementation of a button in Table, which opens a Window in order to present a list of options available to the user. The window opens right beneath the button. With current information from RendererClickEvent  I can only get the position where the mouse click occured, not the absolute position of the button.  But I have seen that with vaadin 8.1 it will be possible to render components in Grid, so I think I will wait for that feature.
I don't see that option anywhere? 
I've tried it with a super simple AIDL / Service sample and can't repro. So it must be something relatively specific. I will try and create a very simple project with nothing but the Service I am using. Versions are:  
Ill test it right now for you

hello, yeah I noticed this when I moved up to 2.x   so do you think we are making this back to public ?
Seems as if disabling the world guard check works. Worldguard version is 6.1

hi Aquiles, I will provide new sources right after I have them hopefully within a couple of days, should I notify you anyhow then? 
I am aware of it now that I've discussed it with people, but I would like to have this information in the documentation somewhere, maybe https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/polymer-templates/tutorial-template-components-in-slot.html
I'm at 3.1.3. I'll re-check after the next releasse. 
Ah, it's fairly simple actually. See, while testing I figured out that pretty much all passive coolers have far, far too little cooling to be useful in such a large reactor, and most of the actives weren't great either. However, the default cooling value for glowstone is five times as high as the next-highest liquid, 80,000 for glowstone vs 16,000 for liquid helium. So, I made a sort of cascading grid layout, and filled the entire reactor volume with it.  ![2017-12-10_16 34 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16315400/33809675-9c67d88e-ddc8-11e7-9101-531ee0a3df79.png) ![2017-12-10_16 33 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16315400/33809676-9fb52aa0-ddc8-11e7-8f2f-d41897d6f08d.png)  Anything with heat production much higher than Thorium produced far too much heat, but thorium oxide is just about right, and really efficient as well.  I haven't tried turning it on since the fix went out, so I'm not sure how much glowstone it'll require, but I think I'll manage. At worst, I might have to set up a dedicated ET void miner for it. 
Thanks for the follow-up and questions.  Before deciding how the TCCL should be used - it would be useful (to me anyway) to understand why it was introduced in the first-place, especially for the logging-case.  Is there any brief write-up (other than in the following linked issues)?  History: `FeatureDetector` and `ClassUtils.isPresent` first learnt to be passed a `ClassLoader` in https://github.com/flyway/flyway/commit/8c800dfcb954840d52ab7c6c271e049162c301a7 and it seems issues #626 and #696 were drivers.  Before that the normal classloader was used.  I figured logging in Flyway code (and location/configuration of logging-apis) would be mostly an internal-affair, but I do notice that at one point logging was moved from the internal to public API - maybe to support extension and plugins (I'm not familiar-enough with Flyway to know)?  Note that `LogCreator` and all of `LogFactory` is static.  If it is allowed to be deployed to a shared-classloader and called by multiple applications/modules with their context-classloaders, we could end-up with a race where the first-caller to `getLog` brings their available logging-API.  So in-summary, I'm interested in knowing what the TCCL provides here.  Maybe it is access to resource configuration-files for the logging API that only exist in the child/context classloader.  Just seems like for something as fundamental as logging, Flyway should be self-sufficient within its own classloader.
That's pretty perfect to be honest! Thanks for the good work! 
Thanks for taking a look at this.  Been banging my head on it for a bit.  Your screen shot shows that the browser accessed localhost:8080/elda/def/foo/bar/1.  The failure condition arises when you dereference the actual URI in the data.  Try pointing the browser at  http://example.org/def/foo/bar/1.  See the second bullet in the list of ways that does work.  If you don't want to mess with your hosts file and ports, you might try modifying the data so that the data is:   http://localhost:8080/elda/def/foo/bar/1 skos:inScheme http://localhost:8080/elda/def/foo/bar .  Though that is not how I've been seeing it happen.  If that doesn't trigger it for you, then I can try to mirror your setup.  They symptoms of the loop are: - Tomcat at > 100% cpu utilization for many minutes - fan gets loud - no stack trace - have to kill tomcat to recover - Elda logging says its about to render the result and then it heads of to never never land  I have an apache front end proxying to Elda in Tomcat7 on Ubuntu 14.04.  Have had it fail on Elda 1.3.3 and 1.3.4.  My environment is a bit unusual - I'm using docker so that could introduce an issue.  If it doesn't reproduce for you, I can try it in VM instead.    Note the XSLT renderer is working.  The Velocity renderer is working with  the .html extension and other access URI patterns. 
I have logged-out from c:geo. Then I logged-in and I have click to "Check authorisation" ...  And now it is correct.  Thank you very much for help. And I am sorry for this issue. 😆
@philwebb @dsyer is right ...   First we are using spring-boot-cli 1.0.2.RELEASE. With this version we are unable to start a compiled application, too. The "Start-Class"  attribute could not be read from the manifest. So we switched to 1.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.  With this version the compiled application works fine. The script version did not work with 1.0.2.RELEASE and 1.1.0.BUILD-SNAPHOT.  following example was used:

Nope, no solution so far.  As a workaround I've resorted to using edbg(https://github.com/etnt/edbg) at work for Erlang code.  Not tried it with Elixir so far though.

It's against the Benchmark. Pretty simple. Launch ZAP, paste in benchmark home page URL, hit attack, immediately hit Stop.  It did this to me 2-3 times in a row.

Well over 100, which makes it all the weirder,

Nope it did not work. I was looking at already scanned block and did not showed any Aspects. havent checked the Aura nodes. 
@rexim Given the simple purpose of the reputation (as I explained in the description), the whole mechanism you are describing is rather pointless... so far, users just need to learn the platform, period. Do you see it as a realistic representation for something else? I really don't.
I am using `JobManager` but I have encounter strange behaviour in my application where periodic persisted job which was at first scheduled with interval A(2 minutes) and then rescheduled to interval B(10 minutes) was launching with both intervals. In android-job database I have found only one job with matching tag and interval matching B. After that I have called `JobScheduler` directly from debugger and found out that there is second job with same tag but old interval A.  But this is beside my point which is, you schedule periodic job on API 21+ with interval A which was supplied by your backend (and job id is high lets say 1000), then user clears data of your app and when he launches app he will get new interval B from server which will be again scheduled (because if I query JobManager for scheduled jobs I will get empty list), now the app will be launched by JobScheduler for both intervals because JobScheduler jobs are persisted despite the fact that all app data were purged.  Therefore if I would like to save user battery by switching retrieval of data from backend from once per 2 hours to once per 8 I could end up with even worse result which will be solved only by app uninstall. 
In last version of cordova on android 4. Es. in a for cycle to send 10 sms i want to update the state of "to send sms".  var error = function(id){ //set id message to error } var success = function (id) {  //set id message to sent } for ... sms.send(phoneNumber, message, options, success(id), error(id) ); 
Double seems like a much more logical choice for the default. I only said BigDecimal due to wondering what the expected behavior is when the value is out of range. 
Thank you, it works!
No reports from nightly users so far. But AFAIK we had less complaints in general and a better PlayStore feedback since we introduced the general concept of GooglePlayServices and the sensor work as is. Therefore I do see some risk in changing the default sensor... Maybe we should stay with the orientation and offer rotation as an option in settings (so reverse the current priority)? Could be less dangerous but still a help for users having problems (to be explained in the FAQ then). 
Ok, i write code for functions some of these days. 
Apologies for the long reply but these are taken form my notes from debugging the differences and I thought they might help you pinpoint the issue?   ---  I've further debugged the stacktrace for my app with both the old and new library versions, and with the new libraries tried my parameter type as both `LongParam` and `OptionalLong`.  Combinations tested:  1. dropwizard 1.3.16 and `LongParam` 2. dropwizard 2.0.0 and `LongParam` 3. dropwizard 2.0.0 and `OptionalLong`   My initial comment that [this line in `SingleValueExtractor`](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/blob/2.29.1/core-server/src/main/java/org/glassfish/jersey/server/internal/inject/SingleValueExtractor.java#L61) was where the error occurred was wrong:   One difference is that in 1. the [1.3.16 version of `AbstractParamConverter.fromString`](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/release/1.3.x/dropwizard-jersey/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jersey/params/AbstractParamConverterProvider.java#L49) does an explicit call to `com.google.common.base.Strings.isNullOrEmpty(value)`, and so returns `null` for empty string. This check here seems to be responsible for making it then use the default value.  This has changed in [2.0.0](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/v2.0.0/dropwizard-jersey/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jersey/params/AbstractParamConverterProvider.java) and it no longer has a check for empty string. However from the traces above it doesn't actually appear to be called called anymore - the trace for 2. calls through to `io.dropwizard.jersey.params.AbstractParamConverter<T>.fromString` instead - and there's [no empty string checking here](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/release/2.0.x/dropwizard-jersey/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jersey/params/AbstractParamConverter.java#L36) - it just blows up with the exception.   Similarly in case 3. [`io.dropwizard.jersey.optional.OptionalLongParamConverterProvider.OptionalLongParamConverter.fromString(String)`](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/release/2.0.x/dropwizard-jersey/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jersey/optional/OptionalLongParamConverterProvider.java#L30) has no explicit empty string check. The parse error results in an `OptionalLong.empty` as detailed earlier.  So there appears to be no equivalent code in 2.0.0 (at least with the rest of my config) that does this explicit empty string check for either 2. or 3. that appears needed to get it to then use the deafult value.      Does that give you any ideas what it might be or how to fix this? Or does this differ from your hellow world example if you set breakpoints and debug from here?   If not I'll take a look at trying to create a simple reproduceable for this.   ---  > I'm wondering if there might be different versions of DropWizard libraries on the classpath.  I've checked the gradle build scan for my application and all dropwizard dependencies are at 2.0.0 (for test 2. and 3.).

I think it found out what the problem is ... the current implementation does not support multicast or multiple responses.  Once one of the multicast response is received by the client, the client simply ignores all other responses due to the same values of the MID and the token.

Yes, that's exactly it. Something like "Removed 17,500 old storage entries from the database". I can get my exact logs for you if you want.  I did go into settings and shut off the "archive old data" since these lines of text really make no dent in the storage, so no reason to erase data from players who have not played in a while. But that did not make a difference with this.  Any way to stop this from happening? It would be a HUGE help to us and finally solve our headache of players never having their times.

I'm completely new to TLA and I only downloaded the toolbox and moved it from Downloads to another directory and started the toolbox using the command line.

Yes, your summary sounds correct.  The add fails to show the validation summary (above the tabs), but does show the inline validation messages.  However, the edit shows both, the inline messages and the validation summary.  I debugged and saw that in both cases the BindingResult had the validation errors contained in it, but for some reason the modal view does not render them. 
Again, the mod is checking permissions, I even posted 3 ways one item on project e tests for permissions before breaking a block. As for the plugin to cancel the drop, considering this has happened with 3 different protection plugins, I'm only going to assume this is a sponge bug.  I wish you would read what I've already put in the first post before asking that.

Hi  @dennisoelkers. I don't think so. It does get appended to other commands like webpack and generally they run fine I'd say. Here is another excerpt, the failure in this is due to something else I think, considering the circumstances. It was working before(tm), minus the tests. The problem with checkProductionBuild is more like a side show event I wanted to get out of the equation.    In terms of enviroment configuration, I have set HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY as well as FTP_PROXY (and again in lowercase, because some things like them uppercase, other lowercase) in the /etc/enviroment. Additionally I added a proxy entry to /etc/maven/settings.xml.

Yes it seems to occur every time for me.
You're correct. I must have checked our latest development build and we have switched to a newer build and from All to Core.  Looks like our old version was using `2.4.6`. So when we release this new build that uses 2.5.3 Core we won't have the issue?

@lognaturel  Yes only primary instance (from Survey Sheet) should be counted  in the google spreadsheet column as they are actual  determiners for the answer we require. 
a side note that shouldn't really matter is that it was in the nether, it was basaltic magma from primal core, i read it wrong ;) however the blocks that are broken in the pack do not "contain monster eggs" they are nether blocks. they do not spawn from the block like monster eggs would. i do not know what mod adds it, my guess is primal core, nether ex or cyclic. seeing how silverfish from monster egg spawns on the block broken and not the breaker.serched for the mods that added add the hellfish and silverfish in the nether. and came across this:  "NEVER quarry nether when you're using nether ore mod if you don't tweak the hellfish config, it will break your server. " so apparently someone else has had the same issue.
Thanks for providing the screenshots poma.

Hello, You can see the accurate input I'm providing in the gif and you can see the behavioural response from the LSP.  I was trying to get it to auto-complete my inputs.

It's a 16 core CPU (c4.4xlarge). I think it was one of the recent syncronization changes to org.bytedeco.javacpp.Pointer.java (https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/commits/d666a119cf858e0df663e486c08973d19bcb670b/src/main/java/org/bytedeco/javacpp/Pointer.java) which leads to the problem.  Down grading to 1.23 (the sync stuff appears to be 1.24) seemed to resolve the problem.  The problem maybe in that code instead of DL4J.  The performance problem comes from the lock serialization, reducing parallelization rather than from a more 'traditional' performance problem. 
Thanks for replying. We have the plugin configured in the `build` and `reporting` elements. The project has around 45 modules.  We have it within the `build` element to fail the build to fail the build when `failBuildOnCVSS` is >= 7.     What we do is run the build on a schedule overnight. If the build fails we generate the report separately and send it as an attachment in an email so we're notified if our software has a vulnerability.  Maybe we have configured it wrong?
@martinlippert Sorry, this problem has not been solved. The most intuitive feeling I get from performance problems is that they are caused by compilation (win10 processes often go into a state of suspended animation), which may only need to solve the compilation problems introduced by JAVA9 modules. Perhaps it was a compilation problem, and I was also in a state of suspended animation when I used the prompt in the springboot project application.yml file.I apologize for not being able to provide a sample project for this.
Running a quick test, not only can I confirm that I'm not calling the global registry to create an NPC, I'm [not calling the global registry _in my entire project_](https://i.imgur.com/kFFtBar.png).  The NPC is created within an `NpcController` abstract class which is shared amongst all my NPCs. The only difference between the type of NPC which is being saved to `saves.yml` and the others is that I'm using pathing for this kind.  **Creation in `NpcController`:**   Note that GuardConfig is entirely separate from NPCs. All I'm pulling from it is the predefined path for the NPCs to follow. Perhaps not the most elegant solution, but certainly nothing (that I can think of) which should be making any saves to the global configuration.  EDIT: To clarify again, GuardConfig is something stored elsewhere in the project. It's not something to do with NPCs that I've merely renamed.
Yes, appears to be fixed. 
Yes, it supports NMEA, outputting various versions of it, currently set as 4.1 version. Do you want an NMEA output log?

I also ran `./Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse -clean` after the re-installation.   Hope this helps. What other details would you like to know?

Either outcome still means we can't currently communicate from Zom Android with Zom iOS. If you aren't going to support legacy anymore, then we need to upgrade Zom iOS to not use legacy likely. Or am I confused about how legacy vs new work? Is there a query/handshake process of some sort?

I sent the report, but with no notes because there right here. 
Ok, I tried to simplify my example as much as possible. https://github.com/hsestupin/quasar-galaxy-issue  So I've initialized FlightRecorder and we can see what happens. You can run example the same way:    The code in **Example1** class do the following: - create **MyActor** and spawns it - register actor in **GalaxyGlobalActorRegistry** - get global ref by **co.paralleluniverse.actors.ActorRegistry#getActor(java.lang.String)** - send local ref of actor to the his global ref  Actually I don't think the use-case described above is somehow undesirable for quasar-actor system, doesn't it? It seems like its pretty ok to pass actor-refs to each other. 
Thanks @sladkoff! I'm fairly new to paper, but I believe it's a fork of Bukkit, so it should be fairly similar to that. Thanks for taking a look!
@macdonst you refer to the payload sent to FCM or the payload received by the plugin?
Yes, it works again. Thanks!

@digitalgust There are some plans regarding debugging, but nothing concrete yet.  If you or anybody wants to help take a look at the ShadowFrames implementation: C-Function: https://github.com/MobiDevelop/robovm/blob/master/compiler/vm/core/src/shadowframes.c Java Compiler Plugin: https://github.com/MobiDevelop/robovm/blob/master/compiler/compiler/src/main/java/org/robovm/compiler/plugin/shadowframe/ShadowFramePlugin.java  The plan is to extend the ShadowFramePlugin to pass information about stack variables to the runtime, and store it in the ShadowFrame struct.  The Soft-Debugger which is responsible for debugging and breaking is implemented in hooks.c https://github.com/MobiDevelop/robovm/blob/master/compiler/vm/core/src/hooks.c  hooks.c implements it's own debugging protocol, on top of which a JDWP debugger has to be implemented. 
I deployed RC5 back. On RC5 there is no gray bar and it is not auto scrolling down.   I have tried both Internet Explorer and Chrome. Same behaviour.   (edit: description was vague)
That sounds like it would solve the problem. However I tend to like properties more than environment variables. This way it's easier to integrate with Jenkins and Maven, e. g. I can run a build like  > mvn clean install -Dtestcontainers.container.host=docker-machine-ip  And it doesn't pollute the build server's environment.  If such a feature is going to be integrated it may be a good idea to mark it  as experimental for some time since I am not exactly sure if it does really make sense that way. I mean: If it wasn't for the docker in docker setup, then socket->localhost, ip->someOtherHost holds true und is perfectly reasonable. The new feature may cause things to become more complicated (also more powerful) and it must be seen if similar situations do exist where it comes in handy. Maybe provisioning Jenkins Slaves with Docker or running a whole container as test would be another use case for this.

We don't this before prior 2.0.x every class had only one cluster. How there are multiply clusters per node and it doesn't seems to be working correctly. Looks like it is related to order in server list: "servers": ["nodel","node2","<NEW_NODE>"] ... but I am not sure. 
I tried re-installing but it did not help. Is the plugin writing a log? 
Thanks, works great now!
@nitaliano  
Main method is `insert`, before the insert I do full delete on the same Entity class - basically wipe/replace content of an entity. If I get some more time I try to create sample project to reproduce it - so I could share it.

After testing by trying to download random songs, it seems to work for most of the songs on soundcloud except for the ones I actually want to download lol.
Doesn't look like it, but I can't be sure. The reason this fails, is because of the change of the scope of the closure, which binds it to the prophecy object instead of the test object, causing "static" to be pointed at something else. This is behavior you cannot predict and you can't resolve easily as it can go through many layers of abstraction.  Personally I would simply turn this particular check off if it's in a closure that's not directly used within the same scope.

@geoand Sorry, this is **test** mode of course. I update my issue.
I am running `Ubuntu 16.04` and `CTRL+F CTRL+A` seems to work fine. Could be a nice workaround, indeed. But, still, the default behaviour looks like when you open a new google page it shows the previous query in the search box. :-)
This occurs for me when I open Intellij on a project directory for the first time, if I haven't run the following commands.    So my best guess is that ghc-mod is the source of the issue, but it would be nice to have Intellij catch the abnormal status as opposed to hanging. 
Using EnderIO 2.2.6.317 and Forge 1277, and v1.14 of Ex Astris (which has this method incorrectly returning null in the Auto Hammer). Hoppers, transfer pipes etc will not insert, but EnderIO conduits will.  What I expect (admittedly without searching too deeply) is that the conduit is checking canInsertItem, but not isItemValidForSlot (as this is what I was doing in Ex Astris).  It actually appears as though the Filing Cabinet thing is not the fault of EnderIO, so ignore that one. 
I'll give it a try.

In my scenario keycloak uses Active Directory / LDAP as identity provider. That's why disabling registration (controlling permissions via authentication) won't work.   The ideal flow would be something like this:  1. User logs in to keycloak with his already exisisting AD account 2. User gets a permission denied error when accessing che 3. Administrator adds keycloak-role "che-user" to the user's account in keycloak 4. User is able to access che

@ronblum After spending some more time on this, I noticed the following more straightforward example better reflects on the issue. Please go through the following steps to reproduce the issue:  - Run the following code:   It will create a data frame where the type of the first column is logical, and the type of the remaining columns is double.  - Adjust indices of columns to see only Columns 50-51 (A total of two columns). Then apply "Filter". You will notice that the type of Column 50 (the first column in the new two-column display) will be Logical, while it should be double.
Thanks for the quick response. I'm running on the Virgo OSGi container. I will give it a try today and let you know.   Thanks again. Ron 
Indeed I do, moving it back to its normal position seems to fix it. I've had it snapped to the bottom-right snapbox

When the program is running, it is not starting. 
I now tried many different shows from different channels in all qualities. I couldn't download any of them.  When clicking on the link nothing happens, meaning there is neither an exception nor a download notification. Clicking on the share button besides the download button, works without an issue.  I'm using the microG version of LineageOS, so Google services are replaced by open source microG libraries. Don't know if this could have something todo with the problem, but I doubt it.

Everyone know that i run only under XP, it's as say that the sky is blue, IMO. 
You didn't change the netty dependency though? So the change from @normanmaurer is not included yet?
You can see the failed executions there. However, you can try any instance yourself. Just try debug from, it fails. 
Here you go. ![2018-02-21_18 30 34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30223331/36511637-599d5d0a-175f-11e8-907e-770c259cc5b9.png) 
After running the "clean" scenario, it has been successfully built! Wow!  And another newbie question here, don't know where to ask elsewhere, please: Is it hard to make it run with `minSdkVersion 25`?
Thanks for your reply. No there is no snackbar.

This happened at the end of an 8-hours running pipeline, so I hadn't had a chance to reproduce this much. What is reproducible without problem is that when multiple threads are used, it takes a few minutes to proceed after the files are downloaded, as indicated in the log. Pipeline to reproduce this is [here](https://github.com/linkedpipes/etl/files/1116974/HTTP.GET.list.test.multithreading.jsonld.zip). 
SonarQube 4.5.2, plugin 0.3.3 
No, this is on a server side only. I do not have the client side mod installed either for "increased visuals".   It was odd for sure and its definitely reproducible. Here's the error from my client, no server error reported.  http://pastebin.com/chMGMnAJ  This is done on any attempt to remove a friend and only then. Does for all players.  
At least very similar. I will take another trace when the error occurs.
Yes, the steps are only:  1. Go to hidden apps setting 2. Check an app 3. Press android back button 4. Return to hidden apps setting to discover check mark missing  Also, a couple of times I checked an app and scrolled down to check more, and when I scrolled back up the checks were missing.   Edit: not sure if changing any default settings affects this.   I have:  1) icons turned off 2) tap to open app drawer off 3) persistent pinned apps on scroll turned on.   Edit 2: to clarify, any apps I hide individually from the app drawer stay checked in the hidden apps setting. Only ones I check from the setting ever disappear. 
Hi @maxieds  I've performed some small tests. Your app crashes when screen rotates - so i need to turn off screen rotation before usage. Logged 3 different connections and like the output of your log-export.

@joakime thanks for the response. The Content-Length is provided and is the correct size. The Content-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding headers are not set.  The POST is coming from Apache NiFi (which is also where the server is running). The POST is happening via the OkHttp client. Not sure exactly what you mean by "How is the POST provided"?  I am not calling `baseRequest.setHandled(true);` - is that something that needs to happen? What does the method do (aside from the obvious setting of _handled = true? Should this be called before or after reading from the InputStream? The JavaDocs for this method simply indicate `/* ------------------------------------------------------------ */`
All my tests were successful. Thanks for fixing it!

Running ubuntu 15.04 with java 8.  Still the same issue. Test model :    Output :  ![capture du 2016-01-27 14 20 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/807703/12614581/21b136d0-c501-11e5-87db-9dac1f70b572.png)  But we can still view the content of the other monitors by clicking where the arrow should be : ![capture du 2016-01-27 14 21 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/807703/12614633/714fc2ce-c501-11e5-9818-db3d9fed7ca9.png)  Note that same bug appears when adding a new monitor from the interface :  ![capture du 2016-01-27 14 22 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/807703/12614620/629667b0-c501-11e5-941c-f864bf49eab6.png)  PS : Note that since this bug report, the values of the monitors, that still could be seen (cf.second screenshot of the first post), are now hidden too. 
Setting `use-scoreboards: false` allows the health to be shown over the players' heads. So definitely a help to the healers.  It's a trade-off though, since many players love to see that scoreboard on the side showing waves and kills.  Maybe eventually showing both could be filed under "feature requests".   Love the plugin. In the mob-fighting genre, yours is the best!
Thanks for proposing this solution. Since I'm already preparing the release, to simplify the workflow I can apply your suggested change myself.   But perhaps it is a non-final workaround in that these scripts are not really tests, so I can imagine someone moving them back some day and causing another Maven deployment failure. I'll add some comments into the scripts themselves to explain why they're located where they are.
@GaneshSPatil - Here`completed`, `failed` or `cancelled` are job results.  > Add one more state (e.g. Done or finalized ) in JobState  This should be a state of the job regardless of what is the result.
It's fixed in the weekly releases: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Downloads#zap-weekly
F5 didn't help gettin Git menu. I've redone the process of creating a new project :  - New project - Ready to go stack - PHP stack - sample PHP project (leave everything as default) - Still no Git menu  During project/workspace creation I got everything fine except the following error (twice then the project is done creating)    I want to use my own GitLab server and don't want to connect with GitHub, are Git tasks linked to GitHub ? 
A user of this library might rely on `configuration.isNamespaceCleanupEnabled()` in order to cleanup their own stuff.  We were using our own flag to control this behavior, but we dropped it in favor of using arq-cube one. It doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel for such behavior.  So, we create our stuff and, in the end, we check for that flag to decide whether or not to cleanup the stuff we created.  The problem is that by default, that flag is set to `false` on arq-cube (given `DestroyNamespace` is true by default), which is semantically wrong, since its meaning is: "Should we cleanup stuff after the tests run?".  The fact the the whole namespace is going to be destroyed at the end of the suite should not affect the fact we should cleanup the stuff we created.  Example of workflow: 1. Test1 runs and creates, say, a BuildConfig named "build" 1. Test1 finishes, but we don't delete the BuildConfig above because `configuration.isNamespaceCleanupEnabled()` returned false 1. Test2 starts but fails because it also creates a BuildConfig named "build". (duplicated resource) 1. Test suite ends, namespace is cleaned up.  Note the broken behavior on step 3 above. With my patch this is fixed, because it makes configuration less subjective.

I'm using an Oppo Find 7 running ColorOS 2.0.6i which is KitKat based. I do not have this kind of playback problems with BeyondPod or Podkicker. It's like the file is damaged somehow but I think it's something else disrurbing playback. The choppy part is very small, probably less than a second and happens on all downloaded podcasts. 
Sorry for the late response. What we have is the .spacerRight() mixin defined as  `.spacerRight() { margin-right: @size-xs; }` but when we use it as  `.spacerRight` what we get is: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1915825/30422516-766da5ae-9940-11e7-9d24-1863359154fa.png)  I hope this is helpful
@hazeliao yeah sure, I appreciate the help. If more information is required let me know.
> This sounds like jvm bug and not something we can or should be fixing. What if you try with JRE 8? That is the officially supported version  Thanks for the reply, and adding the jvm label. I really wasn't sure where to put this...  I now changed my default java configuration to `java-8-openjdk-amd64` but the issue still persists, exactly as before.
Yes, INSPIRE thesaurus are added in admin page. As I said same .war with same database is working ok in linux. I am just using linux for developing now. 
Fix looks good! Thanks for addressing this so quickly.
Yes, this issue occurs after registerering a single nested query. The attached pictures show results after execution of about 300 000 search requests (percolate queries). 
Ok I have tested and it seems a different mod is interfering with it. not sure which one. If i discover which one I can let you know.
Sorry, just saw your reply. I'm very forgetful when it comes to these tickets.  I'm running the test again now on both my local and main server. It shouldn't be the chunkloading limit, as it was on my freshly-generated local server with only me on. 
> @daniloercoli do you know, when you tested on a real device, if the rate of typing had any effect on whether you encountered this issue, i.e. did this only occur when typing fast?  Interesting consideration. I had reproduced the problem several times on a real device, Nexus 5 with Android 7 attached to AS. I also remember that I was able to reproduce the same problem on a Samsung S9 (Android 9) attached to AS. Would you mind to test on a real device, and see it the problem happens?  Let me know, otherwise  I can try do replicate the issue on Monday.
I tried it with the newest one. I also attached my `sessionInfo()`:    <sup>Created on 2019-05-05 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.2.1)</sup>
Workarround: I edited the script 'zap.sh' in   '/Applications/OWASP ZAP.app/Contents/Java'.  I disabled line 20 till 25. On these lines a check is done on the system default java interpreter. See code:   
Fixed
I am still slightly confused as to why the breakpoint I set did not hit  As it happens (and I don't expect anyone else to) I have my own tile server.   The differences showing the maplink stuff ![mykonos1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/861631/55570120-ae718a00-56fa-11e9-8976-2fdf5bbd6cfb.gif) and ![mykonos2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/861631/55570141-b92c1f00-56fa-11e9-80cf-2d7e7f4bc98f.gif)  so relatively minor - its just I like to see as little difference between xowa and mediawiki (it could just be text and no link)
`mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -Dsmallrye-open-api.version=1.1.7 -X` gives  
Lineage os 14.1,newpipe seens to be the only app causing this issue (ive tried changing my system animations but it didn't fix it)
@Wortho27 see above.
No, I just add a simple println for testing purpose (body modification of an existing inner class). I go the same NPE for all inner class and for the class itself (Test, Test$1, Test$2...). I just notice that event if I set output directory for all my module in IntelliJ to "C:/out", Intellij creates one folder per module inside. My out directory looks like this: > C:/out/module1/com/example/SomeClass.class C:/out/module2/com/example2/OtherClass.class  Is it a problem ? Maybe the hierarchy should start directly at "com/...." inside the "out" directory ?  For more, I pulled the repo. I noticed that in [PluginClassFileTransformer:88](https://github.com/HotswapProjects/HotswapAgent/blob/master/hotswap-agent-core/src/main/java/org/hotswap/agent/annotation/handler/PluginClassFileTransformer.java#L88), you get the PluginConfiguration from the ClassLoader. The given ClassLoader is an instance of **org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.EquinoxClassLoader** and I have 2 ClassLoader as a key of the _classLoaderConfigurations_ map in the PluginManager : - **org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main$StartupClassLoader** - **sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader**.  I don't know if this information can help you.
Tobias,  it does. But the application has an exception. So I am wondering whether the application correctly interprets the state that the phone is in. I will test things if needed, just need a hint on what should be tested.   (The #3569 seems to share the same symptoms.)
Here's an example https://gist.github.com/holgerbrandl/4517fed2594e38945d0951958744ce6e  To reproduce 1. Open the document and move the caret to the very end ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200952/52149912-9df75180-266e-11e9-9555-1c537d2b53ff.png)  2. Double click on `Foo` in the structure view. The editor scrolls and puts the caret at the right place, but the preview does not update ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200952/52149992-db5bdf00-266e-11e9-8b7c-90744b6868f0.png)  Typically I use the simplified structure view, but it's the same there.  When doing so I just click on header elements in the structure view.  I've noticed that there is one exception: When (using the non-simplified struture and) clicking on _Unordered Lists_ and _Ordered Lists_ it updates caret **AND** preview!   My version is   and MD Navigator is on v2.7.0.  
It's overworld. superflat .redstone ready,and I also got this once at a another normal world Though I think it may has something to do with forgotton nature too. Forgotton nature seems override the worldprovider or something of overworld and didn't register it correctly. It always cause Dimention door got crashed and make Biosphere can't generate any world(if I install forgotton nature after biosphere,the exist biosphere world will not generate any new area). And sometimes it say that it can't find a spawn-biome for unknown reason.(especilly start a new myscraft dim, but didn't affect anything else) But I didn't found anything with forggon nature. So I am not sure about that. 
this is the result: 
There is no such error anymore.
Please ignore my comment regarding `onApplicationReady` - I checked it again and it works well.  Regarding `@PostConstruct`, I disagree that this is consistent behaviour. Developers expect that once a bean is initialized, all its dependent beans are initialized. Flyway is not a piece of application code - it is an infrastructure tool that helps initialize the database - I don't see a use case where you want to use the _old_ schema version in a `@PostConstruct` and then have Flyway run and change your schema.
I have netbeans set to use emacs mode.  I have customized some keys.  copy is set to ALT-W. Paste is Ctrl+Y, cut is Ctrl+w.  In nbmongo I can select a database.  I right click on a field like _id and select "copy value".   I click the "Edit" button.  Then I click on the "Criteria" text area.  Now I can hit Ctrl-Y (yank in emacs) or Ctrl-V (windows paste) and nothing happens for either one. 
In the web interface and in my desktop client everything is correct (except for the screwed up files mentioned in owncloud/core#5559). I've checked remote.php/webdav now, it looks quite alright. The broken files from 5559 isn't visible there, so I guess they can't interfere with anything then.  I'm on app version 1.4.6. Phone is Xperia Ray running LegacyXperia 10.2 (a non official CyanogenMod branch). I'll try to get a logcat of a synchronization... 
I use 1.22 release. So seems it is already fixed in the current source.

thanks @omehegan   **Freestyle** project with invalid token in gitlab hook correctly gives me a 401 "Invalid token" response
Sorry for the late reply, I right click my small slime  Click the slime ball size button thing Chose 4 (large size) press the book and It puts a pair of shoes on my cursor 
@khmarbaise, yes, I have created a PR here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/java-client-api/pull/283  Thanks. 
yeah, issue solved
Oops, I meant Firefox, thanks! I edited the original message. I like to include at least one mistake in every issue I file.  It's a regression—everything's fine in RStudio Server 1.2.5033, though it's on Ubuntu 18.04.3. I can switch Red Hat to 1.2, or Ubuntu to 1.3, if you think the OS could be a factor.
@tthuem  I removed the entry in the legend.   There is still missing an explanation of void feature model.   Also are constraint that are not satisfiable not highlighted.    1. So should I highlight the unsatisfiable constraints or not? With the current implementation of the explanation it is not possible to recognize a unsatisfiable constraint.  2. Should I highlight the constraint that causes the void model or should we implement an explanation for the void model (that is currently not implemented) ?  In the end the unsatisfiable constraint causes the feature model to be void aswell. So an explanation of the void model would be perfect.
> I assume mesh is running in a cluster env? Can you reproduce the issue with 0.27.0?  @Jotschi we were in standalone mode (no cluster) but restore occured when getmesh was heavy loaded (40 req / s average)  After a restart it returns working properly without lock  Only certains type of schema were locked, i created a new schema and new node and it worked fine. All GET queries were OK, only some update queries returned errors due to orientdb lock  Perhaps because not all orientdb files were locked ?  Another thing: during the restore, i saw some errors logs about orientdb was locked too. mesh cli returned status 504 too.  But in the end restore was effective (we manually checked that modified nodes during the current day were restored to precedent version).  Hope that PR about restoring older node version will become effective soon ;) 
I have already checked the read/write permissions of the FE folder. FE created serveral files before the crash without any problem. So i don't think this could be the case, will check it again anyways when i'm back home. 
Hi,  "You don't have permission to access /update/nightly/ on this server." :)  G. 
> Does the same problem occur with JDK13 builds?  Yes, it happens with OpenJ9 JDK13 and doesn't happen with Hotspot JDK13. NPE is an aftereffect of other exceptions: `ClassCastException -> Method.invoke (InvocationTargetException) ->  NPE`. I will post more details in the context of Jython later. 
Basically have a config option to turn off your "socket" effects. Socket Damage: False Socket Mob Freeze: False Socket Leech: False Socket Fire: False Socket Defense: False  Like that. Also im sure my plugin stackableitems is causing alot of issues it doesnt have alot of compatibility with other plugins.  I got a player whos damn good at finding bugs in plugins its almost scary... If you have a duped item or a item from a tier that was changed (which i did 2 days ago) you can use that item as your boots and when you click and drop the item in your boots slot it will duplicate what is in your hand, i havent tried this but they were duplicating stuff like mad.  It also ended up bugging their player data or corrupting it and i had to delete their player data to actually stop them from getting internal server errors in the server and getting kicked. 
@AlexisDrogoul or @gnoubi can you test it with this model?  [cityIO_Gama.zip](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/files/3155454/cityIO_Gama.zip) 
Yes, it should only affect people from #583.  Well, my idea was to reset the execution count only for scheduled backups. Now I see that I didn't mention it. Anyway, if you are ok with ignoring the execution count for exports, I also think it's better. I evaluated the possibility of doing so but, as the UI allows to set a maximum execution count, I didn't want to break it. But to be fair, I don't see it very useful for exports and I think we should be save from having anyone using it.  I'll prepare another pull request then...

ok I will give you a demo project for this issue asap.
Linear but I do not think it matters as I observed problems regardless of the number of hardware cycles.  
Yeah i got a regular output... i don't think it is an actual bug. It's just how it is intended to work. Requirements for merging are too strict... you should probably just check owners, at least one owner in common between the two areas. If you want you could make this configurable...  merge:   matching_all_owners_required: false   at_least_one_owner_required: true   matching_members_required:  false   matching_flags_required:  false   ...
Sadly, no. I tested it only with his account.  I mean this count:  > 16x Found it, 2x Didn't find it, 3x Write note 
I have installed version 1.2.0.1000  Should I manually upgrade to a higher version, e.g. 1.2.2.1000?
maybe I should have added that I'm using the mediasession extension. My UI is observing the MediaController shuffleMode.  When i switch from ExoPlayer (with shuffle enabled) to CastPlayer, the shuffleMode of the MediaController is not set to false, because CastPlayer doesn't report it through the onShuffleModeEnabledChanged() method

No, simply remove this view from the resource perspective. Users may open it, when they need it. It should only be openened in the FeatureIDE perspective per default.

Apologies for only replying now. It happens for me when creating a new file, insert a record and close app. When the app is opened and the password file selected and password entered, the record will be displayed. Clicking on anything, or navigating in the app anywhere will then cause a FC. When a widget is created linked to a password file, clicking the widget will cause app FC immediately. I hope I explained properly
I'm on a Motorola G3 (2015) osprey device with AospExtended custom ROM based on Android 8.1.2, July patchlevel. Tried the latest QKSMS versions from Google Play (3.3.x) and F-Droid (3.4.0 by today as far as I have seen).

I had it melt iron to dart iron (a dartcraft smelting receipe) and ender pearls to dust (that's portal gun I think). I guess you can see why that causes issues if it happens in alloy mode... And this is certainly something that changed as it had worked. 
Do you have only one SSL certificate on that server?  As far as I know, that problem only occurs if your server provides multiple certificates for different domains (SNI), in that case, the app, if it doesn't support SNI, will just use a "random" certificate (maybe first or last of the server config I guess, depends on the server).  When using ssl i can't activate the service; "test" will fail with a generic error as far as I remember. I am not in possession of the phone right now :) I will report back if I have any more information.  Here my concrete example: - My picture gallery is located at https://pics.stefanwienert.de, that cert is valid etc.pp - But, if connecting without SNI, like:    I just receive any certificate (for another of my domains fahrrad-filter.de). 
OK, I suppose that you're right, I was just a bit tired of working with translations :-) For me your proposal of string is good. In Spanish I think that I will write "Origen o destino están fuera del área cubierta por la red de transportes" but I suppose that your approach is better when writing in English.  I think that if we do it is better to do it right and also change in all the translations and ask @rjfv and @mentaer to translate or just review one more string once again. Maybe is easier to simply tell them the line, in this occasion, to allow them to see what they had written before and don't change their files. For the other languages, including English, I can make the changes.

I'm still using 1.3.3 because I have to generate the bottom navigation items dynamically instead of through resources. This means I also don't have a tab xml file, because this wasn't introduced back with my version.

During the sync or the download to my PC via https i have no problems. But it looks like if i share files via https and other users from the internet download them so it could happens too and via my android phone. But i can't find the problem because the server is busy at 100% and it occures no error and i could only reboot my server. My server is running a ubuntu server 12.04 LTS on my home PC ubuntu 12.04 LTS. 
Apologies for the delay, I will see what I can do. What I'm thinking should happen in this case (where a single "word" is larger than the column's maximum width) is that the output should fall back to naive splitting and breaking in the middle of the word. What do you think?

First example: If you host Jetty directly on an IPv6 address and you use an IPv6 client, the request log says: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [25/Apr/2017:08:27:20 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2802   If you however enable the http-forwarded module and send a request using curl like:  `curl -H 'Forwarded: for="[2001:db8:cafe::17]", for=192.0.2.43' -g "http://[::1]:8080/"`  [2001:db8:cafe::17] - - [25/Apr/2017:14:16:50 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2802   So the behaviour is different. With IPv4 it's the same.  Second example: Our application uses the IPRangePredicate [1] from OpenSAML.  They pull the IP address from the request and check via com.google.common.net.InetAddresses to see if its a valid address, which it isn't because of the brackets.   final String address = httpRequest != null ? httpRequest.getRemoteAddr() : null; if (address == null || !InetAddresses.isInetAddress(address)) {    return false; }  I was wondering where it should be normalized... But since rfc7239 states that it MUST be enclosed by brackets in the Forwarded-header, I think it's up to the consumer (jetty in this case) of this header to normalize this into an parsable IP as if Jetty was approached directly and not via a proxy.  [1] https://git.shibboleth.net/view/?p=java-opensaml.git;a=blob;f=opensaml-profile-api/src/main/java/org/opensaml/profile/logic/IPRangePredicate.java;h=0161ce469a7d8531ca5f96c909cc14f79fde705a;hb=HEAD#l100

sorry I am reading my description and is too vague. Let me add this is by doing a query for my user, and not for the individual package. If npm-stats is retrieving all repos for a user there is an assumption that all those have statistics, but for new packages (even after a few days) this assumption is not true as there are no statistics, and one package makes the entire query fail. So in the case of an errored package, it might be good to make it more exception safe.
We have tested with provided solutions on Version: 2.1.7 and it works. Thank You.

Hi @luigidellaquila   yes the patch fixes the problem. I think the issue can be closed!   Thank you for the quick answer.   Fabio
The issue happens for me when I have a url to a .m3u8 file which contains a port specifier. For example: http://192.168.1.2:80/stream/playlist.m3u8  If I remove the ':80', everything works great. I use that URL in my RendererBuilder; it gets passed to a ManifestFetcher<HlsPlaylist> in buildRenderers(), and to an HlsChunkSource in onManifest().

I'm not sure what is wrong. The failures are intermittent and not always in the same test case. Possibly it is just a bug in the OpenJDK code.

yes i do i have both iron chest and iron shulker boxes installed

wow,thank you so much for replying me, yes ,that's right ,i was running Che as root,  but, how to solve this problem if i really need to run Che was root? 
It's working fine.  Thank you! Keep up the good work.
I think  RED is 0.8.2. But the installation details of RED shows two: 0.8.1 and 0.8.2.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3054877/35728590-0c7c9b84-0847-11e8-9a29-2e47feb0a603.png)
My apologies, I thought that I put that in the original post. This bug was found on 0.4.0rc3. UPDATE: It appears that rather than converting waste into fuel, the waste and any quantities of fuel that cannot be converted into ingots are destroyed. The ejected fuel is still duped times the number of ports. 
I have an idea to what is happening as I came across this before with another attribute. Android Studio is changing the way they parse attributes. For instance they were switching enum parsing from integer to string in my previous case. My temporary solution was `View.isInEditMode` to check if it was in preview windows. Error stack trace:   
The 16 MB zip was not accepted. I have anonymized the logs and uploaded to google.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0HGJ3fJ1rpLRzRnM3VqbTg3SFE/view?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0HGJ3fJ1rpLVzk5N1Z0TTVsc0U/view?usp=sharing  btw. if I pre load the base image manually everything works fine.  Edit: Just checked on an other machine with docker 1.7.1 and it failed as well. It seems to be connected to the docker version although docker itself can pull images. 
I believe so, I have the `TravellersBackpack-1.12.2-0.1.8a` file installed. I also have the latest versions of Gravity Gun, Portal Gun, and iChun Util.
Try using phone, emulator with very low memory, or heavy loaded, but I guess it would not be reproducible 100%. Then `onTrimMemory` should be triggered. I used Android 4.4.4. And yes, Glide 3.5.1  
Good question. I'll have to test that - previously I've only ever used MKL with Windows.
The error is happening in the constructor: `new PdfReader(inputStream)`.  I'm locating the file now to see if it can be shared.

I have added the docker-compose.yml. Please run docker-compose up to start up kafka and zookeeper. Then you can start the app with gradle bootRun and then you can use the kafkacat command that I have specified before.  Kafkacat has a -H option in the producer mode. My kafkacat version is 1.5.0 (I have installed kafkacat with this command: brew install kafkacat)
@ZacBlanco Thanks for the answer. # The case is not necessarily recurring, and It only happens on alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT. After alluxio runs for a while, produces files on s3 or oss, then alluxio ls -f to update the alluxio meta.
I made a fresh mvn clean && mvn package on master of spring-boot, used it with my app and now it works as expected. Great.   I am / was using RC3 before. 
yes, with snapshot issue is fixed. indeed duplicate.
I can't swear that the Droid Maxx has a step counter, though i could check if i knew where to look, but it's extremely accurate, so it's doing something right.   It has happened 3 times now, but i haven't seen a correlation to anything I'm doing physically (i.e. running). No task killer or battery savers, not rooted, stock ROM 4.4.4. I don't reboot for sometimes a couple weeks at a time.

Sure, just pushed them to this repo: https://github.com/felixfbecker/PowerShellXSD  `Format.xsd` is the the schema (I autogenerated it from the XML, so pretty sure it's valid) `TestFormat.xml` is a schema instance. Try hovering over any tag, or triggering autocompletion, and you should see the above exceptions logged (and no hover/completion results).
It indeed works when camera storage is set to internal sd.

@TheBentoBox sorry for being too vague on that. I meant depending on what kinda of player expressions i used. (command sender/{_player}/event-player/etc.). I was also making different tests with functions and other event types, not only just a /test command.
Yes this is the whole screenshot. I did a short mistake. This is an Activity that is shown as a dialog, then from this activity-dialog, I open another dialog that keeps the same size on screenshot (as what I see, the screenshot height seems to be the activity-dialog background (white frame) height, but not vertical_center).

Elasticsearch Highlighting problem (0.90.1)  I am working on  upgradion of elasticsearch from 0.20.2 to 0.90.1 and come across the following issue. Elasticsearch Highlighting was working fine(getting results as we expected) in 0.20.2, but the same doesn’t work in ES 0.90.1 "type": "pattern",  Steps to reproduce the issue  Environment: JDK 1.7,Windows 7, elasticsearch 0.90.1, used elasticsearch head plugin to create/query documents  Step 1:- Defined mappings and settings for index(test_hightlight)/type(hightlight).  http://localhost:9200/test_hightlight   [POST]  {   "settings": {     "index": {       "number_of_shards": 6,       "number_of_replicas": 2,       "analysis": {         "analyzer": {           "CommaAnalyzer": {             "type": "pattern",             "flags": "DOTALL",             "lowercase": "true",             "pattern": "\,",             "stopwords": "_none_"           }         }       }     }   },   "mappings": {     "hightlight": {       "properties": {         "documentName": {           "analyzer": "CommaAnalyzer",           "type": "string"         },         "description": {           "analyzer": "CommaAnalyzer",           "type": "string"         }       }     }   } }  Step2:  Indexed following documents to newly created Index.    }  Note: The same query is working as we expected with Elasticsearch 0.20.2 
Hi. Yes sorry I couldn't remember the exact name for the "entity exporter" I was reffering to the "World Item Exporter".  I'm glad that you have been able to reproduce the bug and I hope you will find a way to correct it because your mod is really cool and usefull.  Cheers

In fact I do.   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21300678/64481273-f5761680-d195-11e9-9cb4-67521e15adba.png) 
That's the point. The first map show that there should be excellent coverage! 
@krzyk yeah, I figured that out...   Maybe in the project README? Or in FAQ? I'm not really sure.. 
Sorry I didn't check that at the time. I'm currently crazy for a deadline on tuesday, but i'll give that a try afterwards.  Good job on the library btw, makes things a lot easier. Is there a way to -custom- inject subscriptions? eg by entering a code I'd activate a subscription on the device locally instead of via the market. 
Yes, other running Jenkins-jobs (not on my local machine) are deploying artifacts to this channel. It seems, the index-files of some channels becomes irregular after this exception. I tried several times to rebuild the channel-metadatas also with restarting package-drone, nothing seems to help. So I have to clear the influenced channels completely and redeploy all artifacts. I returned to the 0.10.0m2 after this problems yesterday, where all channels (after complete rebuild) are working now (but with slow deployment).

No worries, it only happened the once and to me.. so may be something to do with being op? Ill keep an eye out Thanks 
Hello,  For me they fail every time. I don't know what those tests do and what other info might be needed from me.  P.S. I attempted to format it but failed. Got the hang of it now.
If you cook 10 of meat for example, the furnace cook 1 and until you do not pick up the meat, it do not cook anymore. It stays locked after cooking 1.
Ah, good callout! It looks like closing the previous response before retrying *does* fix the crash on 3.14. I was able to change my code to the follow and re-run the same scenarios with no crashes:    That definitely gets me unblocked, but it's interesting that this changed in the new version. Maybe something to note in the documentation for the future?  Thanks for the rapid response! (And of course, for all the work on maintaining this core library. :-) )
Sure. Let me try.  I am using CME template ftp://ftp.cmegroup.com/SBEFix/NRCert/Templates/templates_FixBinary.xml  where first place: ![snip1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6333781/2574592/a7bd1baa-b936-11e3-996f-31e60ab0cec9.JPG) and second place: ![snip2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6333781/2574615/172da040-b937-11e3-9fc9-ff1d77541e4e.JPG) decoded differently.  Due to the constant values, they are not sent on the wire by cme but rather decoded by SBE based on mentioned above template.  Asked CME about and after some debugging found this in SBE.  I made local change to have it consistent and it started working.  Pls let me know if you need more info or maybe I can help with any testing.  Thanks. 
Sure, with any profile switch. Which information should/could I provide?
Here you go:    So the NPE occurs at [line 1127](https://github.com/compomics/compomics-utilities/blob/master/src/main/java/com/compomics/util/experiment/massspectrometry/SpectrumFactory.java#L1127). Presumably there is a problem looking up the MGF file in the `mgfIndexesMap`? Either an incorrect MGF file name or the map doesn't contain the expected values?
appreciate for your quick response 😃  My version is 1.0.0, is it out of date？

We actually encountered this bug in a workshop where people had empty spacer columns; they would all have the same name (the empty string!)  People have the weirdest CSV files so we can't expect every file to be in the perfect format. It's more a question of how to handle this.  To solve this: - We could ignore the second column and simply not import them, although that seems rude. - We could add suffixes to the column names when we encounter them more than once (e.g. "2012a"). 
My phone is a Motorola Moto G 2013 (not the LTE version), with the latest official firmware (the Motorola one, not the GPE), KitKat 4.4.4 The version of owncloud I installed is the f-droid one, but I also bought the google play store version (just to support ownclod).  Should I try the Google store version? 
It was encountered when connecting a new provider (a local instance of the Fusion Registry) web service.  The data was World Bank WDI.  I have encountered this issue before with the SDMX specification, where in a URL .. is treated as back up one level, so for instance https://www.google.co.uk/fish/../and/../chips/../search?q=test Is the same as https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=test  This was raised as a potential issue with the REST API, the work around was to use the all keyword.  I don't know why some fail and some pass - I have looked at the ABS and this query is written as: RES_DWELL/+.+.+/ABS?format=compact_v2  So this is why the '..' problem is not encountered.  The ISTAT fails as the query: data/IT1,18_114,1.0/..?detail=serieskeysonly  Is rewritten as  data/?detail=serieskeysonly  I'm not sure how the Eurostat query passes: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/SDMX/diss-web/rest/data/ESTAT,aact_ali01,1.0/..?detail=serieskeysonly 
Yes, it works now! Thanks Vlad.  If I click out of Interpreted Modules and back in, the entries are all cleared (i.e. it doesn't remember them). Is this expected behaviour?

 @qualidafial ,@stevenschlansker,i am from china,my English is not goods. I used jdbi3, When db fields naming suffix with digital, such as 'user_name_2',my POJO named as 'userName2', the jdbi camel converter doesn't work. But the method with me, can work well. 
With that change, the menu could be opened and closed without mouse or touchpad. One would still need a mouse or touchpad to get into the settings. I don't know why the Arrow keys don't work for the side menu. 
I have researched a bit further on this, and  it seems to have to do with **Windows Vista** onward **User Account Control** and Windows protection mechanism for its **C:\Program** directory.  If I start _DBeaver_ as I described in the support issue, with **MyData** directory in the **C:\Program (x86)** directory then _DBeaver_ can't/will not generate a **dbeaver-debug.log** file.  > C:\Program (x86)\DBeaver> dbeaver.exe -data MyData > C:\Program (x86)\Dbeaver> dbeaver.exe -data "C:\Program (x86)\DBeaver\MyData"  This is a bit surprising since the **.log** file is created without any fuss.  If I instead ask _DBeaver_ to generate its configuration files in the **C:\ProgramData** directory, then the **dbeaver-debug.log** file is created.  > C:\Program (x86)\DBeaver> dbeaver.exe -data "C:\ProgramData\DBeaver\MyData"  **PS.** On **Windows XP** (or earlier) it is allowed to create and edit files in the **C:\Program** directory. So the **dbeaver-debug.log** file is created without any trouble.  **PPS.** With a bit of luck this might solve my support issue #3750 (trouble to run repacked version of _DBeaver_. I will try it out when I get back to work (I'm currently on vacation).

My use case is : run an [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org) based application as a windows service. So I have a start method to launch Camel, and another one to stop it. - Using the `java` way requires to develop `IPC` (inter process communication) as the `main` method is called to start and stop the process. It means, one `JVM` is launched to start the application,and another `JVM` is launched to handle the stop request. We need an `IPC` between both of them to notify the first one to shutdown. - Using the `jvm` way, it starts only one `JVM` it means start and stop will executes under the same context, and may use same object instances. It is more easyier in my use case.   But you are true, it breaks the feature `LogonAsService`. To provide both features `(start/stop method` and `LogonAsService`, the `mode` should became configurable and the doc should be updated. But should be easy to do :)

It doesn't fail at compile, it fails on `System.loadLibrary()`. Is there some other output I can provide? 
There's a couple of other places where I've seen odd things like this.  I'll wait for the dev to drop as a release before reporting any others.
@Sammers21 After restarted server, The problem is not reproduce. Is it rabbitmq? Is it com.rabbitmq:amqp-client:3.6.5 ????  Throw exception occured in the following code: rabbitClient.queueDeclare(queueName, false, false, false, null, queueDeclareRes -> {                 if (queueDeclareRes.succeeded()) {                     logger.info("queueName: " + queueName + " declare successfully.");                     declareFut.complete();                 } else {                     logger.error("Failed declare queueName: " + queueName, queueDeclareRes.cause());                     declareFut.fail(queueDeclareRes.cause());                 }             }); 
We upload the file and then we launch the index WS. We get the next logs from opencga-log and SGE log:   
I'll try and do more testing to get some more specifics. All occurrences were during multiplayer EDH matches, so the details are hard to recall. I don't remember the details on the Sol Rings and how they got back to their owner's hands.  I do remember the Spine of Ish Sah though. I sacrificed it to Daretti, Scrap Savant and that simply sent it back to its owner's hand due to: "When Spine of Ish Sah is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, return Spine of Ish Sah to its owner's hand."
I'm new to this bug-reporting stuff, sorry for making it harder. I'll try and behave 0:) 
TestQueryMocks.java   
There are multiple mods doing it this way, see for instance OpenComputers. 
It should either show a empty label, or generate an exception that tells me clearly what is wrong with the code. It took quite some debugging to find the actual cause, because the exception happens latter, when the JSON is being generated, not immediately when the label generator returns .  I would prefer the first option, since I think it will be a common cause of problems.  If the second option is chosen, I think the javadoc in the setItemLabelGenerator should also mention that it is not ok to return null values.   
Yes, I have auto upload on both. I want to have them both, as idea is to test beta. No point in testing beta, if I turn off auto upload:) What is annoying me is this error message. Maybe I am wrong, but I am hoping if we can backoff for the time of upload, we can avoid this error message (never sure if it is real error, or locking error). Other options that came to my mind is: * can we delay beta version for 15min/2 during scheduling (scheduleFilesSyncIfNeeded), so jobs are "somewhat" interleaved? Using setExact() maybe? Or just checking inside job if we are started on round number of minutes (00,15,30,45 for prod, 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5 for beta) and sleep a bit. I am not expert on any of this, so I might be very wrong:) * why tryLock cannot take shared lock? I don't see need for exclusive lock, if we are just reading/uploading file? I guess, if lock can be promoted to shared, we can have multiple jobs work on it:)
Hey @Coduz, I have rechecked this and the problem still persists.   Leo
what do you mean. like i could make a gif 
sorry for the delay response  my maven dependencies :    in my gwt module xml :  `<inherits name="gwt.material.design.GwtMaterialWithJQuery" />`  thats all.

I'm using the currently-recommended Dynmap for 1.7.10, which is at [CurseForge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dynmapforge/files/2223999).  There's also an [old issue](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap/issues/1253) on the Dynmap project stating that it supported ForgeEssentials as of version 1.7.1. So unless they dropped that support in the 2.x branch, I would expect that those hooks are still there. Maybe @mikeprimm can weigh in on this?

Unfortunately I can't share my source, but the problem seems to have to do with config.xml when it contains the following:   
uhh. after our hours and hours of experimenting, it suddenly works. so. i guess i'm going to close it now. 
not in incremental tutorial but the model contained by the extraresources/headless/samples/ folder of gama.product plugin  you can see inconsistency
The issue in question was resolved by adding `[assoc, comm]` to a function definition - it was an AC-matching exception. I'll confess to having no idea what that actually means, but we got it to work eventually :) 
I've tried with all the variants below:  `pool.preparedQuery("select $1", Tuple.tuple().addValue(new Integer[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 }), System.out::println);`  `pool.preparedQuery("select $1", Tuple.tuple().addIntegerArray(new Integer[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 }), System.out::println);`  None of them works.  Always with the same error: `java.lang.ClassCastException: java.base/[Ljava.lang.Integer; cannot be cast to java.base/java.lang.String`

Ok. will prep. There is not official mult-module project yet?  one more info:   If I compile native, application works/reacts on rest requests. Seems it is only about dev (and probably hot reload thing).
It happened on both an existing world and a new world. Reverting to the old version also fixed the issue after the crash on an existing world that crashed as well.

@schafma  No it is OK. I was just asking as I know that having debug logging activated will stop c:geo forcefully in some error cases which would otherwise just happen in the background without crashing.  But as you confirmed it crashes also without debug logging the case is clear.

I believe @LeifBrooks and @pyashwanthkumar have already expressed an interest to look into it, but if you would still like to investigate, feel free to do so and report back your findings. Otherwise, you can have a look around our issue tracker for something else to pick up.  Please, feel free to join our [chat channel](https://chat.carlspring.org/). 
@kiview Thanks for your quick reply ! I opened the bug here because I thought there could be another way to get the ip without having to access the logs of a container. I think the logs command is not even supported by docker itself with the syslog driver so I don't know if raising the issue to docker-java would help, I will check that anyway.  To help me moving forward, do you know if it's possible to override the gateway ip using an environment variable or java option, I tried to look for that without success reading the code / doc of the project.
I believe it was playing 1080p vids. I was just trying the app out trying random vids Like Taylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do. I think it’s VP9. Android TV 7.0 
it was always like this.
This is not conditional on the` catapultsString.delm`. It can be whatever. Just make it `catapultsString.delm <- "foobar"`. The problem is the "interpreter" in R/Rstudio or, maybe, Shiny, actually...
It shouldn't.  The SC plugin uses native libraries (`dll` and `dylib`), which are loaded in the `Stark` class. Dependencies on plugin:  The stranger thing is that it is not working in both systems (Windows - MacOS).
Thank you, @ramack. Your workaround works as expected. Thank you also for your work on this Android app, which is immensely useful for getting images from our mobile devices directly into our Piwigo instance.

The behaviour with a saddle is different : the horse is now mush faster on the client than on the server.  We see ourselves outstrip the particles and move very fast. 
Yeah, exactly as I tought and yes both DBS and portal frames. 
I've used the API, but yeah the context could be tough to resolve nicely.  The other option would be to warn if this has not been installed.  I'd like to make sure we encourage the best security practices possible, and also minimise support load due to apps on phones with old versions of SSL providers.  Put this out there for discussion,  happy to consider all options and not rush anything.

@l0rd i want to publish some services in the containers, so the other outside machine can visit that. if network breaks containers isolation should be avoided, can i fix the port mapping between the host and the container, i want to fix the host port to 4041 the same as the container port?  i do not want to the random port of the host.   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11625846/50193485-cd2d5a00-0371-11e9-9de5-ad85c9b97ca3.png) 
The crux of the issue is that we provide an IMAP service to certain clients and while we haven't made explicit changes to the encoding they are asserting that the version update has caused this to start occurring with "all" of their incoming mails.
I would prefer some kind of a border for selected item or different background of the item, but this also works.

@skabashnyuk The use case is basically automating creation of che and then signing up a user with the swagger API. But as it stands, if I deploy che, I cannot call the create user api without having to manually sign up first a regular user.
My Minecraft version is 1.8 and my MCA version is 1.8-5.0.7.1.

The issue happens on mobile, I`ve got 5 tabs and it happens on the fifth tab so when the fifth tab is clicked the badge is hidden and if I click the forth tab the badge comes back in the same place it was suppose to be if it was visible when the fifth tab was clicked (I`m using shifting behavior so the selected tab get a bit bigger) so the badge is cut in half 
Hi @cbellone   I've checked and it seems that now the VAT mechanism does not fail, so the user can continue asking for their ticket while paying and requesting the invoice.   The only problem that I've seen is that what will happen if the lambda does not return proper information. For example, I've tried with an existing company with a confirmed valid VAT number, and the result we received it is not correct, because it is retrieved an empty address (----). Here you can see an screenshot:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2370634/36175156-d4aee54c-110e-11e8-9ee8-413319177fd4.png)  Of course the invoice created does not include info about the company, so from the legal point of view it is not correct :-/ Do you think it make more sense to have the field of the retrieved information enabled just in case if the user wants to change some data received from the lambda function?  Best,

This is a regression - the boolean is not being deserialized on the REST API call.   The boolean is in the Comment bean and stored in the relationship between the Referenceable and the Comment.  This function has been working ok and just began to fail recently.

Ah, nevermind then. It's a bug in the model loader (maybe the model is wrong, but most likely it's a problem while loading the model from js). If compiled without the model loader, it works fine. 
I misunderstood that as well. Changing as you suggest would be perfect, a clear way to say you are just interested in the current context.

First I'm sorry for anwering you so late. We have built our own webapp, adding openwayback-core as a dependency, and we have configured wayback.xml to fire up OpenWayback in proxy mode. 
That's the culprit indeed. The condition `@ConditionalOnMissingBean(AsyncConfigurer.class)` is not enough - it doesn't take into account the fact that Spring will also consider the TaskExecutor or Executor it may find in the context (see original description).  As a temporary workaround, we disabled Sleuth's default async configurer by setting `spring.sleuth.async.configurer.enabled` to false. Then we added the following configuration in our code:

JSSE assumes that there is only one PrivateKeyEntry in the keystore that is used to initialize the `X509ExtendedKeyManager` (or that we are only interested in the first entry), see https://github.com/frohoff/jdk8u-jdk/blob/da0da73ab82ed714dc5be94acd2f0d00fbdfe2e9/src/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SunX509KeyManagerImpl.java#L50  >   The JSSE handshake code currently calls into this class via >   chooseClientAlias() and chooseServerAlias() to find the certificates to >   use. As implemented here, both always return the first alias returned by >   getClientAliases() and getServerAliases(). In turn, these methods are >   implemented by calling getAliases(), which performs the actual lookup.  If we were to support keystores that contain multiple PrivateKeyEntry and the possibility to select the appropriate alias to use via configuration (ie `xpack.ssl.keystore.key_alias` , then we'd have to implement our own KeyManager extending `X509ExtendedKeyManager` and implement the `chooseServerAlias()` method accordingly. Unfortunately we cannot do that as, as [we figured out during the FIPS effort](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/30509), [we cannot use KeyManagers that extend the SunJSSE ones](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SSLContextImpl.java#l152)  Since we can only use one`PKCS#11` Keystore per Provider with and the KeyStore can only contain one entry, we can effectively use only one Key throughout our configuration.   An alternative to the above is to support multiple Security Providers, configured in the Java security properties and use a different one for each (`KeyManager-KeyStore-Key`) that needs to be used in a configuration. This will require the introduction of an optional configuration setting that can be used wherever a certificate/key or a keystore can be configured in order to denote the provider ID to use for the `KeyManagerFactory`. We should probably limit this to be allowed only when `PKCS#11` keystores/tokens are in use and also verify that a provider ID is valid when we parse the newly introduced setting's value.

Two with c.geo Visit Log http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=7f0fc54a-ed4f-4ceb-a63f-23d088ac3711  and Visit Log http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=3ab3b8a1-66bb-4950-adf2-ddab3b208def with date "Today" (I tried to make another with changing the date explicitly to 27.8., but c.geo didn't allow me to store this, and in the end the date will show as "Today", too) and one with a web browser in my mobile.Visit Log http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=53880e6b-02b4-4879-9271-58eed1439e7e  I also attach here a screen capture from my geocaching.com account details, where you can see the date setting.  I'll edit these logs manually at geocaching.com for the correct date (I'm in a middle of a challenge streak, and need those logs for today ;) ).  BR marautti 
I'll give it a try but I suspect I'll have a hard time getting a reproducible testcase. Regarding your proposed solution: do you really have to do a `read()`? Calling `java.nio.channels.Channel.isOpen()` should return false at least in the above case. 
@briandealwis This doesn't happen for _Run As_.  ~~I tested the wip-498 branch, but it almost all the time hit the JDWP/JVMTI error at startup. (There have been a couple of occasions it started without the error, but it gets the same error anyway.) I think you should be able to reproduce it.~~  UPDATE: it works in the `wip-498` branch works. See https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-eclipse/issues/604#issuecomment-242123350 below. 
it works perfectly with beta 11, above that this exception is thrown while updating object like this    
not tested them yet  thermal expansions items ducts is what i mainly tried on each side
I think I might have a solution using docker `--build-args` feature. I'll maybe have a PR later today... 
URL :http://localhost:8080/Backend/ws/data/test  Test case attached: [v10demo.zip](https://github.com/payara/Payara/files/3244526/v10demo.zip) 
It should have been these builds:  - [1843](https://travis-ci.org/JanusGraph/janusgraph/builds/492193490): Targeted `0.2` which didn't get the flaky marking. - [1902](https://travis-ci.org/JanusGraph/janusgraph/builds/498592012): This build belongs to [this commit](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/4682509e753f7934dc6fd9da30989248181d758f) which was merged before the flaky marking was added. So the test probably just failed the number of retries in Travis.  So, this really seems to be not an issue any more.
I would have to rewrite some parts to post it online. (I'll do it at some point in time...)  Is it possible that it's throwing the IllegalArgumentException because some keywords are not defined within the file itself, but in a resource ? 
Yes your query works. It is exactly the query Edith and I tried and did not work (unfortunately you have to take my word for it ;-) )  
Yes, the issue is gone in the latest version.
Issue: Sunforger does not work properly - Unable to target some spells, such as Tithe to cast from the library. - Unable to target spells such as Lightning Helix or Warleader's Helix resulting in fizzled spells.
Sorry, currently I can't reproduce the issue any more. Maybe because of the recent change in maxSearchMultiplier=50 to maxSearchMultiplier=100. I'll need to do some more tests, but his may take a while. 
That's partial fix, we provide JUnit 4 extension - https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/master/test-framework/junit4 
Yes, I was referring to the official demo app.
OK. The second code is; - getMap**Key**Decoder() returns **key**Decoder - getMap**Key**Encoder() returns **key**Encoder - getMap**Value**Decoder() returns get**Value**Decoder() - getMap**Value**Encoder() returns get**Value**Encoder()  This should be the correct code, but it does not work.  In contrast, the first code is; - getMap**Key**Decoder() returns get**Value**Decoder() - getMap**Key**Encoder() returns **key**Encoder - getMap**Value**Decoder() returns **key**Decoder - getMap**Value**Encoder() returns get**Value**Encoder()  And this works perfectly. 
I pushed the repo on my account: https://github.com/pixelomatic/flixel-demo I've also included all dependencies for your convenience.  After running, just use arrow keys to move around. Just for info, the left block is FlxTilemap and the right one is a FlxTileblock. Try moving down until camera is moving, then start moving up and down. You should notice that there is a 1px gap appearing and disappearing in a pattern on left example. Also, at certain points while you are not moving at all, the object usually has a small gap underneath it so it looks like it's hovering in air. It's obvious that tilemap is vibrating so that's why I think the problem is with tilemap, not other objects. The one at right side stays rock solid and I guess it should be the right behavior.  Here's a screenshot. The tilemap is rendered 1 pixel off from it's real position. ![problem](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/811932/1236588/cfbdc728-29c4-11e3-97d6-831f169b83e8.png) 
I always cycle through options. Long press method does not appear to reproduce it. However, now that you mentioned it, I tried going to one option after an other. So the "Random" option appears to be casuing the issue. I did the long press->Random. Then long press -> Back to no repeat. Causing the same behaviour.

The driver version is 2.5.15 and can be download from: http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/downloads/connectors/hive/jdbc/2-5-15.html  The server is using HiveServer2 1.1.0 from CDH 5.4.4. 
Unfortunatly this would mean that we enable the workaround in our production environment since we cannot reproduce this issue on our local devices. And I think we should avoid this :see_no_evil:.  But we could try patching the Renderer and add the mentioned devices to try if this reduces this failure.
Thanks for the quick reply! ... Woops. Turns out, all the changed I made actually do work. The problem seems to be with JEI, as it still shows no change at all. Removing/adding machine recipes isn't recognized by JEI, despite getting registered with the specific machine. That leaves the question open, on what mod's end the mistake lies. Maybe RT has to update the recipe in question in JEI?
Hi Martino @facchinm, I re-downloaded the archive from the site, untarred again and it appears that this archive had more files in it. Weird, I don't recall seeing errors related to a premature end of the tar archive. Now the library is there, and it works.

It's a one-time workaround. 
It cant be related...as it is happening since some days, still happening now and only on caches **without** inventory.  https://imgur.com/FLLKVhC 
Here is a [catlog using the default verbose log level 1/3](http://pastebin.com/n3eid5Jf), [2/3](http://pastebin.com/S36hWqUu), [3/3](http://pastebin.com/QYrHFhzr) which was cut to the most recent 10k lines for being too big even when I cleared it before opening Xposed Installer and a [catlog using the debug log level](http://pastebin.com/QQei8Fnf).  Also is it normal for my phone to have that much going on in the background and would an antimalware program like Comomdo Mobile Security pose a problem for installation of the Xposed Framework?

thank you so much for your quick and informative response,  i had 6. 7 and 8, uninstalling 6 fixed everything!!  many thanks!
I booted in by deleting maxlock apk. Reinstalled it, uninstalled(clearing data) and deleted the dalvik cache. Installed it again, strangely works but it keeps getting optimized at every boot.  Additionally, could I request you to add an option to lock apps upon screenlock? And also, may I know whats "pausing" as stated in 5.2 update. 
It seems that it works properly. 👍  I'll tell you if I see any bugs
> Can you at least show the code that produces it?  I clicked type-check a random definition in `Category.ard` and it gives me this. Closing the file and re-open makes the error disappear.
Hi, thanks for pointing out, i'll try to take a look at TLS/Java, My goal is to use the Java Stack on Raspberry Pi   (BTW: Oracle Java6 is no more available for RPi/Raspbian -- install fails, as the JDK6/ARM is not available for download from Oracle).   I have tested various JDKs under Docker (from Debian Jessie), I'm summarizing system info and results below. In general, there are 8 errors (TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2) related. Oracle JDK9 does ont compile.  ## Tests Performed:  - SSL Supported/Enabled protocols in Java (default installation) - compile/package UA-Java/master: mvn package  ## Tested Java SDKs: - Oracle JDK 6 without unlimited-jce (not avail via repository) - Oracle JDK 7 w. unlimited-jce - Oracle JDK 8 w. unlimited-jce - Oracle JDK 9 w. unlimited-jce - OpenJDK 7 - OpenJDK 8  ## Result summary: ### Protocol support:    
Thank you @dfalty  very, very much indeed. It helped and is working now. I installed 1.3.881 version and Global Options pane works like a charm.  best regards
Thanks for the quick reply!  As for syncany itself I now removed it and reinstalled by appending --HEAD to brew (I'm on OS X), so the version is now the following: 0.4.5-alpha+SNAPSHOT.1503291236.git1f31213  The plugin version seems to be the latest, though!    I'd be happy to provide more details, I suppose this debug is far from being helpful. Thanks again. 
This doesn't work because offset and speed are part of the visual effect object. And it throws the same error as before.

When we do not use a `TurnWeighting` u-turns will not have any cost (because instead of using manual u-turn checks the u-turn costs are now applied in `TurnWeighting`).  Is there a need for edge-based routing when there are no turn costs ? If yes should "no turn costs" also mean "u-turns are allowed (and free)" ? We can probably support this when we remove `TurnWeighting`, ~~#1520~~ #1820.
I couldn't get the exact crash report that Minecraft gives you, but I did find a good alternative. I tried to get the file and even looked through the files and ran the game about 15 or so times to get the crash report file to appear in the crash reports folder but every time I refreshed to get it to pop up, it wouldn't pop up. So I did the next best thing and got the Minecraft game launcher output. I don't want to cause you too much trouble so here. I feel like I'm being interrogated, just to let you know.

The native code, which was formerly in com.redhat... modules is now part of ceylon.test, and test/test-js tools call runTestTool function directly.

I got 10 enabled indexers and 1 temporary disabled. According to the stats tab I average slightly over 100 searches each day for 8 of the indexers ("Indexer API Accesses") during the last month. Two of them are below 10 searches with a fairly high failure rate so I should probably disable them.

Hmm, when I run it on a fresh install I don't have the issue, so it must be a weird interaction with another mod.

RFTools Control apparently does. I'll test Pressure Pipes.  Edit: Pressure Pipes works BUT it doesn't save the values. Quality/Purity/Strength/Efficiency associated with resonating crystal liquid was deleted. High Pressure Pump > High Pressure Input > Pressure Pipes > High Pressure Output.  Can't connect pipes directly to the tank, but that's irrelevant here http://prntscr.com/dpif77
@gavinking Yes, I am talking of New > Ceylon Source File.  Initially the file is empty, that's right. Entering multiple lines in such a new file will result in Windows style line delimiters.  I updated to the newest version of the plugin and the issue has been resolved.  Thanks. 
I did /npc select <#> and then /npc text and configured what they said. Whenever I right click the NPC, it sends that error. Here is how I've set up my NPC to tell players about myself when he gets right clicked. http://pastebin.com/x8ycYMdC Thanks for the help in advance! 
 
I am debugging it in intelliJ and not using any logger config. How can I set it?
deegree version is 3.3.18  I would rather have a fix for 3.3.x than wait around for 3.4 since we are planning to make use of Deegree for our national public delivery of datasets with WFS 2.0 and GML 3.2.1

I just realized (by [this](https://bazel.build/designs/2016/10/11/distribution-artifact.html)) that `./compile.sh compile <bazel-binary-path>` is no longer supported for dev version of Bazel. I tried `bazel build //src:bazel` and it worked.   I will close this issue, and thanks Damien for helping!
Sebastian, it does not seem useful to work on this while your branch is not integrated. Please let Alex know, once this is done. 
Hello @tkrille,  we are using the latest version of the addon-administration (1.6) and the issue is related to boolean-typed extension fields. 
I haven't got a self contained example but have a look at the constructor of StompClientConnectionImpl.    If the ponger times out, it will call disconnect(), which calls the closeHandler, which closes off the socket, calling the closeHandler again. 
Hey @aguibert !   When calling `Jsonb.toJson(account.getPricePlanCurrent())` the root object is of class **PricePlan$HibernateProxy$something** and the serializer is engaged, because this goes through `serializeRoot()`. The object **tenant** inside of the **pricePlanCurrent** is not serialized using my serializer, it goes through ObjectSerializer's `marshallProperty()`. The same goes if i do `Jsonb.toJson(account)`. It is crucial to have this because a proxy might be out of session an uninitialized and i need to be able handle that properly in my serializer !
Yes we do use lambda ... but looking at the assertion which for reference is    The cname that comes through is `"'[Lcom.sun.enterprise.connectors.authentication.ConnectorSecurityMap;"` which looks perfectly fine. I think the assertion is just wrong as the 'L' character indicates an object type not an array type. I suspect just changing the assert to `assert(cname.charAt(0) == '[');` would work.   Although this is a pre-coffee assessment ;)
Correct, too many active segments, issue is unrelated.
@davidecaroselli I think this is the issue...  There is a broken carriage return that is interpreted in a different way from the tokenizer and cleaner.  Can we filter those so it does not crash? 
I suspect you are correct. Odds are this is not a common occurrance, but rather something that happens under a small set of circumstances... It should more likely be noted for future reference in case another user asks for help solving the same issue.

There might be legitimate reasons why a user might keep a property unselected in their map? Maybe the current source documents don’t have all the data to fit the canonical model?  We can call attention to the unselected properties in the map if we think the user really might not want this, perhaps before they harmonize.  If we think users may prefer the system making default mapping choices for them, we can give them the opportunity to choose that behavior, or at a minimum make it clear that it is happening in the generated code.  Right now the user is making one choice in the UI (don’t map these properties) and the system is doing another (we’re going to map these unmapped properties automatically). That doesn’t seem right.  @bsrikan, I assumed the "Unassigned or Unmatched Mappings" section was for mappings that, for whatever reason, were disconnected from an entity.

I cannot test this as your explanations branch does still contain the cycle dependency already fixed in develop branch. Can we merge develop into explanations?
So I was able to verify the pass created with PKInMemorySigningUtil using the preview on mac but not with the PKFileBasedSigningUtil. Its not a blocker for me as I can just use the PKInMemorySigningUtil, Just thought I should raise the issue for clarity.
sorry for the raging :P i tried to figure this out the whole day, bare with me. :)  yeah, so disabling achievements fixed the startup crash, however it produced a crash while trying to view the creative tab, i can't tell if a NEI search would let it crash.   let me test that version real quick.  
I will send you more details along with a copy of the compressed database tomorrow.   Can you recommend a way to delete duplicate nodes on a non embedded database for nodes not matching the constraints in the meantime. Since this is a production server I would like to get it operational for updates again. Hopefully if i delete the duplicate nodes I can temporarily avoid the error.  Thanks 
@krzyk There are intermittent results (`FAILURE/SUCCESS`) within Unit tests that have something to do with creating files in the `temp` Dir in my computer.    The same error messages may appear on:  `Apache Maven 3.2.1`, `Apache Maven 3.2.5` and `Apache Maven 3.3.3`  I also experience a similar problem at: https://github.com/yegor256/takes/issues/506 
I was trying to craft a coal block using vanilla coal, I got the crash with the inventory 3x3 crafting, in the vanilla bench, and in the TConstruct crafting table.

I added the app to the Samsung store with billing about a week ago and have gotten 72 instances of this error:   java.lang.NullPointerException at org.onepf.oms.appstore.SamsungAppsBillingService.queryInventory(SamsungAppsBillingService.java:190) at org.onepf.oms.OpenIabHelper.queryInventory(OpenIabHelper.java:802) at org.onepf.oms.OpenIabHelper$5.run(OpenIabHelper.java:833) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:856)  It took me a while to find out that OpenIAB expects the key to be "group_id/item_id" but I fixed that before I uploaded the app so I don't think that's the problem. I don't have a Samsung phone so I can't debug this exception. This and the other exceptions I listed above are all that I've seen in the past 7 days.

It is an existing user.. Problem started "a few months ago"  After adding english as second language he says, its working now. Not sure whether in english or hebrew. I asked the user.
Using it, can't say more as I don't know. 
Sorry for filing this report because it is definitely a matter of the local file system. On the SDcard there is FAT by default which doesn't allow ':' in the file names.  FYI what I did: I used the ['MyOwnNotes' app](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=myownnotes&fdid=org.aykit.MyOwnNotes) which creates file names with ':' in it but on the server. The server of course allows such names because it usually uses a modern file system (which is UFS with FreeBSD in my case) and not FAT. But when I try to download those files with the OwnCloud client then it fails to create the file locally.  I suggest to make the error message more clear because it says 'Download failed' but actually the download is ok but the file creation fails. 
@czyzby sorry, had no time to prepare code sample and check it once again. Will do it till the end of this week 
I doubt that I hit `F2`.  Almost nothing in the environment.  The code (that I had just selected for copy/paste):  
Some more details, sorry for not mentioning. Upgraded from 2.0.12.Final to 3.4.1.Final, with 2.0.12 there was no problem with the code.  Here the full stack trace    Were able to fix the issue by replacing PathAndQuery.matches with Path.matches as our rewrite rules handles request path values only.

Yes, freezing, and as Ubuntu applications do when they freeze for more than a second or two, the entire app grays out.  I will take a dump on Monday at work and collect more information.  I haven't tested on a bunch of databases, only the one MS-SQL db. I have access to some MySQL databases, so I will try those.  The windows version, however, I was able to connect to the same database with no issues, by the way. 
Yes it appears with duplicated content.
That if i could answer. The Fission Port of the other two reactors did on Version 2.7 sometimes the same problem. Reactor complete build up and nothing would be imported. After switching the sides of the import and export it worked. Best example: the second small reactor on the first picture (same build as the first small) don't accept fuel rods too.  For Explanation and clarity:  2 small reactors. Same build. 2x2x3 Fission Port layer 2 don't work. Doesn't matter on which side i place an export bus.  First reactor: Moved the fission port one layer up. backside of the port don't accept fuel rods. The top of it accept it and the controller doesn't recognize the rods.  Second reactor: Second Layer: Don't accept Fuel Rods. Third layer - surprise surprise - don't accept fuel rods.   Now i'm confused right now cause this are the same builds.  Well i build the same reactor in a few minutes and i think i have the solution and where it depends on ;)  Maybe Chunks. My first 2 reactors are in nearly with the interior in one chunk. The small ones aren't. The chunk border is exactly behind the controller.

Yes, probably.
@michael-rapp seems they both have the same root cause. Thanks for looking into this.

Hi @mrioan sorry for not providing more details for reproducing this issue (though I did refer to the Spring Security event `AuthenticationSuccessEvent` rather than the Stormpath specific event `SuccessfulAuthenticationRequestEvent`).  Previous to the 1.X release of the Stormpath SDK you used to be able to detect a successful login in a non-Stormpath specific way using just the standard documented Spring Securty approach, i.e. just create a service that implements `ApplicationListener<AuthenticationSuccessEvent>`. E.g. something like this:    This no longer works, for the reasons outlined above.  I've switched over to the Stormpath specific approach as outlined in the [events section](https://docs.stormpath.com/java/spring-boot-web/events.html) of Stormpath's Spring Boot docs, i.e. using `RequestEventListenerAdapter` as you mention.  This works fine - so I will stick with this - but the original bug still stands, i.e. that the standard Spring Security approach that used to work in the RC releases no longer works in the 1.X releases.  But I'd rate this low priority now that you've pointed me at an alternative solution. 
Nope... I need some? I'll try and write down the result... thank you. YOU ARE the BEST!!! Those are the little things missing in the tutorials. But hey, it is work in progress... so such things can be expected...  Now last thing missing: How can I make each gas planet to produce different gasses since it deletes my  tags? Is this supposed to work in [1.10]?  I will update the answer in the original post to make it easier for the readers.
Updated to 1.2.1256, it acts weirdly: sometimes it escapes the chars correctly, sometimes not.     * With `é` or `ö`, it does not work. * If I substitute the `é` with `œ` (U+0153), it renders the HTML. * If I substitute with a `ѩ` (U+0469) or a `ｅ` (U+FF45), it spins, then breaks:

We're using the default forge for FTB Infinity Evolved, let me go see... Forge 10.13.4.1614, by the looks of the debug screen. oh, right: Fastcraft is installed too. I know that can cause abnormalities, totally forgot to mention that last time, my apologies.  Also, I wasn't overloaded, the ability itself was functioning, reflecting both damage and projectiles, but it would fail to negate damage to me. Hitting me with it on would still hurt the other, and would use some of my cp and give me some overload, but I'd take the full damage of the attack. I was wearing Quantum armor from IndustrialCraft2, which negates a good bit of damage; When hit by an electon beam with the armor on and reflection off, I'd take half a heart of damage, but if I was hit by that with the armor on and reflection active, I'd take 6 hearts of damage, completely ignoring the fact that I was wearing the armor. Damage would only bypass my armor when the skill was active, if it was off the armor would function like normal. That being said, we've since removed kCauldron, and reflection is working once again, so its not a pressing issue for me anymore, but it does further incline me to believe kCauldron was the culprit. 
  I still have the problem. For sure it come from the GIS file (that I did not control and that was made "by hand") but it used to work like one month ago. There is one specific building that gives a problem.   Run AndorraABM.gaml and Display Experiment  Note 1: No problem to open this GIS in QGIS Note 2:  Please don't share those data  
I haven't confirmed this behavior yet.. planning on doing so today, but I wanted to put the issue up at least to investigate. 
Hi Michail!  I am facing this on the code base of large project. I've [prepared the simplified version of the classes](https://gist.github.com/orange-buffalo/327073f3b238643fcd42) (jaxb and mapping annotations removed). CPU profiling from ticket's description was taken during `AddressImpl` analysis.  I hope this will be enough to check the issue. If not, apparently it means that the reason of performance degradation is the combination of huge source code base and annotation processing (we are using lombok very intensively)... 
Server version of deck is 0.6.4, nextcloud 16.0.2
@jakubklimek I uploaded a sample pipeline that depicts the problem I'm having here: [SPARQL Select UTF-8 Problem](https://demo.etl.linkedpipes.com/#/pipelines/edit/canvas?pipeline=https:%2F%2Fdemo.etl.linkedpipes.com%2Fresources%2Fpipelines%2F1562939394046).  I am not executing the SPARQL SELECT query on an endpoint, rather on the output of a "JSON-LD to RDF" component, which in turn gets the data from some JSON files I have on my local machine. In the example pipeline above, I used a text holder instead of the JSON files.  When executing this pipeline on my machine, the CSV file generated by the SPARQL SELECT component does not correctly depict the accented letters that can be seen in the input text holder.  In other components that output files, such as "JSON to JSON-LD", we can specify the encoding we want for the output files. Can the same be done for the SPARQL SELECT component as well?

I **think** we can fix this in the archetype. Switching to Beam will probably make this moot, but that's a bigger change. 
Thank you Emanuele, understood. So I'll close this issue. Do we have something in documentation about this? If not, it would be better to have this point described. 
yes sorry xD

>Do you find that particular video resolutions are broken while others work?  Yes, most of the working videos has multiple of 16 height (1080, 720, 480). But some of them has resolution 640x360 and works too. `360 / 16 = 22.5`. So I don't know could it be the reason or not.
Apparently I had [already posted](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/143#issuecomment-58651468) in #143, about this exact problem one year ago!!  [CellInfoWcdma](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfoWcdma.html) belongs to API 18 (AOS 4.3). Thus **DeviceApi17.java** should probably be called **DeviceApi18.java** and using `...SDK > 17` instead of `16`...  The lines in CellTracker.java make it unclear what is really supposed to be executed. As my understanding was that the DeviceApi17.java class should only be executed if you use API17, since we only start support from 17 and up? Instead the lines read as follows.  First [here](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/development/app/src/main/java/com/SecUpwN/AIMSICD/service/CellTracker.java#L397-L400), then [here](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/development/app/src/main/java/com/SecUpwN/AIMSICD/service/CellTracker.java#L948-L950):     What to do? 
Changing to an integer for the SDK_INT fixes the first error, but not the second error as the API doesn't exist in my build SDK for locationEnabled.  Changing my build SDK to 28 fixes both build errors. 
If you have a gitlab account I can just let you in on the project and you can see the source proper and run it
I tested without DS and SF, and still happened. I'll do some more tests to see what mod is breaking things. The odd thing is that it worked correctly in a similar setup (that had DS and SF), so I'll run a diff between the modlists and see what's different.
Doesn't seem to happen anymore. Will continue testing more later but we can close it for now
Thanks! Using the fully qualified path fixes it. Hadn't realised it needs fully qualified paths. An error message about missing import(s) would be good. 
For me, it was usually when going to background and coming to the foreground inside the ChannelActivity but can happen in MainActivity too.
Here is `SELECT * FROM sys.allocations` before running `ALTER CLUSTER REROUTE RETRY FAILED`:    I can confirm running `ALTER CLUSTER REROUTE RETRY FAILED` fixed the problem in my case and the table shows now:  Health: `good`
Yes I will make it when I am free. But how can I send it to you？
@rwinch Sure, I can work on a PR. In the meanwhile, I found a workaround for this issue. Add the following in customized `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter.configure(HttpSecurity)` method  Not ideal, since hardcoded OpenID Connect provider login page, but good enough to overwrite the default behavior.
@andrewkm would be best to ask for that.  Sleaker thinks it's related to papermc. 
@tobiasKaminsky this is related to the Storage location in settings, not the push itself. For me it's set to /emulated/0 which is wrong (when I click to select it and select one of the two options, key can be generated and it all works).
Yes my programm runs 2 netty servers and thay function for weeks      		if(config.isEnableTSQuarry()) { //Teamspeak api 		TS3Config config = new TS3Config(); 		config.setHost("127.0.0.1"); 		config.setFloodRate(FloodRate.UNLIMITED); 		config.setEnableCommunicationsLogging(true); 		TS3Query query = new TS3Query(config); 		query.connect(); 		ts3Api = query.getAsyncApi(); 		ts3Api.login(cloudConfig.getTs3user(), cloudConfig.getTs3pass()); 		ts3Api.selectVirtualServerByPort(9987); 		ts3Api.registerAllEvents(); 		ts3Api.addTS3Listeners(new TS3ListenerToEventManager()); 		ts3Api.setNickname("CloudSystem"); 		}  Is in the main to start the api and the TS3ListenerToEventManager contains:      @Override 	public void onChannelCreate(ChannelCreateEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakChannelCreateEvent event = new TeamSpeakChannelCreateEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onChannelDeleted(ChannelDeletedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakChannelDeletedEvent event = new TeamSpeakChannelDeletedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onChannelDescriptionChanged(ChannelDescriptionEditedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakChannelDescriptionEditedEvent event = new TeamSpeakChannelDescriptionEditedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onChannelEdit(ChannelEditedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakChannelEditedEvent event = new TeamSpeakChannelEditedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onChannelMoved(ChannelMovedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakChannelMovedEvent event = new TeamSpeakChannelMovedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onChannelPasswordChanged(ChannelPasswordChangedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakChannelPasswordChangedEvent event = new TeamSpeakChannelPasswordChangedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onClientJoin(ClientJoinEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakClientJoinEvent event = new TeamSpeakClientJoinEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event);  	}  	@Override 	public void onClientLeave(ClientLeaveEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakClientLeaveEvent event = new TeamSpeakClientLeaveEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onClientMoved(ClientMovedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakClientMovedEvent event = new TeamSpeakClientMovedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onPrivilegeKeyUsed(PrivilegeKeyUsedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakPrivilegeKeyUsedEvent event = new TeamSpeakPrivilegeKeyUsedEvent(arg0);	 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  	@Override 	public void onServerEdit(ServerEditedEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakServerEditedEvent event = new TeamSpeakServerEditedEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event);  	}  	@Override 	public void onTextMessage(TextMessageEvent arg0) { 		TeamSpeakTextMessageEvent event = new TeamSpeakTextMessageEvent(arg0); 		CloudServer.getPluginManager().callEventAsync(event); 	}  Simple code to translate the teamspeak events into my own event system, the event system is tested for weeks and works flawless
Using the latest jar (closure-compiler-v20161024.jar), I'm still seeing the issue.  Adding `--new_type_inf` does fix the issue, but it's not on by default.  Is that what you meant by "type based optimization"? 
ok will do that in a bit.
@mmacfadden Maybe! Critical differences, however:  - This issue does not exist if both elements of LINKSET are created _either_ inside _or_ outside the transaction. - The above test runs through with a LINKMAP (as in #8632), as well as with a LINKLIST - it seems an issue specific to LINKSET. - This issue is exists for PLOCAL as well as MEMORY dbs.  So it would rather be an indirect relationship to the same root cause.

It is not about class path. I have all classes (ListenerMethod is just another annotation). It's about synthetic methods in enum, this class doesn't compile at all. I would like to get ListenerMethod[] method() default {}; and String remover() default ""; but without enum, because mistakes inside enum. Can spoon help me with it? or he just says IllegalArgument and that's all ?  
yes 
Er, it was the duplicate at least. I don't recall checking flips, dunno where that title came from.
I'm using Ampache server and I can create share links with Ultrasonic.  Can you tell me what the difference is between how DSub handles this versus Ultrasonic (what DSub is looking for specifically)?

I have a handful of mods that change worldgen in some way or another. Biomes O' Plenty, Quark, Druidcraft, forbidden arcanus, mystical world, extended caves, and ... I think that's it?  Loss of functionality aside, the effect was pretty neat. Kind of like the midnight was encroaching into the overworld, with tall spires of nightstone, dotted with mushrooms and other flora.
I do have a retina display.  Scale was set to 1:1.

thankyou
Added next lines:   Will send the logs, when it crash. Is this enough?  Uhh. Last time it crashed in android emulator after reload (RR). On my phone (Galaxy S8), as I remember, crashed when started from launcher. But will test it in different situations.
It's a bug in my configuration, it just happens the other mods are more tolerant with metadata = -1.
The workaround should work. I pushed the correction, I just need to repackage the plugin and upload it. I'll do that this weekend.

This is crashing when I access a folder on the server, I don't see any logs at /settings/admin/logging or in /var/www/nextcloud or in /var/log, but I would expect to for a server-side problem. Since re-uploading one of the folders the problem has gone away for that folder, so now the problem is specific to just one certain folder.  Creating a test account would only work if you had access to this folder, wouldn't it?

> The implementation seems to have gone away from this plan and made the false assumption that it can somehow 'fence' the data being written so it can use the same file.  It doesn't reuse the file. It marks it as read-only and then it gets its length so it can compute the starting offset of the next file. If that (older) file's length changes afterwards due to a concurrent write finishing off, then the offsets will not match the sum of lengths before that.  There is, however, a way by which the file is indeed used. After a successful open-write (fencing), the Segment's files are auto-compacted. This means that empty files are deleted (except last one, since it was just created), and multiple files are concatenated into the first file, to avoid having an excessive number of smaller files sitting around.  > use the appropriate naming scheme so that the ambiguity does not exist in the first place.  We are using the naming scheme we originally agreed upon. But it gets very hairy in some cases. Suppose you have this, for segment "a" (this assumes no auto-compaction is done, to explain how the very very original proposal would've worked):

Hi Serge. I'm on Impala 2.x.  I struggled a bit writing this statement, because Impala does not accept the other way of escaping quotes (quote-quote) and Dbeaver insisted in coloring my statement in this way.  My reference is https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/cdh/5-0-x/Impala/Installing-and-Using-Impala/ciiu_literals.html which says "Use the backslash to escape single or double quotation mark characters within a string literal"
> Can you please give me the password for the zip file and also the code you used? I have not been able to reproduce this issue with some sample zip files which have directories in it. For me ZipInputStream works fine.  The password is password. The code I used is:  Did I use it in a wrong way? I also tried copying your code on the readme.md, didn't work either. Another issue I found is when I tried to read the password protected zip files on hdfs, I need to wrap the FSDataInputStream with BufferedInputStream or BytesInputStream. Otherwise it won't read anything. I know this API is only for the local files. Perhaps the problem is on the hdfs side. Anyway, thank you for you reply and help.
I was checking #3162 and it references about  reshare options only in files. So maybe it is a regression because folders are showing too.

I do not think that it is a memory issue. CPU is not busy at all; we see no GC activity in our logs. And no progress is made until we restart Elasticsearch (for ~30 minutes).
The difference seems to be Micrometer **tags**.

I already had 2 HD accounts, both non-empty, and created third one, with nothing on it, of course. Then I selected it, pressed "Delete" in menu, and that just deleted its label but left the account row itself that says "Contains one private key." I think  HD account can only be deleted if it has no transaction history (the "Delete" option is not available for my other accounts), but in this particular case the account was empty and it didn't work out.

If the property exists type declaration (eg: ?Class), assign null, it does not detect if necessary. If the assignment is not null, only use empty() for testing.  These may not be a good idea  My English is not very good.
  Then if I make a change to templates/date.html and refresh the browser the change is not shown.  Of course changes to the ratpack.groovy script refresh fine.  Also touching the ratpack.groovy script will cause the cache to be discarded so the template change will show up.  I don't think changing the cacheSize to default to zero is a great idea but is a reasonable workaround for simple dev purposes.  The behavior I'd like to see is for the template file timestamp to be checked and compared to the cache's timestamp for that template with a switch to disable the timestamp checking.  I was looking at the code and started to work up a patch, but I don't have time to finish it at the moment.  I think the easiest way to implement this is to change the compiledTemplateCache to Cache<String, CompiledTemplate> and make the key be the timestamp + separator + file path.  The timestamp will just be 0 when checking is disabled.  Would you like me to finish the patch and submit it later or is something you want to deal with yourself?

I don't have a generic client for a generic server, but reproducing it with 1 javascript client is fairly easy: - have javascript client connect up as polling (IE-11 should do) - After connect use javascript toInterval to emit a message every 10ms   I tried 500ms, 250ms, 100ms  no luck.... 10ms does it you get piggy backs quite regularly.   I have code handling it in the spot I indicate above and am able to see the piggy-backed messages with no issue. and (as you'd expect) it varies: - ping piggybacked on emit. - 2 emits are piggy backed sometimes - emit piggybacked on ping  my piggyback code handles as many piggy backs until end of content, but I'm only seeing ~2 msgs per content tops.

Sure, one moment 
is it possible that the icon attribute uses glyphicons and not font awesome?  that could explain why i only get a limited subset of icons.  when i just looked at the glyphicons list a lot of the icons are identical with the same name.  i will try to verify this.
Sure, I can file provide a fix with unit tests for this issue on 2.2.x branch and file a pull request.

>Could you tell me the value of System.getProperty("apple.laf.useScreenMenuBar","false") on your machine?  It is set. As you see on the screenshots above it does work (see bulenkov/darcula where the menu is not present). I launch JMeter with exactly the same command, and the only difference is different themes.  Note: the application itself does not modify useScreenMenuBar property, and the property is passed during the startup: https://github.com/apache/jmeter/blob/cfb2bd92acf19123ae8a0de32ca60a46f5a85043/src/dist/build.gradle.kts#L520 
I tried it with that app as well right after I made my last comment. It failed. It said the QR code was invalid (I don't remember the exact message, but I can get that if necessary) and gave numbers the plugin rejected when I attempted to manually enter the code (with 6 digits, SHA256 settings).
It was a few days ago and happened several times during this day. I would have to re-check if the problem still exists...

Had to extend the OpenLayers.WMSGetFeatureInfo-control for this a bit cause by default it only allows to either request only one layer or request multiple layers via drilldown (while the latter case leads to grouping of layers with the same URL).  Are there any plans for GeoWebCache to be able to handle GetFeatureInfo-requests for multiple layers in the future? I understand that this is not trivial when the layers are from different sources. This would mean that GeoWebCache would have to trigger separate requests instead of just cascading the request to a single source. In addition the responses from the separate sources would have to be combined into one response by GeoWebCache to send it back to the client. 
Hi @janpio, thanks for looking into it. I contacted the company too and they should be looking into it. However, in their defense, the plugin was working until a couple of days ago. I started encountering the issue around 16th November, give and take a day or too. Used to work with the latest cordova and and plugin version up till then, I believe being Cordova 8, cordova-android 7.1.1 and and plugin version 6.1.0.  Re your error being different, the difference is induced when adding the  cordova-android-support-gradle-release plugin and forcing a dependency of support libraries version 27 and upwards.  
No it was on an existing db. But some of them may trigger exceptions on indexing - it may be related ? Will do more testing to identify the issue. I have observed this errors 7 times this week. 
Yea, I think I can make that work by using 5 clients with 2e9 operations each, and pointing them at different tables.

Works for me, thank you @soundTricker. 
Only about 1/3 of the nodes before we got warnings about disk space. 
I use latest version 0.14.1 but before some time ago I had another old release and had same problem
@vibhusharma101 the PR is yet to be merged that's why the issue still exists in the app. Once it is done it will be fixed.
Thanks for your support! So here is the first one with "--Full" where German is not working and English is working. Below I have attached another one where both streams are working with my setup - hope that helps.

Yes, I can access the Web UI through my phone. I can even access qBittorrent through your app but only if I specify the Local IP address of my server through the standard settings, not the advanced settings.  As you can see I have gotten your app working:  ![working app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4989354/18768401/35651e0e-8125-11e6-9d53-168e0ee5b377.png)  The problem I have is I keep having to change the IP address setting here between my external internet IP address when I am not at home, and my local IP address when I am at home:  ![settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4989354/18768427/5864551e-8125-11e6-882a-008f11a34e32.png)  What I would like is for the app to correctly use the advanced settings I have specified here so that when I am connected via my WiFi network it uses the Local IP address I have specified.  ![advanced settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4989354/18768432/5e582900-8125-11e6-8b43-fda3d7abd6b3.png)  Currently v4.4.0 of qBittorrent Controller Pro ignores the advanced settings for a local IP address. 🙁  
Not yet. I managed to remove @Test annotated methods on the tests. But it is still not working on the spartanizer. I am still working on it.

> @nirodg - thanks. It appears that the problem is related to the use of a generic collection where the scanner is unable to determine the type of the collection type parameter (e.g. `ENTITY` in `List<ENTITY>` and it is not falling back to `object`. Would you mind to push a simple project to Github that demonstrates the class hierarchy being used?  I see. I do have [an example project](https://github.com/nirodg/dodo-example) where its shown it's usage- I will soon update it due to the changes I've done in the lib, but it does give a clear idea.   Here is the definition of the API endpoint https://github.com/nirodg/dodo-example/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/brage/dodo/example/rs/api/CarRestService.java  Here the implementation and where all injections occurs https://github.com/nirodg/dodo-example/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/brage/dodo/example/rs/services/CarRestServiceBean.java  Currently I'm porting my library to Quarkus and I'm wandering if it a problem of getting properly the generics via reflection or a problem due to the open-api lib.    Many thanks in advance for checking this out, @MikeEdgar !  PS. If needed I can quickly setup a quarkus project with the exact implementation so the NPE happens. 
Hmm I don't remember how we fixed it - I think we worked it around at the time by using the index of the elements.  I'm seeing this kind of issues on 'Block * trackers' switch in new Privacy & Security submenu as well.  ` UiObject blockAnalyticTrackerEntry = TestHelper.settingsList.getChild(new UiSelector()                 .className("android.widget.LinearLayout")                 .instance(2)); ` and `         UiObject blockSocialTrackerEntry = TestHelper.settingsList.getChild(new UiSelector()                 .className("android.widget.LinearLayout")                 .instance(3)); ` refers to same element (analytic tracker switch), although uiautomatorviewer says the latter one points to the social tracker block switch. I have to change the .instance() index to  4 from 3 to toggle the social tracker.  Really a mystery.
I cannot reproduce the bug anymore , so I'm closing the issue. Thank you. 
Hi @sabbyanandan.  Thank you for your help. I'll try to describe the process...  Steps: 1) I've registered previusly a task app, that only shows date-time into a loop for ten minutes.     All seems ok. App registered ok.  2) I deploy the task app date-time, it is  launching without scheduler, applying into "--parameters" textfield from web:   4) And, if i do the same deply, removing  "deployer.*.kubernetes.entryPointStyle=exec" param is running  ok. 
I don't have permission plugin in my login server.
Hello,  This issue is no longer replicated,  Thanks
I'll do you one better. I recorded this and threw it on Youtube.  https://youtu.be/TWooGfy0P7Y  As you see from the video, it works right at the start but then it won't let the cart pass going the other way. This leads me to believe that I am doing something wrong but I can't seem to figure out what.  I am using it in a modpack... Could that be the issue? 
Thanks for your reply!  1. I'm using Firefox on Windows and Ubuntu 2. The warning was thrown by TeXtidote  In general, the problem is solved for me, I'm fine with using my Linux machine for the spell check. But I'm happy to provide you with more information, in case you intend to dig deeper into it :)  Btw, thank you very much for your amazing tool! It's much more convenient than the other solutions for using languagetool on tex files (including TeXstudio)!
@nemonster This is working! 
it will wait forever I tried to play around with the kill parameter already  the container itself is stopped at this time so just the feedback seems not to work 
we are on 4.20 
Yes, this is for the Tablet release only.  It needs to be addressed.  Corporate developers still contact support about this issue. 
I tried 0.13.5 with my project and it seems to work.  Thanks for the quick fix.
I agree with you something strange happened, I will investigate this deeply later. Maybe we are in the case we have an ongoing handshake with read epoch = 1 (just after the change cipher spec) and so no established session... (so we have an ongoing handshake bu read epoch is not equal to record.epoch)  But in all case, I think this code should be as robust as possible. And any CLIENT_HELLO with epoch =0 should restart an handshake. This will avoid any blocking state. 
This is my Full screen activity, small player activity have above onPause and onStop:-  
> I have drafted a fix for this. Could you try out the attached snapshot build to see if it works for you? [#596 (comment)](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/596#issuecomment-484120761)  Thanks for the quick response. Unfortunately it behaves the same way.
Hi,  I do not see weird htaccess access. I use lighttpd 1.4.35 web server, all configuration is fine an Ok double checked everything, did not make any changes since several months! 
Ah yes, saw the javadocs now. But only 1 method appears in the hawtio console, so perhaps they are getting mixed together somewhere.  We are using Camel 2.13.2. Sorry for not mentioning earlier. I'll try upgrading to see if it makes a difference. 
We do not _need_ it, but since we already have Git mirrors on SourceForge (e.g. for Fiji) we might just as well keep them up-to-date, no? Should be relatively easy, too. 
Dunno, doesn't seem like a very logical place. The CMR only does lookups and downloads, it knows nothing about sources and making packages. We might use the common package that will be introduced in M4 perhaps? 
If client always request this abnormal message, it will cause the edge service to die.The log will print Exception info: Too many open files.
Yeah, give me a minute to launch the game. Also, as another note, the auto GUI setting is actually bigger than large in my case. 
Sorry for not responding earlier, I needed to investigate more.  It seems the MediaInfoLib is not multilingual. It only handles "raw" and English names. So it does not matter what language you set, you will only get the English names (or the "raw" ones) if you use the library (which is UMS case).  The translations to other languages are part of the MediaInfo executable and not the library. Unless I am totally mistaken of course.  To answer your question: we can of course set the UMS language there. But it does not matter, it will work exactly the same than with the hardcoded "en".    
2016.06.09 on samsung s4-mini  Interesting....  This is the only found cache out of 1600, which resists to show me the found date.  I guessed because of the leap day. This is the only particularity.  Any suggestions?  
Windows 7 64 and Java 6. The client was loading for me this morning by the way, this started happening after the 6 hour reload. 
Updated MyController to Version 1.2.0.Final  Rebooting the test node, I get the same behavior on Resources logs detail, but a slightly different error message on the server log...  This one actually says "properties=null" but I have no idea what that means in this context. Also, I notice the payload= 010003003F03 does not coincide with the resources log where I have [Firmware config request] 010003004003B7040102 and [Firmware config response] 010003004003E669     ### Server Log 
Wait, I am an idiot. There has to be a valid target to cast a cipher card before you can encode it. Not a bug! 
I think that including a low res icon to be used on older phones sounds like an easy solution.  The problem is  how to have a single APK that uses raster on old API and vector on new API.  I need to do research to see how to do it or if it's possible.  Using VectorDrawableCompat would also require research, because my earlier conclusion was that it might not work the same for _launch_ icons (as opposed to icons within the application).  So, yeah, digging is required. 
I added a commit to my branch that should, in theory, test for this fix, but I can't seem to get it to work, and I'm not sure if it's my weak gradle skills, or what. 
> Do you think we should also trigger it for release?  No, I would keep this as a manual task (is it in our Wiki?) as sometimes I do something stupid while building release. ;) 
ok. the title has been modified.
Correct, these are simple queries without GROUP BY.  The query looks something like this:   
Have to correct myself: Only two are archived due to woodwork. The others are residing so I was wrong. So just archived caches that are still shown on map. After killing c:geo through task manager the disc icon from the one archived disappeared.  So it is just that archived stay on map. Is this expected?  I wait for my dropbox to upload photos from yesterdays event and then I will provide screenshots.  Changed title. 
that's the tricky question ;-) any suggestions?  
The entry in `WORKSPACE`:    should demonstrate the issue. There may be one reason, when this may make sense - when you use `my.BUILD/my` from different repos. 
Yes I have, but I was still not seeing the messages sent to Event Viewer. No worries, I'll just use JNA for now. 
yeah, just figured it out ... 
Regarding(1) perhaps I was using and older java compiler so it complained. All of my stuff is in Eclipse/Helios and previous version of java.   Regarding data. Perhaps you can just  hop over to Bobst  and get the larger files and put it on a USB stick. I'm guessing that the data you are using is not really good for testing because it may miss several types of data such as IPO messages, trading halts or limit down/limit up cases. It would have been much better for nasdaq to provide a dataset that has all the messages combinations  in it for testing purposes. This would in fact be less than 1k.   Regarding (3) and (4). ok. if it works then it works, but I thought I should ask.   In general most of the mistakes I found in your stuff was by gut feel. i.e. "nah... that does not seem right". It also comes from working with the data from another source which was in character format not binary so I could read the raw data into a text editor. (See www.tradingphysics.com or lobsterdata.com for data.) Both of these sources suffer from the fact they are not using itch 5.0 data and leave out important things such as order imbalance messages. Tradingphysics data does not have nanoseconds (it has milliseconds). so when one calculates the difference between the time the order entered to when it was deleted, you get 0 instead of say 500 nanoseconds.   In regards to (4), I was passing some argument parameters and the compiler complained about mixing integer and long. So that was purely by accident.  
I seems like the root cause of the indefinite waiting is that after I click "save as draft", the site is not redirected to integrations, and rather the view stays on the new integration page. The indefinite waiting occurs after second click on "save as draft", which seems to try to create the integration, which already exists. This occurs in the log:  {{ 2018-02-16 09:51:45,245 INFO [CurrentFlow] Error saving integration: {   "_body": "[{\"error\":\"UniqueProperty\",\"message\":\"Value 'test' is not unique\",\"property\":\"create.obj.name\"}]",   "status": 400,   "ok": false,   "statusText": "Bad Request", }}  Full log is attached.

I dont know what you need to see from my setup, so i have just taken a few to show you. :) 2 minnutes before stopping the reactor with the lvls it has now, its core was 100% full and had about 38 ingots in its acceses port. So you can see in the pics how much was used that fast.  It seems to happen pretty regually, though i havnt confirmed that yet. (No more yellowrite :P)  The server is running SolitaryCraft from ATLauncher, newest update. http://www.atlauncher.com/pack/SolitaryCraft/ So that means its running with: Bigreactors v. 0.4.0rc8 CoFHCore v 3.0.0.B6-26 Forge v, 10.13.0.1207  Regarding config and server setup, it is just standart as they come in SolitaryCraft. We have disabled a few mods, like 3d Furnice and Dog Talents, but nothing that has anything to do with bigreactors.  Let me know if there is more info you need...  ![br3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8850655/4349018/7e9b81c4-41a5-11e4-83d7-b8ec7d838210.jpg) ![br1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8850655/4349019/7e9f9584-41a5-11e4-8bc7-32b3f5d6fe45.jpg) ![br2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8850655/4349017/7e9b1aa4-41a5-11e4-9b3f-786b221b26d3.jpg) 
Hi, @danieldietrich ,  Thank you for your quick response!  I see and agree with that storing the hash lazily _can_ have a significant memory overhead. Maybe it would make sense in Scala, a language that has native support for lazy fields, where most of the overhead (the `Lazy` instance, the lambda for the supplier, the `Integer` instance, and thus the implications on GC) would not be present. The fact that Scala's immutable collections don't do this is a good sign that, even in Scala, it still doesn't worth it _generally_.  When the benefits do outweigh the above overhead, such a wrapper class that you proposed seems perfectly feasible to me. We'll consider implementing that class given that our measurements confirm that it worths doing so. As a wise man once said: "Measure, don't premature!"  The fix for this issue in master is perfectly fine by me, and I'm looking forward towards your next release. :) Until then, we'll stick to your snapshot builds.  Keep up the good work! 
@intrications Thanks for your quick answer.  I can confirm that the server used is the regular Librelio server.  @Ageleswari Did you change something in the Android code? 
I apologize for the delay. I just got around to re-adding .gitignore I did an install of 2.3.2, and the issue persists. I was unable to retrieve a crash log after a Force Quit.
The all jar as in the one that has them all in one?

Hi, I changed my setup step by step to eliminate potential culprits.  1) removed Guava 15 from dependencies: problem still exists 2) set max memory to 4 GB: problem still exists 3) set min memory to 4 GB: problem still exists 4) upgraded to JDK 1.8.0_92-b14: problem still exists 5) used your System.err.println statements: problem gone.  Looks like a timing issue, because the logging slows everything down. In a second test, I redirected the output to a file on a SSD with same result: the problem is gone. Then I removed most of your logging statements and voila: problem is back.  It smells like a race condition where you have to have bad luck with timing. 
I try to do so after i tested the new orespawn Version through.

No, they just get attacked. They only get 1 damage per attack, but the mobs never fight back. They're in open spaces, and the damage only occurs near a potential pet. 
Do we need to throw an intermittent exception? Perhaps just at startup (or when it fails) is enough?

Take a Notifier block in the designer, and pull out the property setter, which has textColor and BackgroundColor in the dropdown.  Use the dropdown switch between textColor and backgroundColor and look at the tooltip.  It does not change when you change the dropdown selection.

As a matter of fact, it is. However, in theory, shouldn't the `Recombinator` work for any population size greater than or equal to 2? I noticed that even with a population size of 50 and an offspring fraction of 0.5, it sometimes still produced one such instance every generation where an individual is recombined with itself. It seems that with the current implementation, there is always a chance (smaller as the population size is increased), this situation occurs. At [Retest](https://retest.de/) we use Jenetics to implement our genetic algorithm with the goal of optimizing test suites for multiple objectives. The population we currently deal with is relatively small. The altered offsprings are evaluated each time which is expensive. Hence, we would like to avoid this situation.  Can the current selection mechanism within the `Recombinator` class be improved? We would be glad to help.
Hi, I've tried another time: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20456461/69242737-d0dce880-0ba1-11ea-9904-0467bc808e1e.png)  The error now is changed This is the configuration:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20456461/69242778-e6eaa900-0ba1-11ea-9613-0a73c7d66913.png)  Certificate and Key imported from ~/go/bin/.
The problem is as I discussed about the filtering. It's not a question of does the expanded search find a node or not, it's does the expanded search find a node that _passes_ my filter. Inside of **findClosest** the **findNetworkEntries** returns a set of node ids, then we loop through these nodes using the edge explorer and the supplied filter. The basic search does not find a node that passes my filter so **findClosest** returns a "null" **QueryResult**. If I try and expand the search further I still don't find my node because no matter what value of **maxRegionSearch**, **findNetworkEntries** returns the first set of nodes that it finds but I already know those don't pass my filter, so once again they don't pass my filter and I get a "null" result. Here is the code in my app that I use to wrap **findClosest** to get my result. I feel like this could be easily incorporated into LocationIndexTree itself if it makes sense to others. And then it would be clear that there is a link between the search and the filtering. I would be happy to write this up as a pull request if you agree.   
hmm thats odd, with the same setup as you I see a GsonAdapter with the following code:    I think the issue is that the GsonAdapter is doing `isSolved` because the method is called `isSolved` 
I leave the original file in the original folder.
Sorry, for not mentioning that this is from JabRef to LibreOffice Writer (version 5.0.5.2), so there is no .tex file. I can whip up a .bib file if that would be helpful, however.  By "in-text citation," I mean the writing signifying that a work has been cited that appears in the body of a document. So if this were part of a journal article that I used JabRef (Team 2015) to help me create a bibliography for, the in-text citation would be "(Team 2015)". [Though ideally it should be "(JabRef Development Team 2015)".]

@milosonator Just downloaded the newest build and it still does not work unfortunately. Thanks for your reply :smile:  
Stepping through it in the debugger, in `RestClient:discoverNodes()` it adds each node with:  `hosts.add(StringUtils.parseIpAddress(inet).toString());`  `parseIpAddress` doesn't seem to understand the format in the response from the server, which is in the format `foo.bar.amazonaws.com/10.10.0.23:9200`  I can definitely connect to both the hostname, and the ip, from the Spark cluster. 
I think it was a validation error. (Collection cannot be used.) But I will try to reproduce it.

I do not see anything which could make a difference.  It is hard to tell anything from the above information. The best would be to try to reproduce it. Though I don't have much time to take care of it. I will talk about it within a team to see if it is possible to take it into a sprint.

Hi @yinfeiru ,  1) I agree that this is not a memory leakage because I can garbage collect the memory. 2-3) However, my concern is more about the constant increase of allocated memory until we reach the heap size and the device automcall the GC. During my test, I just initialize Mixpanel with the `MixpanelAPI.getInstance(my_context, MIXPANEL_TOKEN);` call. I don't send push notification, track events or whatever else.  If I use the exact same application and login with the exact same account, while the app is in the foreground :  - Android 4 devices : memory allocation is constant - Android 5 devices : memory continuously increase   I can do some test for you as needed, but it seems that we can focus our investigation on Android 5+   Just let me know if you need more information !  Thanks.

`coreutils` are installed, it's just that the macOS version of `readlink` doesn't have a `-f` option. 
I don't think so, because this is not the behavior in a standard text field, and I've not seen it on other text fields (which of course RTF field UI developers have to wrap with javascript to make the magic happen).  Indeed I just checked here on Github by clicking Edit on my original post above, and if it were an overall browser/env issue, one might expect it to occur here as well, but it did not.  Mac El Capitan 10.11.6 / Chrome Version 61.0.3163.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)  I could try another browser/OS some time, but in the meantime, I just wanted to call it to someone's attention that this is the behavior I observed.
I was in the middle of development of some feature and needed to make fast debugging session of master. I had to commit my changes, checkout to master, recompile master to debug. And then checkout my branch, recompile it to continue my work. With codenvy it is even worse because I have to do all of that for 2 repos. 
First thing I tried.. sorry.. no result.. 
I updated the version and now it works. Thank you for your help!
@kirwan Hi, I checked one more time and it has to be the application context. `ImagePipelineConfig config = ImagePipelineConfig.newBuilder(this)         .setRequestListeners(requestListeners).build();         Fresco.initialize(this, config);` These lines are what I have in my application class, the only place where the initialization is done. Could be something wrong there? 
I will give it another try. I have already spent a few minutes looking into the bug... 
I have been using ZAP 2.6.0 for normal use. When I'm debugging I have been using the development build pulled last week.   About the workaround, do you refer to the following steps? 1. Enable global HTTP session tracking 2. Open the request editor 3. Select the cookie "Use current tracking session" 4. Disable global HTTP session tracking 5. Send request  In my attempts, this has been able to send the request in "ignore_cookie" mode (in the dev build).   To answer your question, I think the request editor should not use any http state (and thus use the ignore_cookie mode) unless the user enables the option "use global HTTP session tracking", then it should use the global state (therefore using the "browser_compatibility" option or the "default" option (I think it is defaulted to rfc_2109?)).  I must say I do not fully understand the difference between the global http states and the non-global variant, could you elaborate on this? What is the functional use of a non-global http state tracking in the request editor?
Hmm. I've tried refreshing/F5ing after the "Failed to run" message several times today, as well as deleting and recreating an entirely new workspace with the same stack and repeatedly launching that as well. No luck so far, same failure mode every time.  Is there anywhere else I can look for error logs than that bottom pane that appears while the workspace is starting?

Not sure this is the equivalent:    I think the problem here lies in the fact that the server time is slightly more in the future than the client time.   Notice the 1000ms sleep time - we are after the `date` sent from the server.

I think it is probably wrong to generate a "mulitpart/form-data" content type without the boundary parameter. It should default to something even if user does not provide it.

It is the Jiayu S3 with mediatek MT6752 SOC. The ROM is a custom AOSP one.  Can you or anyone confirm if termux works on other android 7.1 phones/ROMs?
This is caused by Tinkers' changing the parameters of a certain method in the latest update. Unfortunately, the only way to solve this is to just not use either Construct's Armory or the latest Tinkers' Construct version until I can push out an update, which I plan to do tonight as soon as I can.
Here's a test:    The last 3 assertions in mapClassWithTransientFields currently fail, but pass if MapperOptions.actLikeSerializable is set to true by default.

It did conflict with Mystcraft, can´t remember which version I did use the first time. Who is reserving the ID´s at the wrong time I can´t tell, but my guess is that XCompWiz have more experiences on this area ;-)  But my biggest issue was that I needed to update the config file on the client and server side to fix this. If you enter a CM and the config file on the client side is not set to the same dimension as the server side this happened.  Just let me know if there is any more information you need :-) 
I had 6.4.10 and I tried updating to 6.4.11. Problem was in both. And yes, I have Optifine (version OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_U_B5)  (Minecraft 1.7.10) 
Hi Hernan,  okay - no worries.  We're supplying "openid name email" in the scope now and we get back a valid firebase token.  Another thing I noticed in that code that looks a bit off is this in the `delegationWithOptions` method:    Thanks for getting back to us so quickly.  -Richard

I understand that large structures need a lot of bandwith to synchronize but why is an upload required? My upload speed is about 110kb/s and during login or teleport to that area the client does use almost the complete upload speed. So of course the client needs to download the whole structure and that takes some time. But why does the client "reupload" almost the same data (it did not have it before the teleport/login of course).

I am in 4.4.2 android (kitkat) and 1.5.4.2 version mgit, and I got it from play store. Thanks.

There are 3 transceivers.  One sends power only.  One receives items only, and had 2 chests on 2 sides.  The 3rd one, that created the error, was attached to the quarry, and receives power and sends items.  After this error, the world would not even load; the server would crash.  I used MCedit to remove the quarry and transceiver (I could see the location of the ticking entity in the crash log), and then was able to load the world.  I then noticed that the transceiver that receives items mistakenly had a 2nd chest adjacent to it, and removed it so that only 1 chest remained.  From that chest ME cable is connected to import into an AE network.  I then placed the quarry and transceiver again, and no problems.  There was severe tick lag just prior to the crash. 
no. no warning. and when i get more connection again it doesn't resume updating. 
Sorry it looks like the problem was mine, launching the process from command line shows low usage like expected.  I was launching JsCover via.. Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(execParams);  There appears to be something wrong my launching code that is causing the process to take up tons on CPU.   
that is exactly what I mean. But it looks like the stargate ring is there, too. Below it. Seems like both at the same time, so to say, because one or two ring / chevron blocks are usually missing and you can see the ring there. 
Seems fixed in 0.6.2  Can't reproduce.

@martinbonnin Thanks you for your reply. I used apollo-android v 1.2.1 and it worked.
I will try to reproduce this on similar environment. If there is any progress, i will update it here. 
Thanks for the comments.  I got the plugins from here, Yeah Chest terminal is not working at all, but lucky blocks works fine they just cant make them but they can open them.  If I knew where in the code it was looking at the recipe for the Autocrafter I may be able to fix it, but its strange that its the only machine that cant take in heads. It can output them just not input them.
Hi Jürgen, Paul asked me to open a github issue instead of a rt ticket so others can comment on this problem.  I have admin access to the machines yes, All the machines hosting DOMA test pools are concerned. I tried to find some trace of failed transfers files but I couldn't find anything relevant. The file does not appear in pool listing (rep ls) nor in the /data on the machine.  Paul thought about a problem with cancelled HTTP-TPC transfers with space-manager enabled.

Thanks for the timeout explanation.  What about detecting and reacting to the change in master? (It is a separate issue from the timeout.)  Thanks again.

Proposal:   **Code style** We can use default style of Android Studio with following tweaks:  - Maximum consecutive blank lines: 1 - Blank lines before closing brace '}': 0  *Note*: Default Android Studio style uses spaces for indentation instead of tabs. Let me know if you prefer tabs.  **License** - For files which don't have **any** license/copyright header, add GPLv3 header with your name. - For files which **only** have your name, add GPLv3 header too. - We can also add GPLv3 header to XML files if thats okay with you.  Remaining files are attributed to Michael A. MacDonald. I believe these are under GPLv2 license but I could not find a definitive answer. If these files are licensed under GPLv2, we can add GPLv2 or GPLv3 (whichever you prefer) header.  **Refactoring** I am refactoring `VNCConn` to remove dependency on `VncCanvas`. It will allow us to keep `VNCConn` alive across activity restarts so that we can enable rotation of `VncCanvasActivity`.  Thanks. 
for current version ,one request contains 2 exit span and 3 local span for above image. I think `AsyncThread/excute` and `/test` are enough (one local and one exit)
OK, I've updated it.      Just tested again by placing redstone block in the ground and putting a piston (alternated with piston/sticky piston) on top.  Did it via both survival and creative modes.  No issues.   Can confirm this appears to be resolved.  Closing issue as resolved. 
Hi @hiroyuki-sato   With Verify. I mean it should check the syntax of the dig before pushing. What happens I think is the version number updates but the code still stays the same. I'm going to run a few more tests today to get the correct steps to replicate.  Rejecting push command when old revision is running is a good feature but I have not encountered this.
Tried it with a unit, too. Same result 
I mean gateway received the `CloseWebSocketFrame` of client, but don't send it to the backend.
It basically stopped placing blocks.  Say for the building gadget, the ghost preview of the placement of a column would render but when right clicking nothing would occur.  No blocks would be removed from inventory, nothing would render into the world, and no blocks would be placed.  I've got some free time today to try to isolate and repeat the issue.
tl;dr - same effect.  I've copied the JSON into a separate file (test.json) and changed my request line as suggested and have a breakpoint on the call to nashorn.eval(exp) in Script::evalInNashorn(yaddah...) where exp is "read('test.json')". The Object that's returned by nashorn is a JsonContext containing a LinkedHashMap 'json' in which the LinkedHashMap entry that contains the value 'Söze' containing the ö is a char[4] array [83, **246**, 122, 101] so the decoding looks to be happening either when the file is read or when nashorn is evaluating the JSON. 
 it's start sucessfull
Here's the screenshot:  ![Screenshot_2020-01-23-20-02-55-966_cgeo geocaching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54314831/73020127-e5956100-3e1c-11ea-9258-f8db98e34cff.jpg)   I should add that, since my first post, I've managed to bypass the problem by uninstalling Locus Map Pro. At first, nothing happened, but then I noticed that the maps folder was set to the Locus map offline folder, although I kept setting it to the maps folder. In other words, the Maps folder you see in the previous screenshot ("Pasta de Temas de Mapas") was actually the Locus offline map folder when you opened it.  Still, I had Locus Map Pro app installed in my previous phones, and this never happened.
I asked TLove (I'm making the pack for him) and he's cool with me sharing it with you. Keep in mind it's still in development. Is there an email I can send you the link in? Being closed beta, I shouldn't let everyone who see's the issue, have the pack. I could just have Blu or TLove relay it to you. 
It is now saved as public, but I still cannot delete it.
hey ojw28, yup, seems to be a duplicate - I will use the search next time, sorry ;) I'll use the original issue for further comments on the issue 
Minecraft version: 1.12.2 AS version: 1.7 Forge version: 1.12.2-14.23.0.2512  I assumed that losing infusion was intentional due to the last line in the "Infused Crystal Tools" chapter in the book (in Constellation; line reads "However, that also comes with the possibility that the liquid might be drained at some point..."). I've noted twice now that occasionally, when using the sword rapidly (i.e. against >10 mobs), it will convert from "Infused Crystal Sword" to "Crystal Sword," retaining all of its enchantments, size, purity, and current cutting. Advanced tooltips also show that the item is converted from astralsorcery:itemchargedcrystalsword to astralsorcery:itemcrystalsword.  I did just update AS to 1.7.2 yesterday, and have yet to have this happen again, but I haven't really used the sword much since then. I will see if I can replicate the issue.

But the decorator adds a constraint to one of its argument that make the decorator more strict than the interface. If you remove the link ControllerDecorator ---|> Controller, the Get works.

@samtstern  Yes. I observed that while working on [`FirebaseRecyclerPagingAdaper`](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/version-4.4.0-dev/database/src/main/java/com/firebase/ui/database/paging/FirebaseRecyclerPagingAdapter.java).  I did an experiment: - When I added this line   `mDataSource.observeForever(mDataSourceObserver)` Then after calling `getValue()` on `mDataSource` doesn't returned a null value  - When I commented the code of `observeForever` Then `mDataSource.getValue()` always returned a null value.  By observing this, maybe LiveData not hold values if nobody is observing
The uninstall or reset all app data via Appmanager in the Android settings (or wait three days). The important thing is that between the first and the second part of the sequence you don't use the same caches (or clean the cache cache). Or simply only fo the second part of the sequence after a reinstall. 
@eivantsov using https://github.com/minishift/minishift/tree/master/addons/che and have not provided any GitHub clientID and secret nor registered an app on the GitHub side ... seeing `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` only now - I guess one needs to set those, and then it works? :smile: Sorry. Let's close this, and I'll try with that, and re-open if still NOK.
I don't know a way to suppress the warnings however would it be possible to check if the OS being ran is android and to do something else?  
You're right, `./gradlew runIDE`.  I'm debugging a program within the plugin. If I run gdb session in terminal with the same args then gdb stops at the breakpoint.

If a fragment declares an InjectExtra annotation field, there is no way that Henson can detected it when building the DSL of the activity(ies) that will contain the fragment.

Hi,  you just made your point :)  You are 100% right, so this part is producing exception:    So I have Eureka UP, and Cloud-Config UP and my first microService UP. Starting Spring Boot Admin, in a debug mode, I've put break-point in `for` and I see that `discoveryClient.getServices()` has two elements. That was expected, I guess :) Eureka anyway shouldn't be in this list.  So elements are: - my microService and - cloud config server.  Method `registry.register(convert(instance));` pass OK for my microService, while 2nd service,  cloud config server, fails on that method `registry.register(convert(instance));`.  Error is same as I've already posted, so I don't want to repeat myself. `java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String`

Thanks for such quick response! I appreciate it!   I have encountered that while building response just for tests.  In real world there always (or usually) are headers (or header) present. I've just found inconsistency in logic. There was not a null check for headers and after that there was an operation on the map assuming that headers are present, but there is a possibility to build response without them. As a result there was a NPE thrown without any meaningful information. 
@bleskes  no, we don't set that. should it better to set it? 
If the minimum number of clusters is set to kmin=10 **(we modified a little bit the original algorithm)**, the algorithm may return a lower number of clusters. This is due to this sorting bug.
Yes, I can confirm. There is a large case statement. 
Yes its still got some bugs for me. When ever someone issues the command /tictactoe accept [playername] by pressing the words in the chat. It will work but it will seed them an unknown command message for some reason. Also if Player 2 who received an invite to play from player 1 accepts then leaves mid game --> If Player 2 then invites Player 1 to a game. When Player 1 presses accept, it will say that he doesn't have a pending request from player 2.  This is really hard to explain. I tried to show in the video. Im now running the latest version .14 and its still having issues. Even if both players are OP'ed with all privileges.   Im happy to arrange a time for you to come on my server and see for yourself if that helps.
I don't have the stackctrace. The exception is thrown in ResultMapping.validate below. The bug is probably caused when the variable column is set to null in MapperBuildAssistant shown above.  Thanks   
See [here](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-camel/tree/master/itests/standalone/docker/src/main/java/org/wildfly/camel/test). Basically to test stuff that relies on some external resources being available.
Sorry, It leaves no stack trace beside this one :      +1: java.lang.NullPointerException         at org.milyn.javabean.gen.ConfigGenerator.main(ConfigGenerator.java:72)  when I launch it in Eclipse I can see that on line 72 there is       outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs();  when I inspect `outputFile.getParentFile()` it is `null` though the `outputfile` variable is holding  a genuine `File` instance. 
@misaochan So actually the crash was obtained initially when I built from an outdated master. So I pulled fresh changes and built it and tried it again. And the crash persists and happens every time I hit the deny button on the run-time permission dialog.   Replacing the fragment with a dialog would be simple enough but yeah lets hear from the others as well. 
it is mostly certificates files which we are loading via configmap example:-client-cert.p12
Phonograph
SO yeah could not replicate it btw CP. had like 40 spawners going over night with just as many killer joes no crash. I am thinking it is tied to Random Things Blood moon event. http://randomthingsminecraftmod.wikispaces.com/Bloodmoon 
I am running a modified version of the code (only change is DATALIMIT = 32768 instead of DATALIMIT = 8192) so that I can perform a 100*100 matrix multiplication. The program runs correctly in the graphical version but because it takes about 5 hours to complete execution and allocates more than 3GB of RAM I was trying to get the CLI version to work. I am attaching the program in this post [naive.zip](https://github.com/lupino3/edumips64/files/4064129/naive.zip)

@cescoffier I'm working on it.  I may have a fix.
@mayankgarg1990 You're right, JSON is not orderable. In that case, I don't have a good solution except for falling back to a regular checksum. We can still apply array sort to structured type but have a regular checksum as a fallback. This allows to handle the most kinds of scenarios.   For array of orderable structured type: 
Actually it works now. Some update in between seems to have fixed it. Thanks a lot!
@wvpaf, I've asked my team members to generate one, I'll comment soon. 
I have tried testing the issue again but I can't seem to reproduce the issue.  The steps I took were. 1. Launch app 2. Select any novel chapter 3. Move the page a bit 4. Open running app page (My Zenfone has a dedicated button to it) 5. Close Baka-Tsuki  6. Launch app 7. Open to previous chapter with "Resume Novel" or manually  At the time this issue was happening every time but now it doesn't. I am still using the same android and app version. Let me know if you need more details. 
We need to do synchronisation on a finer level since the eager update and the periodic refresh happen concurrently. There are rules associated with how the additional fields should be read from/write to that if future methods follow should fix the problems in general, provided that the client's physical clock is sufficiently accurate.  That's from what I reason about it at the moment but I could be wrong. 
Having been forced to forcequit Minecraft due to a freeze-up (unrelated to BC), I can confirm that a complete relaunch does indeed fix the problem. As for repeatability, this has only happened once. If it's useful information, I should say that the bottom rectangle was connected before I placed the other markers. 
@sberyozkin I was able to connect to the endpoint IIRC.

From an Enum:  `list.addItem(company.displayName(), company.name());`  I also add an empty option:  `list.addItem("");`  I tried commenting out the empty option - it did not help.  Note that the exception correctly shows the index of the selected item. The problem is that it shows size as 0. 
@tolusha  I solved it by adding the following env to the containers field part: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/e3999fcc8b040a537c11300de178358acaef4396/deploy/kubernetes/helm/che/custom-charts/che-jaeger/templates/deployment.yaml#L32  
Yes, of course 
hi @ctron  1. signed the ECA 2. Yes, I agree with making it configurable.  3. I need help in building the environment for development and testing. i followed https://wiki.eclipse.org/PackageDrone/HowTo/Contribute building with oomph but eclipse still have lots of errors. is there a better guide?
Not at all. Allow a few days for me to get a PR done.   Thanks for letting me know that it's already fixed. I did scan through the list of new commits but apparently not thoroughly enough to realize that #181 fixed the issue.  Thanks for your help! 
It should change the brightness, just like ON/OFF should turn the light on and off. 
NO_CONNECTION should in fact be included in the algorithm above. It is merely a last resort, basically the try/catch around everything:    This would allow a more detailed control in the operations. The `test()` method would have to run more tests though. 
I think I introduced the problem as a side effect of bug #458. It affects models that make repeated updates to the same areas of state data (like the shmem model). These accumulate longer and longer listener lists, which mean that invariants get checked over and over again, making the model slower and slower (but giving correct behaviour).  You could try your model with VDMJ (which has the fix)? https://github.com/nickbattle/vdmj/releases/download/3.1.1-1/vdmj-3.1.1.jar  
ok so after futher testing i noted that, if none of the items in a kit has a desiganted slot the items just dont appear, but once only one item has a slot everything works again, i also noticed that it only applies to items e.g. potion effects work all the time

The behavior is a little less wacky, but you can still type past the character limit... 
I want to debug existed che-theia plugin e.g. ssh plugin, so I start clean theia in a dev container and then run the plugin from that instance
Exactly, local build as in head of master. Same thing happens with version 2.1.0-beta2.
1. i deploy openstack juno release by using mirantis. 2. i download openstack4j master branch source code, then i compile the project and package the class file into jar with maven tools. 3. i am using resteasy connector other than Jersey 2.  see the picture below,  the lines i comment will raise the exception.

That would certainly work.  I was looking at your docs on the config stuff a bit, but I was only seeing excludes, not includes. 
I am working with jpegs of fairly arbitrary length - examples are 4292608, 4174032, 4306866 
Hexacord 1.7 to 1.12 Lastest build Online mode 
thanks.  in tomcat,DbThreadSession gets one connection from CoreConnectionPool and never be return to CoreConnectionPool.so the connection will always be held by the tomcat thread and never be validated by the CoreConnectionPool.  validation is done in the CoreConnectionPool. 
Got a google account, and the "google play"-shop/store app. That where i installed mycelium from.  what is "play services"?  Got alot of outer google service/apps: Gmail, hangout, google drive, google search, google maps, google maps street view, google plus, youtube 
@jiazhai yes happens each time. Steps: 1. install pulsar 2.4.2 from the Helm Chart (I use Helm 3)     - note: To get 2.4.2 working on Kubernetes, do the following workarounds:       - turn off functions #5818       - change the image spec for the Dashboard to 2.4.1 due to #5847        - check if admin api works on all proxy pods, and restart those which are stuck #5994 2. create a tenant and a namespace     - note: I create my namespace with:        - `bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-backlog-quota mytenant/mynamespace --limit 300M --policy consumer_backlog_eviction`        - `bin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-deduplication mytenant/mynamespace --enable` 3. publish some messages into a persistent topic in that namespace     - note: I use Protobuf serliaization; I don't use message compression at this time 4. go to the Dashboard, navigate to the topic, and try to view some messages currently residing on that topic    - on the Dashboard webpage, when clicking on a message, nothing visible will happen (just a brief display of a loading indicator)    - you have to open e.g. the Chrome web dev tools and look at Console or Network to see the 500 error returned

That's actually not mine. Two users of my plugin send me private message that fastlogin doesn't work with my premium plugin (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/casualprotector-best-server-protector-antibot-anticrash.59866/) FastLogin v1.10-git484855724b794de1fe057cf7360245362658b432 git-Spigot-72c2605-251a5b6 (MC: 1.10.2) (Implementing API version 1.10.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT) Protocollib - just v4.4.0  When the first user told me about that i didn't take it seriously but when more users told me about this issue i decided to make a issue here. Maybe it should be 4.5.0 version (but it's only recommended on 1.14 mc I think)
yes 
I have installed it from bitnami stack. I am facing this issue when i am trying to connect from LAN, on wifi or dongal its working. So is there any settings in configuration file which i need to do?
Typo... managed bindings... as in not manually installed. That may not be the correct way to describe this, but similar to managed/unmanaged Items and Things.
With updated library version I was still unable to enter date manually. There were no visible changes to keyboard. Only numbers, delete and done buttons.  Material Library version: 1.2.0-alpha04 
> I can't reproduce this. > Do you mean that sorting doesn't work at all, in all tables, all databases?  I think it only happens if I have an explicit ORDER BY in my query. It will re-run the query as if it's sorting, but doesn't actually change the sort. if I remove the ORDER BY, then it works.  Maybe that's the intended behavior. I'd like to be able to change the sorting after the fact though, without having to comment out my ORDER BY
@lewie, thanks for your quick fix!!  With this fix openHAB starts without any errors again and data is added to the database, looks good at the first glance!  The problem, which I mentioned in the other thread, seems to be fixed also. I will do some additional tests in the next few days and report here if I find any further issues.  Thanks again! Juelicher 
I fix the change in 2.0.11-SNAPSHOT, i am going to send pull request to you for review

@benas @PascalSchumacher Thank you, guys, for a quick fix!  I tried it and it works very well. Closing the issue.
I'm not an expert on database design. What is the advantage of a separate table instead of a new column in the existing table? It seems like it may save a little space but would make queries slower and more complicated with "join" logic.
I'm using <code>master</code>. Maybe problem is too old version of Intellij Idea. Fortunately I use Windows not every day, I will check this later 
Yes, when I tried  `-Dtools_jar_location="tools.jar"` the .jar was on the root so that was the correct path.  If I try to run the plugin without tools.jar manual injection:

Hi there, no the name was %iv% so it's max 12 characters  
i am using mac. Below is the first command to run [doc - docker standalone](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/standalone-docker/)  `docker run -it -p 6650:6650 -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/data:/pulsar/data apachepulsar/pulsar:2.4.1 bin/pulsar standalone`  This will start the pulsar cluster, accessible at localhost:8080, on mac the same will also be accessible on <http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8080/>  Later i started with following command  `SERVICE_URL=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:8080/` `docker run -p 80:80 -e SERVICE_URL=$SERVICE_URL apachepulsar/pulsar-dashboard:2.4.1`  I also tried to use `--advertised-address` but, broker standalone cluster didn't start with advertise address.  But starting docker standalone with this command didn't workout.  ` docker run -it -p 6650:6650 -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD/data:/pulsar/data apachepulsar/pulsar:2.4.1 bin/pulsar standalone --advertised-address=10.192.31.2`  ERROR: `[main] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.PulsarStandaloneStarter - Unknown option: --advertised-address=10.192.31.2` Here the ip is my localhost ip.

It is extending your ImageView which implements RippleView. So, I think it does.. Anyways I'll be uploading screenshots in a min! 
@steve-bate Yes, this solves the issue for me. Many thanks.  However, I also consider the substring-check a bug :-)
I'll have to get my crash report when I get home from work. Sorry I forgot to include it the first time. 
@marcanpilami , this behaviour is not for each run, it's very rarely when we have this issue.  Our context configuration:   The issue was reproduced when queue has capacity > 1 and there > 1 job already submitted jobs to the queue before start.  So, JQM takes 2,3...N jobs in the same time. And as there was not syncronized block in ClassLoaderManager, JQM create second class-loader due to syncronization issue. Take a look in my patch
@tsmaeder I agree that changes should be provided into VS Code Quarkus extension, because it doesn't use API to check for preexisting tasks, they just check if `/.vscode/launch.json` file exists   and it works for vscode but doesn't work for theia.

The problem is that we lock wrong keys, copying wont help here. If we insert a record, which contains a "temporary" rid as a value, we lock this temporary rid-key and the corresponding index, after that we convert the rid into a persistent one. That's ok in most cases since the index is wholly locked as a component, but for auto-sharded indexes we may lock the wrong shard corresponding to the old rid value and this will lead to data inconsistency.  In `micro-tx` branch there are no more key locks, so obviously there is no such problem any more, but we still need to select the right shard, so we must assign the rid before index locking.
you can see if the behavior reveals anything  join mc.intangir.org with 1.8 and walk down the expeditions hall, then go back towards the old worlds hall  you can see existing npcs disappear as new ones appear  its almost like its replacing them

> (i.e. directory structure)  If someone has physical access to your device, the entire directory structure of all connected ownClouds will leak through the upload pane. Also, if #674 lands, filenames will leak too. This is why I called it a "security risk".  I should point out that Dropbox does this with their upload pane. 
Uuugh, yes, I'm a noob. I have a very poor understanding of the stack. I ended up figuring out how to do it right a few games later. >.<
If I remember correctly the main problem was that there was use on a stack variable after it went out of scope.  These functions are where it occurred.  5: RuleContext* ParserRuleContext::addChild(RuleContext *ruleInvocation) { children.push_back(ruleInvocation); return ruleInvocation; }  6: void Parser::unrollRecursionContexts(ParserRuleContext *parentctx) { _precedenceStack.pop_back(); _ctx->stop = _input->LT(-1); ParserRuleContext *retctx = _ctx; // save current ctx (return value)  // unroll so ctx is as it was before call to recursive method if (_parseListeners.size() > 0) { while (_ctx != parentctx) { triggerExitRuleEvent(); _ctx = dynamic_cast<ParserRuleContext *>(_ctx->parent); } } else { _ctx = parentctx; }  // hook into tree retctx->parent = parentctx;  if (_buildParseTrees && parentctx != nullptr) { // add return ctx into invoking rule's tree parentctx->addChild(retctx); } }  I believe somehow child went out of scope during the recursion process.
@rstoyanchev I know webflux uses the `PathContainer`, you get the path value in this way: `String path = processPath(pathWithinHandler.value());`, the `PathContainer.value()` just return the non-decoded path `@Override 	public String value() { 		return this.path; 	}`  the `processPath()` method does't decode the path too. this is the simple demo: https://github.com/BiLuoHen/demo, visit the `http://localhost:8080/pic.png` will get the pic resource,  vist the `http://localhost:8080/图片.png` or `http://localhost:8080/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87.png` will get 404 response
Hi, thanx for your fast reply. I used 5.4.2 unity version. But before that i tried on previous versions also months ago, did not work either. Sorry this time i cannot send the project but the debugger doesn't work inside any coroutine. I mean i set a breakpoint and the debugger never reaches it while the code runs perfectly. Its the only reason i do not use Consulo all the time. Can u tell me, if it works for you, can you debug inside coroutines? If yes can you tell me if you have any plugins? Best regards.

I definitely didn't hold down the shift key when it happened. Also, during the AADL course it happened to almost everybody at some time. I have the impression that it happens after making many edits without closing the graphical editor.

After I sent this I realized I didn't give you much detail to go on.  I'm currently using ActiveMQ 5.11.0 and I've tried hawtio 1.4.47, as well as 46 and 45... the problem varies a bit between releases but I didn't remember having this problem until recently.  Could definitely be AMQ.  I can send more detail if needed.  It happens in the latest karaf and only really seems to affect the camel component.

Hi @zhangzhx I am using latest SAM 0.2.4 and Docker version 17.10.0-ce, build f4ffd25  The issue which you referenced https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local/issues/158 has two issues reported. The second one ('invalid bind mount spec') has been marked resolved in 0.2.3. And I am not getting this one.  I am getting first one "open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified".  But I am able to resolve the error when running from cmd, using below command @for /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker-machine env') DO @%i  It is in Eclipse where I am still getting the same error (screenshot attached in previous post.)  
No, the default configs in JED basically do nothing at all. If you want to reproduce this, enable the WorldInfo override option in the JED main config (via the in-game config menu for example), and then create a config file in `config/justenoughdimensions/dimensions.json`, like this: https://pastebin.com/izmtFaWH where the `dim` ID is whatever the Advanced Rocketry dimension uses. This should cause JED to try to find a spawn point for that dimension, when the dimension is loaded for the first time (it doesn't yet have its own `level.dat` file). For testing/debugging, I'd also recommend enabling the verbose logging option in JED, so you get log messages (at the INFO level) about when JED does certain things, like tries to find the spawn point.
The configuration is as follows.  #### Machin-A  * IP(multiple NIC)    * 192.168.109.72    * 192.168.247.1 * Role    * DAS    * Server Instance(instance1)  #### Machin-B  * IP    * 192.168.109.197 * Role    * Server Instance(instance2) * Note    * Node-Type:SSH  Machine A 192.168.109.72 and Machine B 192.168.109.72 are the same network segment.  The host of DAS is 192.168.109.72. (Because it is setting DAS Bind Address) When instance1 is started in this state, NIC of 192.168.247.1 is assigned to instance1. The IP address of instance 2 is 192.168.109.197. Domain data grid can not be constructed because address 192.168.247.1 and address 192.168.109.197 can not communicate.  In the above case, I would like to specify the NIC to be used at instance1.  Even if you set the Data Grid Discovery mode setting to tcpip and list the addresses to use in TCP / IP instances, this matter could not be avoided.

There are the logs of 2 machines (currently I don't have access to the 3rd one but that computer should have slept at that time): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15830762/logs_0.zip https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15830762/logs_1.zip  I can not remember anything special that occurred at that time.

I've tried to post some data on a website. I cannot give you an exact example. I've managed to solve the issue with such code:    As far as I understood, I should have encode my encoding and then use existing method addEncoded. 
The problem occurs for each writeable Number item (which shows a slider and has therefore several lines). The slider is overlapping with the following item in the list. In the screenshot, each visible slider belongs to the item above it. "Change mode" is an Enum item and has no slider.  Firefox and Chrome show the same result. IE does not work at all, as you know.  This is the thing xml: [2016-08-22 Paper UI overlap bug - thing xml.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/files/432479/2016-08-22.Paper.UI.overlap.bug.-.thing.xml.txt)  Thanks for checking. 
It doesn't seem OS dependent, because I get different outputs on machines that all runs Win10. Though it seems to depend on something in the system, anyway.

Happens with every contact
Made a full test here:  Insanely slow:   **Another thing:** If I give this sword to player `give diamond sword of sharpness 5, knockback 2 named "TEST" with lore "HEY" to player`, then use `player has diamond sword of sharpness 5, knockback 2 named "TEST"` it won't work, because the lore doesn't match.  The same works for NBT, if I add ANYTHING different in NBT, it won't match the item, even though it matches the conditions.  Using only name and enchantments, it'll match normally.  `inventory of %player% is empty` doesn't work too.  That's it basically.
Can't find the `apk` ...?

From what I understand this affected all versions 1.8-1.12. ViaVersion wouldn't solve this problem since ViaVersion doesn't work that way, I'm already using 1.12.2 Spigot so obviously, there's nothing to inject there.

Hi @dbarashev  thank you for taking time for this issue. I atteched an example in format .gan and screenshots of the steps I followed to reproduce this issue here: https://owncloud.lal.in2p3.fr/index.php/s/82odF8xNdPwUkLL  Here are the steps I followed: 1. I add 5 tasks and display the "General view" 2. I open "task 5" General view  3. I enter "task 5" Predecessors' view 4. I click on "task name" column in the first row to add a predecessor and it opens a drop-down menu giving choice between the existing other tasks 5. by pressing "t" key, I select "task 2" task (first existing other task beginning with "t"). The "task 5" Predecessor view displays only one predecessor: "task 2" 6. by selecting the cell in "task name" column and ID "1" line, I edit the only predecessor of "task 5" and I press "t" key which selects "task 3" (second existing other task beginning with "t").  7. the "task 5" Predecessor view displays only one predecessor: "task 3". It has replaced the predecessor "task 2" appearing on step 5 8. I close the "task 5" view and get back to "General view". I notice that 2 predecessors are appearing in the links 9. "task 5" Predecessor view confirms that 2 predecessors have been registered for task 5
Yes, it took me three times although.

I did actually. Now that you mention it. From 1387 to 1388, which completely removed the edited .jar file after installing forge prior 1387. As in there's no .jar anymore.   Guess it's back to 1387 again. 
@zackm0571 below is the code snippet. `remote_video_container` is for the remote participant, `local_video_container` is for the local participant aka the user. For the screenshots above, I put some margin to `remote_video_container` to demonstrate the overlapping.

I simply opened IntelliJ, installed the plugin, restarted IntelliJ, and then tried to check out a project from version control, using Gerrit as the remote.  I have checked the connection in the plugin settings - I get connection successful.  I reverse-proved this by deliberately giving the wrong username to make sure it would give an error (which it did). 
Because the choice of default widget depends on whether the state description is editable or not. It looks like now the state description seems to answer "not editable" while it should return "editable". https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/blob/master/bundles/org.openhab.core.ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/smarthome/ui/internal/items/ItemUIRegistryImpl.java#L244 https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/blob/master/bundles/org.openhab.core.ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/smarthome/ui/internal/items/ItemUIRegistryImpl.java#L781 And it looks like the only very recent PR that was in relation to "editable".
No it doesnt show up It only shows the new mine i created. 
Not sure I understand the first part of the question but I got the spdy/npn stuff working with Gyrex back in the day (using -Xbootclasspath and npn fragment). I'm now in the process of updating to Jetty 9.4.1 and alpn.
Yes, but apparently we missed an important detail in https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-extras/commit/f621cb5ed6a27320f619c4dc0185fadcaa3dc00c#diff-d03af8b70bcedad15e6b5b70e578de47.  I assume the super call should have gone into the doValidateLambdaContents.

I have started the instance a second time. And also tried your advice. Still, I can't make any change in the tree of the configuration editor. Even if I don't color features. Looks like we reload the config file after a save, but the save never happens. So no configuration can be modified.
Concur on both. 
@ZacSweers This is on a fairly big project and the stack trace doesn't mention any of our namespaces so I'm not sure how to reproduce it from scratch. I'll try to investigate tomorrow. Do you have an idea where I should start looking?

Coolpad 5560s, I use it for tinkering with android, mostly. 
Hi. 1) Create a default Flutter 1.12.13 project. 2) Install the package ^0.1.7. 3) When running a dialog appears on the Android screen saying that my app has stopped. 4) if I remove the package the app runs normally. Only that.
Attached a strace log.  And noticed strange entries, such as:   
Hi Ron,  Thanks for the quick update. I had downloaded the swagger-parser-1.0.28 jar from the maven repository (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/swagger/swagger-parser/1.0.28/) and had used it. Could you please let me know a way to download the updated jar and then retest my case?
Nope, Only replaced the file and restarted server its fixed ;) 
I did get an Outlook notification on my phone.  I can try to generate another log.

Nevermind, after I deleted the entire battlearena file, it regenerated and I was able to paste the config file I had before. Then the RespawnWithClass thing worked. Thanks for trying to help :) 
I have tested several versions down to 1.6.2. As I said it is also the same on another machine running Windows and most probably different version of Java. I really want to use the Map and not items.  I actually posted the full source, only missing the "System.out.println(data);" 
if animations were  disabled it also won't be working on  version 3.0.0 . I have checked animations were not disabled. 
@tthuem My workspace was named FeatureIDE. But I created a new workspace and tested again. There is still the same Issue.  The weird is that the altered example templates are restored on an eclipse restart. 
Do you have try it on Windows? My system is XP, maybe this is the difference.  
The latest release. When I change from play screen back to main menu, it stays in "Play Ranked" 
There are ftests for folo in the addons/folo/ftests module...I'm not sure if that's what you're after.  Basically, folo (just a dumb shortening of "follow") is a content tracking API. It exposes a set of REST URLs that basically the same as the ones you would normally use to download or upload content, with the difference that they allow you to specify a tracking id. When you download or upload content via one of these URLs (instead of the main ones), folo will add entries to the tracking record corresponding to that tracking id. It also exposes a few REST resources for sealing (closing) the tracking record, and downloading / deleting the record.  Where you'd normally use the following to download content from the public group:    You'll see logs for the ftests in embedders/savant/target/failsafe-tests, just like with any other ftest.  A test like this one might be modified to have an upload and a download of the same file, then the rest of the test would show what's in the tracking record:  https://github.com/Commonjava/indy/blob/master/addons/folo/ftests/src/main/java/org/commonjava/indy/folo/ftest/report/StoreFileAndVerifyInTrackingReportTest.java

Yep. Removed all mods to check again. Issue is still present. Could it be the version of forge or codechickenlib? Edit: It's not the Codechickenlib version. Issue's still there. Also noticed https://gyazo.com/0e74fa8eb854c9ed21a1d7cd91af503d arms are  a bit wonky. Edit 2: Not the forge version either. It's solely the mod itself.  
@eidottermihi   In landscape the version displays correctly. (I have an md5 hash for a version string, running Raspbmc, it's very long.)  IP still displays incorrectly in Network though. Maybe because it's not extending to take up 100% of the screen width, see image: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2758854/2013-10-12%2016.42.41.png

i tried again and looks like it only happens when i swap the head with an existing tool.  In my case i started with an iron pickaxe head, made a pickaxe with it and then later swapped it with an agate head, i also double checked and it also happened with the second pickaxe.
No problem, that would be huge if you could get an update out for that. Off the top of my head I don't know any explicit way to test for this in JEST but I'll gladly do some research for you and send over some links!

@terrymanu  all my config, my  version is `3.1.0`  
1.8.0 is my minecraft version and skript is https://github.com/bensku/Skript/releases/tag/dev23
The following change on my local copy of JDTModuleManager.java fixed the issue.   I haven't yet set up a fork of ceylon-ide-eclipse, otherwise I'd have done a pull request:   
Hello @bogensberger,  The column type is `LONG`  There is data in the table 
Hi, thanks for the answer.  The temporary fix solves the problem yes. Much better for me while waiting a real fix :)  Let's keep the issue opened until you try a new build then.    
@danielegobbetti I tested it but this is the result ![screenshot_20170326-101014](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2318483/24330720/177d4970-1225-11e7-9c64-8689e35ec462.png) 
You can see the popup white color where the word is written `Settings` in the above screenshot. There is background white and black. Also, its height isn't less. Its height is more. Have any solution  **Source:**  
Turned out to be a generally rare circumstance that wouldn't affect a server operating "normally"  If you loaded the plugin while the server is up and you are logged in at the time the plugin is loaded, you are not added to the actors internal database, and any database insertions that require a non-null actor throw an exception. Logging out and back in again fixes the issue.
Yeah that must be it ;) But we should find out what the matter is, because if it can happen that would be really bad
@eivantsov I created a normal user and everything works now. I think the problem is running as root. Problem not a good idea to run as root anyways. 
@TWiStErRob Thank you very much. 
Hi,  It works if I change slightly the implementation to: KieSession kie = getSessionByProcess(processInstanceId); org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance processInstance = (org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance) kie.getProcessInstance(processInstanceId); processInstance.signalEvent(type, event);  Thanks 
Hmm, well I'm not sure why you're not having the issue but basically I was sent this and wanted to put it into an email. I long press on the message and hit copy and it says "copied". Attempting to paste it anywhere does nothing. I press "paste" and the button just does it's little animation but doesn't disappear and nothing is pasted. Rebooting and restarting do nothing and even now it's still uncopiable in qksms.   Perhaps there is some character that the default messanger is ignoring or not copying? I'm not sure.
Russian :C  Help me, please (
@Xephi I've added '-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8'  into server line command starting,but it didn't work too. 
@TylerJewell I am running che from CLI as che run, and have set CHE_HOST to the server IP.  @eivantsov OS is windows 10 Pro
Thanks for submitting the STU comment, @brynrhodes. I think the definition you recommend is the proper one (purely evaluable at compile-time). I also agree with @cmoesel in that it makes sense to _not_ allow `Today()` and `Now()` in parameters, since a DRY-enough pattern can be written using regular CQL expressions when `Today()` and `Now()` are necessary. For authors who might discover this thread later, an example is probably something like,  
This works for me now.
Still broken with bare docker command and absolute path: 
Tested and it's working fine. Thanks! 
No, I haven't seen this error myself yet
I tried after your opngl optimization commit , it disappears. So i close now.
That reading was from 30 minutes later. I didn't spawn at my bed and lost everything so I had to get home.  No it was definitely seconds, roughly 5, guarantee it was less than 10. I entered the room, was poisoned, was dead before I heard five "attacks" and was wearing diamond armor with either medium or heavy shielding. Happened twice.  Unfortunately I took the reactor down because I needed to run it so testing it again won't be as easy.   Here are steps I believe I took before this happened to me twice:  - Use compact machines with 1.12 - Make a large compact machine - Build a 3x3 reactor for TBU Oxide. I can try to send the build somehow. - Run 3 pellets while back in the overworld. Leave the depleted fuel in the fission controller overnight. - Come back  
Ok, just a maven integration problem. Runs now. 
It allows to specify launch configuration https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/using-developer-environments-workspaces.html#editor-specific-commands
Thank you I'm testing it.
Sorry about the typo. Redis version is 5.0.2. Don't know what to say other than the issue has been reported and can be closed because it is not reproducible? Are there any config settings you can think of? 
Yes, we'll fix this after FOSDEM in the next release, whatever version that is. Sorry about the breakage, we didn't have test coverage for from-source bootstrapping on Windows.
OK, I will try to remove it or at least make it private. But I will wait for merge of PR #1154, because there will be some conflicts.
No, I don't have a way to reliably trigger the crash now.
The headline gives it away: "previous working version": 5.3.3 "newer not working version": 6.0.3

@llfbandit Thank you for the quick response.  Where is `0.6-SNAPSHOT` being published? I can't seem to find it in the maven repo.  Also, is there an estimate on when 0.6 will be released?
The issue occurs when deploying my application via a gitlab pipeline. I build a docker container in which i clone my project an then install all dependencies. When compiling the pipline exits with the given error.  The pipeline executes a npm run build step. when executing this step manually in my local project the same error occurs. When executing npm start the error does not happen.

No, not reproducable with either TPCH, nor MySQL connector.  Problem is with HIVE it seems.
Thanks for your feedback. Im' running Nextcloud 14.0.3 on an Odroid HC-2 with up-to-date NextcloudPi.  Ah, and btw. with the German translation of the android app, the message is too small to read the text on a vertical screen. I needed to switch to horizontal view to read the message in total and get its meaning.
Hi,  yes, this seems to be the case. I tested this using Debian Wheezy with backport kernel 3.16 and Docker 1.3.1, however in it worked in AWS using latest Amazon Linux and Docker 1.3.1.  So setup is: - Debian Wheezy 7 with backport Kernel 3.16 - Docker 1.3.1 - JDK 8 (java version "1.8.0_20") - A generic Java project (I created an example-project: https://github.com/SaschaMoellering/docker-maven-test) - mvn package && mvn vertx:fatJar && mvn -Ddocker.host=http://127.0.0.1:2375 docker:package  Debian:    On Amazon Linux it works perfectly fine.  Thanks and Regards, Sascha 
So adding that mutex does make the problem more rare but I could still get it to happen by the about 30th run when I had 3 requests happen at the same millisecond.  I'll do some more poking.  Edit. could not repeat this anymore despite how long I ran the test. Might have been some fluke thing related to how I created the mutex at that time. The attached PR 884 seems to fix this completely.
PR #630 
Yea sorry missed that nevermind then

This is the definition. The actual number is -232323 as you can see below. This has changed in the past week or so.   
Yes, @overheadhunter this is comparable with #984 haven't detected this one before, sorry. But difference is, I can provoke it constantly every time and an interesting fact, my computer is a DELL as well (DELL Latitude 5580), but with an Intel HD Graphics 620 connected to an Dell Universal Dock D6000.  I'll test with 1.5.0-beta2 asap. As long as it's beta, I'll not aim to migrate my vaults.
Yes, can try that. I can reproduce this in both computers. May be it is a Windows thing. The dropdown drops down momentarily before the sync starts. 
I tried first time with v3.7.4 and had the same problem. I updated to DEV Build just to make sure isnt that version.
hi Mario, with DEV 30/07 same happens. Just had recently taken photos and videos uploaded via cellular data.
I tried to reproduce it with the "normal" kura version but the bug appears too Here is what i did:  1) Selected SINGLE_ASSET_GENERATED and applied ![1a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60254601/73953220-631e9e00-4900-11ea-8221-da84ce5ab7e2.jpg)  2) Click on "Upload Channels", select file, check "Replace current channels", click on "Upload" ![2a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60254601/73953655-02dc2c00-4901-11ea-8539-6ce390d2f1c4.jpg)  3) You can see the config is reseted ![3a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60254601/73953731-230beb00-4901-11ea-8dc5-1b758449d51a.jpg)   @MMaiero what kind of detail will help, the snapshot0 ?  
Charter member are basically premium member, which became and stayed premium since the first year of Groundspeaks premium option. The difference should only be the member type name on the website, but technically identical to premium members.  Therefore I more suspect, that the live map might do something wrong on server side, but I don't know if there might be anything in the detail of the parameters we send to request data from the map. 
Hi,   I finally figured it out. Thanks for the offer ! I need to make a few tests before and I will commit it.  Cheers Alexis  
Hi,  The e-mail is a business related e-mail so I cannot send you a screenshot (not the complete e-mail) but what I did is that I opened the e-mail with notepad then remomed sensitive information and I left other e-mail structure information so that you can look at the e-mail structure and attachment. So, you will find the epured source e-mail in attachment and you will see that I replaced sensitive information lines(s) with the string _xxx-deleted-line(s)-here-xxx_.  For your information, last week, I moved this e-mail in a folder so today, after I received your e-mail request, I went back to that folder to see the e-mail again and the proper logo is correctly displayed today. This is strange. But be sure that last week, it was the wrong logo. Since last week, I had an Android update. I do not know if it can be related.

Interesting, switching the Look and Feeling to Plastic3D seems to have changed the behavior by a lot. However, there is still some instability happening to me--the tabs become blank after I pasted another bibtex entry. Screenshot: ![screenshot from 2017-11-06 14-54-31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3915003/32466774-550dcbfc-c305-11e7-8bd8-b9dbdb2d051c.png)  Here is what I did: I changed the Look and Feel to Windows Plastic, and then restarted JabRef. I found it doesn't work and the program automatically reversed to the default Look and Feeling. Then I changed the Look and Feeling to the jgoodies Plastic3D one, and saved everything. It seems working ok, but there are some errors on the prompts. You can find the full log of output [here](https://paste.ubuntu.com/25906162/).  Then I restarted the program, and the failure happens in a strange way. First, I added a bibtex entry by pasting a bibtex code to the table. Downloaded the PDF using the automatic search and download button. It worked well until then, and I saved the database. I thought it wouldn't have any problems, so I opened the Preference window and exported the settings to the saved file as you can see from my linked commit to this issue. There seem to be some errors or maybe just warnings in the terminal, and I didn't think they are really causing anything fatal. Then I pasted another bibtex entry to the table, saved it, and tried to generate the bibtex key. I look down to the tabs--they are all blank now as you can see from the screenshot attached. I clicked a few buttons, including Generate bibtex key, Save, Quality --> generate bibtex key and maybe a few other buttons. It didn't return to normal. So, I closed JabRef. The full terminal record for these steps can be found [here](https://paste.ubuntu.com/25906123/).   But this issue didn't reoccur if I just use the program normally, like adding multiple entries in a row, auto-downloading PDF files and so on. I only have 3 Look and Feeling profiles and have tried all of them. 2 didn't work at all, the Plastic3D one caused this blank window issue to me. Let me know if I can provide further information. Or, maybe it should be a separate non-crucial issue to discuss for this update.  Thanks,  Qi
No, nothing on the IDE logs. 
Usability wise: The event field is customizable meaning it can keyword or numeric. Even if we restrict it to being a keyword: `event where condition` is queryDSL is essentially: `event_field == "event" and ...` event is a value, we just happen to escape it automatically. So whether it's only letter or numbers should not matter since both are valid values.   is problematic since it means `42` is a field not a value. Which is not the case.  Implementation wise: I think reusing identifiers is problematic and having a dedicated token for eventType (essentially an unescaped string) would work better.
Unfortunately full integration test requires too complicated code. But here is a simple example demonstrated this issue  `        String test="\u041d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c\n\r";                  ByteArrayOutputStream bo = new ByteArrayOutputStream();         // Set Content-Type: */*;charset=utf-8         PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(bo, "UTF-8"));         writer.wrirte(test);          writer.flush();          // OnCommittedResponseWrapper#trackContentLength(String content)          int excpectedLength = test.length();          int realLength = bo.toByteArray().length; // read writed length          System.out.println(excpectedLength + " <> "  + realLength); `

The folder was missing but it seems to be working fine after manually adding it!  Thanks, and sorry for the late reply! :) 
Sure!  
i agree, the problem is the same. closing... we continue #1795

  Here.  Edit: To give a bit more feedback, try typing something, waiting a second, then typing again, and then press CTRL-Z. Then start typing again, that should reset the caret to the start of the text area. This test was able to reproduce the bug for me.

Hello @sockeqwe, I want to keep the presenter on a configuration change, that's why I call `setRetainInstance(true)`. I just tried without calling `setRetainInstance(true)`; the presenter is not retained anymore on a configuration change, and I'm still having the same issue.  If I return to Fragment A (by pressing back or popping the back stack), the presenter is recreated anyway, so that's why I set `keepPresenterAndViewStateOnBackstack` to false. (issue #265)  I also noticed if you remove Fragment A from the back stack (go "up"), then Fragment B/C call `detachView(retainInstance=true)`. I currently have worked around this by calling `detachView(false)` manually in the Fragment's `onDestroy()`. Is this a bug?  Thanks for your help, Thomas
Where can I get 3.0.2? Latest on F-droid is 3.0.1
Go ahead, I'm not working on this one. Don't know about other people out there though :p 
should be covered, I will need to add more tests though
@ejona86 your `override_targets` does appear to work on my system and the target deployment system as well. Thanks very much. 
That's not what I meant.  My idea is that only price of a single block of forest depends on the percentage of area that is free (arable / total). Hence, using your example, planting trees on 1% of the area would cost different amounts. While the average price for a single block in the transaction (which we can calculate and use easily if it is a linear function) would be the same for both countries, Country B would have to pay for 1000 times more blocks than country A. Which is sensible, as it would get 1000 times higher absorption boost. 
No, streams is active and receiving messages. I just deleted & recreated the alert conditions and now alerts are firing again ... I had to do this for several streams ... 
I am using Chrome aswell so that can't be the problem. Where does the plugin store its configuration in the database? So i can update the configuration through there for now 
Hi,   no, the widget does not show any task at all. I delete the widget, readd, and works again for a while.

In the app itself, all tasks are shown independent of their status.

The exact steps to reproduce: 1. CD to spring-cloud-contract root folder 2. Run ./mvnw clean install -P integration (exact command in my case .\mvnw clean install -P integration)  Environment: Windows 8.1 Enterprise.  Please let me know if you need some other info.

DITA-OT1.8.M2 on Windows. 
For incremental build I see Main.java:[23,27] cannot find symbol symbol:   class Main_StringFoo_Builder location: interface foo.bar.Main.StringFoo Main.java:[17,5] Builder extends the wrong type (should be Main_GenericFoo_Builder)  I don't see errors for clean build. Also I don't see any of the warnings, but probably you're correct :)  So you will keep this and add separate bug, too? 
Sure - will do.
I am not able to reproduce it.  However I can also say I've never seen it happen prior to the QtWebEngine update (with RStudio or any other Windows application in this VM).  Probably nothing to do here other than see if it happens again to anyone.  
Yes, I did. Steps to build dependencies: - cd pulsar - mvn clean -U install -Dmaven.test.skip=true  and the result is success.  ![build_pulsar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20899711/67996952-cad3a600-fc8c-11e9-9b96-a258aadceb71.png)

Didn't think of that before. Just tested now, and yes it occurs when destroying only the concrete blocks, even without rails on them. 
Ok maybe THAT was the issue?  The primary group, that is.  Except that "/custom" came back as a 'Unknown Command...' even with the files present, so that may be something else or... i just have to do a total server restart every time I add one.  I couldn't get it to work before even with the primary groups on info but, it does appear to be working as advertised now, at least on the /einfo command.  Maybe had been a problem with a previous build I had that got patched along the way, I don't know.  There wasn't anything helpful in debug since... it acts like the command was never  even attempted.
Hi @luigidellaquila  I was create [test](https://github.com/WeaxMe/orienteer-test/blob/master/orientdb-test-data-query/src/test/java/com/weaxme/test/query/TestPreparedStatement.java) for this case. Answer for you questions: - I use schema less class  UPD: If use  operator `LIKE` instead operator `=` all works fine!  Thanks for feedback, Vitaliy
My only idea is looking at the way it is done when the project get's executed locals => there has to be some difference in determining the Classpath and JARs getting loaded during execution. 
OK, versions: IDEA 14.0 plugin 0.10.1 haxe 3.4.0 haxelib 3.3.0  I use HXML file project configuration (it's the only one Flash debugging works with), here's my HXML file:   It's of course possible that I'm doing something wrong, but I never had libs added automatically to a project.

This repo should reproduce the problem consistently: https://github.com/queer/vertx-reproducer

No. I just stripped out everything but Malisis Doors and it's fine. I then re-added Quark and the problem presents itself, so it's an interaction between Quark and Malisis Doors.  Further testing shows it's something to do with the double-doors code since it doesn't affect single doors.  I'll report this to Quark's git as well since it only affects when _both_ mods are installed.  Quark r1.0-59 Autoreglib 1.0-2  Cheers! 
@paulKra Sure, go ahead! I haven't started this yet. Let me know if you have any questions.
I have tested with the latested, however I haven't reset my config as the server is in production right now, so resetting the config would require some downtime 
> Interesting. Are you suggesting that we should not reference these files at all then in the BEP?  I think so. We should not reference them with bytesream paths if that results them being uploaded to the CAS.

A scroll would work, but there are two things which should happen if possible with a scroll:  1. the window should indicate there is more to the left or right somehow.  2. The current setting should be visible unless the user has scrolled away from it on purpose.
> Ideally, non-String classes should not be reaching in and accessing that field - there should be a getter method so we can have a divergent internal representation that achieves the same behavior.  Agreed. Such a thing already exists here:  https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/02fdf14c71fb83f76deaa4f264b5c6748afc820b/jcl/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java#L87-L93  Although I think I've encountered at least one place in OpenJDK where they reach into String via reflection and extract the field. It should instead be calling this getter.

No, all new accounts do the right thing. And creating a new USD Perfect Money account "fixes" the dummy account.  It is nice to have one-less-step to set up a regtest cluster, but if the code paths are different it is probably best to just remove them.
Am not sure from where it comes, but the bindFilter, will add a filter that throw an `UnmodifiableListIterator` from guava 19 when sorted . I got it with a 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT wisdom framework.  
@yurishkuro Yes, the case I'm concerned about is when `Service A` is traced, but something makes a request to `A` with the debug header set.   In todays world, unless all services in the chain are instrumented and reporting correctly, it is difficult to ascertain that this debug header originated in `A`. `peer.service` is only set when an inbound request has `X_UBER_SOURCE` header set, which is something that might not be true all the time (and perhaps none of the time for users that aren't uber). 
No.. I am executing it on IntelliJ idea.

No,The only thing that happens to me is that everything disappears when loading the game and has me crazy
I'm using the version, which has ben released in the play store yesterday evening (2013-07-02) 
@clintongormley  - My apologies  , it was not _size , it was doc.score.  My concern was that , with scripting disabled , doc.score is working , but _score is giving "scripting disabled error". 
I have the latest Railcraft installed with the world gen module disabled. I haven't tested whether chunk generation works, but any of the debugging commands do not work. The workaround I currently use is to disable COG's Railcraft module outright since I don't want any Railcraft worldgen anyway.

This is for loading just 10 per page.  I don't have the specs for our application server but I don't suspect you need much for a simple query like this. Perhaps it's a database issue. I'll follow up once I know more.
OK, sorry, this may be caused by my local hack to work around #74. Please ignore this for now, I'll revisit this when #74 is fixed. 
@KrzysztofJozefowicz Thanks for the quick reply. I'm using the zoom option because i sometimes give demo's. The zoom option is a very powerfull help. It would very helpfull if at least in source this is working.

Hii,  Okay, I don't use SQLite, but I can send you a copy of the database if you want to? I'll do everything that you are saying, to help you fix the bug. 
I don't see a problem with that.  I could see backspace being the expected button for removing things anyway. 
​A brand new fresh clone into a different directory fixed it.  Stupid git indexing , when will they ever fix that ! I even did a `git reset --hard @{u}` and it still didn't update all the necessary files that it should have.  This might be a Windows Git bug lurking I'm sure.  That `git reset` command has always worked for me in the past, and even helped @ostephens get unstuck once before as well when I told him to do that same thing.  For some reason, its not working out so well in my case.  Oh well, the fresh new clone did the trick however!  Thanks @wetneb !​  
Well I thought I already did both. But when I press ok to submit the Support Information the box disappears without any further notice. So I don't really know what happens then.

He said he placed a "Containment Chalice". But he isn't 100% sure if thats the last thing he did.  Update: Now, without doing a thing, the player and others can enter his claim as usual

you are right. I'll check why my browser won't display it but it is indeed there 
I am able to replicate with another query without `no`.  
Version was from yesterday evening (as you see in date/time) Today it worked from current nightly. I'll make another one from your fix in #441 and try again. 
@aarexer I don't see a better way of solving this. Would you like to fix it? :)
Also, this is very very terrible: http://prntscr.com/7zlxoh

I saved it and there is no special config for mekanismtools, only for mekanism.
Thanks for your help! It does work on my game. And for on-screen keyboard, click Windows-Key first, and then click the space bar can change the IME from  one to another. Besides, I think any character can reproduce that bug, rather than particular ones. 
I would be willing to try to test it on my server when there is downtime, however I am not set up to build java projects.  I don't suppose there is a place I could get a build?  In any case my spawn (with the use.\* protection) _is_ at 0,0 and goes down to the bottom of the map, so I'm fairly certain this was precisely my issue. 
Hi,  Firstly I started creating workspace using "Java-mysql" stack.I imported some github project into my workspace.My workspace is now up and running.Now I stopped my workspace.  when I stopped my workspace Eclipse-che is itself creating a snapshot.It created snapshot succesfully and stopped the workspace.  A pop up comes saying that Work space is not running. With a "start" button and with a checkbox "Use latest snapshot".  Here when I uncheck the checkbox and start the workspace ....It is getting started properly.  But if the "Use latest snapshot" is checked and now if I started the workspace it is throwing Error like below: [STDOUT] Exec Agent binary is downloaded remotely [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28 Exec-agent configuration [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28   Server [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28     - Address: :4412 [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28     - Base path: '' [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28   Authentication [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28     - Enabled: true [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28     - Tokens expiration timeout: 10m [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28   Workspace master server [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28     - API endpoint: http://che-host:9500/wsmaster/api [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28   Process executor [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28     - Logs dir: /home/user/che/exec-agent/logs [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28  [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28 ⇩ Registered HTTPRoutes: [STDOUT]  [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28 Process Routes: [STDOUT] 2017/11/08 05:01:28 ✓ Start Process ...........................

Thank you for looking into this! Maybe it is just me not understanding what is violating the rules. Some comments to the code: m_action is a string m_nameValuePairs is a java.util.Properties object declared as     You can replicate with samples/JdbcQueries.java (you need to cast `currentStatement` to Statement in order to get the probe to comple - but that is a separate issue)  I have tried both BTrace 1.3.6 and head. 
i have a stupid question.How can i connect direct to the power cell when there are factory flash casting all around is and under the power cell factory importer is? this is my first time i used your mod sorry for the newbie question   edit: oh i can with with one block diference place the other 3 blocks.i was thinking that i place the power cell directly to the factory heart  edit 2: no it doesn´t work.after the server start the power cell is direct to 0 fe. i have connect the flux point from flux networks 
@Kamielvf I've tried that.  @deathbeam It's slow in general. Sub-par fps and what feels like stuttering when running.
Hi,  2.49 
@dormaayan  you broke more than 30 tests and we are right before release
I use Apache Maven 3.3.9 and Java 1.8.0_131. 
Yes, there was exception. See attached the logcat output. The mentioned line was added with the merge of the bip-wip branch into the master, so it's kind of new.  `E/nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.service.btle.BtLEQueue: Queue Dispatch Thread died: nulljava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError: null                                                                                                                                    	at nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.util.DateTimeUtils.formatDateTime(DateTimeUtils.java) ~[na:na]                                                                                                                                    	at nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.service.btle.BtLEAction.getCreationTime(BtLEAction.java:70) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    	at nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.service.btle.BtLEAction.toString(BtLEAction.java:76) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    	at java.lang.StringBuilder.append(StringBuilder.java:202) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    	at nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.service.btle.BtLEQueue$1.run(BtLEQueue.java:105) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown pattern character 'X'                                                                                                                                    	at java.text.SimpleDateFormat.validatePatternCharacter(SimpleDateFormat.java:323) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    	at java.text.SimpleDateFormat.validatePattern(SimpleDateFormat.java:312) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    	at java.text.SimpleDateFormat.<init>(SimpleDateFormat.java:365) ~[na:0.0]                                                                                                                                    	at nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.util.DateTimeUtils.<clinit>(DateTimeUtils.java:36) ~[na:na]                                                                                                                                    	... 5 common frames omitted`
If you really agree with the resulting priorities, and if you think it helps you to stay on top of the bugs, I could add them to the existing bugs.  I updated the list of tags above.  If you enable those, I would still need the permissions to add/remove. Maybe it could even work to allow all users to add/remove those basic tags. 
Thanks for the quick answer. I'm using the following maven release (which i believe is the latest release, as 3.3.6 is still SNAPSHOT)  There seems to be no such constructor `new fftw_iodim(int n)` which would let me specify an array length. The only constructors present are: `new fftw_iodim()` and `new fftw_iodim(Pointer p)`. So do I have to use `calloc` or `realloc` to allocate a void* array , put my fftw_iodim in there and then use the pointer cast constructor `new fftw_iodim(Pointer p)` with that array?  Also, suppose I would not use the `fftw_iodim_do_not_use_me` class but instead the normal  `fftw_iodim`, how would I set the parameters? 
Sure I can, I'll create a pr soon! 
As it turns out, this issue has been fixed since 9.0.1. I sent you a PR for the passing test, just so you can add to your test suite to prevent regression.  https://github.com/jmrozanec/cron-utils/pull/407
Hi,  **pom.xml:**   
I delayed doing manual sync. I feel like manual sy down/up would put them back into sync... I have three clients: laptop, work and home... On home, daemon was started by syncany gui which was unresponsive to restart, so I did a sy daemon force-stop and sy daemon start.  After a full night, home is still out of sync. I know because there were files added yesterday at work. Of course, work may be having issues, too. 
@benbc It's just a logging problem. I was using Neo4J 2.2.6.  
Yes, it does.
It's not happening anymore, somehow. Now idea why. I it start again, I will try to make a logcat.
Hi. Thanks for the super fast reply! - Using version 0.7.0 ( compile 'com.h6ah4i.android:openslmediaplayer:0.7.0') - Android version 5.1.1 - Device is a Sony Xperia Z5 (E6653) but all other devices we have tested with have the same issue (Note 3, Galaxy S5).  Here are link to a couple of sample files (Github doesn't allow mp3's)  https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbvj84tt6o6zfq4/Aaj%20Din%20Chadheya-%28Mr-Jatt.com%29.mp3?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/tu7ctl8yx3eqtbh/Chand%20Chupa%20Badal%20Mein-%28Mr-Jatt.com%29.mp3?dl=0  Thanks. 
Having one interface probably would be the simplest solution for now - also, from the use point of view one could think "if something is Faster, what is the point of using something that is only Fast". 
If I enter 192.168.1.210,192.168.1.211,192.168.1.213:2181/drill/mydrillcluster in the "Host" field, the URL will turn to: jdbc:drill:zk=192.168.1.210,192.168.1.211,192.168.1.213:2181/drill/mydrillcluster:2181  Doesn't work.  Drill URL pattern: `jdbc:drill:zk=<node name>[:<port>][,<node name2>[:<port>]/<directory>/<cluster ID>[schema=<storage plugin>]` And JDBC Docs on Apache Drill website: http://drill.apache.org/docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/
I now switched on version 4.3.61 and it it doesn't occur currently on that version. Maybe it fixed itself?
@ezaquarii . Same scenario on dropbox. Dropbox wins :)  Open Dropbox / Nexcloud Open folder called INSTALL Tap on MY_APP.apk  Dropbox install MY_APP.apk, Nextcloud dont.
It's possible, as I was fighting mobs and some of them bestow status effects thanks to Infernal Mobs, though I didn't specifically notice it.  I'll turn fog options back on in the config and blind myself to see if that triggers the crash - I'll edit this comment with results.  EDIT - https://pastebin.com/vLtnxY9C That seems to be the issue - went to the spot I originally crashed (outside a Mesa biome), set time to 23000, drank a potion that bestowed Blindness and stood still - crash.
Enchiridion is a mod that lets modpack makers make books for their modpacks ingame, its like HQM, but without the quest aspect

It is a bug but you must coding it for the next version because a change of this type requires an ample quality control of the system. We have now a stable version that we will use until the next that will incorporate some of the improvements. 
Netty. I'm pretty sure it was page not found, when i logged requests comming it was recognized as: `/x/y/z` in CR6 it was treated as single parameter when i used url encoding. I will edit this post and add some logs in about 8-10 hours.  Star given, great job :) 
Yes, any object. Window blinks, but nothing happens. Nothing appears in log file.
Hi.  I m unable to recollect exactly what the errors where. But it was something like this:  Cannot create home/(username)/.local/...../(filename).(extension) No such file of directory.  I think, in the script, you would have written where the files have to be copied relative to the current directory from where the ./install.sh was run. This caused an error(Maybe my system problem) as it couldn't 'cd' into proper directories and copy the main files  On Mon, May 28, 2018, 6:07 PM Matthijs Kooijman <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Can you please be more explicit what errors you are seeing?

Hi RaphC,  I misplaced my orignal find.  Found these others instead:  http://software-testing-tutorials-automation.blogspot.nl/2012/11/pause-refresh-and-waitforpagetoload.html and http://www.pushtotest.com/selenium-and-testmaker-reference  Both suggest the target is to be used for the value when target is  irrelevant.

I hope so. Tried to find some example with same kind of functionality, but all offered just moving to another page.  That could be also included in test directory, and just load the page from file when running integration-test phase. 
@philipwhiuk Any email provider. Maybe I did not describe the problem clearly,I refer to the forwarding identifier of the mailing list page.The weird thing is the email marked after the first forwarded can be shown,but drop down on the refresh and the marked icon is gone
I used `"tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, parse"` annotators, version: `"edu.stanford.nlp" % "stanford-corenlp" % "3.6.0"` 
I have update the issue detail and some device with problem and without problem.
latest of all P:R and RemainInMotion. http://i58.tinypic.com/6r1o29.png is my setup. 
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);         latch.await();         add the two line code can resolve the problem.beacuse all Thrad run down.part of  the data not write to the tcp connect. Sorry!   
Yep, double checked, I got the update just 1 hour ago, before testing...  Your fix seems to work, but only when the option is not already checked.  What I did to fix the issue:  - Disable logging - Close database - Force close KP2A - Load KP2A and DB - Enable logging - Close database - Force close KP2A - Load KP2A and DB - Send logs  Following this scenario worked. Maybe there are useless steps, but I could not send logs before disabling and enabling the option again...  I tried a more adapted scenario:  - Disable logging - Close database - Force close KP2A - Load KP2A and DB - Enable logging - Send logs  And it works. Of courses logs are empty, but it makes sense...
1. I tried to copy data inside the same region (from a bucket in us-standard to us- standard), and I reached very good speed - 440 MByte/sec (3520 Mbit/sec), so actually AWS dependency does not slow down the speed. 2. When I placed the EC2 machine in Frankfurt, I reached almost twice better speed than when the machine was located in N. Virginia while copying data from us-standard to Frankfurt - 38 Mbyte/sec (304 Mbit/sec). I'm not sure that there is a real problem here. Transferring data via WAN network always works much slower then via LAN due to latency and bandwidth 3. Regarding -e / --endpoint option, my source bucket is located in us-standard and target bucket in Frankfurt, so I don't understand how this should work? If I define a Frankfurt's endpoint, the application will try to access both buckets using only Frankfurt's endpoint? Or there is a possibility to define separate endpoints for source and target buckets? 
Ergh, I messed up. I was talking about the tanks and energy bar, but apparently somehow they'd got resized down to being tiny and I neglected to check first -.-  My bad, no bug. You can close this ~.~;; 
Hi, yes in htop I can see that it's filled all 8g of memory I told it to use.  We're running it on a large volume (probably a few million files), perhaps it's legitimately filling the memory?  I was just assuming there's a memory leak somewhere. 
I haven't been able to reproduce it either, but it's something that some users are reporting. Need more information from them about their setup.

I uninstalled the plugin, restarted idea, and manually installed the nightly build per these instructions: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/installing-plugin-from-disk.html. Still no luck.  Please log an issue here with the following details and reload the project.   
I need some time to figure it out: when and how this bug happens exactly. 
I've reproduced it in single player just by spawning a few ghosts and some Thaumcraft Eldritch mobs.  I suppose we can throw potions at entities with splash or arrows too.  We're also using the infernal mobs mod, they will change potions when mob is spawning and might update them periodically.
Sorry, i am very busy at the moment. I will look into it and try to provide the necessary logs. I hope i will get into this at the weekend.
Since the issue report system does not support uploading .json, I change the file extension to .txt for upload. I can only import 9 records (13 rows) of this file. It stopped import at the one with Chinese characters in parameter values using Google Refine v2.5  [20160423_210000_shop.txt](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/files/229279/20160423_210000_shop.txt) 
project demo is here: https://github.com/tuhao1020/config-test-demo you need to start consul and a config server, then you can reproduce the problem  
i saw the commit but thought that didn't apply because `ENUM$VALUES` was not being accessed.  for now excluding one thing leads to another exception and so forth. im using [this apk](https://apkpure.com/grindr-gay-chat-meet-date/com.grindrapp.android) version [3.0.8](https://apkpure.com/grindr-gay-chat-meet-date/com.grindrapp.android/download?from=details%2Fversion&fid=c%2FAPK%2F3056%2F0353e63a57aaa5a2&version_code=14016) (because latest is multi-dex). i'm processing the packages of interest only `-it '^Lcom/grindrapp/'`.
Alright, got it. Note, this occurs on ANY right click when you are not within range of (the black square outline). Removing this plugin fixes the issue, and no errors/exceptions occur.  
Yes and yes. The process is simple  1. Install TaskBar https://f-droid.org/app/com.farmerbb.taskbar.  2. Launch it.  3. activate it in the upper right corner, any setting does not affect anything though you might want to go to the general settings and set position on top.

Yeah I switched it to ${intensity.percent}. But regardless I can't get it to dim by saying "Alexa, dim the arc lamp to 50"  I used hurl.it to send http request using all the same stuff i put into habridge and it works fine. So I am not sure what habridge is sending to my homeassistant that it wont work. 
Today's or yesterday's nightly build.  It's easy to reproduce, it happens every time: menu -> manage -> import from web  wait a while...  press back button.  wait 3 secs  FC 
there you go https://github.com/StephanPraetsch/factcast-inmem-problem  that creates output like 
@purringpigeon I uploaded a new SNAPSHOT-Version:   
note that Suse 12.3 comes with glib 2.17 (v2.17-4.7.1 for me atm) so higher versions seem to work.  
Unfortunately there no easy example, I think it's related to the annotation being in the library with an older version.
I guess that you create new Images at some point. Just create them as static fieleds once.  instead of calling return FMUIPlugin.getImage(imgPath); every time just cache them.  See ConfigurationMapLabelProvider.getColumnImage  The images might actually already exist somewhere.  We could also just rewrite the method FMUIPlugin.getImage to cache the images in a map.
My recommendation is we fix this upstream in logstash. Comments, votes, design discussion on http://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1097 very welcome :)  Personally I like leaving this 'downstream' issue open (with an appropriate tag) until the problem is solved 'upstream': that way we can keep track of 'external' work that will improve the experience of working with logstash-logback-encoder, and perhaps see if we can find another workaround when the problem remains unresolved upstream. But that might be a matter of personal preference :). 
Its the same as main server :P and i did this when i went to bed, appleassult told me before i went so figured i do this before i forget 
Belarus. Don't use any VPN. Changing content country in settings not helping (tried US, GB, RU, BY).
@heiko-braun no, this is just a followup from #3460 and the discussion continues there, do you want to leave this open for tracking purposes or do you want to close this?
I tried to debug this "Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Current VaadinSession is not open" exception. It seems to be somehow linked to Spring session fixation and might be a corner case timing problem. We will get this exception if there is VaadinSession that is still alive and being killed by Spring session fixation and at the same time we are logging in and new VaadinSession is being created. Spring will throw this exception, since the the session being killed is closed and now UIScoped bean can be instantiated to that context. The application works since soon after this new VaadinSession is alive and UIScoped bean is instantiated with it.
@colintheshots Yes, sorry, should've mentioned that the list of apps doesn't pop-up to choose the default. The toggle doesn't trigger anything, the screen does just a kind of refresh. It was reproduced on Monday, on the 2018-10-21 build.
Sorry. I didn't notice your comment until I see the pull request. It's not urgent.
@allek5 Well I just "hacked" the code in AuthState there is the method "getClientSecret" and at line 632 there is the method getClientAuthentication() which takes the clientsecret (if any) and acts like that 
Sorry for the slow response. It seems to work consistently for zombies but endermen still doesn't work. Using build 250, forge 1230.

Here is what it was before I took out the JSON and XML parms:  steps.dependencycheck additionalArguments:         '--scan ./ --format XML --format HTML --format JSON --prettyPrint --suppression ./OWASPFalsePositiveSuppression.xml --out ./ --data /home/jenkins/tools --cveUrlBase http://ourmirror.com/nvdcve-1.0-%d.json.gz --cveUrlModified http:// ourmirror.com/nvdcve-1.0-modified.json.gz',         odcInstallation: 'OWASP Dependency Check v5', skipOnScmChange: false, skipOnUpstreamChange: false  Nothing I did would make the XML and JSON reports be anything other than a default report with zero vulnerabilities.  I remember too that these default reports also showed that nothing was scanned, zeros across the board, yet the XML report was quite accurate and usable.  It (the XML) also appears to be fed into the mechanism for Jenkins to display the vulnerabilities page.  Michael Corum
@sparkoo I've set it to the address the command kubectl get ingres che-plugin-registry gives me and that is without /v3 at the end. And I don't think I'm using tls. Can I see it anywhere if it is used?
Forgot, of course I have the MessageListenerAdapter beans configured as well in my `RedisConfiguration`:    Sorry but I cannot really provide a reproducible test case now as this error takes weeks, sometimes months to happen and this project is not open source. If I reduce it to a just the redis part I'd not know if the error is still in there as it would have run months in production before that and even after months it would not be clear that the error will never happen again. But the redis pub-sub part is basically not more than I just posted here.  Would it make sense to provide some state of the `MessageListenerAdapter` beans as soon as this happens? What would be useful info?
@hmottestad thanks for looking into this. I'll need to revisit this to jog my memory but from the top of my head, yes, UpdateContext was added to handle isolation. IIRC the way it is set up is such that `addStatement` without a context is actually the "special case", that is, it translates to an addStatement with a null UpdateContext.  As for removing that line from the test: I did that because the compliance tests should validate the _default_ behavior of the Sail. Especially since this config option is not (yet) available as part of the sail config template. But if removing this line makes tests fail we should perhaps raise that as a separate bug instead of trying to fix everything in this branch.  
@jexp I didn't catch it before, but you are right - running the first explain is just as slow as actually running the query, and adding `CYPHER planner=rule` makes it fast.  I realize these are pretty atypical queries - I noticed the issue and came up w/ them while writing benchmarks to evaluate neo4j as the database for a GraphQL schema defined server framework. 
We use POJO in the queue.
I just cloned the repo and ran mvn clean install (5.22.1) on che-plugin-git-ext-plugin on  a windows machine. But if you cannot confirm that behaviour, I will try again on a linux with a fresh setup. There are no exceptions just most of the tests are ignored. (all those that derive from BaseTests which uses the MockitoJunitRunner ).

Well, as I stated before, The Utility Worlds mod adds the ability for players to craft portals to their very own private mining, garden, or void worlds.  EVERY time that a new portal is created, so is a dimension, similar to mystcraft.  This is not such an issue with the mining worlds, HOWEVER, the garden worlds are only 5 blocks deep, 4 blocks of dirt/grass and 1 of bedrock.  Your mod is biting chunks out of those dimensions leaving gaping holes to the void when it tries to generate the lush caves because there is not enough depth for them to generate.  The Utility Worlds mod author is at a loss as to how it can be blocked.  I have seen mods in the past retain the ability to use either a whitelist or a blacklist so the server operators can decide which they need to use for their modpack servers based on the mods included in the pack, this is usually in the form of a simple config option that allows you to choose 1 for blacklist or 2 for whitelist and they utilize the same list in the config of dimensions for either one.  I am not asking you to remove the blacklist for players that need them, but it is not very useful for anyone using the Utility Worlds mod or any other mod that allows for dimensions to be added at any time.  As it stands, if I add say dimensions 5, 6 and 7 to the blacklist today, by tomorrow I may need to add 2 or 3 more and restart the server for the list to take affect and by then the damage may already be done, you want to talk about annoying, that's rather annoying as well.  Perhaps then if you can't be bothered to add a simple whitelist, then you can make it so that Lush Caves do not generate in dimensions added by Utility Worlds mod by default which would also solve the issue of the gaping holes in the ground.  It's ultimately your mod either way and at least I can turn them completely off for the server.

OK, I’ll check this again soon and write what I’ve got.  P. S. Not so soon, I suppose. 🤔 
This is how I include the library: `    implementation 'com.github.nextcloud:android-library:master'` That should give me the latest version?  As for a test: after letting the user enter server and username + pwd there's an ASyncTask started that does this - there's not much more to it that just that. You can even enter the credential in source:

No.
Thanks for feedback Nitin. As of now there is no support for case change functions, but I created issue to track that request: [#128](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/issues/128)
Commit 4d680abed3793dc2a003185e538123952ea591b0 renames the request parameters from ``<something>`` to ``pt.<something>``.  But the web client can't handle that.  Commit 4828b13815e4cd5a9f9ee89aad55519d015929b1 wanted to tell the web client about the new parameter names, but it wouldn't work for anything but the first request (move one of the markers: crash). Reason seems to be that the web client does something with the parameter strings which doesn't like ``.``.

Yes, Windows 
I have the widget on my home screen. Sometime it needs to be re-added because it is no longer there. 
Argh, sry, I've forgotten to replace the maven property in pom snippet.  I'm using version v5.1.1. I will try it with v6.0-rc1. (I only looked at `Attachment.java` and have seen that it wasn't changed but now I've seen the changes in `AbstractConfluenceSiteMojo.java` :wink:)

Hi @spidru, please apologize my late response. After some further testing in december I switched to another GRIB2 library, because I was running out of time with my project. Finally I found time to test your changes. In the attached screenshot you can see the two outputs from release v0.4 and the version I build by using `gradle clean build` myself. As you can see your fix works, I would recommend a new release with the recent commits. Even if I didn't used your library in the end, thank you for your fix anyway.  ![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19152212/73171399-eec64c80-4100-11ea-9548-76ef3f958be8.PNG)  
It adds a section to the config, then removes it at the end, which should be the same thing. I've tested it, and the added fetch section gets removed. 
For me at least, if I use the apply operation with a 1 parameter operator, and specify a fixed value in the second slot, the result is a 0 parameter operation.  i.e. I have an operation variable that accepts an entity and returns an NBT value. If I use it in an apply with an entity variable, the resulting variable can be placed in a display to see the result. It seems it can also be used again in an apply.

Do the channel numbers in the android media URI (123 in `content://android.media.tv/channel/123`) correspond with the channel numbers in TVHeadend? If so, then I don't have channels with the numbers in the errors.  I do have some channels without logos, though the error isn't showing up for those. 
Hi thboileau,  Thanks for your promptly reply!  the jars of Restlet Framework that we are using are: ![org restlet-jars](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12999827/8322130/16c655be-1a63-11e5-8f37-e6351ff4ebe0.png)  and classes that we utilized are: ![genericclient-import](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12999827/8322166/a87ecb80-1a63-11e5-9da5-fb8aab8bcf9a.png)  We did not test the last stable release (2.3.3) yet since we are doing platform migration test from Windows to IBM AIX and the result will be applied to production environment too.  We may try the last stable release but also want to identify the root cause of this issue so that we can fine tune the system or server environment to avoid similar issue happen again.  I would like to provide more details if needed.  Thanks! 
I have only tested a couple of videos (as not all videos crash), but when using FFMPEG.exe direct it does not crash, it just cannot process the videos.  The behavior is strange, some corrupt videos will crash the JavaCV straight away, others crash when we use multiple videos/instances but do not crash if we load them as a single file.  It seems that when we pass the video and time to extract the frame from, it is after this point it crashes. It seems to be a crash with the codec used inside JavaCV. I have tried adding catch code (in a try-catch block) so that if for some reason JavaCV cannot extract a frame or a codec issue appears it then should return an error without crashing but this does not work and it still crashes.  I think we need to find a way to stop JavaCV from crashing (which then crashes the whole java application) when an exception like this occurs. Do you have any suggestion on how we can add code to stop JavaCV crashing, or if errors like these occur, then we get back some indication an error occurred, the process stops, but does not crash?  We have managed to stop some types of corrupt video crashing the application, but we have to get each video, look at the error, then try to add code for each error which is too bigger tasks as many videos crash in many different ways. We need to find a solution so that if JavaCV crashes or cannot work, it does not crash and returns an error.
@lumpfish  Apology for a not-so-clear description. I have updated it. The issue was originally created with the following in mind:  JCK tests currently run via STF wrappers. These wrappers are part of systemtest repository. So, in order to compile and run JCKs we need to compile systemtests and STF. However JCKs have run without STF wrappers in the past. So, for sake of simplicity and ease of maintenance we may want to think about running JCKs without the STF wrappers.
I installed the app version 20171208 from f-droid and everything worked fine.

Then I uninstalled 20171213 and reinstalled 20171208 from f-droid because that one worked. Recently f-droid updated the app to 20171213 and broke this once again.
Yes, now it does have an empty constructor :) But unfortunatelly, the same exception still occurs.  I know about the debug feature, but I'm on the way to production state, so this is no option for me. As I've seen just right now, the exception also occurs, if don't change the data model but only the db version in manifest. 
Thanks for the quick fix!
Sorry, sloppy me.  I'm on Nvidia shield k1, LG G2 and Nexus 7 2013. Both marshmallow and lollipop.  
@jorgesilva I came up with an idea and the problem has been solved. 
Sure: ~~[springhealth.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/2686778/springhealth.zip)~~ [springhealth_2.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/2693773/springhealth.zip)  Just start the application, call `http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/rabbitmq.consumed` and u will see the following:    The second output is the one I would've expected :-)
Sure, here it is. ![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 12 05 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42695513/47663286-0405a180-db73-11e8-9f72-839c3896e7ed.png) 
我用dolphinscheduler用户安装了ds，不是用root用户。 I use user dolphinscheduler to  install ds.  修改/tmp/dolphinscheduler的属主或者权限都能防止这个错误 Modify /tmp/dolphinscheduler's owner or authority prevents this error  但我想知道的是，在1.1版本是通过sudo生成缓存文件，1.2版本是通过安装用户自己，这是版本做了修改还是一个bug？ But what I want to know is that ，the cache file was generated by sudo in version 1.1  and in version 1.2 by the user installed himself. Is this a revision of the release or a bug?
Right. Its an issue from the `raml-parser-2` project. Have submitted an issue there.  https://github.com/raml-org/raml-java-parser/issues/558
Exactly, it will only place as a normal block in the world and not work as intended. 
An example would be the (overworld) ores from Thaumcraft for which I enabled UBifying for Amber and Quartz ore and was a bit surprised about the missing alpha blending. <details>    <summary>The overlay textures with partial transparency</summary>    ![ore_amber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3805624/52109619-6781ee00-25fe-11e9-8748-dc73bf86d320.png)  ![ore_quartz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3805624/52109620-6781ee00-25fe-11e9-8d82-d259630744df.png)  </details> I've cut out the non-opaque parts for now, but would like to put them back in :-)   For the sake of clarity though I should mention that I'm not entirely sure if alpha-blending is actually missing or if I just badly misjudged the overlay's appearance ingame^^  
Both. I can't look inside of a chest as a result
I run Wikivoyage offline, version 1.3, downloaded from FDroid. I forgot to mention that I removed some Google applications (maps, mail and 2~3 others), if there is a link.  Thanks for your work! 
have to check with bootstrap how it handles that be i suppose they renders on the other side (left-to-right) as well 
Thanks @thboileau, I just ran your code and am seeing an `ArrayList` of `LinkedHashMap`, so it's consistent with the issue I reported. 
Hello, when i first implemented an exception handler for the 0.13.0 release of java-object-diff i was fighting with lot of exceptions raised when comparing Hibernate Envers revision entities: i needed the proxied objects to get lazy associated entities to compare, so i couldn't detach them from session but, at the same time, the diffing tree invariably reached proxy attributes that raised errors when called to be compared. The exception messages were not usefull to clearly identify failing attributes because the complete node paths was missing in the exception message, so i wrote a listener (originally a single interface for both circular and read/write errors) to log offending node paths. In the meantime i reached a quite stable solution using attributes exclusion both with builder exclusions configuration and annotating entities with @ObjectDiffProperty, even if i don't like very much the annotations which pollute my persistent model with diff engine implementation details. I think the DiffNode is indeed an essential information to pass to the exception listerners. 
Hi Axel,   I've found that the root cause is that I use data sources with autoCommit mode set to false. In this case even extremely simple case (just schema history table creation without any migration) fails in concurrent environment. I've reproduced it in naive test [here](https://github.com/apanasevich/flyway/commit/03a47e00a355106a1d5f9f6fb1cca20bf0360687) in a separate branch.   Also, I've commited a [fix](https://github.com/apanasevich/flyway/commit/8afe727e6ae073af7e0c4f6e111b0e64080015cd) in another branch. Could you take a look on it? If you find it correct, I'll create a PR.  Unfortunately, I can't find any test in the repository. So, I've checked the fix only with PostgreSQL. But I think the problem is related to other DBMSes.
Add, Set and Sub works just fine. It's only Get that's weird
Maintable beta is fine
I just requested the infos. What he wrote me is that it happens all the time on any device he has access to. He told me it happened at some point after he used the app for some days. He is using the latest version from the market. 
Upgraded to version 2.6.0, but the problem still occurs.  Here my sample code:  **Fragment**   
Cannot reproduce this either, so possibly it has been fixed by fbc723b58d73386d8deae9da66d8bdb1c6f6344f.
I don't know whether they ever worked locally, but yes I am using VirtualBox. I'd like the tests to be resilient for that, or be skipped explicitly in my environment if that's by design - help me with it? 
In English. I downgraded to 362 and the issue seems mostly gone. 
1. This is the first time i am trying it. 2. "is this Android native or generic" - I don't get the question 3. The error seems to be from android. Will try to grab more logs and paste. 
it's version 1.4.1
I called 'Wallet.encrypt' and then called 'Wallet.decrypt' again. And when you call the 'currentReceiveKey' function 'DeterministicKey' which is the key value of 'KeyPurpose.RECEIVE_FUNDS' in 'currentKeys' which is a member variable of 'keyChainGroup' is found, and 'DeterministicKey' value is known as 'privkey' is null.  After 'decryprt', the data of 'currentKeys' which is a member variable of 'keychaingrouo' is not updated.
It's definitely a regression. Can't say exactly when it started happening, but it's been at least 2 or 3 months.
Block tiles seem to already be loaded in the way Cervator was suggesting: getting a list of every asset file of that type, then processing them all in `WorldAtlasImpl`. I'm pretty sure that that should be possible for blocks, too, as all block registered with the `BlockManager` come from either block-family assets or auto-tiles (blocks with no special properties, specified only by their textures). It should definitely at least be possible to continue using block families in the same way (only explicitly mentioning the family for registration, not the individual blocks).
Yes. Checkout the syncOrch branch and run AddRemoveNodeTestIT.   Note, you need to uncomment  "//throw new WrongClusterException(clusterId, layout.getClusterId()); " in the CorfuRuntime class. 
It does sometimes jump, though the jumping is a lot more apparent with the crusher.  Takes less than a second to process something.

I agree that would be best to match transit. Transit has an index with the time departure and after that says the line and more things in the map view, but in the itineraries fragment it just says "1. takes 5 min".  So, we can add the index and always say "1. 3400m - 5 min" instead of  "1. Ride 751m takes 2 min", in the map view, to have information about the distance. I think that is good to avoid the use of Ride or Walk here to have the same output for all the bike routes even if they start with a little leg of walking, also matches better the idea of the transit part. In the itineraries fragment we can just say "1. takes 4 min" if it is OK, as it is in transit, being this way more verbose in this part than in the map view.  I have tested Netherlands server and it happens the same failure with `itinerary` fields, so I will report the bug.  2014-01-29 Sean Barbeau notifications@github.com  > @vreixo https://github.com/vreixo Thanks for looking into this! For the > text, how about we just match what is shown for transit "xxxx - 4 min"? > This is simple and understandable, I think, and avoids translation issues. > This would apply to both walk and bike trips. >  > Could you please report the above server-side bug on the main OTP repo? > Once this is fixed, I do like splitting out bike and walk time.

@skabashnyuk IMO, providing both CHE_API_EXTERNAL and CHE_API_INTERNAL is reasonable even if it was in K8s/OpenShift world.  Workspace containers will connect to the ingress (or external endpoint that have external IP) if CHE_API contains public domain name. On the other hand, URLs with `http://che-server:8080/api` will be resolved as the local IP address by the local DNS.  At the viewpoint of functionality, some ingresses like Nginx does't handle websockets well. So I want to avoid connections via Ingresses if it was possible.   I can't say with absolute certainly since implementation of Ingresses are so many, but I just can say it's better to suppress traffic to  Ingress. It will give us some stability and quick response.

@dreis2211 could be.  Are you able to take a [server dump](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/jetty-dump-tool.html)? The dump should show if the `FrameFlusher` has queued entries or not. If so, you are probably hitting the same case as this issue.

As far as I can tell this is still happening in build 134, following the steps above and filling out the "Dive date and time" field. I invited you to join The Test Project of Unfathomable Awesomeness if you want to test using that.

I can reproduce the count difference using one SSTable file. So I like to seek your help tracking this issue.  Our data is composite key + composite column names data. I choose one example SSTable files including -Data.db file about 1190323388 bytes, plus CompressionInfor.db, Index.db, Filter.db, Summary.db, Statistics.db.  The sstable2json, parsing the Data.db file, will output 195238 as count of row key. If I iterator the columns, I will get 46167243 columns from these row keys.  Now, I built the index of the above set data. After that, I wrote the following unit test code:    The output is  keyCnt = 195234 recordCnt = 46167221  So using hadoop-sstable, it looks like I lost 4 row keys, and 22 columns. I have the -Index.db and -Index.db.Index files, but not sure how internal you are using the index file to generate the split and parsing the -Data.db file. Any help for debugging this issue?  Thanks 
It worked in older builds (1.7.10-70 and older), but it hasn't worked in any of the 'LC2' builds to my knowledge.

Here's our .buckconfig.local. The key part is `/buckcache/` this worked before that commit but not after. I haven't confirmed this myself but I'm told we're seeing cache requests going to the root URL instead.   
Version 1.4.2. Scene.json remains unchanged when I run headles mode after rendreing scene in GUI. As far as I understand, this is because the scene has already been rendered. Therefore, you must delete the dump file or change some property in the Scene.json (width, height, etc.) and then run headless rendering to reproduce this error.
NPC doesn't detect you at all when chase range is anything higher than 0. However, we tried putting it at 0 so it attacks and follows the player, than put it at 30, and when the player left the chase range of 30 it indeed went back home. So the only problem here seems to be an absence of detection when chase range is higher than 0.
I got the exception in the console process.  However the console process did continue to run.  only the query crashed.  and the query is select count \* from (select distinct abc from class) the class has about 1m records and total storage size of about 400 MB

Hmm.. How can I find out?  -- I just re-ran the scan by setting "Maximum rule duration" to 4 minutes and disabling "Handle anti CSRF tokens" after reading that this forces the scans to run in a single thread.  I didn't see anything come close to approaching 4 minutes, and it completed without issue.  The entire scan completed MUCH faster -- faster than I would have expected going from 1 thread to 5.  I've reverted those two changes and am re-running to see if this is still reproducible and then will run the scan by just changing CSRF.  It has already passed the point where it hung last time.

Yes I see there are no rules to ignore all files. This is my work project so I can't share it. This .gitignore file wasn't changed for a while, but today I updated plugin and problem happend. Restarted phpstorm 2 times and had to disable plugin becuase of this issue.

Oh yeah, they do, in the same mod I discovered this, thats how i circumvent the issue in my map, however the behavior felt like a bug therefore my post.  Now since I have an answer and the issue closed I gladly asume this is the intentional behavior of said plants.   The Plant Interactor from industrial foregoing behaves like it "right clicks" the plant, so Wheat (Vanilla MC) puts the drops inside the player's (or interacting machine) in its inventory, however the AA plants do not behave like that.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read the post and reply, i highly appreciate the time and gesture, and now my doubt is answered!  BTW: Maybe this could be a feature in later patches? haha.

I used the Version from Google Play, which Version should I have used instead? 
It does clarify the issue.  FWIW, I read what comments are present, and still this did not occur to me.  I doubt updating comments are high priority, but noting somewhere in the class that it's meant to mimic Line2D would have given me somewhere else to look to understand it's behavior.  Thanks for the library, it's been very useful to me.
I'm a bit busy, sorry, but here is what I added to just copy and paste USER_LOCATION("user_location", Type.READ), 
Ah, so you're saying that only pipe wire inputs will cause sided outputs? Yeah, that'll work. 
I have reproduced it 100% of the time on my test world.  
Spawn eggs. So I don’t know, do they have to be naturally spawned to stack?
Yep. 
Works on the ea build.  Thanks to fix it promptly.
I used ffmpeg to add a subtitle track to an existing MP4 file.  So I don't know why the edit list is there, but it seems that ffmpeg always creates an edit list for each track.  In my video there is an edit list for every track.  The edit list for the audio and video tracks indicate a duration equal to the length of the video.  But the edit list for the TX3G track indicates a duration equal to the length of that track itself, which is when the last subtitle ends.  If the last subtitle ends near the end of the video, then the problem is not very noticeable because the last subtitle is shown for only a few extra seconds.  But the problem really shows itself when the last subtitle is shown for quite a bit longer than it should.
I will try that later then (currently at school) 
Yes, that seems to have worked in my dev environment; thanks! In case  anyone else is reading this, the exact thing I added to pom.xml is, in  Flyway's <configuration> section:  <locations> <location>filesystem:src/main/resources/db/migration</location> </locations> 
These errors are from our server during online 25-35 players. Some of them do name their plots, so it's impossible to check what the name is. We thought the problem was in naming plots in other laguages, but only English is allowed, so that was not a problem

Thank you for the response.   I've narrowed this to a more reasonable reprex. The issue still persist in v1.2.1522. What I find curious however is that the issue does *not* occur when interacting directly with R *nor* with RStudio 1.2.1335. It only occurs with version *after* the current RStudio stable release. Below is some console output. You might be right that this `.000` that comes from a failed installation is from devtools. Whatever the case though this only fix I've found is to uninstall R and then manually delete that file then re-install. I think the central issue is that `R CMD INSTALL` is not running correctly with RStudion v1.2.1522 as the package builds fine. 🤷‍♂   <details> <summary><strong>Call with RStudio 1.2.1522</strong></summary>   </details>
@lpatino10 Sounds great! Let me know.  @germanattanasio I would love to create the patch if I am allowed to.  My manager was really excited about me getting the chance to contribute to the SDK.  Don't know if you saw but I work for IBM Watson on the public sector implementations team so it would be a great experience to get under the hood of something that we use so frequently.
I had this plugin on my server previously, and it worked fine. I had an NPC going from one city to another, it has to be a recent change. 
Exactly, it only happens when scaling is applied. displaying CMYK jpegs without scaling works fine. 
They come up with special `Float` and `Double` value:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/216930/19629370/b3e0ef58-99bf-11e6-90c5-4a94f0716587.png)

Yes. Using the Default encryption module. 
I've had this working for DASH, but not for HLS. It appears that HLS will only start playback after the first chunk has been received, even if i've asked it to seek. 
@tsmaeder what I mean with "builtins" is the vs-code built-in extensions as of this: https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14759  @ibuziuk what I mean is that there is more complexity to the theia API and builtin extensions so users may encounter known issues with builtins while trying to add a .vsix extension to the plugin registry.  In the case of html-language-features (which is a built-in required by the vuejs extension) it was enough just by adding the html-language-features.vsix prior to the loading of the vuejs extension but there may be cases in which built-ins conflict with each-other or .vsix versions of the ms-vscode builtins are outdated.  So this represents a blocker for a user trying to just make a sidecar container (and maybe a cli one too), and some extension's meta.yaml to add a ms-vscode extension to che. In this case maybe it would be nice to have P1 on this case to get help from che devs around it so users can continue their work
That's the example I'm trying to run. Don't you have any integration tests in your project? Why don't you put examples as integration tests into it and make sure they actually work? I couldn't find anything meaningful that's actually working regarding JavaCPP yet. You can run your github project in the travis integration test system for free simply by putting a one-line .travis.yml file at the top of your github project and activating the project on the travis service (see https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL/example-maven-project-setups). 
I'm without a root.
:shrug: `static` was what I initially listed it at.  It doesn't work as an instance method either.  It turns out I was slightly wrong: the problem is dependent on injecting something (I probably didn't `mvn clean package` one time or something).  This works:   Attaching a "working" [repro](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/files/1772563/repro.zip).

Actually, I considered this to be a PR (if PR means Problem Report).
HTC One M8 on android 6.0. In my file explorer I can reach the folder through both /sdcard/DCIM/100MEDIA and /storage/emulated/0/DCIM/100MEDIA.  (As a side note, since I'm not sure if this is related or a separate bug. In v0.2.7 the app crashes when selecting the "Excluded Albums" option in settings.)  Edit: I got the "excluded albums" option working again by clearing user data on the app. I can now see that the app is finding the camera folder through: /storage/emulated/0/DCIM/100MEDIA

What do you mean by it does not fit in the screen? The problem is caused by the has_child filter. The filter works fine by it's on.  I removed some parts of the filter and removed indentation so you can see the filter.   
Hi @chkal   Just tested with a fresh build of 2.6.0-SNAPSHOT from the master branch, and I have the exact same result:  `2018-06-29 17:13:42.292  WARN 13826 --- [           main] licationContextBinderApplicationListener : ApplicationContext already bound to current context class loader, releasing it first`  I don't know if @ruifigueira will be able to reply soon (we actually work together). I'll ask him if he has some spare time to look at this.
the steps are all that you need to do:    the dc.txt file is attached to the first issue  You don't have to _do_ anything - the errors appear in the logs about a minute after the node starts
> Please try the latest build from http://builds.jabref.org/clean-regedit.  Thanks Stefan. I tested this version and this bug is fixed. BUT there is a regression: when installing as admin for all users of the PC, the registry entry HKLM\Software\JabRef is no longer there. But this is what I need, see my initial post. 
@janpio I'm not sure. And just have a try, because I found that build-tools version has been changed in ".travis.yml" of this repo in v7.1.3.
The drums are from Extra Utilities 2 and I was using Liquid Pipes from AR. I used Iron Drums and the hold 256 buckets, so fairly good for a space station. Normally you can't mix liquids in drums like this but I don't use them very often.
Sorry - I found a workaround: save the SQL file in the editor under a different name and the issue went away. It it happens again I will for sure make a video.

@laszlocsomor prepending `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL` to the binary call (`MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL="*" node -e "console.log(process.argv)" /something`) will disable the path conversion.  But that puts the onus on Bazel developers to be aware of an implementation detail (usage of MSYS on Windows platforms) inside of Bazel. I'm not sure how many are aware of this caveat.  Are there any cases where the path conversion is desirable? Perhaps the flag could be set by Bazel when invoking MSYS.  Off the top of my head: - inside shell scripts proper one is always using win32 - any path sent in by the user running Bazel on a MSYS shell will reach Bazel already converted  
Fixed the issue, they all drop subsequent items, and double plants don't drop.

I have confirmed ,it is my mistake ,thanks @auhlig @emjburns 
@vsch Surprisingly, I am now unable to reproduce this issue. I do not know what state was my IDE in that this occurred. And it has occurred multiple times. But this time I am not able to reproduce it. If I am able to then I will share the file with you.   Meanwhile, if you deem OK then please go ahead and close this bug or I can do it. Let me know what you want to do.

The shields act as if they're not there. Say if there is a skeleton shooting, the arrow will just hit the player instead of being deflected.

I'm sorry I didn't explain fully the first time

Server response is fine since i can use it with other accounts. But with some specific accounts, it takes 10s from i click "Connect" until the message appears. And if i give a wrong password, i get an error immediately while using the correct password it times out. 
To preserve nulls custom Stringer should be used :)
Good question, actually I am not able to debug anything at all now.  Even without engaging PyDev debugger.  RED gets hung up on Discovering Libraries and it always seems to hang up on the BuiltIn library.  ![_2019Jun04100100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1178569/58890145-b1173e00-86af-11e9-910e-93273cbf873f.png)  It appears that the robot debug session terminates?
I posted and the dev's response: "Well, I just link through, so unfortunately it's their issue, nothing I can do about it :(" 
No, there was a large plate pattern in the part builder.
Hello @h6ah4i   - Library Version : 0.7.2 - Android OS Version : Tested on Nougat 7.1, Kitkat 4.4.2, same behaviour encountered - Device : Moto G 2014, Samsung S4 Mini - Dump of `adb shell dumpsys media.audio_flinger` 
It is my own app, the only strange thing about it I can see is that it has playMusic() in the update method.  While this may seem strange, it is a direct code conversion from AS, and worked in flash.  Consider adding support to prevent playMusic() in update method from causing restarts on focus lost. 
I am trying to set the value via the "Polling Period" entry box in the "Device Configuration" section when viewing the Thing in Habmin. It lists 1800 (I assume that is the default). I enter any other number, click save, and this error shows up in the log. 
It works perfectly with the number. Thanks for help.
Welcome back @mbogoevici!  The easiest is to bring back these [tests](https://github.com/ilayaperumalg/spring-cloud-stream/commit/40c6c3504fc7a0251ce137130ee6e18b2dce63b2#diff-b7a90e11abc7f08eb2403bd3fb1a0ef3L72), run them, and observer the behavior.  
I have reactive spring-boot 2 appication and i need call external soap web-services in my service layer.

Sorry that I can't upload the pic as privacy. However after I debug this issue, I resolve it with some code adding to the `DicomReader.addInfo()` method as:  The pic has key `Palette Color LUT Data` leads to this issue.

Okay you can close this (or should I? not sure how this works)
I'll work on a repro for this soon. I wish I hadn't found it in the midst of "Jam Code" so it was easier to extract :)   
I clean up after the project is still the same，Maybe it's my build.gradle configuration is wrong? But I was written in document steps . 
Yes, they go off the edge.  You can scroll down to see the buttons, but usual Android UI is for panels that include a large text area to resize (reducing the size of the text area) to keep buttons below the text area visible when the keyboard appears. Try the Twitter app's post window with and without the keyboard visible.  I think there's some kind of flag to control what mode the keyboard is in - disabling predictions, numeric only, etc.  Screenshot in your inbox in a minute, as I can't post one here AFAIK! 
The entity I am looking is in atlas. I am still using the old atlas code  with latest egera code(not the latest connector), is this causing the issue?
Verified on vic-44dd1d94-dev.ova.  Closing.
I tried to open https://github.com/akka/akka in IDEA - it does not use Lombok at all. 
Yes.  Thanks for bringing this up. Because also I couldn't change the Composertype in the FeatureIDE project configuration after importing the model. After changing the type and clicking `Apply` or `Apply and Close` a error prompt showed up but closed immediately. Reopening the configuration, the value of composertype was still `FeatureModelling` (default I guess). Restarting eclipse fixed this too. But this is probably another issue.
I believe it was introduced when the gpx output was added as it was some sort of required value in the response

Cool, @bgogetap thanks for the tip!
Mathieu, I am not sure about the exact error location (it would be easy fix once we figure it out!). The error occurs in UI level, and the user is prevented from adding a new constraint. I haven't been making any changes in this area. Did you make any changes that might affect Constraints? 
hmm.. i tried sample it is working indeed. also tried all possible combination of generics and interfaces i have in my project still working on sample. not able to figure why not working in my project.  will send you patch if i am able to replicate on sample.  
I didn't make any change in project files. This problem seemed to be  related to lack of required Android SDK version. Analyzing the stacktrace messages I understood that the download should occur automatically but it failed. I installed the version 29 of SDK through SDK Manager and problem was solved.  Sorry about my english. Thank you for your attention. 
No I have this bug on 0.4.1, I don't see the v0.4.2 on play store. I think this bug is only on the streamers who have not much viewers (~50) - Username  ghostxts

@kingoleg Sorry, I don't know any workaround and thus downgraded to 3.5  @gbenmansour I cannot reproduce the issue with version 3.5 and the bug in the source code was introduced with 3.6. Maybe your problem is slightly different and has another cause. 
c:geo - 2014.02.27 Android - 4.4.2  I've been running this version of android for about a month and c:geo was working fine with it on a prior version and the one above , up until a couple of days ago. I had also updated c:geo about 3 weeks ago, but as I said above, it eas fine up until a couple of days ago.  I can use maps, navigation and all other functions of c:geo, its just the compass that is locked up. The distance from target still works but with no direction to show me the way, the compass is all hut impossible to use.  Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android 
Thanks for the quick reply! On the web interface always shows up a few different instances of the same e-mail in 'sent folder', and on k9 @ android have copies as well, but not from the tests I made today. What I mean is, the last time I have a record(more than one sent) of this, happened on 11.Jan.2017  I don't know if is relevant, but I have 'auto synchronization of emails/data' disabled. There's any way I can test the 'deleting of old drafts' to help you out?
@arvindsv I think we can document it.  
This is correct.  I get sent into a game that I did not "select", I'll check the next time it happens if the opponant is correct.
This is a plain bnd project - not a maven one. I am not using any - runpath. The bndrun comprises the exact configuration as aforementioned.
@Sirse The forge version is Forge10.13.4.1558-1.7.10 and im using AM2 1.4.0.009 which is the last version made for 1.7.10  I honestly hadnt considered it being a forge issue. I have had other problems with Minefantasy before aswell such as the bloomery and forge not lighting 90% of the time. I usually have to hit it with the light like 30 times before it turns on. Idk if thats a programmed feature or maybe theres something up with a mod conflict, or forge version. Idk.  Im currently just focusing on getting MF2 working as well as possible without removing other mods. So far these have been the only two issues thankfully.
Just to clarify. Is this really fixed? How was it fixed? Did you remove API 17 compatibility or implement reflection? Sorry, but it's not clear from the PR info.  
Both 1.11.2 and 1.12.1 have the issue.
Hi @fuss86 , unfortunately `File.lastModified()` suffers from the same problem: it doesn't return any subsecond granularity.  I haven't checked it, but supposedly Java 10 has this fixed.
@Damar95 yes I did everything I could imagine! but there is no result!
I am not developing this part of OSATE and does not have this bug - please open a report against osate-core for that. If you cannot reproduce the issue after, I will try to make a sanitized model for you. 
Hi @ISchwarz23 ,  To reproduce, we just need to add those two lines into `build.gradle`, then perform sync with gradle files.    Thanks. 
Tried in my code, but still experiencing issue... Here is how I'm doing this... I'm not sure how your library works, but maybe issue is somehow related to difference between query params of selection and deletion     Neither onError() nor onNext() is invoked when deleting:(

Hi @jimczi   OK, so if it is finally a breaking change and so, only a "docs" issue, I think that this doc page especially should be updated (referenced by Kibana search bar) :  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax
Sure, I'll test them tonight after work. Note that what I mentioned are trees, not biomes, so it's only the individual trees that cause the problem, not the biome the player is in. Another gigantic tree I'll test is the Sacred Rubber Tree from Minefactory Reloaded. 
I've tested it and it works, but I personally prefer the previous behaviour, as now I have to move the focus out of the field.  Would it be possible to just regain focus? Or is it too difficult for now?
yes, I am using Node.js.
I was working with MarkLogic 9 and I think DataHub v4.0.3, though now I use MLCP and ml-gradle directly without DataHub. For database configurations that require a database restart timeout you can try to deploy ml-config/root/task-servers/TaskServer.json with {"threads": "32"}. For token replacement you can use a token in a module (e.g. if mlContentDatabaseName=eds-nosql-rdl property is in gradle.properties then use "%%mlContentDatabaseName%%" in a modules.xqy module, deploy it, and observe that the token isn't replaced. For mlLoadModules/mlReloadModules only works properly with deployments from scratch, just deploy from scratch (i.e. with a blank MarkLogic/Data folder), then change a module, remove a different module, and add a new module, and rename an existing module, then run mlLoadModules/mlReloadModules and observe the results. ml-gradle by itself behaves properly in all these cases. DataHub does not.
I just ran a few `git grep` to search through your repository's history for any sign of tesseract, but didn't find any:  It seems that `fscrawler` has always used `parseToString`... unless there is another repository from which you started from, e.g. when it was still named `fsriver`?

I was able to use my old Che 4.4 server to commit the code. It's still not working properly either though, I was relying on the snapshot because I installed some other software which I know is bad practice. So I will work on creating my own container and stack. Not really sure why Git broke still though. 
it works fine on Lollipop.    Interesting, I wouldn't have guessed that b/c targetSdk=25.  Good catch.

This is the error actual error which occurs in flyway:    I haven't tested Postgres 9.6.x yet. In terms of whether this is even fixable, I think that the strategy for locking a schema for migration would need to be changed. You may be able to switch to using `pg_try_advisory_lock` and poll for it to go true instead of relying on `pg_advisory_lock`'s blocking nature.

i mean i break it  and when try to remove box (holo text) by command  they tell me there is no mystery vault created but the hologram text sill in world first line (mystery vault) second line (Right click) and can not break block in the old position of the chest please i need remove the text because i make mystery vault in other place thanks for help
> did it work with IntelliJ 13?   yes, it works  > How would you expect support for multi-repository?   I think it's not a problem with milti-Git-repository (and I don't expect that it will work somehow). By my problem rather is that when I have even one-Git-repository linked in my project and want to push it to Gerrit --> instead of push <b>_refs/for/master_</b> I got push <b>_refs/heads..._</b>

@paoloantinori I used to be able to connect multi source fields to one target field. I think we even demoed this as a feature at Summit last year @kcbabo?
the problem was i think because i changed the id of the bundle when i updated the modpack (but not sure) the logs with the mods are in here http://pastebin.com/zmaiijDy  now i cant confirm that the issue is still happening because i replaced all bundles in that base and i updated the mod since then , so the issue i think is outdated 
Yeah, using `{cni-plugins-amd64-v0.6.0.tgz}` with bazel 0.13.0rc1 works.  I don't like having to ratchet to a particular bazel version, but I guess we can do it if necessary.  It's going to be particularly painful for our release branches; we'll either have to require a maximum bazel version of 0.11, or we'll have to require a minimum bazel version of 0.13, neither of which is ideal.
These were the values: The necessary transaction fee is: 0.00000733 BTC (0.9 satoshis/byte) Transaction size: 0.816 Kb  So probably increasing the minimum to 2 sat/byte is the easier solution. This is the type of silent error that may leave people in the dark.
None that isn't normal; I hover around 25-30ms latency.  I think it may have had something to do with how fast I was breaking the block, because when I turned off my Haste II, it didn't happen anymore.
"Do you override or provide your own mapping?" - Didn't get you. Well but the same query works for the first time. 
Sure, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13109154/41300680-575e9366-6e34-11e8-9c21-8a02475f1a3a.png)  I don't see any errors (now) in Graylog, should I remove and re-add to dashboard tosee if I get any errors? At no point I do see errors in the browser.  An interesting note: If I select time period of 1 day, I see all entries including the top most (top 5 values instead of top 200) 7 day or 30 day time period and the top entry is missing, (top 4 values)  Thanks 
Yes, on other Samsung 8.1 devices. We were starting to test on other versions, but we developed the workaround, so we concluded our testing.
Hi, - Starting cryptomator in admin mode: same issue with installers or executables needing escalation of privileges. However, I can perfectly run executable not needing admin escalation - Starting cryptomator in user mode: exactly same behaviour, user mode apps can start while executables needing escalation of privileges don't have access to the mounted vault  Wired because I am mounting the vault while removing the "--options CURRENT_SESSION" param and keeping the other default options. Apps started in admin mode do properly have access to the encrypted vault this way. But, the executables in admin mode don't ?

@vreixo Great, thanks! 
I left a comment in the pull request.
I have chosen the right encoding GBK in `Text`, but in `Table Editor` words still are squares. In `Text`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16850617/62408668-d4526100-b5fe-11e9-8602-680d333f964e.png) In `Table Editor`: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16850617/62408674-ee8c3f00-b5fe-11e9-97a6-95d516c396f5.png) Here is the sample file [sample.zip](https://github.com/SeeSharpSoft/intellij-csv-validator/files/3463575/sample.zip) 
~~I used Windows installer downloaded from releases page.~~  I think I should be more specific: version 6.2.3 was downloaded from here https://dbeaver.io/files/ea/ as a fix to issue #6928. _By default_ I download installers from releases page.  The same issue exists in earlier versions.
@charafau Sorry for getting back to you so late. We actually chucked Flutter because of its webview issues, I will try to give a minimal code to reproduce it 
I see this in Courier, LucidaTypewriter, MathJax_Vector, MathJax_Vector-Bold, Nimbus Mono PS, Noto Color Emoji and VT323. I do not see it in Source Code Pro and Source Code Variable. These are all the fonts I can choose. I will change my font to one of those then.  Also: I set the preferences to automatic line breaks. If a new line starts then, the cursor gets resetted.
That was restored ok(can't find logic). Try to create  aa database and restore it from file. After that create bb  and try to restore it. Second restore will be to aa.

Sorry, I was busy last week. Here is gif that shows the problem. Problem occurs only when AppTheme's windowIsTranslucent set to true and the app was launched from the desktop screen. If the app is launched on top of another app (as it happens when you build from android studio) everything works just fine ![ezgif com-gif-maker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30048242/53417596-f78d3a80-39e6-11e9-9c14-400afeb59e1d.gif) 
Thanks,@minwoox @anuraaga @trustin    it is very strange.I've done a lot of data simulation on the original environment,But none of the above shows up.  @anuraaga  You may be right.  I agree with what you said .   I only  catch InterruptedException,ExecutionException,TimeoutException. 
> Is it Android 10?  It's Android 9
Sure, I'm fairly swamped at work right now, but will this week.
> Can you provide your sharding rule configuration?  I didn't describe it clearly, Now I think I'm clear. I'm sorry.  run well.  The issues is simply that inline.algorithm-expression don't support uppercase.  It's a minor problem, It just doesn't look consistent. 
@iocanel @jimmidyson i think this kind of transformation is relatively.  you can used original model convert json and  used the same json convert model  the result is same  original model 
I messed it up to set the module path correctly in Gradle. Now I am able to compile my stuff. Sorry for that, it was my mistake. But there's still another problem: I'm using eclipse 4.10 and it does not recognize the module-info.class inside META-INF/versions/9 thus displays an error saying 'net.bytebuddy' cannot be resolved to a module. If I repackage the jar and put module-info.class in the top-level directory, it gets recognized by eclipse and everything's fine. I guess eclipse does not (yet?) handle multi-release jars correctly. Are you aware of that? What IDE do you use?
Using the ElasticSearch 6.5.4 as storage. Sorry that I couldn't send a fix for you asI don't know the exact cause for this problem.  Maybe I should upgrade to the latest Skywalking 6.3.0 and try again.
this was caused because of encryption on server side, and as I am notified there are still some issues with encryption on server side.
there is only " the application consulo could not be opened".  I've reinstall os and it worked till i closed the app. when i want to open it the second, situation reapeats. 
The weird thing is that I have dropped the stored caches and reloaded a couple today and the position on the live map is now accurate. The original stored caches were uploaded from a gpx file with other caches a couple of days ago. I will need to see whether this was a problem relating to storing many (60) caches at one time.   I'll keep playing with the software and see if I can replicate the problem. Meantime the bug has resolved itself..... 
Fixed! I'll remember the updateSite= trick just in case something similar happens again
Not sure, @quintesse just said that it didn't work for him. 
Sure  
I've upgraded to 1.2.672-1 and so far today I haven't noticed an issue. Scrolling with a mouse-wheel while directly over the scrollbar as described above did not cause the issue - the scrollbar remained as it should.
I had "Mod" inheriting from a "TMod" rank that I removed when updating permissions, and forgot to fix it. Unfortunately you skip past things like that when you're updating things at 1AM.
I put 5.0 in the title because that's the version I was testing. It seems that although some of these are not new strings, they weren't truncating in previous versions - so seems like some are regressions?  I don't have a previous build or screenshots to tell though. But I filed truncation issues for the previous release, and these strings weren't part of the truncations, I believe.
Yes I did that twice and nothing showed up...
I agree that this helps fix application errors by forcing this during development, but when an error like this would occur in a production app, in theory, the app could continue working (if the exception was caught, in which case the app design should have been better, agreed).  I think this is a balance between forcing better flow design and robustness in case of failure. Now that we know runtime errors can be thrown when registering for example, we can check for this (and remove the catch-all from otto _shame_) 
Haven't tested on other builds. 
This happened when testing scaling on a large topology on aurora.  
Different device IDs. Thanks for checking it out!
I did not see this every time the activity was destroyed. I do believe it is a race condition.  Unfortunately, I am pressed for time and just reverted to the old version of Glide I was using.
Yes, it is paired. When I go back to an older version of CanZE, it still works correctly 
So the first sample below, is my way of searching through the fields of a PDF given an input stream.  I'm checking to see if the name of the editTexts and other UI elements match the ones in the PDF, if they do then I write onto the PDF Fields what is written from the android UI.  There are a lot of commented lines I should have removed, these are just things I was trying out.  (Note: I may be missing curly brackets near the end by accident, I cut out some of the other "if statements" as I am trying to transition from another library to PDFbox)    If I am missing a call of a function or if there is anything that stands out that shouldn't be done, please let me know. 
maybe foot and bike should also be able to use `highway=bridleway`. And I just got a car route over a way which has the properties `highway=tracks` and `motorcar=no`.  Looks like a never-ending story. :smile:  
Yeah, that's currently one of the issues sadly.  The extension never gets deleted from the file (Which is the odd thing)
I am using ->        GMD = 2.0-rc5        GWT = 2.8.2       Chrome = any mobile device       OS = Android/iOS
Yes, that is exactly the problem I encountered. Failure in the compliance tests.
@gashcrumb - as part of the [Upgrade](https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/issues/1128) story, I'm proposing to remove the entire "Draft" column in the list view. 
ObjectBox version: 1.5.0: Recently I did not notice any similar issue.   I will try v2 and observe. Thanks =)
Yes 
Unfortunately, Not for a few weeks, as I'm travelling and thought that this may be an easy way to develop on the fly.   If you know of another provider with a newer version being hosted, I'll happily try replicate my workspace there. Otherwise I'll spin up a proper Che server once I'm back home. 
I still haven't fixed it since it was low priority and I was working on other things such as deployment and documentation. I will try to finish it this week.
But what if the two registrations of the device are the same **IP:PORT**?  The first registration of the device is successful, but for some reason the device is restarted. The device sends a new registration to the server. Unfortunately, the device's IP and port remain unchanged. In this way, the device receives feedback on successful registration. But apparently on the server side, the Map  **regsByAddr** has no information about it.  Am I right in this analysis? Thanks.
That's a good question! Not very knowledgeable about MC modding at all, so I'm swimming in ignorance here. Could it have something to do with this recent change?  https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commit/205f5c13c844540000ed41fbc85057cb8de5ab53  Best I could find, clue wise.

I fixed my code. I used this combination during debugging. Still this should be fixed in future. pumpPresort is parameter without action (similar to cache size). Then I can choose or disable cahce. So I would expect that specified pumpPresort without pumpSource will behave as EMPTY source or without any action 
I am not sure about that because I do not know that much about mail spec which is a bit complicated... but only in: if (content instanceof String) { ... we check if something is ATTACHMENT and https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/mail/Part.html#getContent%28%29 says: For example, the object returned for "text/plain" content is usually a String object. So usually != always ;>. What if it is going to be InputStream or something else for some other mimeType? Anyway I do not think it can happen very often. Probably only if some other library will mess with DataHandlers or some other case but I havent seen that yet.  But since we are here there is one more thing to consider ^_^ which is connected to previous one. What about images (for example: image/png) that are INLINE? They will usually go to if (content instanceof InputStream) { ... or the new else {... Since there is no check for disposition they will be always treated as ATTACHMENT. But I think that images can be also INLINE (probably some other stuff theoretically can be INLINE to). For example some email clients can show images inside message and some other show them as attachments. But we loose that information...  Anyway I am not sure what you should do in such case: email.addMessage? (which doesnt seem right since it is usally for text/plain, text/html) or maybe there should be email.addInline? 
There are no error messages on the console (or any output for that matter). JSkat log attached:  [JSkat.log](https://github.com/b0n541/jskat-multimodule/files/2284382/JSkat.log)  I managed to get a stacktrace with jcmd.print (not sure if this is useful for you): [jskat_thread.txt](https://github.com/b0n541/jskat-multimodule/files/2284384/jskat_thread.txt)
It sadly doesn't happen only once and i can reproduce it.. It would be awesome if you could release bugfix release. Also off-topic but will you drop 1.10.2 support soon and just continue developing for 1.11? 
I flew to those coordinates, just exploring around checking for any bugs. That's the only one I found so far and the village wasn't like that in snapshot-5. In snapshot-5 the village generates normally on the same seed, which is weird 
Tested on 7.99.15 and confirmed not present. As for the build, it's the one linked in discords #testing channel released yesterday, and was also present in my port which is running from the latest commits, I'm unsure when the bug showed up.
 @aaalaniz Thank you for investigating, i'll try it with a different emulator setup as you suggested and will update this ticket accordingly.

@marcingrzejszczak My problem is that ExecutorBeanPostProcessor creates proxy of DelegatingSecurityContextSchedulingTaskExecutor which during execution forwards call to yet another task executor. It cannot do so, because the delegate field is null
Yeah I know, it's difficult to say... I have so many mods that mess with rendering and I'm just gonna hope that the issue goes away if I update some of them...

I can't reproduce it, but I remember that everytime I was trying to sync large amounts of data, I got the "Nextcloud doesn't respond" Android message and when I ignored the message and tried to use the app, it crashed.
@RagaRBM no, I am using the latest build 
Thanks Sawickil for your response.  I have considered the approach that you have mentioned. But I feel that it is bit cumbersome, as you have to index your data and right after the index completed you have to delete and create another river. The specific issue is that if you have any gap between the two, you may have data that is not indexed, because when index completed it was not there and was created before the incremental river was created (assuming the parameter value of last begin will be the current timestamp for the first run).  Potentially there could be two solutions: 1- The easy one is to allow the users of the river to pass on a value to initialize the $river.state.timestamp variable. That way we can specify e.g. Jan 1, 1970 or any other date that matches our needs to be set as the bootstrap value, it will result in fetching all the data even for the first run. Subsequently it will store the actual value of last river run and will automatically move to incremental mode. This could be very straight forward to implement and can be added as an optional parameter to river configuration. There won't be need to for two rivers and also the timing wont affect any results.  2- Second and more cleaner approach is similar to Solr Data import handler, where we can specify three queries i.e. regular query for full index refresh or first time use. And another query for delta identification and third to retrieve that data: example is     I think it will be great addition to an excellent project and could bring the elasticsearch jdbc importer functionality very close to Solr DIH.

It seems any lollipop devices connect with both versions, although of percentage of H2 requests is slightly higher on some devices, e.g., the h2 percentage of Nexus 5 is higher than Galaxy S6. 
HikariCP version: 2.7.8 Sometimes I get it:  https://hastebin.com/adujexiqad.md 'Does it only happen under load?' -This happens when I'm spamming with method which executes something to mysql, or 'two users' are using over 2 methods, in 3-5 seconds (i think so)  Example: 
I'm really sorry, I'd love to but I can't do that atm as I only have wifi a few times a day, passing through coffee shops. I'll try and do so once I have a proper wifi solution at home. This would take too much time to change all my settings, start syncthing, wait for wifi to time out, etc. Feel free to close, I only reported this for other users who might encounter the same issue as changing the mentioned setting solved this for me. 
Hey!! Thanks for replying, Actually the test case on which I am working is as follows, 1. I have created a server which is able to handle requests for file upload. 2. Of course one client can upload many files using single channel, But I am considering a test case in which I want to create multiple clients and to do so I should create Multiple Bootstraps, EventLoopGroup and Channel that means,  > One Bootstraps, EventLoopGroup and Channel per client and I am creating almost 100 client per second that means 100 Bootstraps, EventLoopGroup and Channel per second, Though I Shutdown each and every Bootstrap at the end of call flow (explained above), I am getting the above Exception.  If creating multiple EventLoopGroups is not advisable then how to replicate above scenario? Because at real time there will be millions of clients and each client will have its own Bootstrap, EventLoopGroup and Channel and the server should serve all those clients.  And if test app is necessary to understand the problem then I'll surely upload the code snippet of test case.

I don't think that should be a problem. 
I already had a PR (see spring-projects#100) but closed it to do it the right way (as described in Contributor Guidelines) 😉 
As far as I can tell it does. I'll make a branch/pull request 
That I don't know... Had to remove the Mod from the server. Its the auto sorting button.  
Android Studio, latest: 0.8.13, gradle plugin 0.13.+ I'm not sure that its related for 100% to iconify lib, it may be a fault of android build system itself.   dex options that I'm using right now and that solve the problem are:   
Yes, indeed it is the issue with symlinks :( Moving the project to a non-symlinked location fixes it. 
  This test acquires the first permit in the loop but the next call blocks forever even though the next permit should be available in five seconds.
It happens with any song. I'm running on Centos 6.5 x64.  It works if I try it on my own Windows computer, but it does not work when I try it on any of my 7 CentOS servers, all hosted by OVH.   Default settings for the bot
I have downgraded to JDK 12 until gradle (and vscode-java) fully support 13. If this issue still happens at that point, I will provide logs.
that was realy fast! i just tried and seems like the new version is working fine, right now they are all spawning outside of the range, i dont have time to try spawners and everything right now, but if i find something else failing i will make a new report  thank you!  
Confirmed it is from the machine, still figuring out how to fix it. 
This happens when I import a document. I am using 5.3.0
Not every time, but quite frequently.

Nice, quick find! Yea, we should do a quick release for this one. Thanks!
Sorry,I'm not sure... 
Done. Please find it [here](https://github.com/FWinkler79/SpringCloudPlatform/tree/Issue-Just-For-Spencer-Gibb).  To reproduce: * start service-registry <-- throws an error reported in spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix#1471 * start greetings-service <-- this is where the error of this issue occurs.  ❗️ Note: it seems the error is related to one of these dependencies:  If they are on the class path (like in the sample referenced above) the error is thrown. If they are removed, the error is gone. Unfortunately, I need all of them for the (non-minimal) setup I have initially referenced.
i think it lets me hold it but when i place it it is only visible to me and nobody else on the server also if i rejoin it wont even for for me anymore in 1.8

I've sent the result of "adb bugreport' by email. The device is an Intel/Baytrail platform running Android-IA.  The decoder is the one from Google, available in AOSP since marshmallow [1]. It used to be enabled by default [2], but for some reason this was changed on nougat [3]. The decoder is built into the firmware anyway, so I simply enabled it by including media_codecs_google_tv.xml into main media_codecs.xml.

@boaks I don't think I need to check the alert message after the exception has been serialized, so for me it won't be needed. But maybe others want to check the alert message even after it has been serialized. Is there any reason not to serialize the alert message as well?
The CAPS are use in a CONTROLLED fashion so your point on that was a waste of typing, and there is no attitude just hate repeating stuff now for the 3rd time it seems!  I understand that the NPC files are created with a RANDOM uuid. I also understand specifically from the lastAccountName value!  So the question is WHY or WHAT plugin could be creating this?    I type no commands this is RANDOM and it just generates this files daily!  Today i just deleted 1,300 of these files and when i posted this i just deleted like 3,400 previously.  The server as NOT been restart/rebooted since this post, and I/nor any mods have any commands what would create any such files.  Here is a list of my plugins you can view from this timings report, if you think some may or may not be compatible.  http://www.spigotmc.org/go/timings?url=14407071  Please don't tell me stuff i already know, if you have a question ask and i will answer, but WHY/WHAT would be generating all these NPC (fake/accounts)?  Thanks 
I am seeing the problem with normal table names like MASTER or CUSTOMER.
Yes ... That's right... Like this:  Authenticator authenticator = new Authenticator() {    builder.proxyPassword(cloudantProxyPassword).proxyURL(new URL(cloudantProxyUrl)).proxyUser(cloudantProxyUsername); client = builder.build(); 
Legacy, i will try update simpleclans 
Hello,  Yes! It was a problem with browser cookies.  Thanks greetings.
I think this is what you want... http://pastebin.com/XRnYA22h The problem is that the server doesn't crash itself, neither my client crashes, but the it shows an "Internal Server Error" and kicks me out of the server... Let me know if you need anything else 
I ran "gradle eclipse" before importing the project into Eclipse.
Here is an example: http://mardou.dyndns.org/bs4xp.nsf But I found out why: if you do not use applications links then this will occurr. When using application links the layou is correct and no scrollbar appears. 
when i load jpg or png,that's not happen.but when load webP,happen sometimes 
I'll try to prepare sample application as soon I'll get some time to work on it.
I found the reason in a thread of an erlang mailing list:  _Yes, the {timeout,1,...} applies to the whole subset of tests, in this case the setup and all the tests in it. The individual tests still get their default timeout of 5 seconds. If you reduce the timeout for the whole group to 1 second, then that will of course happen first and abort all the tests in the group, while in the first case it's one of the individual tests that times out first. Only when applied to a single test does {timeout,T,...} change the timeout of the test itself._  _I'm sorry that this is confusing. There should probably be a separate way of modifying the default timeout for all individual tests._ (http://osdir.com/ml/erlang-programming-bugs/2012-02/msg00006.html)  According to this I had to use test generators. There I can set the timeout individual for every test case. (Is there another way to set the timeout?)    In summary: It isn't a problem of the IDEA Erlang plugin. It is only a problem of the limited configuration possibilities of Eunit. How could the plugin help to avoid this problem? 
Okay. Upon testing it on a server with no other plugins, the error still persists. Here is the item I am using: http://pastebin.com/bDvhnf4D It appears to make the item disappear client-side, however not server-side when using consume. All I did was /rpgitem testyoyo give and right clicked with it. You can then just press Q to drop it even when it's not in your inventory. The error is inconsistent and will occasionally have consume work properly. This also happens when crafting items. 
That fixes the issue. Thanks!  One thing...  Since you are rethrowing the exception, there is no need to include the exception/stack trace in your log message.  I'm using Spring's `@Retryable` annotation and I end up with three of your stack traces, followed by my own stack trace in the logs.

> How, when, what's the context, why were you running our unit tests on what machine? Why 2.2.0 when we are at 2.2.6?  I just follow the recommended steps . `$ git clone git@github.com:ReactiveX/RxJava.git` `$ cd RxJava/` `$ ./gradlew build` and it generated three .jar files under /build/libs build/libs/rxjava-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build/libs/rxjava-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar build/libs/rxjava-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar but 2 tests failed
@concavelenz You might be right, depends on your point of view. For me `import {A} from 'ab';` means I'm only interested in A class from a.js and I think this should be equivalent to `import {A} from 'a';` `export {B} from 'b';` should be ignored in this case.  Is ES6 import works differently ?

I have just seen that there are also statistical code analysis tools available in the Github marketplace. All of them are free for open source projects. Most also add code coverage and security checks. I have no experience with any of these tools, but maybe it would be also interesting to add one of them?  - https://github.com/marketplace/codacy - https://github.com/marketplace/codebeat - https://github.com/marketplace/better-code-hub - https://github.com/marketplace/code-climate  They run checks before a PR can be merged, similar to Travis.  > Can you try out https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/ if it is faster?  Sure, I can try this, but don't you think it would be enough to only run them before merging the PR?
I reinstalled 4.2.5, and both action works. I'll retry 4.2.6 tomorrow. I'm not doing anything fancy on 4.2.6, just go the place, right click, create new XXX, get an error. Will post video if I can reproduce when I upgrade tomorrow.
Hi and thank you for your quick reply @derTobsch, the configuration is very simple:  
Unfortunately I'm not in a position to check right now, but I think I was still getting woodcutting *noises*, even if there wasn't any visible animation going on. It's possible that the animation may still be playing, to some degree, since that's one source of sound effect playback. It's also possible that the server's just sending "yo, there's a sound" messages to the client, in which case, Soy's suggestion is probably the best we can do, barring wierd heuristic magicks
Yes. The problem is that I want to define the values function to test the builtin values function. 
It's a default leshan demo client(modified, objects add), It's not like i can repeat it when i want(usually when I am off work ). Didn't have time to test. Leshan on device registry/registry update reads object data, and writes back some time resources, its mimics sleeping device, so I will try only with not modified leshan client, and maybe comment out jetty. and will check register timing..
Yes I am a premium member and the crash happens on a SGN with 4.1.1 and on a Nexus7 with 4.1.1. I see no crash on HTC Desire with 2.2 and c:geo version 2012.6.28. Also no crash on a Xoom with 3.2.  I think I had some similar crash experience with one of the caches in the south end of Central Park, but at that time I was only able to submit a bug report to the play store - this also happened on the SGN with 4.1.1 
I don't know what the overhead of `new` is.  I wouldn't leap into doing more object pools unless we knew that object allocation was a significant problem (i.e. as part of a general look at perf.).  Right now, I need to do something about the process size growth.  It might be that, if we really don't have a heap leak, all I need to do is reduce the heap size on my box.  That will have the side effect of making GC work harder, but (within reason) that's preferable to my current symptoms.  Still with me to poke around a bit more. 
Hello Holger,  I'am using Tabris 1.2 (current release). On mobile clients `setTitle()`works also at session time, this (minor) bug occurs only on web client.  Christian  
Found the bug in DateTimePicker. This seems to have been already fixed in 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT but in 0.9.1 there was a line `cal.set(11,12)` which obviously meant that hour field was always set to 12.  
It appears to be working now, which is odd.  After changing the color codes and prefix, and doing /petadmin reload, the new color codes were working in chat but the old prefix remained.  Now after a server reboot the prefix is gone and everything is working.  It seems that /petadmin reload doesn't update the prefix? I haven't touched anything since I posted this and the automatic server reboot fixed it. 
Oh, I was indeed using the deprecated API. Though adding through /rest/things (after adding the thing) giving me 500 error and not 409.  Logs are here http://pastebin.com/GLXPFqxZ

I'm running the application on Linux and JVM 1.8. I guess it is related to integer max value (2^31 = 2147483648) because we spot this pattern:  4464444523 (4.1G) got truncated to 169477227 (1.5M) (4464444523 % 2147483648 = 169477227) 10485760000 (9.8G) got truncated to 1895825408 (1.8G) (10485760000 % 2147483648 = 1895825408)
So I'm using spring boot, katharsis-spring and katharsis-jpa.  katharsis version is 2.8.2, spring boot version is 1.4.2  I've got an object (hypothetically `Car`) which aggregates some other objects (hypothetically `Car` has `Wheel`s in a list).  If I annotate the aggregated objects (`Wheel`) with `@JsonApiResource`, this fails and throws the exception.  Sorry I can't be more explicit, hope this helps.  I will try to provide a test case later today, but am a bit swamped.

I was talking to my colleague, Thurston (whom you've spoken with on the mailing lists), and he agreed with you.  Something like this in production would probably never happen and therefore is not entirely worth fixing.  I agree.  We should just close this issue. 
@raphw Windows 10. (Version 10.0.16299.19)  About JRE, it should work fine on JRE I think, in JRE 8 you could run byte buddy agent with manually provided tools.jar and added attach.dll to command line or via reflections directly to class loader - ofc you need to choose valid lib/tools for each system etc, but it works fine. So something like this should be possible in JRE 9 too. By somehow loading `jdk.attach.jmod` (I think this is the only one missing from jre?) and that `attach` library, but not sure how to do that yet. (like I said, it works perfectly fine in JRE 8, you just need to add that libraries to your .jar or download them on startup)
There are no error with sneak but nothing append, always stand, and isSneaking return true until we put stand.

Hi StavrevaS, nevermind, I retested and it works fine. I guess i did something wrong the last time.   My CT-MG installation is running in SSO mode and I created with a supplier user an onbehalf user for one of the supplier's customers. Afterwards I used the onbehalf user and called the mentioned cleanup method on the identity service.  Cheers, Sven 
Yes I do, seems identical to the one in the forge log I posted

I didn't enable the lockscreen for Signal, notifications are normally shown at my phone.  Edit: Misunderstood you, sorry. Signal is not at the foreground, I locked the screen while being at my launcher screen. 
I think I did exactly that by adding a `scala_macro_library` target that I don't run through ijar that I linked above.  I guess that + minimizing target size is the answer.

Yes, the enchant effect works (I probably should have removed that for this issue, I just had it on my test skript) 
So I couldn't figure out the incantation to make sbt exclude the nd4j-native-...${os.name}-${.... dependency, and then I couldn't figure out how to re-include it with the variables filled in.  So I guess it should just be documented until the Coursier guys get a fix in, sounds like they're working on it though.  I imaging a lot of Scala users who use Emacs (like me) will trip over this as Ensime officially recommends Coursier (because it makes SBT a ton faster).

In the 1.61, the second solution was working well, so I'm more up to stick into this solution. 
We're using Gradle 2.2.1.  I'll check to see if this fixes the problem when I've got time tomorrow.

Reindexing *is* a workaround. But i meant that there is no workaround as previous steps to actually use the shrink API with some previous steps.
Ok, I've looked a lil bit closer. If you use https for admin, then link will point to proper https orientdb address. The strange thing is that this address still is somehow "autoredirected" to http version. So, link shows https, but browser (FF, Chrome) on both Windows and Linux opens http version, and I still have to change address manually.   Even stranger: when I "copy link address", and paste it it goes to wrong url, but when I change url manually, and copy it again, then pasting it causes it to go to correct url.  But this is probably browser fault, and probably can't be fixed from here. In fact I'm gonna ask stackoverflow of this peculiar behavior.  Second scenario: when orientdb is using https, while dropwizard is using http, link explicitly shows http version, but that's really uncommon configuration and I understand that it is not worth supporting.

Yep, it's the same error in the title of this issue.  > I have updated [the readme file in this repo](https://github.com/Instabug/Instabug-React-Native#using-cocoapods) with instruction on how to do that. Can you please check it out and let me know if it works for you?  Nice! Yes, those install steps appear to work. Two points of feedback on the docs: 1. It might be worth calling out that if you do those manual Pod steps you'll still have to setup Android manually. 2. I'm uncomfortable with the `post_install do |installer|` step since it appears to unlink the React base pod. What's the point of this step? Also, the project still builds if I remove that step. 
Thank you. I've been off sick and unable to test anything. Thanks for resolving this.
My database (Fis Profile) is connected with external JDBC (developed by FIS). As I've mentioned it is decoded on server side with ISO-8859-2.  First step - setting jdbc connection with ISO-8859-2 encoding: ![latin2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19408985/15826491/092e8e82-2c08-11e6-9f85-fcbec57a7460.png)  Second step - retrieving data from STBLPAT table: ![resultset_latin2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19408985/15826570/520d5142-2c08-11e6-8544-2fea7168afaa.png)  Here I cannot figure out what is the encoding. I was trying every combination using notepad++ and still same mess.  Third step - First step - setting jdbc connection with ISO-8859-1 encoding: ![latin1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19408985/15826625/93301d26-2c08-11e6-8d1e-1842370b60bf.png)  Fourth step - again retrieving data from STBLPAT table: ![resultset_latin1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19408985/15826655/b6c34aba-2c08-11e6-9b13-09a0262bfab1.png)  Stiil mess but something is different.  Fifth step - using notepad++ I'm changing encoding from ISO-8859-1 to ISO-8859-2 ![np_latin1_to_latin2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19408985/15826700/df42c27c-2c08-11e6-8625-8c62bae438d3.png)  As you can see there is no mess anymore. Polish special characters looks just fine.  I've tried the EA version but got same results.  Any ideas?

Thanks for your concern. Issue is when you try to change(scroll) one recyclerview item to another the second item comes suddenly. Which is not smooth. May be I can create a gif and post very soon. Also is there any way to change the bottom position of the next and previous items ? I couldn't find anything. Please clarify.  
okay, i will do it tomorrow morning
@sberyozkin Yes the body returned is "Forbidden", which don't match the `Content-Type` of `application/json`. Take a look at the test in the reproducer.  https://github.com/SlyngDK/quarkus-jaxrs-security-wrong-content-type/blob/master/src/test/java/org/acme/quickstart/GreetingResourceTest.java  
Yes, kubectl get pods works as expected. In the kubectl config, we're using --embed-certs=false. Not sure if this causes the problem.
I tried to set it - same result 
Hi @mattjacunski , we tested it on samsung galaxy, htc one, and china phones. those three are using jellybean and kitkat. 
Yes. Even tried clearing partition cache to see if that will change anything but still didn't work. 
 I am running with   Plugin 0.10.852 IDEA 15.0.1 JDK 1.8.0_66 OS Ubuntu 14.04  I write a poc demo.   
Yes, it's device specific. Only mentioned devices are affected.  In the meanwhile, I figured out following details: 1. Using _top_, I compared CPU load, required to play my streams on the Japanese XPeria Z3 versus European XPeria Z3. On that Japanese device CPU load is twice as high.  2. As well, Japanese devices cause the following message printed to the logcat: 07-13 17:47:33.296 W/ACodec  ( 9173): do not know color format 0x7fa30c04 = 2141391876 , However, European versions do not. 3. Playback stops when the player switches to the 8MBps bitrate. In the initial experiment, I observed 10-15 seconds playback because I started with 1MBps, and then relied on the player to increase the quality. In the clean experiment, I fixed the bitrate to the predefined value and observed. Turned out that on the affected devices, there is no problem playing 4MBps stream, but when ExoPlayer is given an 8MBps stream - it consumes almost all CPU and drops all frames.  So far, my theory is: 1. Those affected devices are not capable of switching the surface to color format COLOR_QCOM_FORMATYUV420PackedSemiPlanar32m (0x7fa30c04) 2. Therefore, they fall back to converting 0x7fa30c04 into something like COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar just after decoding. And that's why CPU load is higher.  If my theory proves right, then there is a little ExoPlayer may do to improve the situation, except, maybe, adapting the algorithm of the maximum bitrate estimation, and including that "incompatible surface" variable into it.  
Hi CP,   Thanks for the quick response.  Here are the requested screenshots.    In the first, I have connected the reactor rednet ports via the rednet insulated conduits and set both to channel "pink".  The second and third image is the GUI for the big reactors rednet port which allows it to emit a redstone signal upon certain events.  In my case I have set the reactor control rods to automatically be the same % as whatever the internal battery level is thus shutting down the reactor / starting it up depending on the drain (going into your very cool capacitor bank).  This also happens when I connect the power monitor to the the reactor rednet port via the rednet insulated conduits and tell it to emit a redstone signal is the power drops below a certain level. Interestingly, in this setup it does seem to emit a signal (seen by attaching a redstone light) but does not "go into" the rednet port.  This is a very good tutorial on what Big Reactors are and can do if you wish to find out more about them:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sev05VJkgAY  BTW just a personal thank you for making such a great mod, you keep a 43 yo tinkerer very happy ;)  ![2014-10-16_09 12 45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9249158/4659442/1d424a86-550d-11e4-90d5-f21f2fa84453.png) ![2014-10-16_09 12 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9249158/4659443/1d47d03c-550d-11e4-85a8-0582974f6de7.png) ![2014-10-16_09 12 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9249158/4659444/1d490998-550d-11e4-8a0a-e15836c9cbd6.png)

it happen when I am open full screen from the recyclerview item in separate activity. and when i am back to screen my recycler adapter is notified that time it give the exception.
They use RF, I think? I noticed on another issue that this was a known issue for a while now, when charging blocks was fixed, it broke charging items. And it works on RF blocks just fine.
Additional info, the library project is only affected if it doesn't contain **any** resources 
The issue we're trying to demonstrate is:   1.  Subscribe to an atmosphere endpoint/chatroom 2.  Unsubscribe from that atmosphere endpoint/chatroom 3.  Subscribe to a different atmosphere endpoint/chatroom 4.  Make an HTTP Request to a non-atmosphere endpoint   We're finding that Step 4 often fails.  Is there something inherently wrong with the approach we're trying to use? Is there something we missed that would cause HTTP requests happening concurrently with atmosphere calls to fail/suspend/etc. ? 
Yeah, latter I've noticed that the class being in the wrong place doesn't break the build. but the class can be found at: https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/blob/fbb0173459b698b1bb9fcedf4ea3c4ac7b5f0cf6/contrib/src/main/java/org/archive/util/OneLineSimpleLayout.java

Yes, it is always reproducible.  Also I just saw when trying again there is a popup shown. Likely the one for the sync conflict. For one second, before it crashes.  When I opened a different txt file that was _not_ downloaded already and (thus) has no sync conflict, the built-in editor works.

Calling the @golang//... is doing it, but I'm saying it's not happening when you use a target that depends on that repository.   I'm getting this with rules_go. I have this is in my WORKSPACE:      new_http_archive(         name = "golang_linux_amd64",         build_file_content = "",         sha256 = "bb8fe0d81161e4a8b0a8b2145ee5f8a60370baf5d48c07a83f6f09e1ad253bec",         strip_prefix = "go",         url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8rc1.linux-amd64.tar.gz",     )      new_http_archive(         name = "golang_darwin_amd64",         build_file_content = "",         sha256 = "faf2530afbc78d8fa64054960a130f10aa2b183abd5879cdfd2ec1a4bca01ff3",         strip_prefix = "go",         url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8rc1.darwin-amd64.tar.gz",     )      git_repository(         name = "io_bazel_rules_go",         remote = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go.git",         commit = "d0142854a22a0dd98306280e897e64086289a0de",     )      load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_repositories", "new_go_repository")      go_repositories(omit_go = True)   The `omit_go` allows me to use the golang repositories I specified instead of rules_go using an older version. And I have this in a BUILD file:      go_library(         name = "go_default_library",         srcs = ["main.go"],         visibility = ["//visibility:private"],         deps = [],     )      go_binary(         name = "something_nice",         library = ":go_default_library",         visibility = ["//visibility:public"],     )  And if I change the two golang repositories to another version, and run `bazel build //path/to/something_nice`, the new versions of the Go repositories are not downloaded and used.
I tested alone.
@tanguyantoine I just downloaded the lib from npm the day before yesterday. It says version 0.3.4. Just did a npm update. It didn't change. And [here's the component](https://github.com/natashache/soundwise/blob/master/src/containers/Player.js) where the library is used.
Indeed, its in step 2. I've no problem with the code itself, as it works fine if I simply "Run" the app - it displays the white screen if I "Debug" it.  When I'm "Running" the app, the "Flutter Hot Reload" button is greyed out" - I'd read that maybe it needs to be running in debug.  (I've also moved on through the exercise with no issues, other than not being able to debug or hot reload!)

This is the sample Dockerfile given in the Eclipse Che doc.    It is stated in the document to start the language server in the entrypoint. This is where I'm confused. If I am to implement a new language server (for a new language), where do I direct the entrypoint to? Can I add my language server to github and build an image from it to be included as the entrypoint, or is there any other way to do it?

With the dev build(328) the game doesn't crash when I use Scheme 1 anymore. And the Scheme 2 works but I had to replace the id 0 interface for three exporters for each machine set to the corresponding channels. Also the interface which was used for item inputs(Scheme 2. middle column) to the network one(storage system) from other networks(in this case network 2) has to be set to the same channel as the interface attached to the drawer controller, I supposed this was a fix for https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedTunnels/issues/163 . As for providing the environment where the crash happened - I was playing Enigmatica 2 Expert 1.64d modpack. I don't understand, do you need a backup of my game world?  Edit: I did more testing with the dev build and in the Scheme 2. only interface with ID 1 seem to accpet items from its corresponting item importer, others only work if interfaces and importers are set to ID 0 or 1.  Edit2: There's also this unusual output in the log, I don't know what could this be related to  > [16:18:10] [Server thread/WARN] [Cyclops Core]: Slotless source to destination movement failed due to inconsistent insertion behaviour by destination in simulation and non-simulation: org.cyclops.integrateddynamics.core.network.IngredientChannelIndexed@32742577.

Yes, it happens at every crafting station with a 3x3 crafting window. I'm playing on a server with the waystone mod and it only happens, when crafting of items from the mod (e.g. the warpstone) is disabled. Yesterday I contacted the admin for enabling it and everything worked.
In my opinion, it may be closed.

Hmm, I can confirm that last night (just after the release of Amonkhet) that it was not working, however it is possible it was fixed shortly after the release?  After work I will try and confirm again if the cards is working or not under various circumstances. Cheers

This behavior doesn't exist. Nothing is `raise`d in the Ruby code. I don't see it in Python or C# code either.  I see the Java SDK has error code handling and surfaces it to the coder. Perhaps other implementations should follow suit.
Java/JVM detail version: 1.8.0_72-internal  Regarding memory increase, I'll let you know after I've talked to the admin.
Handbrake location was not set recently. Destination was set via bound sign. Using the `save-sign` to set the destination also failed to materialise.
In Spring Data we support annotations and meta-annotations that are annotated with JSR305 annotations to discover whether a package, class or method has opted-in for non-nullability. We do not express a limit on meta-annotation nesting, so one can use either directly JSR305 annotations, Spring Framework annotations (that are annotated with JSR305) or further, composed annotations.   That's, why we are using `AnnotatedElementUtils`. `@Nonnull`'s `when` attribute expresses non-nullability or allows opting out to express that a particular argument or return value may be null.

False alarm, indeed problem was on our side (API was setting DB encoding to `utf8` instead of `utf8mb4`, just deployed a fix, should be good now.
No, I didn't feel the need to pack the textures since they don't do anything to illustrate the problem.   As it turns out, this was another of my own mistakes, haha. I was able to solve the issue by advancing the near clip of the camera from 0.1. For some reason, I didn't really try this solution even though I'm pretty sure I knew it already.   I thought I recalled seeing this problem in another test of mine that moving the near clip didn't solve, but I might be mistaken. Anyway, closed for now!  EDIT: The outcome seems to be that this could be an OS-specific or graphics card-specific problem with LibGDX over BDX, which means that there might not be much that we can do about it. 
This I am not sure. By definition, a reliability function should be 1 at time 0 and 0 at infinity. So both degenerated function either violate the condition at 1 or at infinity. Consider for example the evaluator for the first moment and a constant 1 function (not to mix with constant failure rate). The area below the curve is then infinity. I think we should check what happens to our framework. One may be able to tolerate degenerated functions, giving the user respective strange results. I am just unsure whether all our approximations etc. terminate. Should we go ahead and enable degenerated functions? Then we should possibly create a branch and check all functions. Follow-up question would then be: Should we create a marker for ReliabilityFunctions that decay to a degenerated function? Something like "isDegenerated?"? This could ease the consideration also for tests. Several functions can be easily configured to become degenerated (Linear term with empty lhs).

It is indeed different than I first thought. I have just seen that on repeated refresh of the same list of caches still some pictures are loaded, which made me think they are loaded multiple times.  I retested it today and from what I can see, the first refresh loads quite a lot of images and on the sedond refresh also images are loaded (but these have not been contained in the first refresh as far as I checked). Why is that?  Both refreshes have been done a few minutes apart. Here are the logs:  First refresh: https://www.dropbox.com/s/joo7hp9byiy2nnw/firstrefresh_89caches_issues4578.txt?dl=0  Seond refresh: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmugewj5ynwn39j/secondrefresh_89caches_issues4578.txt?dl=0  Please kindly have a look.

Yes, i will craft patch with unit tests. 
Thanks for your quick response. Just a bit more information before I attempt to redo the trace to try to capture what you need.  I have performed the test with two other mail clients, Thunderbird (45.3.0) and standard Mail client on iOS and both detect an invalid password and prompt the user to update the password.  At my organisation we manage approximately 110 smartphones of which 95 are Android with K-9 deployed. From my experience I haven't seen K-9 prompt the user for a new password after their password is changed, but I'd love to be proven wrong!  During the trace I collected I was monitoring the server side logs and multiple authentication errors occurred for the test account with reason invalid password, which leads to the other half of this problem where by K-9 will keep trying to login after password failure. Our mail server (Zimbra 8.7) is configured to lockout accounts that have a number of a authentication failures within a period of time. So in our case K-9 is causing accounts to be locked out within moments of the user changing their password.  To make matters worse, even if the user has the initiative to go into K-9 account settings and manually update their password, at this point their account is inevitably locked out, which means when K-9 goes to verify the password they've input it reports the password as incorrect to the user.  Another thing I noticed when I was testing this issue was in between the user updating their password in the email system and them manually clicking the refresh button on the folder view in K-9, K-9 would eventually display a light grey "IOException: readStringUntil(): end of stream reached" under the Inbox, and put an entry in the K9mail-errors (attached).

Yes I do have some saves. I looked back through my save archive and I managed to locate one before and after the problem. Again, this is using MekHQ 42.  [astec bug saves and custom units.zip](https://github.com/MegaMek/mekhq/files/818493/astec.bug.saves.and.custom.units.zip)  - I included my entire custom unit folder for this specific campaign, it probably won't load without it. - C82 is the save made on June 3, there is an impending Extraction mission where I have to rescue 4 civilian vehicles. - C83 is a save made on June 4 the day after the extraction was complete and I had received several dependants as my bonus reward. This one shows Astech work minutes as zero.  I did some basic testing on my own and here is what I found:  - I took save C82 and reran the extraction mission again, I didn't actually play out the mission in full, I simply deployed all units and then used /victory to end the game. This generated the "astech test campaign" MUL file. I then reloaded save C82 several times and used this MUL file to resolve the mission instantly until it rewarded me with dependants again, 6 to be specific. I then saved the game, this is save C82a. - If I load up C82a and hit the button to advance the day, the Astech minutes pool instantly drops to zero, just like save C83. In order to fix the problem I have to fire all temporary Astechs and then rehire them. - I thought it might have to do with work jobs that were in progress when the day ended, so I used the GM tools to finish all of the work in the repair bay and warehouse. This had no effect, astech minutes still became zero. I tried again and simply deleted all mechs and parts that were being worked on, same result. - I tried using the GM tools to delete all of my dependants and then advanced the day. This had no effect, the astech minutes still became zero. However in this case all I had to do was bring all astech teams to full, I did not have to fire all of the temporary astechs first.
I don't have a database backup, also i'm using MySQL :/ 
@benjaminp, thanks for the suggestion. That works, although I need `--nostart_end_lib` too. I've added this line to tools/bazel.rc and it seems to work:  `build --linkopt=-fuse-ld=bfd --nostart_end_lib`  If I use a machine with gold 1.14 it seems to work (testing with gcc, not with Bazel).  Do you think it's possible for Bazel to detect this case (old gold, fully static, exceptions), and use bfd instead? Seems unlikely...
Can do. I'll clone and put a pull request in.
Hm, weird, I just tried again and the issue is still the same, and the version (Settings --> About) is definitely 1.0.8. 
Okay, I suppose I should have mentioned a few things: - I cannot reproduce the bug in a modpack with ender IO alone. - The bug happens in my world which also has 250+ other mods - The power line gets its power from a P2P Tunnel - It's not only on server restart but also when placing lights, I have to place the light first then the power conduit or it won't work - I haven't tried applying a redstone signal to it to see what happens. - I haven't tried with the latest that just got out.

No problems will do, just rebuilding the machine now but I'll run the same query and give you the log.  In regards to the disk, the server is a VM so it 'sees' an SSD with 200GB. Memory is 32GB with the heap and page-cache settings being left at defaults.  The query itself is:  MATCH (p:Post)<-[:attached]-(m:Meeting) RETURN p, m  Disk scheduler being used was deadline (saw a recommendation for a similar issue to use this scheduler). I'll post through the debug.log as soon as the machine is up and running.  Thanks!

no, it's not been reported on `minishift`. indeed that let us believe this is caused by resource limits that are set on `fuse-ignite` but not locally on our dev environment.  investigating in that direction right now

That's it because the random forest implementation swallows it.  The interesting thing is that the forest still appears to work correctly after that.

After an update to the branch, I am no longer able to reproduce the issue. Hence, closing it.
no 
So this is what I got with the `curl -v`    So what is happening is that feign is not injecting the the variable (in this case `phil`) into the `@RequestLine("GET /_search?q=body:{body}")` seemingly because of the colon?  it turns into `%3A%7B`   which I am assuming is `:{`   then %7D  or  `}`  Any idea? 
Tried again after deploying the latest master and I have the same message. It could be the environment is broken, so we will investigate further.

It's hard to give a minimal working example with a Zotero library, but here's my setup on which you see it: 1. Location of files -> Custom Location, pick some folder. 2. Renaming rules -> `%a%y - %t`; do not lowercase; do not replace blanks; do truncate after punctuation; max length of title is 50; max number of authors is 1; do not add suffix for omitted authors 3. Add any old thing, let ZotFile rename it appropriately. 4. Re-select the file, do Rename attachments manually, via right-click.  If that's not enough to do it, the bug may be more subtle than that; let me know and I can try to tweak around to reproduce more precisely.

I mean when you change both the dimension of the environment and the dimension of the circle from #m to #cm, nothing is displayed. (to display a 1cm circle in a surface of 2500cm² for instance) 
@cosminstefanxp  I did in step 2 - set the request as Form-based Authentication(include setting user/pass and forced user)  ZAP knew when should send the login request, but it sent with the wrong method (GET)

@oprisnik I use both rounding corners and circle rounding. Thank you for BitmapTransformation hint, I'll try it
Yes, that command completes succesfully.
Thank you for your response  offline and After a while  up Only Admin Server has such a problem

Okay, I made a fork and cleaned up the workaround for a pull request. (First time actually using GitHub or Git for that matter, so I hope everything went okay)  It is of course just a workaround, since it (in order to not get slowed down during import) requires that users have the project property set before even starting the import. Which may be a bit much to ask if they don't use Gradle to generate those setting files automatically. Nonetheless there is also a text box to enter the string in the project properties page, so it can be changed via UI if people don't want to mess with the bare files.  If you want to come up with a cleaner solution, feel free.
spigot 1.8.8 
@electrum I did fix this locally but don't send a PR because at that time I found the latest revision's web UI is changed heavily from 0.148 to 0.149  and I am not sure if someone is planning to revamp this completely.  @chrisunder Thanks. 
ghc-mod version 5.4.0.0 compiled by GHC 7.6.3  Perhaps the culprit is changing my GHC version? Not sure why that would be, just a stab in the dark. Edit: Nope. 
Thank you for replying  yes we are always playing HlsMediaSource 
Hey Thanks. I used onDestroy() in initState() working fine.
Thank you for quick response. I will try your workaround suggestions.
Thanks for the quick reply!  No toast message. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10e.  The ADB log shows the following:   I've tried to clear Aegis app data and set up my vault again: * Through the "Password" option via the first setup assistant, then trying to check "Biometric unlock" in the settings ⇒ I have the same behavior and error in the ADB log. * Through the "Biometric" option via the first setup assistant ⇒ I cannot go to the next screen, and I have the same error in the ADB log.
Because this has been a recent change in this release, what we are going to do in this version is allow users write --password without raising an exception. However, if that's the case we will print a warning message saying that they should not do it and that it will be forbidden in future releases.  Regarding adding --password automatically to the other command lines, that will be probably added in a future release.
I am, in fact, also using a Motorolla moto G (XT1032). 
Just once it has happened. Bitmap tile source

I attacked and dealt combat damage with (I _believe_) two **_Siren Stormtamers_** and a **_Storm Fleet Aerialist_**. Though one of those creatures might have been a **_Kitesail Freebooter_**.   Sorry for being vague - this is my first bug report. 
Bug still exists.. :D  https://i.vgy.me/bs9Oxi.png after restart it will tp you but on the wrong PS
Hi @Geosearchef ,  Thanks for the quick response. I'm certain the client is aware where it can find the Forged Alliance installation, considering it has worked before and according to the settings, the path is correct. (I set it again just to make sure but the error still occurs)  I uploaded the full version of the latest log, including at least one occurence of this error. You can find it [here](http://f.cybrox.eu/t/faf.log).  **Yep!**: I downgraded to `0.7.7.2-alpha` and can connect just fine. So it seems to be an issue with `0.8.0-beta`
It was my firewall, ignore me i am a noob. :)
What's the purpose of alpha? Moving the alpha slider in the RGB preview changes the luminosity, but if it actually does nothing, shouldn't it be removed?
It says v.0.1.4 here. I don't know how to get the full build number. 
Not sure. How do I get that?  Also I can't seem to find how to save the game on the PC. 
Unfortunately I don't have much time right now. But I think the case is very simple to reproduce.
@doanduyhai , all I did was create table xyz with secondary index xid in cassandra Then due to bug mentioned in ticket, I had to use raw query.  I needed pagination like dsl() with raw() api. So set fetchSize to 10 But page._1() has list of size 200 which is total number of records. I was expecting it to return 10 in list item.  **Is there any other way we should set paging state and fetchSize when using raw() api  than below ?**  Here XYZ matches columns from xyz table and is POJO 
My backend (maybe frontend too) might have been with mode http. 
Thanks @kurtharriger, I tried to add that bean to my app but after that I couldn't see any tracing at all on the logs, not sure if that is something that needs to be set inside Sleuth itself?

Yes you are right. Alright i will close this issue.

im using it for ban manager   
I'm just saying I found it not user-friendly to have to use the annotation. It doesn't add any value to my code and prevented me from using the Workset Iteration :)  
I just acessed it with my normal browser, again using tor. I didn't get any error and I could download the file without any problems. I have no idea why this is.  
Yeah it does
@lvca - good point. I've upgraded my environment to use the 2.1.4 release of orientdb. I am getting the same stack trace when attempting to commit a transaction.  
I have plugin on both servers - spigot and bungee I have turn on bungee on spigot config I have set MySQL database  When new player enters game he gets his skin. When I use /skin command on spigot server connected to this same database and I have set new skin, this new skin is set on bungecord server too. So there is some connection between server/plugin and database. It dont work when I use /skin command on BC server.

I activated the trace listener but I can't find how to use it, even by looking at the code... 
I use with maven, Lombok 1.16.18 The project is generate with Hipster and modified with the client specification. The maven build failed if i have a @mapping annotation and a DTO with an lombock annotation. The build work when i not used lombok annotation on this same DTO or if the mapper don't have an @Mapping(source, target) annotation.
Hello @germanattanasio ! Sorry for the delayed response, I have updated the SolrJ and SolrJ-core both to version 6.5.1 and java-jdk is already at 3.8.0 but I still get the error code 500 while trying to get the collections from the clusters or any other call to our Retrieve & Rank service ...  listClusters() worked for almost a year, we haven't changed anything on the code, right now it is returning code 500 but it has worked for almost a year ... I will be glad to help in anything I can, just let me know what you need. Thanks in advance!

It looks like the problem is classpath containing ";" not quoted.  I can reproduce it with following step:  * Create 2 maven projects as A and B * Add project B as project A's dependency * Add both projects into the same workspace * Debug on project A  Debugger may produce something likes this   Sometimes debugger may decide bundle them all into single jar, in this case everything goes fine.

I've build jar with `nobody`. Here it is https://bintray.com/artifact/download/thestigger/generic/elasticsearch-mesos-scheduler-1.0.0-withDependencies.jar Or you can build by your own. 
The Screenshot is from Dynmap, full-world-render right after the regeneration.  But that explains why the world has only terrain generated.  Don't forget the Command bug here.  I do the "pregeneration" of the world to reduce the server-load when players are online and moving around to find other biomes or so. If I only generate the terrain, there is still lost of work for my CPU when the decoration is generated, so this will not really do, what i want - totally remove world-generation-lag.  Maybe a config paramter can do the trick here? So I can switch to full generation (terrain + decoration) for every filler run, to toally remove that i need additional CPU-load for that. Because with every change in a chunk dynmap is refreshing the map too, causing additional load. 
Oh, indeed, double-checked and googled - found this answer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14318921/toast-is-not-shown-on-samsung-galaxy-s3-latest-update-4-1-2 And for some reason in Settings I had "Blocked" for c:geo notifications. When I changed it toasts appeared again, so now it looks fine.  Then I would suggest to reformulate this issue to kind of feature request "Inform user that there will be no toasts if notifications are blocked". Probably you could check this value from the app and notify user somehow (on the main screen or additional dialog maybe). Because it was not obvious that I need to go to Notification settings for that...

I made the slave account and admin and that helped after a reboot, so it seems to be a permission issue. I will check if giving the necessary permission without making the user an admin is possible and comment the results here. Also the functions succeed when run as a normal user locally.  Shame that the library cannot tell about missing permissions with a checked exception. This also happens with some Linux methods where calling getSerialNumber methods return empty string when not run with sudo. I don't know if it would be even possible to detect the missing permissions in these cases.
I don't know if a specific resolution thing would be beneficial as it would probably be quite complicated to take into account in the code. At the minute I just have it where if the maximum radius of the isochrone is smaller than a specific value, then the buffer size is decreased. So if the maximum radius is less than 2000m, then the buffer is 0.00018, and anything more it is 0.0018. I am not sure where that initial 0.0018 came from as it is hard coded
@wb9688 If I adjust any of track bars separately the end result will be stuttering of audio. I use audio-only playback, I forgot to tell that. I just checked and the same thing happen if I watch a whole video. Maybe it's because I use fairly low-end android phone. Is this speed up computation heavy?
react-native start --reset-cache worked  Sorry for the bad English. I'm Brazilian and I'm using Google Translate.  Thanks!
My map is a full resolution map using the same procedure as the mapsforge-mapcreator. The difference is just that I build the pieces of the map in small chunks and then stitch them together using a C++ program that I wrote to build the world map. The C++ program does not modify any of the coordinates. It only copies the binary data. 
Randomly or when there are a lot of vampires on the server.
I was using wasync 1.0.0.beta which did not contain test cases master branch contains test cases however it seems the test cases make use of embedded nettosphere which is not my case I am using Atmosphere runtime 1.0.7 on J2EE container JBoss AS 7.1.1  check org.atmosphere.cprAsynchronousProcessor.supportWebSocket() I am quite confident this is the root of the problem, I checked in detail with a debugger  it seems nobody has so far used Atmosphere 1.0.7 runtime with websockets :-) 
no result with the sql  SELECT \* from artwork_located where artwork_id=535 
I don't think I have that. Didn't know there were logs. It will be removed when you uninstall the app I think? 
> The IP and port of the client and server logs don't match. Can you double check if the logs are the right ones?  Sorry I didn't mention it earlier. The client calls the envoy proxy running at port 8082 and the proxy routes to its local server 8086. But the problem persists even if I call the server directly without the proxy layer. 
My humble apologies for taking so long to come back to you, especially as you responded so promptly.  We’ve been trying various tests within our Jenkins build set up to try and isolate the problem.  We are definitely going ahead with an order for the Enterprise version (it should come through as Deutsche Post / DHL) but we can not get the Oracle Apex applications to load without the “&” placeholder error.  We have set sqlplus enabled, but it looks like the set define off is still being ignored.  We use placeholders elsewhere, so we can not globally turn placeholders off.   It looks like Flyway is still setting define on – see highlighted line below:-   public String replacePlaceholders(String input) /*     */   { /* 130 */     String result = this.placeholderReplacer.replacePlaceholders(input); /* 131 */     if ((this.oracleSqlplus) && (this.defineOn)) { /* 132 */       boolean replaced = false; /*     */ /* 134 */       Map<String, String> placeholders = getPlaceholderReplacements(); /* 135 */       Set<String> unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions = new TreeSet(); /*     */       for (;;) { /* 137 */         Matcher matcher = this.anyPlaceholderPattern.matcher(result); /* 138 */         if (!matcher.find()) break; /* 139 */         String searchTerm = matcher.group(3).toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH); /* 140 */         if (!placeholders.containsKey(searchTerm)) { /* 141 */           unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions.add(matcher.group(1)); /* 142 */           result = StringUtils.replace(result, matcher.group(1), ""); /*     */         } else { /* 144 */           result = StringUtils.replace(result, matcher.group(2), (String)placeholders.get(searchTerm)); /* 145 */           replaced = true; /*     */         } /*     */       } /*     */ /*     */ /*     */ /*     */ /* 152 */       if (!unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions.isEmpty()) /*     */       { /* 154 */         throw new FlywayException("No value provided for placeholder expressions: " + StringUtils.collectionToCommaDelimitedString(unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions) + ".

Any ideas?
When I added a deadline or timeout to the request, it terminated after the expected duration with a timeout, however, no request was ever initiated over the wire.  I looked over the places where the `catch (Throwable t) { //log }` pattern is used with executors. In every case I saw, it looked like the log was a last ditch effort to alert the user that something that should _never_ happen had happened. Since these cases represent legitimately irrecoverable errors, perhaps _catastrophic failure_ is appropriate? gRPC can't fix the problem, and likely the user's code can't either without recompilation.
@ryanjbaxter As a test I set the basedir to "/var/tmp/spring-cloud/repos/" without creating the repos directory. After querying the server these are the folders under /var/tmp/spring-cloud.    I would expect config-repo-8260599878887614334 to be below repos.

yes, this happens on one device and on the other device first it would not even open the camera, i fixed that (#96 ), but  it still crashes in the newContentActivity
Is that it is just a suggestion not required at all for compiling. At least for the intelliJ plugin, that could be used for other IDEs including the --display.  The meta is to enable completions without adding explicitly an "using" clause. Without the metadata, it would be slow and displaying zillions of static public methods that probably are not meant to be used as extensions. With the metadata, it should be faster limiting the classes you are searching and would avoid suggesting lots of garbage. 
Take one of our caches; GC3HJ8Q. Here the displayed cache owner name is displayed as "Cecilie & John Magnus". This is not my real username, witch instead is "john.magnus".   When selecting "Caches hidden", c:geo (at least visually) tries to load caches from a with the displayed name and thus fails to load any more caches.
There is a proxy server and it is configured in Jenkins. Jenkins has internet access. I added: true to the artifactoryUseProxy parameter and it all worked. What is artifactoryUseProxy: true? Thank!

It was just a coincidence the problem first manifested after updating the devfile. I investigated more and the issue emerges in multiuser config with Keycloak configured to use LDAP federation.  **Steps to reproduce:** - deploy Che 7.3.0 on minikube in multiuser mode - configure Keycloak to provide user accounts from LDAP server using User Federation - login to Che using credentials of LDAP user - create and start workspace - you'll see Kubernetes pod `che-plugin-broker` in status `Init:Error`  If I do not configure Keycloak and use default user admin/admin, everything works just fine. The `che-plugin-broker` pod is started with parameter `-runtime-id workspacem96e6c2hiwgmir8r:default:116f6b67-066e-4221-8a80-7d75734d643c` which is ok. But after configuring Keycloak and using LDAP user credentials, `che-plugin-broker` pod is started with parameter `-runtime-id workspacete1prvrydnhsnvc2:default:f:65d2c280-a3c8-4b89-b00b-ca99b82e488b:fk633080` which cannot be parsed, since the userid part contains the separator (':').  
@TylerJewell Thanks for looking into it. Yes cli-latest.sh file is at your mentioned location.  
Normally I don't have any problems with using IEx.pry though not all parts are as easy to debug because of the supervisors. But even if I disable the entire supervisor tree in the start function it gives those errors. It looks like when it's trying to :int.ni all the modules in the project.  And that is probably also causing another problem when I increase the ETS tables limit and succeed starting it. Because everything is bound in the debugger including the libraries it slows down the project so much I get problems with our supervisors timing out. Though with increasing the timeouts I can get the project to work with the debugger though startup takes about 50 seconds on the first request.   When I manually use the :int.ni I don't have that problem but it's probably because everything is being debugged now.
Hey,  The latest version of SyncThing has fixed this issue for me. It's got an uptime of 19 hours now, which is way more than it ever got before.  Just thought you should know, though, that the update completely wiped my Syncthing configuration. I'll be making backups from now on! :) 
config/catalog is very much like SpyCarBasic and has been verified with the load tool and getBasePlans() call. Calls made were createTenant, createAccount, createSubscription, getAccount.  What is supposedly 'wrong': Maybe nothing, I was under the impression that the balance is supposed to reflect the customer's outstanding liability.Is that incorrect?   After looking into this a bit more, I think your client.getAccount("externalKey") has a bug. Maybe you are using a == instead of .equals("") ? 
OOPS, I want this on. Sorry, there is a mysterious bug I am hunting day and night, the removal was one way to battle it.  Something regarding #226.  So please enable it.

Many of the calls to `increaseStoredEnergyUnits` that I can see will all check the EU capacity, and only increase by the amount it can hold. The other ones are for things like the Magic Energy Absorber, which is probably fine because it eats an enchantment or something and produces a ton of energy all at once.
OK @vetss, I will try again and provide logs.

Hi Serge, looked at the log and its not an error, there are no error messages. It seems to be a feature, and I may be misunderstanding projects. Here are two fresh screen shots.   ![1 Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27032470/61999973-2a5f6a00-b110-11e9-844c-0c5b6bd54171.PNG) ![2 Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27032470/61999974-30554b00-b110-11e9-8d48-c7c5a31fa248.PNG) Note Metapplica is active. If I copy/paster the MariaDB connection from General to Metapplica by right-clicking and copying from General then right-clicking and pasting to Metapplica, intead of the connection appearing in Metapplica, it replicates in General.   Intuitively I expect the connection to show up in Metapplica, I want to use this connection in several projects.
Here it is:   
Ok my bad, but the 2 issues are unrelated. Yes test mail is not getting sent and it is an issue and so is this error showing up in logs but the action of sending test mail does not result in these errors showing up in the logs. Sorry for the confusion. 
Are the `response` and `connect` timeouts undocumented API; the documentation only mentions `timeoutInSeconds`?  A timeout of more than 24 seconds does not work.  There is a hardcoded 24 second read timeout on the HTTP request calling the device method.  Instead of a "gateway timeout" after 30 seconds, there is a `SocketTimeoutException` with `Read timed out` after 24 seconds.
Works fine on 14.3.0(1029-b0908619ed6f9d)

This could be a way to bring it to the people with google:play store. Sadly there is that issue at the moment with the closed-source library's.  Another method could a kind of serial-code or a paypal-transaction id as serial-code. So another way to "buy it". I think google get a lot of the money you should get for the payment, or?
I think it happened when the webjars is modified without reloading the project info (so no change of version, just the content changes). Nothing that really affects anybody, but if we can avoid it would be the best. 
Nexus 4.  Yeah, it only happened once, so that might have been it. 
Oh, sorry, I forgot. Please forgive me. These are the things that will show up in the console, but not in the log.  
The entity is the player model. Sorry that wasn't clear. Looking at the code for #6698, it's checking specifically for NPC Ids of pets, which the player is not.

@sijie In practice most users prefer to start bookie in the background especially in production environments, so it would be better to support this. However, as discussed with @jiazhai , the original intention of `bin/pulsar` is to use `pulsar_env.sh`, therefore I'm not sure it's appropriate to pass the `BOOKIE_EXTRA_OPTS` in `bin/pulsar`. If this way can be accepted I can make a PR trying to address this.
Yes, this fixed it. Thank you!
@joerghoh     Can you successfully perform a dry-run of maven release prepare/perform? My setup hasn't changed and this worked fine from the last release I did.
Tried with on RPi, Mac, Linux, Android so the problem seems to affect each. I looked a little closer at the issue last night and realized the socket read is what is taking all of the time. My previous code was using a slightly optimized nanohttpd 1.25 and the way reading the headers are read has changed completely.

Hi Phil - thanks for the reply. It's the end of our day so I can debug tomorrow, but in the mean time I can confirm that I have not set the `spring.messages.basename` property explicitly in my app. 
Difficult to nail the reproducer. It's mainly a contract issue where the flush does not ensure that it establishes a checkpoint where it needs to ensure that the data that have been received by AsyncFile so far must be written to the disk (as it stays in the buffer). 
I'm so sorry. I've been out of town. I will try this tomorrow on a fresh project to ensure there was nothing else happening in mine.. 
I'm not sure about the exact version number, the file used can be found in following link: https://github.com/wf9a5m75/phonegap-http-request/tree/master/libs/android

Well I can't seem to even replicate my issue in the DW20 pack anymore. After a few server restarts the labels are working fine. I'll be messing around a lot with the mod still, see if I can figure out what I did..
I have 5 items placed. Now I've tried on a different phone, and it's working fine. This working device is running Android 6.0 (Sony Z3Compact), the other one Android 5.1 (Huawei G8). I've noticed that it happens with 4 items or more and it also occur with your bottombar application sample:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17174870/21991324/68d94286-dc12-11e6-9326-2df5f8d31087.png)    
I've seen it in 7.2.1 and 7.3 - Thanks 
now doesn't provoke an exception, but i can't get the response from the device when the index of array is greater than 127
No, as stated, delete data only. Version is the master. 
I haven't reported it to cofh yet but plan to. I wanted to get some more screen shots and see if I can do a screen capture video of it. What I am seeing is two behaviors one, a redstone block is broken by the quarry and red liquid comes out and spreads and stays and continues to spread until the source block is filled or picked up with a bucket. the other is I break a redstone ore block with a pick, red liquid comes out and quickly drains away leaving the ore pieces. it's no big deal and to be honest the only reason I have the mod is because it was one of the recommended mods to be able to use the BC tank mod.  
public class Main { 	public static void main( String[] args ){ 		new Server() 				.start(HelloResource.class, HelloResource.class) 				.subscribe(v -> { 							System.err.println("Server started"); 						}, 						x -> { 							x.printStackTrace(); 						}); 	} }
I find the reason now. It's quite weird. My hive version is hive-0.13.1-cdh5.3.0 Follow the steps can generate the wrong result. (1) Create an ORC table in presto.       create table employees_orc as select \* from employees; (2) Insert overwrite this ORC table in Hive       insert overwrite table employees_orc select \* from employees; (3) Query in presto       select \* from employees_orc where hire_date = date '2000-01-28';  If I omit step (2), then the result is correct. It seems to be caused by hive orc write.  The value that are getting set into the tuple domains is 10984. Marker{type=class java.lang.Long, value=10984, bound=EXACTLY} 
Can you try it? I've also extracted the archive manually and that's way faster.
Yes, I'm currently working around this limitation by piping the output to a file.  I'm consuming the output in a CI/CD deployment pipeline where one step generates the output and another consumes it.  Thus, I need to persist it to a file instead of piping straight through to the next command.
I removed HWYLA yesterday and that's why I'm reporting this here: the errors stopped. The players aren't disconnected anymore, and before, they were disconnected after 6~10 hours of server uptime. After this time, ALL players started being disconnected. I think it's an issue with HWYLA and 1.10 servers, and you haven't received issues related because right now there are only a few servers running complete packs (that includes hwyla)...
It's version 1.6.2 and as I mentioned: No google play services installed on the phone
Using OkHttp seems to fix the issue. Thanks for pointing that our @TWiStErRob.  
Doesn't happen on Ubuntu 18.04 either. Looks to be a Windows specific issue.
Thanks to you. Indeed that line helped, although I had to find out first, that the order of these lines seem to be important. Got still a lot to learn about gradle...

The login with Thunderbird and the AquaMail android app works flawlessly. For thunderbird the setting is SSL/TLS+Normal password, for AquaMail it's SSL+Prefer compatibility.  I tried the Maildroid android app without success, too.  I'm using the latest K-9-app that is available on the google app store. The server only supports SSL so I've always set security in K9 to SSL/TLS and authentication to "Normal password" since that is the setting that also works in Thunderbird. "Encrytped password" does not work either - but that did not surprise since it also does not work in thunderbird.

Hi @Hohol, I can't assign issues outside of the Elastic organisation, but you're welcome to work on this.

I didn't know that. Thank you for clarification. But my following lines of code still work fine, so it's look like the rightclick events are correctly detected. Only the event cancelling doesn't work ... however it was working fine with the dev20b, just before I update to the dev22f.   In this example, the player always receives the message and the five dirts. However the cancelling doesn't fail occasionally but on each try ... 
I see. I actually downloaded a source copy, and I was able just now to test the fix you suggested. Looks like this is the only place to fix. Why are you saying it requires refactoring? Sorry, I am new to the GitHub development rules. What is a pull-request? I guess, I was not going to submit it, as I did not know what that is -:) 
See the log here: http://bbqsauce.terron.com/bbqsauce.gz (Gzip format)  Interestingly enough, the error has also popped up for the different variations of "fuel" as well. 
Thanks @eivantsov for testing this. I've researched this a bit more and discovered that what I am experiencing was reported in issue #3324. The workspace structure is created properly, as you demonstrated, but the workspace container creates projects and files in /data, not in /my/data/che-data.  I believe this has been fixed in PR #3318 which has other changes. I'm trying to find a recent build that I can use to test this. The nightly build is failing because che-server creates the directory structure as root and then launches the workspaces with user 1000, so they can't properly write into the storage area. 
It happened repeatedly, I manually updated to the latest version and have had no issues since. must have been an issue with the older version.
K9-mail, which is weird, because I remember reporting by mail in former versions and everything working fine
Yes, item rendering is correct, see the screenshot. ![2018-01-01_11 04 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11092555/34466915-9c44da24-eee3-11e7-85b8-c8ed5f8905bb.png) 
Tested with the latest version and looks fine now. 
What i think is that you use the onDeathEvent. I had issues with that in my own mod. SpmodAPI. (Weird name but deal with it). And when i switcht over to PlayerDropsEvent and set the Player.captureDrops to true while my logic ran. That seems to have it fixed on my side. Because they get then spawned properly.
@adrianmo I'm trying to deploy on PKS w/ NSX-T, and the LoadBalancer Services are not getting external IPs for some reason (I suspect it to be a separate non-related PKS issue).  
I feel like I'm testing a moving target here... Can't reproduce but it's not scaling now.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6345473/12658580/dc839a1c-c5d7-11e5-8480-73ee94861c31.png)

Actually, ignoring of sitemaps plays wery well, so stopping happens immideately. I guess the issue may be when such gigants, as G, or Y! appears in the crawling list. They have huge xml maps, and parsing them is an issue itself.  You may create a kind of recommendation for collector's users to 'reject at url filters section' very big and popular sites, if there is no actual need in crawling it. 
Yes i have compile Che OS : ubuntu 16:04 IDE : Eclipse Neon.2 Release (4.6.2)
Makes perfect sense. BTW, I am just finishing creating a wrapper for this library for Basic4Android, so users will be able to make Meteor clients using that IDE, too. 
This happened in previous versions. Can't reproduce in current Snapshot. See this example in 3.0.1 to see the effect:  https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/annis3/scriptorium#_q=aGlfcmVuZD0vLipzbWFsbC4qLyAmIGxiX24gJiAjMSBfcl8gIzI&_c=QmVzYS5sZXR0ZXJz&cl=0&cr=0&s=0&l=10  BTW we also need a mechanism to code the displayed base-text in the URL. Currently choosing a different base-text is not coded in the URL, making it difficult to send other users (or publish) exactly what the researcher is seeing. I'll close this one and make a new feature request.

This could be because of the CORS settings that you pointed out in the other thread. I will check again with the right CORS settings and post my observations. 
`/data/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/files/config.xml` and `config.xml.invalid` are 0600 and owned by root, everything else is 0600 and owned by uid 10113.  I tried reproducing this again and changing the device name without root works, but changing the device name after I enable root hits the bug. 
Sorry, haven't had a change to test it.  I switched to a Jersey implementation.  That is very well integrated in Atmosphere. 
@yuriyz  Please find the attached log file generated using ce-dev4 Gluu server   [oxd-server_with_scope_ticket_scopeExpr.log](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxd/files/1689415/oxd-server_with_scope_ticket_scopeExpr.log) 
I was using jitpack to enable direct builds from GitHub so if I needed to make changes to clarity I could do so in a fork and build it directly.  I suppose I can use the central version in current master and use clarity HEAD in source2 branch.  That said, a tagged release should probably not break :) 
I don't think a reproducer is warranted, given that it is clear by inspection of the following code (taken from `VertxImpl.InternalTimerHandler`) that `cancelTimer` is not linearized with respect to `handle`:    As written, the `compareAndSet` in `cancel` might as well be an ordinary load and store, since there is no other atomic operation on the `cancelled` flag to establish a linearization. Another way of explaining the issue is that there is a possible interleaving where `handle` sees `cancelled` is false, then `cancel` is called, the CAS succeeds in setting  `cancelled` to true and thus the function returns true, and then the handler proceeds to execute.  Sorry if this is an over-explanantion, I don't mean to insult anybody's intelligence. Let me know if I am missing something.
Sure, the output is:  > $ nsp check     (+) No known vulnerabilities found 
I'm getting differing reports, and I'm beginning to think that it may have to do with a user's system memory, basically each file gets pumped into the ArchiveTransferManager and I think it may be that java is putting the whole file into memory. Could you guys report what size file you're trying to upload and what your system ram is? I've successfully uploaded 9 gb, but I've got 24 gb on my system.  
I do not have a thread dump, but I have the exception stack trace:    buildBootstrap() method is creating the serverBootstrap as it was mention in previous comment. 
Hi - see attached debug logs. Hopefully this shows the issue. Thanks.  [output.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/files/2000245/output.txt)

Please find [attached a video](https://github.com/smarek/Simple-Dilbert/files/270z7065/dilbert.zip) (zipped as GibHub would not accept it otherwise).  See how zooming in and out crops the image.  Running Oreo 8.0 stock ROM on a Nokia 3.  Thanks for your quick response.
So, I think that `X 1 hour or less before Y` _would_ be `true` if `X` is at the exact same time as `Y` (because I said an hour or less, and 0 hours is less than 1 hour). The more that I think about this case, the more that I think it overrides the exclusive definition of the before. In fact, I think it's even broader than I initially proposed above; consider `X 1 hour before Y`. Intuitively, if `X` is exactly 1 hour before `Y`, it should return true, but based on the exclusive definition of before, it should return false.  In other words, I think the relative qualifiers should override the exclusivity of the before/after comparison operator in all cases, not just where the two boundaries meet. Thoughts?
Copy, working on it now.  Will be back in a few, using the released versions i assume.
Sounds good. I'm doing as you request. 
OS: Linux Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 Eclipse Version: Neon Release (4.6.0), Build id: 20160613-1800 LOEclipse: 2.1.1 LibreOffice 5.1, LibreOffice SDK 5.1.4.2 64 bit Java: JavaSE-1.8 64bit https://www.anony.ws/image/Jllr 
Everything starts from `HttpRequest` that contains `EofException` as it's request failure.    I was thinking that shouldn't request failures be given to `org.eclipse.jetty.client.RequestNotifier` instead? 
Got it, we may close it then. 
Still no fix, c'mon it cant be that hard! 
It keeps crashing when i open the wireless grid, And my version is 9.3.4-fix i cant find a version more then that.
Thanks for you answer. I reinstalled the plugin with version `1.3.0`, and it seems to be working on Android 8. This what I excepted from plugin before, and now it's working : `{withFingerprint: "Is0/g9fTO+TxRdZFmKltLw==↵"}` :)  Unfortunately I don't have an Android 7 to try the last plugin version  (1.3.4)
Good to know but I haven't tried yet.   
@mahikaw Sure! Just one thing to point out if the problem was in the data itself it would always give me a NullPointerException right? But I don't face the exception now. Its weird. I guess it is mostly a network related problem. Do check it out.
me:  Was the world upgraded to 1.10.2? If yes from what version? - from 1.9.2  How did you obtain the spawners? (/give, mining, prior to upgrade in inventory) - from essentialsX give commands and Sign shop  All spawners are affected? - Not all, somes

I'm sure. Both meshes have different names. (I even reduplicated them). You can check the file in the link I gave. I updated the file with the bugfix. 
asm core mods not installed at all full list of mods: http://clip2net.com/s/3noavYD other foci will test late can U give me compiled jar for test? 
I'm really sorry that I can't demo this problem again, it just happened by accident
Other liquids too. Will test with chunk loader and report back. 
Hi @slemeur , apologies, this was fixed while I was in the process of submitting the issue.  Adding a stack as per the documentation does work for me now, the issue I was experiencing was from an unrelated cause.  We can close this issue.
It was from Master, but I pulled it from 1.6.0 and even few other release branches, but I'm getting the same error. Not sure if I am doing something wrong?

The `ImmutableList` is from Google Guava. I tried running my code with the PR, but the problem still persists.  By experimenting, I found out that this code is enough to provoke the stack overflow:

Hi, It seemed to start working on quarkus 0.21.1 but I'm not sure why. It also works on 0.21.2 now that that has been released. However, it does still have the same error as mentioned above when building with 0.21.0. The gradle version is 5.5.1
Dear Marc,  I can gladly share the fasta. It's a mix of UniProt entries from various species and entries from HOMD (Human Oral Microbiome Database). I've created custom headers a la searchGUI style (e.g. ">generic|001R_FRG3G") since they were not uniform. There are some redundant amino acid sequences in the fasta, but unique accession numbers. The file is 1.3 GB in size. I can send you a "wetransfer" unless you have a better way!?  I've also been having trouble with searchGUI (which might be due to the file storage solution on the server), but I double checked and used an mgf / comet.pep.xml file that had no issues completing.  Thank you for your support!!  Best, David

It happens to normal messages.  New messages after logging in/hopping.  Also sometimes it is working normally, then just stops (no logout/hopping)
Okay, I did it, with just NEI, your mod(and core). FML latest here, I added text parts to explain what I was doing at the time. http://codepad.org/3OkKf4lJ  Thanks for your help!

  This project has 2 flavours and a library dependency, builds nicely until I changed to put the generated drawables in the build directory ..  Looking at this, I would think that the 'generateReleaseResources' and its respective targets and flavours would be a good spot to hook into.. leaves it later in the build.. Its possible the clean is being done after the dependant library thats built first. 
Hi @max-dev - thanks for looking into this. We finally realized the problem was our `@JsonIgnore` annotations! We didn't want our regular rest API including the complete referenced object, so we added that annotation. Finally we realized this was probably interfering with the reference!  Can you point me to the code you use to replace the referenced object in the JSON serialization with just the URL? I would like to apply something like that to our REST API as well.

Should be easy reproducible if you comment out the line starting with cd= in start.sh and use an absolute path for -Djetty.home. 
Probably around 4k entities of all types at that time.
This bug also occurs in v3.6.0. I can confirm it works in v3.5.5.
It is fixed. Thank you for the fast response. 
> When you "Close application", do you mean pressing back until back to home screen?  I mean pressing the "show open windows/apps" button and removing _Material Files_ window from the screen (so closing the app).  BTW, right now, I can't find _Material Files_ (which I uninstalled yesterday for precaution) in the F-Droid apps-list in my phone neither in the website version[1]. As if it has been removed?  Thanks a lot, best regards.  [1] https://search.f-droid.org/?q=material+files&lang=en
sorry, LC build 25, IC2 2.0.381 
I am using java console from java stack 
I close the issue as I am not able to reproduce it anymore. 
Actually, my phone tries and tries it again and it fails all the time.   @tobiasKaminsky I'll create an account. 
@Siedlerchr This one works. 
Hey @brettwooldridge, you're right, that's a bad practice. We realized that issue recently and tried to debug it. 1 total connection is not normal so I put a breakpoint where Hikari tries to throw the timeout error and realized that both log entries for 30 connections and 1 connection belong to Postgresql.  I actually tried a bunch of different configurations for lifetime and leak detection threshold and none of them worked. Most probably maximum lifetime value was 60000 in this example (I tried 60s because I thought that the socket connection might become unreliable after some time) so I was wrong when I said it uses the default configuration. It's likely that Hikari tries to connect the database for 60 seconds and then expires the connection. However, when I disable Hikari it works smooth and it shouldn't take 60s for Hikari to connect the database.  OK, I fixed the pool name issue now and restarted the server. I will paste the output when it throws the error again.  
Hi, thanks for the feedback. I finally found out the problem. Entries with a tag always appear at the top of the list in the 'float' mode, even if they do not fit the search. In the 'filter' mode they are not visible, which is more consistent. Thus it is not a bug but rather an annoying feature. In my view, tagged entries not fulfilling the search may appear first atop the grayed items, however not at the very top. 
Yes @slemeur  I am interested to work on this feature. @sleshchenko Please do let me know how can I contribute.
Not sure why its been implemented that way 
Yes, I agree it makes sense to support OOTB behavior.   I like your idea of a path-pattern based selection. An admin could say "these areas of the site are not access controlled (ie. don't have special permissions) and thus we do not need to authenticate the request". On the other hand you could also have a field where you specify which paths you DO need to authenticate. Sort of like exclude and include fields. Not sure if that makes it too complicated... wdyt? 
Looks good, I have verified the code in my test project.  Related, how can one change the status code? For example, I guessed that one could add `endpoints.health.DOWN=500` to the `application.properties` file if a 500 response is preferred instead of the 503 (or a 200 if one would revert to the current behavior) but that does not seem to work? 
Whoops, setting does seem to correspond correctly, but when unloading the app and restarting, the app crashes everytime.   
Trying to use @ExceptionHandler(ObjectNotFoundException.class) in the AbstractController, but for some odd reason, the dao does not throw an exception, rather it returns a proxied POJO that contains information regarding a com.sun.jdi.InvocationException.

Not yet, it was just blind attempt at fixing by reverting grizzly modules to previous version.  I'm trying to create a sample project, but it seems that it needs more ingredients than just form auth, jvmRoute and JSF page.  I hopefully get back to it on Monday, and try to look at diffs between grizzly releases.
I don't think this is a BigQuery client issue.  The BigQuery client simply tripped over the underlying issue that StringEnumValue isn't safe.
It seems to be connected to "Global settings" in "SQL formatting" in "Preferences". If I select the specific datasource formatting settings then for this datasource formatting works. When I deselect datasource specific box, switching back to "Global settings", formatting cease to work. A click on "Global settings" link doesn't do anything. I have done several upgrades on DBeaver from previous versions, and I have played with external formatters. May be in old version I have switched to external formatter in "Global settings", now it's unavailable and that's why I can't switch to "Global settings"?  So to me formatter works with the connection specific settings but it doesn't work with "Global settings" and I can't modify "Global settings".
I am using gradle version 2.2.1. This is in an android project where all referenced modules are android library modules. I am using version 1.0.0 of the android gradle plugin. 
@benas Yes, works fine now - thanks for the fix!
> yes, the problem isn't that it is showing N/A but that none of the fields are showing anything if the system doesn't report the sim card as being ready.  Thanks for analyzing our code, @jensstein! We're happy getting any improving help we can get.  > if i were to make a patch i would like to pull out the switch statement and maybe also the other checks for the return of getSimState because they don't really seem to do anything. > would that be okay?  I'm not sure wether these are needed for solving #96 (hopefully some day), but don't worry, the pull request you'll create will likely be checked by @larsgrefer before we merge it.

If that is the case, of course we'd be happy to see these things melt down. Thanks ahead! 
No, as you can see the service instance is created on the first line without any problem 
Hi casz.   Thanks for your quick support.  I figured out my problem.... Me :)   In the credential example given below  it says "Load from Environment Variable". It means what it says.  My environment variable wasn't set correctly.  After I fixed that, it worked flawlessly..... Thanks!  credentials:   system:     domainCredentials:       - credentials:           - basicSSHUserPrivateKey:               scope: GLOBAL               id: "basic-SSH"               username: "ssh-username"               passphrase: "" #Doable, but not recommended               description: "SSH Credentials for ssh-username"               privateKeySource:                 directEntry:                   **privateKey: ${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY} #Load from Environment Variable**   
I had it installed through F-Droid.  Uninstalled and installed the Google Play version and the issue is still occurs.  I sent the crash report.  I'm using it on a LG G4 running CM13.  I was using Firefox but installed Chrome and removed Open by Default but it still crashes when hitting Open in Browser, I don't even get to select a browser to open in.   
Oh there's a quirk here where `foo is after 2018-10-01T00:00:00.000` means that foo is after 2018-10-01T00:00:00.001 will be generated and that comes back as 2018-10-01.
hi @aurelhubert sorry for late response, the error appears when i use ahbottom version 1.3.1 to android version below API 23 (Marshmallow).  - No I didn't use vectors i still used drawables for the icons.  - appcompat I used are v7:24.0.0  so i rollback using ahbottom version 1.2.3 and it's works well across API level e.g from 16 to 24 
That is not the point. What is irritating is that the filter works in different ways depending on how big my browser window is. In some cases it would be nice to get al list of for example organisations and projects for a country.
>Could you give that one a try for your purposes, ideally against 5.1.9 snapshot?  @jhoeller I already [reverted the workaround on master yesterday](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/commit/fc827e1f929e3a5a77738e42f246c9c298f8a78b) and all is fine; thanks!  I am building our 5.1.x against 5.1.9 snapshots and don't see any problems there either (although we only had the problem on master, when we went to a shared handler factory across multiple components).
It works.
Clearing the data for Google Play Services (which is already latest version) causes all Google Services to flat-out stop working, and does absolutely nothing to help with this bug.  As already mentioned in my second comment above, I have already tested with just one route selected (after clearing data for PAT Realtime Tracker).  I have no idea what "logcats" are. I am more familiar with "desktop Linux" where "logcats" don't exist :-)  Have you guys considered using OpenStreetMaps instead of Google Maps/Google Play Services? Their API hasn't changes in ages and is already in use by several desktop and mobile apps (including on Android). Using an API that rarely changes might make things easier for you guys than relying on things provided by corporations that like to frequently changes stuff -- believe me, I've already been there! :-) 
The logging view only reported that the CustomURL task was not running.
Hi Igrignon,  Thanks for fixing this. I will check it out when it is available. As a workaround I am doing the following now :)    As far as Eclipse or Maven Plugin , I normally use Maven Plugin. I do use eclipse as my IDE though.   Thanks 
That is a temporary solution and considered a bad practice. The solution to this problem lies in the concept of Handling Lifecycle callbacks and is an important concept for all Android Developers to learn about. Solving this issue will help them learn about it and implement it in a project as well. I would not encourage locking the screen orientation :)
Saw the advice to try 3.0RC3. Is this working better? I was earlier at the "official" Google Play version (2.x I think) and that also had the same issue.... Uploads from my Sailfish phone and from my desktop clients have no issues. Account created for testing and info emailed to the requested address.  Tried to find something with catlog, but it told me I need to be root and these phones are not rooted.

Well, no. I will not post on public or to unknown persons full headers of real e-mails or real e-mail addresses of persons I have no permission to publish their e-mail. You should know that this no good idea. Sorry. :)  I know of my own experience it is hard for a programmer to believe. Check it out with the information I gave in the description. I tried and tested those parameters. Check it yourself: Create an e-mail-address of those length, send test-mails to yourself and you should see the result. :)  If you have other questions I try to help as far I can.  best regards, Stefan

1 Sorry, I should have been specific in that it's about the Adapter, not the View itself.  The signature of android.support.v7.RecyclerView.Adapter is    public static abstract class Adapter<VH extends ViewHolder> {    public abstract VH onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType);   public abstract void onBindViewHolder(VH holder, int position); .... some concrete methods }  The signature of carbon.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter is   public abstract static class Adapter<VH extends ViewHolder, I> extends android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter<VH> { ... the support methods  public abstract I getItem(int var1); }  2 When you have View v = new View(context); and carbon.widget.LinearLayout l = new carbon.widget.LinearLayout(context); and l.addChild(v); works very well, but l.addChild(v, new android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams(WRAP_CONTENT, WRAP_CONTENT); produces an exception during layout. Same with LayoutParams of super types of android.widget.LinearLayout. The android framework converts/wraps/copies super type LayoutParams to the fitting type filling in default values, where they are missing.

No, actually the other browsers I have work just fine (Firefox Beta and Chrome). I had no other launcher left, so I have installed Hola and there it seems to work.
The repository was private. Is there any other data I could provide to help me out with this issue? 
I think that any attempt to show it whole will cause the same crash as its simply too big. So to be save I would opt for truncating it after a certain length.  MT can handle pretty long strings, but e.g. 3000+ character makes it crash (just tried it). So 200 max? 
Yes, the timings are not matching, I don't have that time issue's logs with me currently. Might be I took IO logs at later time. I am trying reproducing this issue and once I get those issues, I'll upload.
Works now.

This problem occurs only when there are enabled such modules as "Override", "HarvestLevelTweaks" (I apologise).  //(I tried to change harvest level of some blocks using this modules, but I found much simplier way to do this). Only with "Override" module enabled (when "HarvestLevelTweaks" is disabled) I haven't this bug.  I noticed, that in config file I have only **_one_** variant of each material. that registered by TCon and TGreg (in other words, 2 _real_ materials transforms into one material in config, because ITT uses name of material instead of ID).  I can say, that ITT exactly overrides durability and mining speed of material. Other stats of materials are result of mixing TCon's stats and TGreg's stats:

Hello Paul,  thank you for your quick reply. I have tried to build the library yesterday for the first time, so I cannot say, if it was already happening before.   Best regards,  Joerg 
Embraal Bruiser has menace, I should have not been able to block him, I think that was the point. If the log gets saved I should have access to it. I will check for it later.
could we add a second criteria in the sortby order ?  
@bogas04 I don't know the reason yet. But I don't want to use a quick hack for this. 
That is for "no fill" I think?
Yes 
In this case the update of the database is too slow so the leader lease is lost and the RM loose the leader role and transition to standby. This is what the logs say and this is normal behaviour. The RM does not relinquish its role as leader, it lose it.  What the log does not say and that is the cause of the strange logs we got is that in the transitionToStanby function we force the leader election process to relinquish its id and to get a new one. This was done to give the administrator the possibility to make the leader transition to standby. I can remove it but I'll have to rewrite all the HA tests for this (they use the transitionToStandby admin call to simulate the crash of the scheduler node).  Keeping this is not a problem because once the RM as transitioned to standby it will have to go through a total recovery to become active again, so it has no impact if the new leader is the same RM that kept its id or another node because the previous leader relinquished its id. 
It does seem to be short articles that get skipped, now that you mention that.  It also seems to happen when the current article is long enough that it goes off the length of the browser window.  If I can see the article in the window, it doesn't seem to get skipped.   
DITA OT 2.5.2 but probably older versions have the same problem. I'm not sure how this usually works when running the DITA OT integrator from the command line using the "dita -install". Possibly because my DITA OT is installed in a folder which has French accents... we run our automated tests in such a folder.

I'll get back to you asap after trying FUI 4.1.0
I should have provided more background.  We had a project which was using ml-gradle-3.6 and was deploying conditionally from different directories. For example, in testing environments, we simply added a path to modulePaths to deploy our test source and data to MarkLogic. We decide to start using DHF and migrate what we could.  With DHF, ml-gradle modulePaths are ignored so conditional deployment is no longer possible.  In the end, we migrated all our code under plugins but have not found a DHF way to deploy code conditionally to MarkLogic. Most likely we will _eval_ something on the server in a post deploy hook to delete files not in use but this is not ideal. I don't know if there is anything on the DHF roadmap but something like a "dhf ignore" list would be great.

Thanks for the quick response, @svenjacobs .  As you suggested, I created a simple button group using plain HTML/Bootstrap/JavaScript to try to reproduce the issue.  In my example, I used the Glyphicons instead of Font Awesome, since I was trying to follow the basic example found at http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/ , but I don't think this would make a difference.  Here is my example HTML:    This example works as expected, and I was NOT able to reproduce the issue of the buttons shifting and jiggling as the tooltips are displayed.  Please let me know if you have any questions, and thanks again. 
Hi Axel, yes, can you try this statement , the same error :   CREATE PROCEDURE `get_stats_bonus_cumul` (isdn BIGINT, bid VARCHAR(100), dt0 DATE, dt1 DATE) DELIMITER //  BEGIN   DECLARE sql_cmd      VARCHAR(10000);   SET sql_cmd = CONCAT(   'SELECT     "',dt0,'" AS from_date,   FROM stats_bonus s1   WHERE s1.agg_date="',dt1,'"');    SET @sqlstatement = sql_cmd;   PREPARE sqlquery FROM @sqlstatement;   EXECUTE sqlquery;   DEALLOCATE PREPARE sqlquery; END  //  DELIMITER ;  I confirm you that we use Mysql.  Thanks, Marco.

I think I have enough free space, my internal SD card still has 880MB and my external still has more than 10GB. When I try to generate a bug report I get the message "Bug report could not be created". Similar to the other error messages. Is there another way to get log files?

Hi, sorry I included a link in the original question: https://gist.github.com/use-sparingly/ac1539784af7ae7569cd50135016cf2c
The query from the first screen is how it started - I did nothing except adding the two tables to the visual query builder. I did delete the join by clicking on the link between the two tables and pressing DELETE on my keyboard. To create it again, I did drag from field `political_party` to field `id`.  Tell me if it's still not reproducible for you.
I'm sorry I do not know much English :( P2P tunnels do not transmit RF energy using BC pipes and P2P tunnel does not change its type with ME on the RF when clicking any BC pipe on it

Master seems to be working fine 
I am referring to general option of the app language. There is an option to set the Ui language. This does not work right ro me. If I choose anything else than System default I get different random translations in some activities. I also found some actions not working if you set a language that there is no available translation. For example setting my mobile to Greek ui, has a result of notifications without text to my mi band 2. 
Hi @bsideup   Yes, I will try to narrow down this issue and provide a project to reproduce it.
Asus Zenfone 2 (asus z00ad) Android 5.0  I will try 1.0.6 now and report back. 
It's easy enough to recreate. What do you mean by the type of message? What info do you need?
Yes, theres no problem, its granted till my smartphone starts ;) 
I copyed sample code without changes from github readme to my project and run from my fragment. I tryed both getFragmentManager and getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager. I use latest support libs and build tools versions.

@davidfestal everything compiles and looks good. Thanks! 
I do not see any errors in the console. No. 
Hi @roytmana, thanks a lot for your feedback!   What you called "scrambled highlighting" has been solved :)  I wonder if you are seeing a regression or a problem that's always been there. Sounds weird that you say the difference is dramatic but you can't reproduce it. It might depend either on your queries or your analysis chain, would be great if you can open another issue with some examples of what doesn't work. 
Ok, seem's to work. I uncheckt JSHint and Npm and the deadly indexing stoped.  Thanks

For this project this is the only place where we use it, as this specific project is still at a very early stage. In case it is of any use, next is the code of the Glide Module we are using:   	@GlideModule 	public final class GlideManager extends AppGlideModule 	{ 		@Override 		public boolean isManifestParsingEnabled() 		{ 			return false; 		}  		@Override 		public void applyOptions(final Context context, final GlideBuilder builder) 		{ 			final int sizeMemory = 40 * 1024 * 1024; // 40 MB 			builder.setMemoryCache(new LruResourceCache(sizeMemory));  			final int sizeDisk = 75 * 1024 * 1024; // 75 MB 			builder.setDiskCache(new InternalCacheDiskCacheFactory(context, sizeDisk)); 		} 	}
Does not work on when I enable the opposite side.

Hello Stephane,  First of all, I would like to apologize for the late answer but I was a bit away from work :-)  Finally, I found where does this issue come from... And I am quite embarrassed because the problem was totally related to my fragments lifecycle and not to RS.  Indeed, on orientation change I misunderstood how Android worked and I was recreating my fragments whereas Android was already taking care of it. That's explained why everything was duplicated...  So, thanks for shedding some light on my issue and I feel deeply sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.

This happens if I just type the name of the class and then a period. Once it starts, autocomplete starts breaking for everything in the script. I'm just seeing the error in the workspace log so I'm not sure how to get a stack frame.

I told my member today that everybody should respect the chunk boundries and I will also give it a last test tomorrow. After deleting the tanks in SP (testwise) it did work. So it should be ok for the update hopefully :).   The server update is from AgriCraft-1.7.10-1.3.1  €: I added Agricraft in the first weeks of July and most people only use vanilla logs. There was also no mod removed.

Its only on the Block breaking particles, everything else works as intended. When viewing from certain angles it flashes between transparent and opaque, and rarely appears as intended.  I'm using the Mo'Bends mod, and a thought occurred that maybe its messing with the rendering of FBP, but removing the mod had no effect unfortunately.

Sure, here are the up/down logs from an attempt to sync: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gmnvu1g18gyd9rd/22-05-2014_04-27-47.tw_up.log https://www.dropbox.com/s/e5pim34s80cne5m/22-05-2014_04-27-52.tw_down.log  The down.log contains:    Which is a bit strange, since the sync works fine if I don't change any tasks. I set Mirakel up using the downloadable config (and used the same config to set up my laptop running `task` which syncs fine). 
I unfortunately only turned logs on after that happened.
@violetagg Spring cloud gateway is configured to use different static routes and uses discovery locator. It is also configured to generate custom tags, which has caused no problem as of now. I first found out about this issue in-browser, while on a page that uses spring cloud gateway to load different resources (all requests are routed to the same route). I've also been able to reproduce it by doing simultaneous requests to the same url over and over again. Unfortunately I haven't been able to reproduce the issue at home and I cannot give you the project on which this happens, but I'll be able to give you some more info tomorrow. I also forgot to mention that spring cloud gateway is running as a docker service and the JVM has been configured to use a maximum of 512m of memory.
Not exactly, one of our extension which is available on marketplace [Code4Z](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.code4z-extension-pack) contains an application called Zowe which pulls a file from mainframe and save it under temporary folder which is one level above `/projects`, this is how we test it if you would like to have a demo about this than we may have a call.
Thanks for your quick replies.  I have been using Roc for datasets of around the 100,000-200,000 observations, and it seems reasonably fast at these sizes (I did not compare it with other libraries, though).  After casting to long in the appropriate places inside rocArea and mannWhitneyU, the roc areas seem correct now. These are the only two places where I met integer overflows. 
> you want to override the default size (as computed by the underlying stream)  Wrapping the stream without setting the max initial ended up showing question marks (unknown file size) and a messed up progress bar: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12547785/73212587-8be2ae80-411c-11ea-8a56-e4157ae64588.png)    So I set the max initial to the file size (correctly shown at the right side of the `/`) but the total bytes downloaded (at the left of `/`) is off by one even though the actual file is downloaded in full and my OS shows the file size correctly.
Sorry for the incomplete issue posted yesterday, I was in a hurry.  However, I was using the code above for this operations: 1. reading an empty configuration with a default value of zero; 2. (doing some operations not with config library) 3. updating previously readed config with a value  Example: 1. read database version (0 at the first time) 2. creating database with migrations 3. saving database version (version 5)  As you can see above, the config object was built like this  The first debug line prints 0, as expected. The second debug line **prints 5**, as expected, but the **value is not updated** in the file from the version 3.2.0 while in the 3.1.0 this works right.   ---  I'll try the lib with master commit and watch the issue you linked me in a while.
Crash no longer occurs, but shift-clicking the item does not move it to the villager.

I had the same issue as @omar31, I can't get custom splash or lingering potions work in kits
Thanks @kmerz! I will check if the migration completed, and will check for reproducibility.
It was the same issue, possibly.  So, I did the following:  1. just ran `grakn server start` as a non-root user (let's call him user). This resulted in an access denied error. 2. modified access rights: `sudo chown user:user /opt/grakn/core/server/services/cassandra/cassandra.yaml `, and then tried to `grakn server start` again. This resulted in the same `code:3` error I mentioned above. 3. `sudo grakn server start` after that has lead to a different error: `An error has occurred during boot-up. Please run 'grakn server status' or check the logs located under the 'logs' directory. Process exited with code '100': '' ` The logs have this to say about that last error:  > [main] ERROR grakn.core.daemon.GraknDaemon - An error has occurred during boot-up.

@Sam1301  This happens for the production build on my phone, version 1.1.0. My phone is a Meizu MX5. This bug is reproducable on different devices for Android 5.0.x. 1. Open the app. 2. Tap the pen icon in the lower left corner. 3. Tap the message box (where it says "Tap on a message to compose reply"). 4. Enter '@', followed by some letter. 5. The app should crash.  Here is an image of the result: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7950151/20869474/33790df8-ba73-11e6-849b-6430707924c6.png) 
Tested version 1.4.2, it hangs and crashes same. Here is a log from 1.4.1 version (after it hanged and got back to normal after few minutes) [trebleshot_log.txt](https://github.com/genonbeta/TrebleShot/files/3335275/trebleshot_log.txt)

I have queried the redis slowquery log.There are only about 10 entries which have a high _querying_ time.None of which are during the 56 seconds of timespan during which we recieved these errors.No disconnects either during the said interval according to the number of established connections remaining constant for that time period.We have a thread pool defined as 100 though in the application. Can it be due to many threads invoking commands on the single redis client?Or am I barking up the wrong tree?
Yes, I think payload is missing. So, is there anyway to see the message sending from iPhone? I printed all the received variables but I still can't get the payload reference.
Oh, I think I said it wrong. I don't mean the white space in the code. I mean the 1px high white space between the lines. In the screenshot you can see 1px high white lines which starts at line 9. Have a closure look at the line numbers. There you will see the small distance between the lines best.  This behavior was not like this in version 0.7 M5.
slow enough that it will exceed the time set in NetworkConstants `     /**      * The number of seconds before a connection becomes idle.      */     public static final int IDLE_TIME = 15; ` 
Ok, so i gathered some info. The pigman that made me crash was in the nether, and the crashed happened while I was in the overworld close to my nether portal (so it was probably loaded with the vanilla portal check thinghy [ I bet it's not relevant]). So I went to the nether and next to that position there was a blight pigman, but he also was a Infernal Mob from atomicstriker's mod. About retrying to play... I might do that later, but I downgraded the version to the previous one and haven't crashed since (been playing for ~1h). Here's the culprit maybe: ![2020-02-26_16 33 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41645690/75380580-0a667380-58b6-11ea-8838-0a4de738ea26.png) 
Hi! I am traveling this week, will do my best to look into it and provide you with the logs on Wednesday. 
There was no output in the window where I ran `bin/che.sh start -i` when I attempted to goto definition (F4) or autocomplete (however, in that case I think I was using they wrong key binding.)  I did not use the java stack or use the default template. I do have jdk 1.8 on my stack machine. The Maven project type is selected for the project and Update dependencies worked the second time I ran it.  Since that workspace broke (#286). I created a new workspace. Now Update dependencies fails. Here is the output from my last attempt:   
I sent you the credential, hope you can help me with this.
@zgrose What is the exact name of the tray extension you are using? I'm not able to reproduce this.  
I was killing Wall beasts in Lumbridge swamp dungeon. I realised that defence exp tracker was showing these things, when I reached 60 attack (I was wielding Brine sabre). Then I switched my combat style style to train strength (earlier I was training attack).  I had no boosted stats what so ever.  Now I have closed the client so I can not check if it is still showing it incorrectly.  Tomorrow when I log in, I will see if it is still messed up.
@pierantoniomerlino  I am using 5.46, which is the latest one. But issue appeared since version 5.40 at least. Currently the output looks like: `[KNotification handle = 0x004e value: 2f ff ff ff c8 03 ` Due to these extra 3 chars before `Notification handle = ` substring keeps ` = 0x004e value:... ` instead of expected `0x004e value:...` and subsequent split takes `=`, not `0x004e` as handle id.
@cojalvo this is currently discussed, please join if you have an idea :) https://discuss.graphhopper.com/t/gradle-project-sync-failed-in-android-studio-3-0-1/2845/7
The problem is when you have a string that contains an underscore, i.e. "A12_T6". That is not recognised as a string. 
It would seem like this could quite probably be the change...since it has significantly changed the way the container is loaded. 
I'll work on the log and the versions I upgraded from, but wanted to give an update.    When I create a new world, things seem to work just fine, so it must have to do with the upgrade.  
Please go ahead I won't have time to fix this. Best of luck :)
It looks like it may be fixed; I can't produce the same error when using the flag with rules_swift on 0.22, so I'll close this. Thanks!

Posts, Stairs, Slabs and Walls all seem to have the issue on Multiplayer, however Posts and Walls don't make step sounds in single player, either. The platforms on the same BlockID as "Wooden Post" and "Metal Post" also suffer from lacking multiplayer step sounds, however the coloured Metal Platforms work fine on both.

I installed the Alpha release (Version: 2.12.3.568~fdbe53d) and my issue appears to be fixed.  However, I am suspicious that it was the act of installing and reinstalling the app, not the Alpha release itself, that resolved it.
Sure, same way I did since 2.1 or so: drag old exist from ``Applications`` to trash (obviously its isn't running),  relog os-user,  drag new exist into ``Applications``, click on exist in ``Applications`` after its done copying from dmg, configure mem-settings, and confirm that the old data directory should be reused.
Many thanks for the prompt reply!  I will try it with Cyberduck.  I really cannot tell how I achieved that! I started with an 1.2.x-version and upgraded multiple times.  Just found out as I am working with git from commandline and wanted to list my files and was suprised that the directory could not see any files when I was using lowercase, as it always was not be a difference on Windows.  
Just sometimes when climbing down.
Obviously, tooltips sometimes work :). But look at my new "Tooltips" paragraph of http://www3.bootsfaces.net/Showcase/forms/selectMultiMenu.jsf, just above the attributes section. Did I define the tooltip in a wrong way?

Yes, we should. In fact, we should check permission each time the service is started. This is just another check, like checking if server address is set, password is set, etc. 
Yeah u are right, fixed it
I have sent the log via message at the openHAB community.
Hi imotov  It's quite a big bit of json and I had to obscure the index and shard information as it was too long for the comment section in github. If you need it happy to talk offline via email etc. We quite a large number of indices.   
With 2.1-GA the IllegalStateException still happens, I have been unable to reproduce the NullPointerException though.  On the first attempt 100 Records get actually moved, on the second attempt another 78 (again, throwing the IllegalStateException). Further attempts only throw the exception and move nothing.  Console log follows:   
Yes, sorry. It is the apiarist database (the craftable one). I'm using, i think, the lastest versions of both forestry and binnie's mods that there are for MC 1.7.10.  I'm also using Optifine, if that means anything

It's a spread in an array. Exactly this chunk:    I know the first two spreads are redundant, but that was the code.  Apart from that, I've now checked some other previous versions (the one I had before updating was v20160517), with the following results: - v20160517 - Ok - v20160619 - Ok - v20160713 - javascript error "$jscomp.initSymbol is not a function” - v20160822 - javascript error “$jscomp.arrayFromIterable is not a function” - v20160911 - javascript error “$jscomp.arrayFromIterable is not a function”  Hope that helps. 
A weekend has passed... Have you release the new build? 
Same error.
I can try. Is there a commit you could point me to, it'd help me get the bandwidth to prioritize this.
No we do not need it. Thanks

I don't have stable version of Android-Studio, but it's Beta 6 already, so should work fine. All I did is Git-clone the repo, and open it on the IDE. All gradle settings weren't changed from their default ones.   The error occurred when updating the project to lates Gradle version.  However, after trying to import it again, without updating the gradle version, and it got a different issue:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5357526/31053027-5761ea1c-a69c-11e7-8f88-ec7b5b0f4f04.png)  Then I chose to sync project again, and now it works fine...  However, I tried the "comparison" sample, and out of all items there, when I tried "fresco" (with "network", as I did for all), it took more and more memory, till the app crashed silently. Is it intended to be this way? Almost all others just got the memory have a random number, but none really crashed.   I also noticed that sometimes when I try to build a sample I get a warning/error : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5357526/31053493-2a91d4f6-a6a7-11e7-9a19-8eb07fdfaaaf.png) Sometimes it warns something about architecture. However, when I choose to run, it runs fine...  
No more false-positives. Seems like fixed. 
Hi,   They have several hundred to several thousand members.
The command that failed like this last time was `bazel build //src/test/shell/bazel/...` . I don't think it's specific to the command, though. 
@vsiva Sure, I think this is the relevant bits of the log.  
compile 'it.neokree:MaterialNavigationDrawer:1.3' 
I grabbed alpha08: the first query runs fine. The second indeed takes a lot of time (but it does not crash as it used to), as it does a big antijoin operation followed by a double optional match.  Anyways, I don't think that's a problem: I changed that query a lot since then (see its [commit history](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_implementations/commits/master/cypher/queries-opencypher/bi-19.cypher)). It turned out I misinterpreted the LDBC spec in one place and we also changed the semantics of the query in another. The new query runs a few seconds using alpha08.  So in conclusion, I believe this issue is fixed now.
@xfeep  Sorry that I have not tried all the cases. I have downloaded the 0.4.4 version and try to reproduce it on Centos 6.  With "jvm_workers 0;", the return is correctly. With "jvm_workers 8;" (any numbers), this issue will happen. I guess the main thread is interrupted while the work threads is still working, and this cause the issue. I think we also need cover the hijacked request in this case.  Here's the conf:  [nginx.conf.txt](https://github.com/nginx-clojure/nginx-clojure/files/251490/nginx.conf.txt) 
> Does this happen when you open NewPipe or when you start playing a new video?  When you re-open NewPipe. Effectively the reproducer is something like:  1. Start playing an hour-long video on popout. 2. Switch to another app. 3. Do other actions, lock your phone, etc. 4. Go back to NewPipe, and the popout dies.  > This can be caused by an expired stream link.  Maybe NewPipe should try to re-fetch a new stream link and restart playing from the stopped time, instead of dying? I could look into implementing it myself but I'm not really a Java developer by trade.

Thank you for your answer.  I think that the solution could be adding a variable in refine.ini file that resolve between 127.0.0.1 and the subdomain, but not sure how to code it, and some attemps that I tried did not solve the problem  I'll open this issue in the rdf repo extension. If I find a solution I'll post it here to help others with this issue.  PS: FYI https://github.com/stkenny/grefine-rdf-extension/issues/9

I was testing pure hawt.io run under Tomcat (from hawtio-web.war). Go to JMX and check the attributes of Catalina:type=Server. Try to sort the table. Check http://plnkr.co/edit/j3hxIkpeuvGQSkAEW8K8 (the first value in second column is `'50'`, not `50`). 
It took some time to pin this down, but I found the 2.2 snapshot downloadable on the site to have this problem. The latest code from Github or earlier versions does not show this behavior.  
sorry about the confusion,  i have multi maven modules with Go and I would like to run mvn-golang:vet In this example,  2 modules should be sufficient      common     main  main depends on common via mvn-golang maven dependency  Normal   'build' gold works, since main module can reference 'common'  via GOPATH which is set correctly ( ends with target/__dep__/common-x.y.x)  'vet' goal fail to find  'common'  since GOPATH does not have 'common' in its path
AEnterprise,  Here's a link to the clients logs I found:   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/20nkg3y9z84vgte/AAANUVYPqL922_Q-1XaHjNhba?dl=0   I didn't see any server logs, I don't know whether or not there should be any as I'm playing in a single player environment.  The CoFH Core version I am using is 3.0.0B9-40.  Sorry if that's not the log you need; this is my first time really getting deep into the forge files. 
How can I invoke / debug the sandbox? I don't see any kind of tests on `src/main/tools/BUILD` or files. Any easy way of running it on gdb? 
Cancel button was removed - not sure if intended - if so, we can close this issue.
@shollyman thanks for the clarification but the issue is, that even for dryRuns it fails to get the schema from the querystatistics after the query has been executed once. I am doing  - dry run - execution - dry run  In that order, the expectation is that I can get the schema via  - querystatistics - queryresults - querystatistics (not working)
Yes, It works.
sure, I'll test it later today and provide an update on the results.  Thanks! -Steve
i've tried to find this file again and tried dozens of them. I did not find it.  All of these checked files all have to do with the construction of the nGen score generator and perhaps may have to do with the solved issue empty space with Dropdown Menu #383?? I may have been working with a file that was already corrupted...  I suggest, as me too i cannot replicate this issue any more, to close this issue. Next time i'll give all the info i have - sorry for this one.
Has anyone else been having this issue?  If it's just me, I think we can leave it for now, I just needed to run it to make sure evolution works, and it doesn't actively stop me from doing that.  @PRabahy Thank you for your quick response and effort.

Actually the change updated it to 25.0.1, added you in CC. Maybe they are doing something wrong on their CI about it. Since it is not breaking with NDK12, I think we can remove it from release blocker.
Hmm, I disagree it's working as intended. First of all the `app:elevation` property is there. There is also code around it, that tries to set the elevation - it doesn't work.  I've just done quick research about that and found this https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/issues/652, which is also an indication that something is wrong here.  My point here is, there is no clear documentation around `app:elevation` and `android:elevation`. I had to spend some time investigating why there is no elevation there. Wanted to highlight this to people working on the library and maybe make someone else's life easier in the future.

Currently looking through the blocks. Looks like it does not work with at least with - Both IO Ports - Grindstone - Interface - Drive - Vibration Chamber  Cannot really test the ME chest.  It looks like it is related to AE2 automation. Simple setup with an interface as buffer and a storage bus facing one of the AE2 blocks. If I use a hopper to insert any items it works just fine.  Already found out, that calling `TileEntity.markDirty()` in `onChangeInventory()` it will solve it. The question is more, how could this affect the performance. It is probably fine for things like the IO Ports or Grindstone, but chaning it for an interface might have a huge impact.

@ShawnieBoy that wiki page really needs some editing and does not have enough info.   @lodici I guess our opinions are different about readmes. I think a readme is something that helps you if you read it, not only somewhere to put release notes. I think stuff like the definition of in-game words and shortcut keys, should definitely be there.  That F1 mechanism is neat, will check it out.  @melvinzhang @lodici will test the memory parameter along with the existence of a "time to think bug".

Fantastic. I'm able to load this into my project now. Thank you very much @jamie-beardedhen  
Still the same using: compile('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-sleuth:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT') compile('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-zipkin:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT')  Are they the correct ones? And am I correct that this is a bug, meaning that the intention is to never report if the Span says "no"?  The reason why I'm asking is that I'm confused about how the filtering is meant to be used. As far as I can see, the only effect the sampler has is to set Span.exportable to false in DefaultTracer.startTrace().  This exportable flag is then only used when determining if ZipkinSpanListener.release() should trigger a reporter.report(), causing the Span http report call.  ZipkinSpanListener.serverSend() however, never checks the "exportable" field and therefore calls reporter.report(), which is probably why I'm seeing http reports.

Hi Samuel, I tried to implement such new support, but for me (I’m not an expert of filtering, re-sampling...) it is not so easy. If you want I can send you the work I’ve done so far, hoping it could be useful.  Anyway I think I found a bug on the FFmpegFrameRecorder.record() method: it seems to ignore final samples in the last frame. So I think to add a record(AVFrame) call in the stop() method if needed.  In this way all samples are written in the output file and it is no more truncated. This solved for me.  Let me now if you are interested in my work and how you prefer to manage it.  Thank you. Regards.
yeah for me it did; some pics will follow once I'm in the corresponding situation 
Yes, It's only happen on particular model.  Such as MeiZu mobile( M3S、M2、M578C); Gionee Mobile; Youxuepai/U32； Android version probability distributions:  Android 5.1,level22 (97.13%); Android5.0,level 21(2.67%); Android5.1.1,level 22(0.21%)
I assume that I don't completely understand the code, so correct me if I'm wrong, but after we read all the metadata, which happens in `readOtaFile()` before we enter the loop all fields that we have getters for are already set. Then we enter the loop reading remaining bytes and not setting any fields based on that data. Also, as I described above, I was able to update the FW of a device successfully with the while loop removed.  Here is the FW file which cause the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, but with the while loop completely removed FW update works.

Thanks @nkzawa, that'll be great. Will close this once it is released.   BTW, we are using this lib in production, so I am doing active trouble shooting and trying to clean the issue list. 30+ open issue is bit scary. And you are the one with full knowledge to do this, could you please go through them and close the ones not valid anymore? 
According to my friend, c:geo hasn't asked him about storage permissions, because "it was ok".  Also from the system information I can see `Write external storage permission: granted`, so it should be fine
I meant ~1 minute. 
I am just experiencing this. Even if the .deleteOnExit is called and the hook runs. The files are not deleted. I think they may be still accessed by the VM.

Both clusters: source and destination have 0 counts, I will check again if they are in V, but certainly the move didn't work as expected and I tried twice in freshly imported db. I will import the database again to see what is exactly happening. Then I can provide the dump that I am using so you can find why this is happening.

Well, this is interesting. I reinstalled the 2169 and I can't reproduce the freeze problem anymore 🤔 I cleared the logs & caches multiple times before the updates, so I don't have the logs unfortunately =/ I'll send you the logs if I can reproduce the freezing again, sorry =/ And thanks! 😅
I'll test it an give an feedback. Is there already a plan when the version appears? 
@anishshah101 Sorry I didn't come back to you. I will try to elaborate a little bit more although as @tarelli  said if you are starting to fix some bugs this is not one of the easiest. The problem has to do with the way we are loading the DOM and executing the jquery. If you want to execute some jquery commands on a html component you usually need to embed the jquery command in a:    We are doing something wrong because sometimes we are trying to execute a command on the Console component, i.e. [this](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto.frontend/blob/master/src/main/webapp/js/GEPPETTO.Console.js#L277) and the dom is not ready (Console is null). Therefore a js error occurs. Some components (Simulation buttons, zoom in/out, etc) are not loaded in the layout and the console can't be opened. It is a random error I guess because it depends on many things Internet speed, local js processing, elements being loaded asyncronous... This error may potentially happen in a different line also because of async execution.  If you finally try to fix this bug let me know if I can be of any help. This time I will be faster in answering you :)

It will be broken functionality for anyone upgrading their phones currently. I don't use the feature myself, but the first thing my wife noticed when I handed her a new Pixel was that it wasn't working anymore. She's non-tech, so that's the kind of person who needs to be considered.

Hi notcarl! Thanks for your reply, sorry for not being clear.  I did not intend to use any sort of idle mode, and setting `idleTimeout` on the channel builder does not appear to affect the issue I'm describing.  Indeed, from looking at the source code it seems that this is because a newly-created channel queues up outgoing requests while some initial name-resolution work occurs; the name resolution work happens on the same `scheduledExecutor` as the idle timer (which we cannot replace with a direct executor); and when the name resolution is done the queued requests are dispatched; i.e. though we try to use a direct executor, the channel still uses a non-direct executor for important work.   I don't believe the problem is related to the idle timer, it just happens to use the same executor as the idle timer (which seems to be the mistake as far as I can see).  Here is a minimal example:    The reason that `onNext` is called on a different thread is due to the details I provided in the original comment, and it's fixed by the pull request I created.  Edit: updated to use non-streaming RPC in example, since it turns out it does not matter.
Oh. I didn't even know that TravisCI caches something. I was trying to find a bug in your commit several times but couldn't figure out what is going on. Good that you looked in TravisCI! Thank you for resolving it!
I don't know how
@danieloeh I would, of course. Unfortunately 0.9.8.1 has not arrived on f-droid, yet. I don't know if you somehow can push them to build the most current version or if just their build service has some hickups... 
Sorry, for late feedback.  Yes i was able to reproduce the issue.  Will try to reproduce with sample app and provide more info.
For the record, I'm not able to reproduce all that locally (MacOS) with:    I'm going to make the suggested change and deploy on ec2 again to get more details if possible.

Can you please send me your email address so I can send you my flutter project sources.
I haven't gone to AHC yet. The reason I think this is a netty issue is because this line  works when not connected through a proxy  `WebSocket websocket = c.prepareGet(getTargetUrl()).execute(new WebSocketUpgradeHandler.Builder()`  However when I call  `AsyncHttpClientConfig cf = new AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder()             S.setProxyServer(new ProxyServer("192.168.1.130", 3128)).build();         AsyncHttpClient c = new AsyncHttpClient(cf);`  things no longer work. All the connection data appears to make it to the netty handler correctly, that is it correctly detects that I want to use a proxy and it also knows to work in ssl mode and issue a connect to the proxy server, and it knows the endpoint of the websocket. Also the proxy server works when issuing https requests.   With all that said it could be a misunderstanding on my part since I'm having a hard time finding any examples of the way to correctly set this up. I assumed .setProxyServer would be the only modification I would need to interoperate with a proxy server, but I definitely could be wrong on that point.

Yes, I'll test the 0.27 StartTime AddLiveStream workaround.  I can't test for #3 in the 0.27 version (I've only got it running on 1 host.) But I can test it on 0.28-pre. Maybe just using curl as a proof of concept would be a good idea. It should fail because the MBE won't find the file (even though it's in the Storage Group, the Storage Directory doesn't  exist on the MBE, e.g. it's not cross mounted.) 
hello @alainsahli,  i tried to include the json file with the regex the following way:  
Thank you for the quick reply!   Yes, there are TestNG dependencies on the classpath.  One we explicitly provide (6.4), the other is from powermock-modue-testng (which transitively brings in 6.2).  I cannot remove these from our POM for two reasons.  First, it breaks Eclipse.  There are a number of "type org.testNg.IHookable cannot be resolved.  It is indirectly referenced from required .class files."  (I launched with -clean for Eclipse and did a Maven refresh project configuration and clean build just for paranoia sake).  Second, it breaks the Maven command line build, which uses TestNG for both unit and integration tests.  The plugin did appear to work fine before this last upgrade. (Sorry, I do not remember my prior version, which I know is notably unhelpful).  Invoking a test via run rather than debug works fine. - Saish 
Items flowing through water works correctly,  Passive mobs are not moving at all. I tested cows and sheep.  Aggressive mobs have the same behavior. While in survival I spawned a creeper and even when I punch it it refuses to move or explode.

[Kazam_screencast_00001.mp4.zip](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/files/3131650/Kazam_screencast_00001.mp4.zip)  Hi, I attached video of the issue.
No, it only fires once. 
@leonard84 The original use case was using Grails' testing transformations aka `@TestFor(MyController)`  I found that `@Log` has the same behavior.  Putting that demo test in a grails app and using `@TestFor(..)` instead will reproduce the same results.   The weird part is that the compilation error only happens when you add an `assert` statement within a closure.   The stacktrace that I see when using `@TestFor` is very similar:   
until now, staff members have been in the island top. I just recently gave the negative permission. The `is top` is only calculated when a player performs the command.
I've made a Profile with the following settings but it did not help:  Title: test-dnd Ringer Mode: Do not disturb Ringing items in Do not Disturb mode: All  To test it, I've triggered the operation manually by long-tapping it and choosing Trigger this Profile.  This seems to do nothing at all on my device. DnD mode stays active if it already was.  I've also tried to do the reverse: To let Easer activate DnD mode rather than disable it. However, Easer won't enable (or disable) DnD mode on my device at all.  I've tried all of the Ringer Mode settings (DnD All, DnD Priority, DnD None, DnD Alarms). I'm sorry to say that none of them do anything on my device.
Interesting. This issue is reproducible on the latest commit. I stepped through the commits backwards till I could no longer reproduce the issue. It is not reproducible on [8fed5ca](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CogniCrypt/commit/8fed5ca0637f0087a9592f95bea91c2a4b3695d0) (i.e. first occurrence at [9611104](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CogniCrypt/commit/96111043bb7a87018ecf80053cf7f46a76a4f34c) ).

(repost - GitHub mangled the last somehow)  Sure, any regular expression pattern will work. The only caveat here is with this bug, and our mishandling escape sequences.

BEL Script groups these into `DEFINE ANNOTATION` expressions; XBEL uses the `annotationDefinitionGroup` element shown above. 
I don't mean to be confusing.  There's two issues: 1. As described in #146, it appears that only `<servers>... <server>... <id>registry.hub.docker.io</id>...` is supported in `settings.xml`. The credentials even appear to be applied to my own server (which I reference from my `pom.xml` as `<registry>docker.company.com</registry>`. I had expected to add a `settings.xml` entry such as `<servers>... <server>... <id>docker.company.com</id>...`, but that didn't do anything. I now have in my `settings.xml` `<servers>... <server>... <id>registry.hub.docker.io</id>...` with user name/password for my own server, for the interim. Funky! But different issue (#146). 2. As meant in this issue, the documentation just talks a lot about `registry.hub.docker.io` (emphasis on `io`), and it talks about it as if it's the default URL for the Docker registry (particularly that second quote in the original comment gave me that impression). But it seems to me now that this is not a valid URL for a Docker registry, rather `registry.hub.docker.com` is. Is it meant as a URL, in which case I'd say _that's wrong_, or is it meant as an identifier of some sort?

Yes, the file was deleted from the server. But it still exist on the client in "ghost" form, which means that the OC client doesn't show it, but it can still be seen with an android file manager.  The issue with this is that if those stray files are big they will increasingly waste storage space.

Well the larger issue is that the MMMPS Powerglove becomes my (and lots of other peoples') default device in mid-to-late-game. Once I get sufficient resources to make and start upgrading it, that becomes my wrench.. my portable crafting table... my light source... one of my melee weapons (along with something from Tinkers' Construct) .. AND my ranged damage weapon. It fills slot number 1 on my hotbar and I work with it inside my base constantly, which means that right now.. most of my floors and big chunks of my walls turn into ugly black transparent squares. If you hard-block the Powerglove from hiding conduit facades, then the wrench functionality in it is rendered useless and I've STILL got to carry around an omniwrench / whatnot.  So, to me at least, while this may not be a major functional hurdle.. it is a rather significant aesthetic hurdle. (shrug)  You could always drop an email to MachineMuse through her website, ask her if there is an easier way to code around it? She's pretty receptive to other mods cooperating with hers, so it is worth a shot.

I think the way a dependent target was defined instructed Bazel to use those files. And then Bazel complained about that but much later, without context. I might be wrong.  Anyway, I fixed this by specifying in CROSSTOOL the correct `-isystem` flag where the `opencv2/opencv.hpp` file can be found.
That's a good question, I didn't test that yet. It's used in an Android app currently. I might try to make a basic Java project to test that. 
Thanks. I've opened [SPR-12686](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-12686). 
@lovaiible Thank you. The issue is fixed.

@itolisto sorry for not replying.  I will remind @tcard to look into this.
Oops, my bad!  Here it is:  
    data = read.csv('https://academics.hamilton.edu/mathematics/ckuruwit/Data/SF_2015.csv')  Then click on the data variable in the environment window.
ODB Community Edition 2.1.15 The server does not start. Error message is "The ORIENTDB_HOME environment variable is not defined correctly".  I found that this is a resulting error of java not being part of PATH environment variable. After adding the java.exe containing folder to the PATH variable it worked. 
The sample code is below. Unfortunately I cannot send you my keystore and truststore files, but they can contain any key and certificate in order to start the application.

May be me so, Is your app creating the Camera folder or the Camera app ? I'm using the Xperia camera, there may be differences ? 
Strange, I tried that several times before and it never worked. But it's working now. Closing this one. If I meet it again, I'll reopen. 
That seems to fix it. It reported an error in the model. Thanks!

It means that when you call `BuildProducer.produce()` outside of the scope of your build step, it is (probably) throwing an exception that is silently discarded.  Though looking at the code, there might not be a check for this after all.  > > Build producers can only be executed within the duration of that step's execution. >  > If that's the case then we should definitely update the `BuildProducer`'s javadoc.

You'll need another build step if you want to produce build items later.  If you want to produce a build item earlier which represents some action that should occur later, your build item could contain a function of some sort that is executed in a later build step.
I'm using the latest version of the mod (0.7.1-hotfix1) with Minecraft 1.11.2. And what about the durability loosing?
I have searched these string too and found that in landscape mode video view doesn't fill screen fully. I mean  that some text below the video view 
The resulting project has no build error. Local run works too.
Removed all mods except AoA and made a new world. Trained Anima to 100, put the armor on and the same bug still occurred.  Even more interestingly enough, with the armor on I had a Cyclops hit me, and instead of the armor pieces cloning, the game crashed! https://pastebin.com/mcV1MZcj
Hi, @bf8086 I tried that too but no luck. Other metrics like Alluxio Remote Host and UFS read is being updated but not the Short-Circuit Read and Alluxio Local cache Hit.
Sorry for the wait.  I'm using Sybase : Sybase jTDS driver / Adaptive Server Enterprise 15.5  The workaround works but that's not ideal. 
My test case is a bit complex but I try to put a simple version. The problem may also originate from 'elemMatch' operator since it is used as well and I just realized that operator not found error is also in the console.
Yep, same issue, but the fix is only for non referenced namespaces. Referenced namespaces will always trigger the name check :   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6814629/20835492/444045b8-b89b-11e6-91ca-25c737ee7439.png)  plugin version is 1.2 
Thanks @misaochan for the details.  @albendz I've updated the description to be a little more descriptive.

just the custom user that i created, i set user as admin password as admin .   i query something , then from results i click one of the rids  to see content of record , after i click back on browse button and i lose that query history 
@aQaTL  Concerning the approach, I think a simple JOptionPane is sufficient. I'd just extend the message to something along the lines: "You are about to close this file but have unsaved changes. Would you like to save the changes first?".  Concerning code, we should definitely not create some static methods in SaveFile nor in any classes that are registered via NetBeans Platform.  Moreover, there's no need to pass editor top component to SaveFile class, since it already retrieves one on its own (see TopComponentFactory that returns the singleton components). If there's some common logic that must be shared, I'd extract it to some separate util class.  Also, the code that will handle confirmation should also be as "standalone" as possible, so it can be easily used from other places in the application. I think in the future it will make sense to ask for the confirmation in more cases - for example when attempting to close the application or opening file from Dropbox. 
@sleshchenko Yes, i have verified and created the client_secret key before applying cluster-issuer and certificate. Do you think any other additional step/instruction  that is required is missing in the documentation?. I am creating this in a brand new environment and no other dependencies exists.
Sorry, I can't find the log file in Mac OSX. 
Doesn't matter. They all crash.
hehehe- well, if you have some time, it would be nice... ;) 
It would even be OK if it's always on.  But sure, a checkbox is fine...  or another idea, if you can see the log level when those messages come across bluetooth, maybe offer a choice of which level to enable?  So far I think people typically comment out or disable most log messages before releasing a watch app, to avoid cluttering the log.  But maybe if they could be disabled, it would make more sense to leave some of them in, for the sake of spontaneous troubleshooting in the field.  OTOH they would waste bluetooth bandwidth and battery power, I suppose, so I'm not sure if that's a good practice.  It might be better if there was a way to push the log level as a setting to the watch, so that disabled messages aren't sent across, but that's one of those things that we can't change, I guess.

@mfussenegger Thanks for your quick response.  I just tried the REFRESH command and it didn't work. I test this with multiple node. Let me setup a single node cluster and try this again. Will get back to you later.  Best regards, Ryan
Already solved. Closing the issue.
I changed it to "\". I tried a couple more like "insert" and etc. but I think it didn't work

Where? At the elkjs repository? You set the milestone already, afaics?  Anyway, how do I link issues properly?
@marco-jacob Can you explain once again ?  I guess you deleted a cache which already had a note. Then you added it again and the note is still there. That sound perfectly fine as long as you either had a local note and saved the cache again while it is still held in cachecache or you had a note on gc.com and downloaded it again. 
https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v092/index.php  configure and download the firmware from this link.  Compile the sketch and then manually modify the some defines in Configuration.h, like above sample  #define EEPROM_MODE 0 => #define EEPROM_MODE 1  Then you can  see the error report. @matthijskooijman  Thanks 
Roughly another 250 :/ Im having a look at the obvious ones atm, but will have to wait till after school tomorrow to have a look through everything 
Thanks @serge-rider!
> You mean an extension point to add a new debugger, is that?  No, extension point is not needed. We can start debug session by just configuring appropriate launch config. That does not require any dependency between plugins and extension points. So in eclipse.nodejs.core there will be a single "configurer" for each type of debug session. Those configurers will turn on, if installation has appropriate launch config type and will display in the UI.  > Why? How it works if you have several tern projects in your workspace?  What happens right now, is that for each project a new tern server is started. The same will happen if debug mode is on, but all of those servers will start in debug mode. 
Garcia,  I test without "this" and the result continues null 
when it deleted the tinker's construct tools i just had those selected when i looted the compost.  when it won't allow looting with fertilizer in hand then i switched slots inbetween last time looting and this time, did use some fertilizer acquired from last loot, or generally reorganized the inventory. it only allows looting with empty hand or freshly acquired fertilizer. (not even bio mash works)  the way looting the compost is implemented it's asking for incompatibilities and also isn't user friendly. 
@TiTo-418 Thank You! 
Yes, we definitely plan to continue the tradition of nightly builds for GATK4 -- we can set them up after beta.
I've done some more testing and these are my conclusions:  I can't reproduce the bug in singleplayer it only happens for me in multiplayer. I've tested all the botania rods and found that only the following three rods have the duping bug:  - Rod of the Lands - Rod of the Highlands - Rod of the Terrafirma  Furthermore the Rod of the Depths makes it so that the builder's wand doesn't work at all.  I suspect that the bug is due to all three rods abillity to create dirt out of mana and the interaction of this mechanic with your mod. I've tested with some other random botania items but none of them seemed to exhibit the duping bug. 
I'll send you a PM with a link to the full object.
Hey, yes, the tabs get refreshed and everything is ok if tab is refreshed. I know this is a general "problem" with all the views. I realized just now, that this is actually duplicate of issue #1079 so I am closing this - i had a feeling this issue was posted before but I could not find it.

Ok, thanx! 
Thanks for your reply.  I did some further tests and it seems that this problem occurs because I have extended the java.util.Observable class.  It seems like @dimzon's change has fixed this problem. Thanks!

Assuming you mean the demo referenced [here](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/blob/master/Docs/tomcat/TomcatSingleSignOnValve.md#waffle-authenticator-demo), first, there is no folder Samples/waffle-negotioate, there is a war. I've made a fresh Tomcat instance without custom JARs and dropped `waffle-negotiate-1.8.0.war` into `webapps`.  [Upon boot, I got the same error message.](https://gist.github.com/alshain/e0279ba06c8fc8549b51d78b3c8e898d#file-apache-waffle-log-L27)  Looking at its `WEB-INF/context.xml`, it also uses the Valve as described in the guide.   
I've sent a full bug report to dev.exoplayer@gmail.com I could also see the issue in a Nexus 6 with 7.1, but only once, haven't been able to reproduce it anymore in such device. In a Huawei P20-Lite with Pie seems to be more common.  Doing some test, if I delay the video playback to start around a couple of seconds after releasing the codec, then the problem doesn't seem to occur anymore. But, I can't confirm at all if placing such delay may be related or just pure chance, since the issue happens rarely and I need to perform several times the video encoding followed by the ExoPlayer playback before the error happens again.  
It doesn't work,right-click tree's every part will harvest apricorn when the tree grown.

I'm on v3.45 (latest according to the play store)  I've since removed and reinstalled and had no crashes until I set the quiz to 100 items, then it crashes without fail. 50 items works fine which is an acceptable work around.  Please see the log below - it's from just before I start the quiz (and change the settings) to the crash  Much appreciated!    
> I do not quite understand how this would help. If the request messages take longer than 200 ms to process in the device registry, then the requests towards the registry will still time out in the adapter, because the response does not arrive in time (within 200 ms). The result should be the same: the adapter will reject HTTP requests with a 503, or am I mistaken?  And that is what happens. Yet, on the device registry side, that request is still present and will be processed, delaying requests coming in after that. So all requests which arrive in the future will also time out.  > Once the adapter runs out of credits from the registry, it should actually immediately return a 503 to clients without trying to invoke the registry.  It does, but that is not the problem.  > Did you experience this same behavior using the "load test mode" of the registry, where it simply returns a response without looking up the data?  Yes.  Assuming you have a device registry which allows for 100 credits, but only can process 1 request a second and the timeout it one second. And the request rate is 10 requests per second:  On the first second, you have 10 accepted requests and 1 response. 9 timeouts. And 9 requests in the queue. As canceling requests doesn't remove them on the device registry side.  On the second you have 10 accepted requests, 1 response (already timed out), 10 timeouts and 18 requests on the queue …

We have Java libraries that dynamically load native C libraries and we use the sandwich API to modify the compile time and run time Java classpath in order to exclude unwanted dependencies.  For instance, a developer might want to exclude Guava version 22 from the classpath of an application when it depends on a collection of libraries that collectively depend on both Guava 22 and Guava 25.  More information is available in my comments here:  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5821  I have submitted a pull request to improve handling of native libraries but I don't think anyone has taken a look at it:  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/7042

Here it is working: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4951420/44711498-d740f980-aaf1-11e8-8e50-f65e80276160.png) I will leave it on until it gets resolved. By the way it is port 1337.
I'll correct what I said, it does work when you are OP but, I think you are supposed to be able to use this as a normal user by default, right ?   1. No it doesnt (tested), I think this only affects essentials commands, so for example I can use tab with /tell from Uchat.  2. LuckPerms, Vault, ProtocolLib, Essentials  3. No errors
I went to 1.12 with your newest release 67. The odd rotation thing when flipping the lever seems not to be present there. I also have the feeling that the lightning goes abit faster and smoother in 1.12. I'm not if my pc isn't good enough anymore. I have AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-core with 4.00Ghz processors. 8GB DDR3 RAM 1600Mhz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 And ofc SSD drives (in raid0)
No, I'm using the master version. Should I be using 1.1-dev instead?
@dmzaytsev updated 
actually you could have spotted a different issue. i.e. that of having nbest in the log of server  I meant the problem that the parameter "v" in the config file is not handled at all.  I create a new issue for the "wrong" output of the nbest. This issue keeps related to verbose parameter.  Nicola 
Thank you, here is output of `locale`:

Sorry for the delay!  My ROM is in French, Android 4.2.2 (it's an old phone), App 2.1.1 :slightly_smiling_face: 
+1. I will verify this with secured backend and if any issues I will raise it. 
I use Linux desktop sync. This works perfectly. It's strange, it may fail even if I am at home in the sam local area network, where the server is. 
[CityScope_Kendall.zip](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/files/796611/CityScope_Kendall.zip)   Almost the same model as road traffic but indeed the GIS file are "dirty". I am working on finding other GIS so it's not an emergency for me but more a way to track the difference between the 2 versions of GAMA.   Actually in some release (I have different release version) the rendering is very strange with some Z value on some other there is no problem at all. So I guess the GIS has lots of Z strange values that might impact on the triangulation. Maybe (I don't know if it's generic enough) we can by default flatten (remove any Z composant) any GIS file? 
@terrymanu  yes, I sync from apache/dev yesterday commit id is : https://github.com/xiyelife/incubator-shardingsphere/commit/f43529f9eab895b0be9f282ec8769115f43bead2 I will try to use the latest version ， thanks！
> Hmm interesting. Do you happen to know a more reliable query to distinguish MySQL from MariaDB?  At least `SELECT VERSION();` returns "10.3.7-MariaDB-log" in our MariaDB MaxScale environment and something like "5.0.96-standard" in MySQL. 
Hi I just tested it with the 3.x and it still happens to me. I even created a new project to test this and it still happens(I created a simple project to get rid of other code and just test this part of the app). I can send you the test  project I created so that you won't have to write it yourself.   U can get the test app and import it if you want from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxtZ7N-Znyracm05RnZiVl9BM0E/view?usp=sharing 
Edit: I just tested by deleting the community bridge directory and letting it reload with a server restart, I made all the config edits again and tested. (this test is with craftbukkit 1.7.2)  I'm still getting the same problems, it adds the group the player is in, but it doesn't remove the old group that they are no longer a part of.  Also, it made that same null.yml file again.  Also, it still only   I was using the latest spigot build for 1.7.9.  I just loaded up craftbukkit 1.7.2 build and it still does the same thing, no player file is created in the players folder and it only adds groups rather than remove groups they are not a part of.  My next test is going to be to delete my config file and let it reload with your latest update that you just released couple day's ago.

@soulgalore   I'm testing on a Mac with the following configuration:  ![screen shot 2014-01-02 at 2 00 30 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3484304/1835938/6478ac1a-73f9-11e3-9427-2d7760447558.png) 
I added another point so the path didn't run through the rocket with the same results. The right path was longer than the left and the heading was increasing positive. I tried another path with a clockwise turn where right should have been more than left and it isn't. The heading went negative when I would have expected plus. I know from last year that we had to negate the navX yaw reading because a clockwise turn with it was a positive value while Pathfinder standard was clockwise negative. We were running Vanaka's Motion Profile Generator last year but switched to Path Weaver this year. We couldn't get the simplest turns to run until we switched back to Motion Profile Generator.

@jansupol I time-boxed tried to provide a test case but the tests for OSGi seem to be in a non-working state for me? (And ignored in Java 11)  I'm expecting the error to appear in the test suit if you rename for example org.glassfish.jersey.examples.osgi.helloworld.additional.resource to org.glassfish.jersey.examples.osgi.helloworld.classification.additional.resource.  Regardless, it's clear that the line of code will replace all occurrences of ".class" in the jarEntryName by an empty string while it should only replace the final ".class" if it's the end of the jarEntryName.

@tristaZero Hi I thought the 'SequenceOffset' was designed for the sequence offset ，but i can find anyway to set the variable 'SequenceOffset' , so i just run the vibrateSequenceOffset method and found the result was alternate 1,0,1,0 . i don't konw why don't you set it to 0 directly?

I'm not using web sockets. But the Spark service always calls `configureWebSockets()` on startup, which throws an exception, which kills the process.
Unclear to me too since this is the top crash which happens a lot of times with slightly different stack traces so I can't tell...   cc @mario 
Huh. After testing in a more isolated environment, the exception does not seem to cause a crash. Not really sure why it did in my environment, but it's worth noting that it was heavily modded (even though that should theoretically not make a difference). 
> Is your http_proxy listen on 0.0.0.0 rather than localhost ?  There's no proxy in this example. The example shows that bazel does not try to connect to the proxy at all. It should never attempt to connect to the remote cache at port 4444, only to the proxy at port 4445.  It's trying to connect to the wrong server. The example replicates if the proxy is on a different machine. I used this example because if the server is on another machine, a "minimal test case" involves TCP logs showing there is no attempt to connect to the proxy.

Hello,  Thank you for your response.   "Why are you attempting to log within the doFilter method itself?" - a couple of reasons / use-cases  1. LoggingFilter - the sole reason it exists is to log the path (request.path), time of request, user who made the request etc 2. SomeXAuthorizationFilter - which does some authorization checks and logs basic information including "User U attempting to perform an action A with and some request parameters"  We are currently using Micronaut filters for both these reasons.  One of the workarounds we have thought of is to replace filters with interceptors because we found that logging inside filter method is not instrumented for tracing.  Hope that helps. Your inputs on this will be valuable.

There were still some files left after uninstalling Popcorn Time, so that was the reason why installation failed. Managed to install it now. But now I get this message:  "Uhoh! You're using the wrong version of Popcorn Time for Android. The right version is being downloaded right now, if possible..."
Updating to 1.4.0 seems to have fixed the issue. Thank you! 
Putting it in quotes does seem to work!    It could also explain why https://github.com/Phoenix616/ResourcepacksPlugins/issues/16 doesn't work. So any setting changes not in quotes just sticks to the default.  You don't seem to have a catch case for false without quotes?

So I couldn't get the full trace, so I tried to do it from the command line where it worked. Long story short: seems like the issue was caused by another .jar which had an older version of  JUnit bundled included and when adding 4.10 it went after that jar so basically classpath issue... embarassing. (**-_-**)  That said, I still think the code example in RuleChain should be replaced with my snippet since it is actually compilable and runnable.

Oh, I've using this module many weeks now, and I miss this things: - When [we fail a catch](http://i.imgur.com/suWV1xp.png) or [the mon flees](http://i.imgur.com/KQfA1lH.png), show the percentage of the probability we had of that to happen. - Show the IVs inside circles, [using this Unicodes](http://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_2460.html). That makes the IVs more visible and uses a lot less characters. - Grade perfection: Add a format to sum up the IV percentage to a letter. (A:100%-91%, B:89%-80%...) Example of the last two features: [Snorlax](http://i.imgur.com/7veyqoV.png), [Pokemon GO direct MitM](http://i.imgur.com/FFilOCz.png) - Show Pokéstop spin information & number of items in bag. Useful to see the chain Pokéstop you are, and to check the items when you spin and exit the stop too fast and it seems that failed. [Heads-up notification](http://i.imgur.com/eMY6qI3.png), [notification](http://i.imgur.com/Rl7APXP.png). - When an egg is hatched, show info about the mon hatched (name, CP, IV, candies and dust received), even when the hatch animation has not played yet. - Gym info. PoGoIV did this with a scrollable notification when you entered a gim, with CP, moves and IV of each mon. - Not related to the other modules, because this feature is exclusive of this one, but if you have the **Enable dismiss notifications** enabled, the notification dismiss immediately, as intended. I would like the notification to be dismissed when the animation ends, because when I'm waiting to end I like to see the stats of what I just catched. Maybe adding some delay to dismiss it?  Here you have the GitHubs of the another modules, maybe you can cherrypick stuff from there: [PoGoIV](https://github.com/chuparCh0pper/PoGoIV_xposed) and [Pokemon GO direct MitM](https://github.com/ELynx/pokemon-go-xposed-mitm).

@zoewangg  The jdk version is 1.8.0_191. The aws s3 sdk version  is 2.5.31. The code is very simple:  Maybe there are some missunderstandings here.  I have analyzed the source code of aws sdk: the class of `software.amazon.awssdk.auth.signer.AwsS3V4Signer` and `software.amazon.awssdk.auth.signer.internal.AbstractAws4Signer`. I did not use any `Inputstream`. The inutputstream I mentioned is used in aws s3 sdk, the `Inputstream` represents the stream data of http request. It's quite easy to reproduce.

@brettwooldridge  HikariCP version was 2.7.4 but I've changed it to 3.1.0. Problem is persist using both versions.  Minimum idle is 2 but 0 doesn't do much too. Maximum pool size is 20 but I've tried it with 5, nothing really changed.  @nunnrlc  Should I really stop them that way? Because as you see in the initialization method I always stop the previous dataset if the conditions are met. I've debugged it for a while and it seems to be work right. I mean it creates a new dataset when it's needed. 
Seems like pressing the plugin icon solves the problem, thought it was supposed to be automatic Thanks!
Ok, I can check.  I tried to find the snapshot jars, but https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/ seems outdated.  BTW what are the jars I should update ? spring-cloud-sleuth-core and spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin ?  I tried to clone and build https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth.git but it fails because of some other missing Spring Cloud snapshot dependencies.  What is the easiest way to upgrade my application and do the check ? 
Not deep. Probably one level deeper. Request has an object which contains LocalDate 
Yes: the conclusion of that status update is " over the breakfast table--what else am I to think?", but that doesn't show in the app. 
I'm also thinking it is most likely a threading issue. I've just mentioned those phone models because those the phones i'm currently working with. This issue happened on other models too (one LG for sure). So, no. I think there's no reason to believe that this issue happens only on mentioned phones. I will continue to look to find a solution now when i know that `null` is not on purpose. By the way, the library is great! 
I just created a new end portal by using the frames you can place from creative.  Hopefully that doesn't cause any side effects but that was how I was testing it.

@sbordet  By using a FileInputStream which requires a File, you lose one of the primary features of the Path API -- that of filesystem encapsulation. If you have all of your content on the default filesystem, where the File version of a file and the Path version of the file happen to be equivalent in terms of the actual file content to be read, it may not manifest as a bug. Once you try to use a Path on anything besides the default filesystem, the benefit of using a PathResource goes away.  My interpretation for PathResource was that it was originally intended to provide a _Path_ version of the same type of resource as a FileResource, while staying in the safe zone of the Path abstraction.  Paths all know what filesystem they belong to, and Path and Filesystem implementations are intended to be provide a simple and uniform way of navigating relatively or absolutely within a filesystem, thus all buffers, channels ,etc are delegated in some way to the filesystem which a Path is part of. The older File abstraction has no such capability, which is part of the reason that the Path system was derived in the first place.  Before the bugfix, the getInputStream method delegated to the underlying filesystem for the Path in the PathResource. After the bugfix, it allowed a jailbreak by converting the path name to a string and then wrapping it in a File object, which has no concept of what filesystem the original path came from.

I thought that would be clear by:  > Making a change, pressing "Apply" applies the changes, the "apply" button even gets disabled. Yet the Web UI asks to discard changes when moving away from the service.  As this is an issue which sporadically appears (at least I haven't found a pattern yet) I cannot give you a set of instructions to replicate this with with 100% certainty.
My specific use case was I was creating my own welcome page plugin for the Che Theia editor, but the default Che welcome page was still showing up.  So I asked in https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/issues/95 if there was some way to disable/hide/exclude the default welcome plugin, and one of the suggestion was I could set some env variable.  Hence I wanted to see how I can pass the variable to the editor  I asked the question more generally for editor and plugins because I'm thinking there may be similar use cases.
The authors of depending classes should have the last word, but since is at least partly in public I think it should all be there. 
Unfortunately not. I tried generating a fresh project on a different machine and got a different stack:    Some notes about my setup: - I'm making an Xcode project with a single apple_bundle as its target - We don't currently have any tests in the project - I'm creating the project with --build-with-buck. Full command is "buck project //:targetName --build-with-buck" - The Xcode project mostly generates. I can open the .xcworkspace and it has all targets, but no schemes. I can manually create the schemes and the project will run - The .xcodeproj file does not have a name (it generates as ".xcodeproj" instead of "targetName.xcodeProj") - Project generation works fine on the sample buck ios project - Buck version is a965937ccdadf8119a98ab766c3feb0708dc424e  Sorry, I wish I had more specifics! I will update if I make any more progress on the issue.  
My bad, the problem was caused by having both redhat.vscode-xml and gorkem.vscode-xml extensions installed. VSCode couldn't know one was the evolution of the other. Closing

my xenforo mysql db has always been remote and when you use bungee with servers on the same dedicated server you bind the servers to localhost so players can only connect through bungeecord  when I don't bind the minecraft server it works but when I do it can't connect to the remote mysql db so I would say yes in some cases I need the mysql connector to bind to different ip than the minecraft server  Thanks JamieKG

Thank you very much for your fast comment.  Well, what type of client will be the right one to get both the header information and the bytes?

I don't know how to do that... is there any file somewhere stored? any special way to run syncthing ?  explain me a way and I ll provide logs.. 
Hi Bartosz, problem resolved when i added lines "                 if(list.isBoolean()) {                     return Boolean.valueOf(jsonElement.getAsBoolean());                 } " thank you for the quick response. 
Here is a snippet from my SDK pom.xml. Spring Framework version should be fine.   
Yes, I see you working on a bunch of fixes. That's great. I am planning for an end of March release.
> Which Conscrypt version did you test with?  It's the default version (2.2.1) from grpc-alts
Yes, some plugins utilize scoreboard teams.

If you think this is something serious, then I can buy you the latest Humble Mobile Bundle as a gift (https://www.humblebundle.com/mobile). Either the cheapest option, which includes the game in question, or the 4 USD option, in case you are interested in the other games (for your own amusement, not to test them against XPrivacy ;-). 
I reached out to the original developer when creating the issue but have yet to hear back. I will try to incorporate his changes and test it out if I don't hear anything.

Hi @bclozel - the previous issue had this JUnit test error and the :sagan-site:bootRun error.  The bootRun error was fixed but not the JUnit test error.  At any rate, here is the file:   
Maybe I was overthinking it. Your idea should work in this case. I was thinking that showing https stuff on http pages as not possible without warnings but it's only the other way around. And in this case, YouTube serves the same content over both http and https, so we're not breaking any security practices.
Good point; I just tried updating to 1.0.2.RELEASE but I see the same behaviour.  After adding some more logging in the extended WebInfConfiguration:   
Yes, I've been trying to import my entire summer school timetable lol, now I can see why this is an unreasonable demand.  I'm running Slimkat bacon weekly 8.14, which is based on Kitkat 4.4.4 3gbs of ram Not sure if this is going to be useful anymore. 
@bclozel Yes it was what I did first. It seems that I'm able to execute my filter before or after the ``LoggingCodecConfiguration`` but ``CodecCustomizer#jacksonCodecCustomizer`` is always registered last and overrides my configuration
thank you for your reply I find reason after I report this Bug, and I comment it on my Bug page, but now I can not find it  the cause of the bug is i am not consume the entire response body in my origin code , i do not consume the entire response body, here is my origin code:   my new code is work. but I think some times people do not consume entire response body, so I think the better way is that it can Implicit invoke by okhttp framework
Put a rex down in an iron cage, set the time to night, and watch the hunger bar with a dinopedia.
Wow, thanks for the fast reply. I've installed mirakel 2.2.1 and tried it with davdroid 0.5.7-alpha-mirakel (2014-01-27), 0.5.8-alpha-mirakel (2014-02-11) and 0.5.8-alpha-mirakel (2014-02-12) 
Here's a log after sending a MR.   
the server's dns is mc.worldbuscus.com so far the only one I've found I have the error on. Would this be the reason that connecting with a mini-map also crashes on join? 
Great? verified with 1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and it works even better than 2.1.x.  Thank you @violetagg ! Looking forward for official release.
No, only the RPC threads. I tried manually closing them somehow in the NepeheMiniCluster but had no luck.

I use a LG G3 with 5.1, but also have this on a Galaxy Nexus with 4.4.x :smile:  
Sure. Empty database with a single migration V1_1_1__test.sql that looks like this  
Currently, Stellar Sky-0.1.4.6, though I plan to update to later builds for my modpack soon. 
The query string version seems to behave the same for me:    I'm not sure how to capture the Gnuplot data file, would you be able to provide me with some guidance for that? 
Ok, if I activate "Stay Animated", it's glitching only the first time, but then it's ok.  If it's desactivated, it's glitching each time I open it.  Do wou want the structure code with little exporter?
i'm not actually sure, i don't quite have them memorized but it's this one: https://imgur.com/a/WrNf9ey In the DB the size is set as "BIGGER"
Yes, I also think that I'm using 1.0.8.  Below is the code that creates the AnimatedDrawable (or if that does not work, creates a normal BitmapDrawable assuming it is a non-animated image). Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this issue on my device by myself, but a friend of mine gets it from time to time (Samsung Galaxy S3). Also, in Google Developer Console, I get many of these native crash report; the devices are mostly Galaxy S3, Nexus 5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S5, Xperia Z1. Looks like it happens only on Android 4.3 and 4.4 (but that might be a coincidence).   
Changed code references to label the two primary texture files as BLOCK_PNG and ITEMS_PNG for clarity 
Eclipse and I am using Rabbit 3.5.7 client
Service doesn't matter, it seems to be an issue on display. I don't recall what the last action was. If I can figure out how to reproduce, I'll post steps. 
When I start the openhab fresh the above reported error is no longer in the log. Unfortunatly it is not connecting to the flic button daemon. The PaperUI shows the flicd with state "Bridge-Unitialized".

I did not have any other mods installed. However during the time i started using it, there seems to have been a "sneaky" update to spigot to fix a exploid bug. This seems to have altered some things so in the end it appears that it was indeed the server it self even though they kept claiming it was not them. They just did not realise there had been an update that altered permission stuff. It works fine now although i feel that the 1.11 version was a lot more stable and reliable on the printer function. It now produces a lot of ghost placing that when you move away dissappear. However that is something entirely different. Sorry to have wasted a little of your time today. I know you are busy and i do hope you will continue making this awesome mod even better

Unfortunately I have been unable to reproduce this in a smaller test class. I also cannot make my full source available. I have never seen it take more than 2 waits (of 40ms each) to resolve the property, and I have only once seen it take 2 waits, so it is an incredibly narrow timing issue as far as I can tell. I also only see it when my disk I/O, CPU, and RAM are all at very high usage (I've never seen it occur without over 40 MB/s in disk writes, 95%+ CPU usage, 90%+ RAM usage, and creating/destroying hundreds of MB worth of objects/second). My hard drive is an SSD if that is relevant at all. I also made my transactions smaller to increase throughput and since doing so this issue has become much more rare. I now get it once every ~10 hours of runtime at full load.

That's a RStudio crash, as everything works fine outside of RStudio, and the only message I get when RStudio is launched from a terminal is, as mentioned, `Floating point exception`.  I tried reinstalling the tidyverse package but that doesn't solve the problem. The only workaround is to load every tidyverse package individually and, then, the tidyverse package itself.  I really think it is linked to the message displayed when tidyverse is loaded, more specifically the checkmark symbol...
Thanks for the quick reply on this one :)   Running this server via Multicraft with out of the box settings for the minecraft jar itself, would suppose that this isn't the offline variant.  What kind of exceptions should I be looking for, by the looks of it the only exceptions that I Can find in the server logs are related to Plugindatasource causing the exception:  [13:00:40] [Server thread/WARN]: [Plan] com.djrapitops.plan.data.plugin.HookHandler Caught: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Absolute Path was null (Not defined) [13:00:40] [Server thread/WARN]: [Plan] Exception can be viewed at http://0.0.0.0:8804/debug [13:00:40] [Server thread/ERROR]: [Plan] Attempting to register PluginDataSource caused an exception.  We have an automated restart in about an hour, will troubleshoot some more when im done at work.
For /ignore to not just ignore messages but to also ignore the ignored players chat messages in chat.
when the server is opening maybe is not authme error, the old error is fixed, thanks 
If my application doesn't have enough memory, JRE throw OutOfMemory while processing stack.add(commandToUse);  Thank you.
After looking through the code I believe this delay is caused by the things in GCParser.getExtraOnlineInfo (friends log, GCVote, elevation). At least GCVote and the elevation could be done in parallel (without the activity waiting for their results). 
Stephan- thanks for so many good suggestions so quickly! I will definitely try those breakpoints. At the moment, the EAR is working perfectly (of course!), so I will have to wait until it fails again. As to EAR- Tom's project is a WAR and he is seeing the same behavior, so I don't think it's likely to be a packaging issue.   One other thing I do notice is that when the app is failing, the screen comes back very very fast. Much faster than when it is working correctly. The difference is only a second or two, but it seems like the speed may be because the renderer is skipping things. Just one more piece of the puzzle to mull over... Thanks again!!
on world load, forge is happy with it and its only when you try and load a world that it spits.. 
Using `/npc create test` creates an npc that is not pushable. Not sure how I could push him into the nether portal. I am not familiar with Citizens's in-game commands. I've only ever used it through my own plugins.  [EDIT] I used `/npc moveto` to move it into the nether portal. After a few seconds it disappeared, but when I teleported after it, it was not visible.
The full stack trace is as follows:

Hi,  Here is what i've gathered so far:  I'm using one client and i swapped between the different jars to get the logs, i made sure to delete the elasticsearch index between each try.  For 2.3.1, I can see the index created and messages get populated on my elasticSearch server  [2.3.1_INFO.log](https://github.com/delirius325/jmeter-elasticsearch-backend-listener/files/2668991/2.3.1_INFO.log) [2.3.1_DEBUG.log](https://github.com/delirius325/jmeter-elasticsearch-backend-listener/files/2668992/2.3.1_DEBUG.log)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39808956/49824260-92ef0780-fd36-11e8-89a5-3b44278e1cd6.png)   For 2.5.1, i can see the index created but no messages ever get populated:  [2.5.1_INFO.log](https://github.com/delirius325/jmeter-elasticsearch-backend-listener/files/2668999/2.5.1_INFO.log) [2.5.1_DEBUG.log](https://github.com/delirius325/jmeter-elasticsearch-backend-listener/files/2668998/2.5.1_DEBUG.log)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39808956/49824120-355abb00-fd36-11e8-8e9c-281e3a470145.png) 
> What pack is this your using?  I made a custom pack 
Yes, I removed the old files in tomcat and redeployed the new war file.  Hmm this is odd. I realize now I was wrong when I said it was showing the wrong colours and styling.  It is actually just applying the default Bootstrap css. I have been using a bootstrap css theme (http://bootswatch.com/superhero/) and it worked properly with version 2.0.2.0. However with 2.0.3.0, it seems like it's not picking up everything from the new bootstrap.css file, and the elements on webpage are from the basic bootstrap css  (with some parts from the new css, like the brand in the navbar).  Could this be a solution? http://gwtbootstrap.github.com/gwt-bootstrap/apidocs/com/github/gwtbootstrap/client/ui/config/Configurator.html I will try this later, missed this earlier because all was working with version 2.0.2.0 
1.7.10 - 1.3.1 
It totally was an error on my part, I shouldn't have set it up like I did.  Thanks again for the Forge config tip. 
For 2) I don’t know maybe looking at the code will allow us to guess or maybe davidatorus knows  For 1) a long time ago, HO developers were informing users about development news. News were stored in a server and fetched by the app. We will not support this. Anyway if someone care about development news he can just look github activity.
Let's leave it open for now. I'll report back if it happens again.  
I could also oomph successfully in a VM, but on my local machine the behavior remains reproducible. For now, I will just assume something's wrong with my machine. Regarding expired certificates, I think this would have been clearer from the error message. If I ever succeed in running a setup, I will report back here.
It's a very long latest.log, you need to view it raw :)   The server log only shows a normal login followed by a disconnect, but I'll upload it when I get on my PC.
I have update jira. What do you mean by SRV ? 
@findepi MySQL server version is 5.7.20.  MySQL server is master-slave topology, and GTID mode is on, but when I use the lower presto version, it just works fine.  I have to use GTID to sync data between the master node to the slave node. I feel a little confused about this. Any suggestion to fix it？
Agreed, changing the documentation would fit the bill. The app ended up in the default package in the first place as a quick prototype - and got forgotten there.

OK I finally figured out the problem.  I installed Java8 on this new Mac, but it already had Java11 on it and was using that as default.  I switched the JAVA_HOME to jdk8 by using this command: `export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)"` and then it built fine!
Actually i merge code manually in Android Studio, No direct pull request. Also i don't want to make any change on existing code for better code merging  in future. So can you provide any solution accordingly.  
Here it is:   
yeah, that seems to have fixed the issue

@guillaume-tgl Hello, I have problem only in release build mode. Debug build works fine. I have a lot of another react-native-... dependencies, project fully migrated to react-native@0.60.3. "jetifier" is enabled in Android gradle.properties by default now. Do I need to do some custom steps to use react-native-share with jetifier? 
1.1.3 is the version. I have not done anything to enable on-the-fly minification? Where should I look for that? 
Not that I am aware of. I just installed the new version with fresh configs. I forgot to add I have the admin panel part running remotely via a web server if that's any thing that cause it.

Hi, sorry for the delay.  Clicking true or false on the types I mentioned don't work all the time, but I haven't been able to determine the pattern in which they work or don't work. Additionally, I have noticed these errors in console:  [SEVERE] Could not pass event InventoryClickEvent to EchoPet v2.0.5 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -999   [SEVERE] Could not pass event CreatureSpawnEvent to Prism v1.6.3 java.lang.ClassCastException: com.github.dsh105.echopet.entity.pet.CraftPet cannot be cast to org.bukkit.entity.Sheep  I am running build #2020.  Thanks. 
Sorry for the delay...I am using: `rtiamb.joinFederationExecution(federateName, federateType, federationName, joinMods);` Where joinMods is an empty array (ie not null) 
I use my own stack, which extends codenvy/node. This stack for what I see works perfectly, but sometimes when I add some new folders into projects it doesn't restart.  My stack   I am sorry I don't have the logs, yesterday I installed the new 5.0.0M8 and today the new nightly version, the only things in docker still existing is the image of 5.0.0M8, the container has been deleted (at least I don't see it when I execute docker ps -a). I am not even sure how to get those logs lol.  Tell me how to get those logs and next time I see the issue comes back, I will share them. For now, I didn't try to kill the system, I didn't have the time to do it.
I simply have the comment within a test java class that looks like below and add spaces/change a letter, then save and it will continually happen. It's possibly some of the settings I have may be interacting with the saves causing it to happen more often than it should.   
Downloaded v0.1.2 binary today.  Does not put in '__'.  Attached screenshot.  Perhaps it's fixed in dev version. I can try that.  ![pgomgr_screencap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11563803/18600392/5bcf5bc6-7c2b-11e6-8026-00124b0a11b3.PNG) 
 I'm editing the .py in RStudio's editor and running the code in an interactive python session at the terminal
Step 1: Create a new part, Test1 v1 Step 2: Create a new version of Test1, Test1 v2 Step 3: Create a new SBOL Document, Import part, select Test1, select v2. Result: The imported part in the new SBOL document is Test1 v1 instead of Test1 v2.  ![test1 v1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35148159/51795503-0e135c80-21c3-11e9-99a0-f54e15a1d04e.png) ![test1 v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35148159/51795504-0eabf300-21c3-11e9-812d-58190e500fac.png)  
@geoand https://github.com/kdubb/quarkus-kotlin-mixed-test Almost straight from the project generator. Fails with `1.2.0.Final` plugin but works with `1.1.1.Final`.
i havent been, no 
PR https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android/pull/918 has been created. 
I was actually using your sample app and it was exhibiting the "BLACK when scrolling".  I did add:    to StickyListHeadersListView in main.xml and that DID fix the issue (THANKS).  Could adding this in the StickyListHeader Library be a better solution (in Code)?  (If I use a regular ListView, then I don't need to add this extra attribute to the List View) 
This happens with test9.pdf  Full error log [error-log2.txt](https://github.com/medusa-project/cantaloupe/files/2562686/error-log2.txt)

https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B5yKfXm1PkuLLTJTRExnSmRNbWM&usp=sharing That will have the console log in full. It shouldn't skip anything in it. I have it set to trim it from console view, not from the actual log. Also I posted all 5 of tickthreadings logs as well. I was really hoping it would be another one of those "you need to change x setting" . Sorry for not posting them earlier. Also thanks for the help Nallar.  
Yes, it is a key on the mouse, and thanks.
Oh, is it not meant to land you at the other celestial gateway? I assumed it was to land you on top of the other one. I do apologize if this is working as intended, it just seemed very odd to me.
In backpack put an 2 tool in slots under them. Pressed the shift key, scrolled the mouse wheel went crashes.
@jexp I'm using the version 3.0.1. I'm using this query     So, the Neo4J insert 20% of database.In Neo4j-Browser the inserts are ok. 
> @zregvart It's not obvious from the description where the differences to the current impl are. Can you provide an example if that?  Description has JSON schema snippet as defined by the Swagger Concur publishes and what it needs to be.  To make it more plastic, this could be the JSON as defined by the published Swagger: 
Yep, haven't noticed `1.1.1` update. Works great, thanks.
Nope. Still can connect while game is running.  Waiting for 1.2.2 :C 
I checked it with a list that I had w/ 3 caches in it.  It still does the same thing.    Here are the GC codes.  There's about 15-20km separating them and it launches the map at 5300km scale bar. GC33K80 GC1TTJB GC2RD1  Regarding the quantity of usable caches in a list, in the past I've been able to open a map of a list of up to 4500 caches w/o issue.  I tried 5440 after that and it crashed, so I stepped back to 2K caches as it gets me about 10mile radius.  I have 8 PQ's running weekly that get all the caches w/i a 65mi radius of Houston, TX.  I dump this into GSAK and can generate GPX files based on my needs.  I wish my Garmin Oregon had this much capacity.  I love using c:geo for getting me to the general area, and reading logs, cache notes, sat views etc.  But for accuracy in the woods, the phone just doesn't cut it. 
Its for personal account, and i have integrated One Drive for one of my android application. Previously it was working fine. We found this bug today and i am unable to fix it. Its happening consistently, and its not even opening the picker dialog.  Its crashing when i am calling this class from Activity                                         mPicker = Picker.createPicker(ONEDRIVE_APP_ID);                                         LinkType linkType = LinkType.WebViewLink;                     mPicker.setRequestCode(ID_ONEDRIVE);                     mPicker.startPicking(getActivity(), linkType);  
Yeah, I had a look through the DirectionalLight class before posting here and saw the way it should be getting the dimensions from the camera but that doesn't appear to be what's happening.  The key box2dlights and DirectionalLight code sections are here:   
Actually sorry, I had made a mistake on iOS it does indeed work there.  But still on Android I'm not getting the new assets. Building for android 2.2 The same issue when running on 2.2 and 4.something.  I can confirm that it executes these lines in StorageManager.java when I increase the version number.    But that doesn't result in the new assets.  Maybe I will have to upgrade to V3. But it will be a lot of work and I think the code here is similar. 
Thanks! Will check later today. 
I considered that before posting but since we are only using Forge 1291, rather than 1355+, I posted first before updating.  Updated to latest and just tested.  Tanks and buckets work fine now.. But the TConstruct error still occurs..  Will update Tconstruct and see if thats the issue. 
Ah yeah haven't tried a fabric container - will give that a test shortly 
Not miss,  procedure header was at line 407(please see the last picture), but it should be at the first line. I'm sure SP is right. But In DBeaver, the source is confusing. 
Hi terrymanu,  It's 4.0.0. I just cloned the master branch. As mentioned, only _select_ statements can be performed.  Thanks, Parsa
Okay, I will clear the log, start a new session and try some commands and then paste the contents of the log here. 
Yes, it works perfectly. Better than just use obtainNoHistory because fling keep working always.
Search is not working for a normal user. No stacktrace in the log, just an Error in the user interface 
Sure, I've reproduced it numerous times just now (v1.1.6 on windows10 pc, v1.6.4 on oneplus3t smartphone).  Write this on a new note on PC, and let it sync with the phone.    Then put the phone in "plane mode".  Delete the last paragraph on PC, put a short sentence INSTEAD at its place, and let the note sync with servers  Add sentences BEFORE and AFTER that last paragraph on the phone (no sync is possible due to airplane mode) ; also remove a word from said last paragraph (I dunno if it changes anything).  Then remove airplane mode from phone. Sync occurs.  The big last paragraph (although edited on phone) disappears from phone, replaced by the sentences BEFORE and INSTEAD above. **The AFTER sentence has disappeared.**  As a side note, I've never seen "merge conflicts" or the likes on simplenote, whereas like Git it should encounter such unsolvable situations, and let users deal with them. 
@elvisisking Is this already fixed or just partially? Now I see the correct duration in the activity log for a basic filter step on the 1.7.x branch. However, the basic filter is there twice: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16251792/60096990-ae5db500-9752-11e9-995d-b68b27f7836e.png) The backend returns it twice too: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16251792/60097033-c6cdcf80-9752-11e9-9a4c-d4249d3e517d.png) The integration which I used: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16251792/60097062-d9e09f80-9752-11e9-853b-549e9487feff.png) 
By "intersecting but not overlapping", I meant that the two layers touch each other but don't occupy the same coordinates. For example, I drew the void layer, and I drew the water layer with a filter except on void.  Here's a world file with the bug. It's not the one on the picture, but the same bug is visible. http://www.mediafire.com/file/s87dblmg2ewbqru/Bug.world  Here are the settings for the water ground cover layer. ![https://gyazo.com/5f2d50a1e3a31e5d0355a41c609e52c2](https://i.gyazo.com/5f2d50a1e3a31e5d0355a41c609e52c2.png)
@ddementieva's suggestion about refreshing the page seems to work. I think this implies that right click - "refresh..." in the "Project Explorer" pane may be the actual issue. 
So in other words, the ticket title should go back to "503 should be retriable", but without all the jazz about load balancers? Separately, do we want to give advice about _how_ to run Atlas in an HA configuration (e.g. don't use load balancers)?
