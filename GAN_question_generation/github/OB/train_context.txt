Need null checks for getContentHad a Swagger 2.0 file that I converted to 3.0 and when ran with your tool would fail with null pointer exceptions.These occurred in ApiResponseTransformer and RequestBodyTransformer because getContent() returned null.I think you need some null checking like this (version for ApiResponseTransformer):         final Content content =When I added the null checks to those classes the check worked as expected
failed wysiwyg random test with a complex exampleThe example still needs simplication, but there is enough information to copy the parameter values and call the test again manually.So in this case the strings are equal but `equals` is not true.

### Describe your problem, including steps to reproduce itIf I give the drone a flux bore with anywhere from Efficiency 0 to 4, it will dig up the sand as expected, collecting it by way of a magnet upgrade, and go drop it off in a chest whenever it has a stack of sand on it.However, if I give the drone an Efficiency 5 Flux Bore, it is fast enough to 'insta-mine'.At this point, it seems unable to tell that it has actually broken a block and will sit there digging sand in an infinite loop.Even enabling the 'limit block interactions' on the Dig Area widget appears to be ignored in this case.Desht was unable to reproduce with a block placer placing sand, however I suspect that the block placer may well be going a tiny bit slower than the Starlight/Lava interaction.

Internally, it looks like it converts that number to an int before comparing it against the actual throughput; as a result, specifying a throughput less than 1 (e.g. 0.95) gets compared against a number that loses precision (and is reported as 0):transactions.getThroughput();`  If the test allows double values to be specified, it should report/compare on a double value.

Service operation updateInstance should wait until operation is completeServices` operations implementation, the `createInstance()` and `deleteInstance()` methods poll for the completion of the requested operation using `LastOperationUtils.waitForCompletion` and return only after CC reports that the operation is complete with a `succeeded` or `failed` status.The `updateInstance()` method does not follow this pattern of returning on completion, but returns immediately after initiating the operation.
Basically, it seems that when running in R studio, the GUI itself adds a reference count on the variable created.You can see the following code, when the new matrix created, it should have reference count 1 throughout.This is indeed the case when you run code in a block.Also, as you can see, the function refs itself does not add reference count.However, after the block is finished, rerun refs() function will return 2 (see highlighted line in the graph below).  !Note: I notice the problem existence because the RAM usage was showing duplication when an entry of matrix x is changing.function refs() was an after thought and does not cause the problem.

However, while trying to use your library I found it quite hard to figure out how I could access the header and get it to be set correctly in the `RecordMetadata`.I finally figured out that I should call `parsedHeaders()` on the `ParsingContext` to trigger reading of the header (but this method is not mentioned in the tutorial at all).However, because `iterate()` and `iterateRecords()`, like `beginParsing()`, take the input reader as an argument, this makes it seem impossible to both get the headers and use the iterators (at least my tests to call `iter.getContext().parsedHeaders()` did not succeed -- I suppose getting the iterator does not imply `beginParsing()`, but `IterateResult` also does not expose a `beginParsing()This means I reverted to a simple while loop calling `parser.parseNextRecord()`, but this ends up being verbose because my parsing loop has a few cases of `continue`, meaning I have to repeat the `parser.parseNextRecord()Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like this situation could be improved.

Assuming there are two junit test classes and assuming there is a synthetic bean created and used in both, then if the synthetic bean can differ on a test-to-test basis, the classloader will retain the class information possibly leading to test failures.This only happens if you execute all tests at once (separetely, they would pass) and with `<reuseForks>` set to `true` (which is default).However, it always links to a parent CL that stays the same throughout the test suite execution.I think we want to consider synthetic beans as application classes, but for that we'd need to also consider all of their possible subclasses and/or proxies as app classes.I am not quite sure how to do it yet, but I wanted to write it downso we don't forget it.

Fix caret position after inline paste - is broken   As @mkevins reported :  After inline paste, the caret position should be "incremented" by the length of the inserted text.A safety check was added to the render method to prevent an out of bounds exception that can occur when the caret is moved to a position that is larger than the text buffer, which may happen as a result of Aztec trimming spaces in the content.For the purpose of checking this condition, the willTrimSpaces method https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15021/files#diff-4828a21853e899e5a36faecfa96d83e8R631 was introduced, which tries to evaluate whether Aztec will trim spaces, and if so, prevents setting the caret position.The regex that looks for outer spaces (that will be trimmed) also matches on any spaces adjacent to html tags (including inner tags).The result is that whenever the html contains inner tags adjacent to spaces

Unique graph index does not work with class hierarchies when using moveToClass   Unique indexes do not always work when dealing with sub-classes.For example, if you have the following schema:   - Friend (base class) - has property uid (long) with unique index - User (sub class of Friend)In a multi-threaded environment, if you create a Friend and then convert the Friend to a User using moveToClass, you will often wind up with duplicate Users that have the same uid property.

I'm assuming the intended behavior would be "check interface, push items if possible, move onto next regardless of priority."In current implementation, if you are pushing and pulling items to/from a block (think slime generators from exU2 with milk buckets), your system will almost always halt indefinitely until the current interface's block is cleared up.Apologies if this is confusing, I am willing to give any useful information if needed.

LexerCore ignores double quotes in SIP Header Parameter valuesWe are using JainSip Stack as the foundation of our SIP Software and during integration with a 3rd party SIP Server we recognized an issue inside the LexerCore, which is not supporting double quotes in header param values.Our example is a subscription-state header, but this accounts for any SIP header.Exemplary Unit Test that fails:We also looked up in the RFCs (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt) if the double quotes are supported and found that in 25.1 Page 221 there is a definition of a quoted-string:     quoted-stringIt is expecting that the lexer is currently placed on a supported token, but is placed on the first double quote.This results in a ParseException ignoring this header completely.

High CPU bug correlation with failed cloud messaging eventYou mentioned this bug to me on IRC a month or so ago before I switched back from unifiednlp to gmscore, sowhen it first happened I just figured I'd disable the checkin feature as I needed battery life to be reliable at the time.I recently re-enabled it along with cloud messaging after seeing a commit that stated checkin had been fixed, but I hadn't been able to tell if it was working or not as I only have one app that utilizes itso I unfortunately wasn't able to collect a logcat, but I can say that I had no occurrences of the high CPU bug for a day or so until a few minutes ago when I received the first email notification I've gotten from Slack since re-enabling checkin/cloud messaging (via IMAP IDLE, so I get it right away), which failed to notify me through the app via cloud messaging.At this point my CPU immediately spiked, and it remained high until I rebooted (after checking top to see that the culprit was indeed gmscore)I'll try enabling checkin and cloud messaging again when I have a reliable power source nearby next week, but I hope this helps narrow the potential causes of the bug down for now.

I understand the comments made on [this issue](https://github.com/tlaukkan/vaadin-lazyquerycontainer/issues/12), but the LazyQueryView has so much good debugging and caching functionality, that it seems a waste to have to either copy and paste the code to make your own changes, or to have to loose all those features.The simplest solution seems to be to remove the final modifier, but in light of the aforementioned issue's comment, at the least it seems there could be an AbstractQueryView that LazyQueryView can extend, and thus make the caching and debugging functionality available to anyone who wants to implement their own QueryView.

I unfortunately found a problem with the solution as committed for https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/290.If this is not the case, no "reuse" will take place.Now I'm the first to admit this "getting principal from request and feeding it back" is a little brittle, but that's how it works in JASPIC 1.1.What I guess what needs to happen is that when in a SAM's validateRequest method the unwrapping should _not_ take place.Session#getPrincipal`, but perhaps the more robust way is setting a request attribute to indicate we're in a SAM:I've asked Ron Monzillo if he has any opinion on this matter and let you know as soon as he replies.I originally commented on https://github.com/payara/Payara/issues/290, but since that issue is already closed

Plugin does not check which world player is in.When mines reset, plugin only check the coordinate of the player, but not which world he is in.If player is within the coordinates of a mine, even if he is in a different world, he is teleported to the top of the mine in the other world.This renders the plugin unusable since I have multiverse and players get teleported into premium mines if they find the right coordinates to stand in another world.

Elasticsearch does not indicate retryability when flood stage is exceeded   Today if a node exceeds the disk flood stage watermark, the disk threshold monitor will apply a special read-only index block to any indices that have a shard allocated to the node that exceeded the watermark.This block carries with it a forbidden status code so that if an attempt is made to index into such an index, the client receives a HTTP 403 status code.This situation is retryable though, as once the disk threshold monitor observes the free disk space go above the appropriate threshold, the index block is automatically removed.While 429 is often translated as "too many requests", the [HTTP specification is liberal](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4)By making this change, all of our clients can start retrying when faced with an index that was marked read-only due to a flood stage watermark exceeded event.

writeVLong` used in `SearchStats$Stats.writeTo` to throw `java.lang.This breaks the monitoring endpoints on data nodes.Expected behavior is, of course, not to break.Time counters could be implemented as `double`, with the overhead of floating point arithmetic, and then just losing precision when the value becomes bigger.so you'd just lose that value for monitoring.I also doubt that millisecond precision is useful here, but changing it to seconds would only defer the problem.

I previously included this as a comment on a related issue which is now closedFrom: https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-android/issues/287 If you start streaming the screen in one orientation then change, the stream dimensions remain the size of the original and you end up with a tiny display on the receiving device.so I believe the issue is on the sending side, on Android.I was wondering if the issue is because I'm running the ScreenCapturer from a foreground service and perhaps rotation events aren't being recognised.

I ran into an issue when using the ZLEMAIndicator, or more generally any class extending RecursiveCachedIndicator`  If the Indicator is used with a TimeSeries that has maximum tick count setSome sample test code to demonstrate the issue:      @Test     public voidif (index + 1 < timeFrame) {             // Starting point of the ZLEMA             return new SMAIndicator(indicator, timeFrame).getValue(index);         }ONE.minus(k).multipliedBy(zlemaPrev));     }  Generally this affects any Indicator that performs comparisons with the index.it might be good to make sure `getTimeSeries()` doesn't return null in the actual implementationbut hopefully this example demonstrates what I'm talking about.

Issues routing with priority   #### Issue type:  _Only keep the issue types that are applicable.____ #### Short description / Steps to reproduce: I have an item network with the following:  - Chest (A) with an item exporter (priority 1) that has a variable card duped from the interface reader on the same chest (ie, if an item is in this chest another item of the same type should route here) - Chest (B) with an item exporter (priority -10)that has an export predicate for modded items  Changing the relative priorities of Chest B and Chest A doesn't fix the issue.#### Expected behaviour: I would expect that when I import items into the system that have an identical item in chest A, that they would route to chest A I would expect that when I import items into the system    #### Actual behaviour: When I put a modded item (say a blue slimeball from TiC) in chest 1 and import more of the same, sometimes they end up in chest BWhen I put a vanilla item in chest 1 and import more of the same, sometimes they end up chest C

Video streaming stops after minutes of playback   ### Actual behavior  Videos stop playing after around 4 minutes of streming with the internal player.I'm experiencing this bug on 2 devices with the same Lineage version: a ZTE Axon 7 and a Xperia Tablet Z WiFi.The logs I attached are from playing an 840MB MP4 file on the Axon 7, but the original problem was playing a 1.2GB MKV file on the Xperia Tablet, which lead me to try with different files, all encoded in (according to VLC)`H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)` with `MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)` at 48Khz and 32bits, but varying the resolution and size, in both the internal player and the one bundled with android, with no success.However, VLC seems to work just fine, and also, I successfully streamed many other smaller videos, which, besides being around 70MB only, they were only different in audio sampling:Regarding the logcat, I just removed what seemed like sensitive info in line 256, but besides that, I wasn't really sure what part of the logcat could be important, so I dumped every log line during the whole 3 minutes of playback to the attached file...but it seemed like the best option.

FreeFileSync fails to delete files in Dokany-mounted vault   ### Description  FreeFileSync can't delete files, but it works from Explorer/CLI.And yet the problem started appearing with a new Cryptomator version.`1.4.15` can reproduce the problem,though the problem reproduces even with Dropbox turned off)FFS attempts to remove the lock file, but this does not happen.There is also no error message, perhaps because FreeFileSync just ignores this error.If* you now click "Synchronize" (I suggest you don't and instead skip step 4 here), then FFS will attempt to lock the directory again.But it appears to be locked still (the lock file still exists from the comparing).So FFS will lock on a different file (`Del.sync.ffs_lock`) to atomatically delete the original lock file.After a timeout of about a second, it realizes that the original isn't going to be deleted, so it attempts to remove `Del.sync.ffs_lock` with a recursive call to the same function.But removing that isn't possible either, so it creates `Del.Del.sync.ffs_lock` and so on.Soon the file names become long enough to make deletion fail (another Cryptomator/Dokany bug), so you'll never get rid of those files again.This arguably isn't the smartest behavior of FFS, but it only fails badly because of two combined Cryptomator bugs (deletion fails from FFS, and even manual deletion fails for long file names).I digress, the main point is that the `sync.ffs_lock` file wasn't deletedIf you want to continue using FFS "normally", you need to help it by deleting the lock file manually.from right to left, i.e. to delete it in the vault.When the sync is done, FFS will neither have deleted its lock file (like above) nor the file you created in step (1.).This time, you will additionally see it fail to move the temp database file to main database file because it failed to delete the latter previously.Whatever kinds of files FFS tries to deletethe deletion just silently failsThe files are deleted just like they were with Cryptomator `1.4.11`.No matter if Dropbox is running or not, no matter the FreeFileSync version, on both my laptop and my desktop machine.Besides the widespread error swallowing, this looks like quite a normal way to delete a file.And yet `rm` or `unlink` executed under MinGW cannot reproduce the problem, and also `del` from the Windows command line or Windows Explorer succeed in deleting files if their names are reasonably short.

Hi, If I set manually the key serializer I want to use, It seems that I have to set a comparator as well.If I forget to do it, I get a NPE.I think it would make sens to have some kind of default comparator for each key serializer or at least a helper function to set the comprators because I cannot find the one for INT_ARRAY for example.

It is not fully deterministic, but I was able to produce at least one affected cache with every try with the following recipe: - Start c:geo, open live-map, switch off 'live' - move to a region where no caches are stored, select a zoom level so that you expect >~20 caches in the view - switch on 'live', wait for the caches to be displayed - select 'store offline' to a new list - when the download is finished, the caches are still displayed as unreliable (I would have expected an update here) - directly start opening caches and checking the log page for missing statisticsI assume some sort of timing, but couldn't find any clues to that in the log

Views broken with concurrent update and delete   Hi guys....But the bug still persists and is quite annoying.Now, we run a conflict resolution script that marks 2-a as deleted (3-c) and updates 2-b with the merged data (3-d) -If rev of 3-d > rev of 3-c, everything works fineIf rev of 3-d < rev of 3-c, the object is considered deleted on the client, and disappears from the view   - THIS is the problemAll data looks proper on the server - Also, if we restart the app, the document is still missing from the view (I guess this is not updated again?)- If we wipe the local DB clean, and resync from the server, the document will appear correctly (I guess we trigger different client logic?)- If we pull out the sqllite store from the client (even with a broken state) and look at the revision table, we see both rev 3-c and 3-d marked as current, and 3-c as deleted, which is proper -If we look at the maps_N table for this view, it is empty, the document is not there - Looking at winningRevIDOfDocNumericID (SQLiteStore.java:1971), the query there will calculate the correct winning revision from the data store.Currently we trigger this only on the server, but I doubt it would be much different if the conflict resolution occurred on a client.The main point is that one branch is deleted and the second updated in the same batch.Given that the main use case for Couchbase is the conflict resolution (offline sync), and I figure we are doing a typical form of conflict resolution (update one branch, delete the other), I am quite surprised that this issue hasn't popped up earlier.Currently, two developers have spent an entire week on the client and server hunting this issue.And this unreliability is threatening to block the adoption of offline sync by our company, which is annoying, as in theory this software matches our use case perfectly.Please let me know if you need any more help to reproduce this bug.

The drivtrain was being driven around the field for a while, when it touched the metal part of the SkyBridge and there was a nice ESD zap., given I didn't have any USB surge protectors or chokes installed yet, however it's what happenedThe logs indicate the program was running fine for over 2 minutes (notice the difference in timestamps between the first and second lines below), when at `11:33:10.027` the ESD event occurs.There is a lifecycle call to `onStart()` and the Robot Controller restarts the event loop!The robot continued moving in the last direction for several seconds (if I had to guess, it was the 5000ms USB_WAIT while the event loop was restarting).I'm inclined to believe this is NOT a fluke, because I've seen other bizarre issues that involve lifecycle events happening when they shouldn't be, such as [703](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/703) and [702](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app/issues/702).Additionally, although it's possible that it's unrelated, other people have seen strange issues with USB intents / lifecycle as well, for instance [this](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard/issues/11).I'm not entirely sure this is an SDK bug, (it might be a low-level Android API bug), but there's definitely something fishy going on here.

The preview shows a different color each time it is active, but the home screen is completely unaffected and stays black.Since `isPreview` is only set once in setup, this implies that the wallpaper selector restarts the sketch each time the preview is shown.Further inspection with the android studio debugger shows that the number of animation threads of the app increases with each time the wallpaper is selected.## Thoughts on a solution  Restarting the sketch after the wallpaper is selected will not solve this, because this would reset all variables that where affected in preview mode.It may make sense to replace the main animation thread with the one spawned by the wallpaper selector, but I'm not sure about the possibility of this and what nasty side effects it may have.

I like the feature set and performance, but thus far the documentation is very unclear with many things being outdated, dead links, or suggesting things that turn out to be deprecated versions ago.All that said, I'm trying to use the new default value functionality and no matter how I set a default value (SQL through the studio, programmatically via the Graph API, or programatically via TinkerPop), the default value setting does not survive restarting the server.it looks like you just have an in memory test where you create a class with a couple properties with defaults and then drop it, but never test actually persisting the schema change.
In LifecycleAwareSessionManager, the static variable REFRESH_PERIOD_BEFORE_EXPIRY is used to calculate when a token will be renewed.What this means is in the following case, the token would have already expired when the renewal triggers:  1.At this time, the token's lease duration is 60 seconds, but its TTL is 50 seconds (since we waited for 10 seconds before using this token).But since the token's TTL is 50 seconds, it will have already expired.Even if the token is used right away after creation, this case can still happens if the spring application takes more than 5 seconds to start.

Issue Deleting Entities During System Update and Using Listeners in 1.2   Hi,I discovered it while trying to incorporate the new Family option for the Listeners.I started getting NullPointerExceptions when the Entity entered the entityRemoved() method of the Listener.I later determined that a component was always missing if the Entity was deleted during the update.I am not sure if this is a bug - but it does appear to be inconsistentthe component is present when deleted outside of the System update.position component detected while removing position component detected while removing position component detected while removing position component detected while removing position component detected while removing position component detected while removing position component detected while removing  Thanks,  Dana
The "addressFactory" / localAddress code in Player.java (currently on lines 114 - 117) fails on certain servers.I would love to see a setting available in the simpleserver config to bypass this issue.Have not discovered why this happens, but it is a bad bug.It appears to create an infinite loop, possibly due to multiple IP addresses and domains on a single VPS, or virtual port assignments, while it needlessly cycles.To clarify,  The existing code fails / starts a loop on some servers:

TLC can parse this file, although it takes some time.I increased the heap size to nearly the size of my physical RAM with `-Xmx60g`.That didn't prevent the crash, it only delayed it.
This is working fine, but the last modified timestamp is two hours in the future and the last indexed date is also moved 2 hours in the future.If I look at my fileserver, i found that the file was last modified on 11:55.

But using it in a Popup-Dialog the check symbol in the dropdown for selected items is missing.selectedItems.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(", "));     Notification.show("Items value: " + value); } }  Something by using your component in a pop-up dialog will cause this error.

AssertLinesMatch#matches has a bug that will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown after evaluating a FastForward match if there are more expected lines after the FastForward match then remain in the actual results.This only manifests itself if the expected list size is equal to or larger than the actual list size.The reason this fails is because after matching the fast forward region, the actual list is now empty but AssertLinesMatch doesn't check for that condition and sends the (null) value from the actualDeque.peek call to AssertLineMatch#matches.A pull request with this issue number as the branch name will be submitted that contains the change to AssertLineMatch#matches and a test method added to AssertLineMatchAssertionsTest to illustrate the bug is fixed.

Syncany fails to do integrity check/error recovery.When you cut off (kill -9 java process/power failure/crash)a "sy up"  of a new large size directory while uploading chunks to dropbox, and restart you get an error.To my opinion we need 'sy checkIntegrity' to check files vs local cache vs remote data, and 'sy recover' to fix errors.If this flag is not set, it should run a checkIntegrity/recover first.then it should remove the flag, execute the up/down sync and the set the flag to true when exited.

Write Transaction Interfering with Reads   ### SummaryWe started seeing an issue in our applications where data was sometimes not returned from API calls.While investigating, it appeared to be an issue where write transactions happening in one application that destroys and recreates a node in the database interfere with the read transactions from the APIs.This seems to violate the expectation that the write transaction should be self-contained and not affect the read of the same node.We then continually run a write transaction that first deletes the node and then recreates the node with a configurable delay in between those two steps (however, the same transaction is still used in both steps).` - runs in read mode with a constant read of the same node and reports when the node is either found or not found.These two commands should be run at the same time in two different terminals (better to kick off the write first, but should be very little delay between starting the read).With no or very little delay (<= 10ms), the read intermittently fails to find the node.
However, this logic does not work, as it duplicates the entered characters as I type.For example, if I type "JOHN", it appears as "JJOJOHJOHN"!If I point my browser at the same server it works ok -
Keyboard shortcuts stop working when one clicks inside a dataset   ### System details      RStudio Edition :When a data frame is viewed using the View() function (or the F2 shortcut), if one clicks inside it (i.e., clicks on any cell, for example, to copy its content), then all the keyboard shortcuts including the default and customized ones will stop working.This will be fixed if one clicks on the header of the active document (in this case a view of a data frame) or any other document.

When the response to a request contains a large amount of data, a deadlock occurs.If their internal buffer is full, writing to the output stream is blocked until another thread reads from the input stream.The LiteServlet and Router classes however use them on the same thread which causes a deadlock if the response data is large enough to fill the buffer.
If so, paste below.
In total I currently have 7 items but only the two items explicitly stated in Items section of the persist file are persisted.So the lines "default = everyChange" and "* : strategy = everyChange" are not doing anything, although these should be placeholder for all not specifically configured items.I did not test other persistency add-ons.## Context For the current count of items this is only disturbing, but when integrating other parts of my home the count of items will increase to several dozen (potentially several hundred) items / measurement points, making manual configuration time consuming and prone to errors.

Not sure of the specific conditions for this, but is seems to happen when the chunk is unloaded, or no player is around(it is chunk-loaded with a CC loader -- but those unload when player logs out)The capacitor bank stops accepting (but still transmits) power from a bank of EIO solar panels, and also two transceivers.Breaking the inputs/outputs doesn't get it to accept power again.Only way to fix so far is to break one block in the capacitor bank and put it back.
Client engine is not protected from several property change events when only one property is modifiedTechnically I don't see a problem from the client side point of view when modification of only one property fires several events (that other properties are also changed).If it happens and we update the property whose change event is fired (as a result of another property change) in the same request then the current client side property value wins: we will have old value and not the sent from the server.But I don't know whether it's feasible at all.`true` should be provided when this method is called from the message processing of server RPC requests.`false` if it's called from the client side.In the end of RPC message processing the value for all updated `MapProperty` instances should be set to `false` (though I don't know whether the property updates still happens when message processing is in progress).In this way all client side changes will be just ignored if the server side updates are not yet applied.

*Describe the bug* Food items that are old enough, when used to produce a quicker-spoiling product, may produce an already-spoiled product even though none of the inputs are spoiled.If the corn is old enough (it need not be spoiled;) when you try to make dough out of it, the dough to be output will be greenIt makes sense that flour which is nearer to being spoiled will produce dough that will spoil even sooner, but it doesn't make sense that unspoiled flour would ever produce spoiled dough.- No mods that affect this were added.

### Steps to reproduce the problem  Create a new `.Rmd` file with this content:### Describe the problem in detail` so the figure looks good when I run the chunk in RStudio.It turns out my time is wasted because the rendered output does not use the same figure size as the figured in RStudio (see screenshot below).If so, notice that the user must ignore the output as shown in RStudio while tweaking chunk options, since they will never share RStudio output with others and it is not representative of the knitted output.
The same happens if you go to page 2 of the filtered thread, and so on** because the rest of the thread's post entries are still in the database, when the thread view comes to display a filtered page, it requests the posts in that page's range - if those posts weren't all overwritten with the filtered ones, the rest will be the original posts for that page, probably by other people  You can test all this by taking a large thread (preferably with an unread count visible), filtering on a user's posts, and then looking back at the thread list - the page and unread counts will have changed, and the last page will probably have other people's posts at the end.You have to view the 'full' thread again to fix it - and if you don't do the 'hit the back button' thing, the unread count will be messed up.I'm trying to change the way the read/unread counts are calculated, but the rest is too strongly tied into the database structure

CryptoException thrown when attempting to begin playback from middle of videoI am experiencing an issue in my application when attempting to begin playback from somewhere other than the beginning of a video asset.When `seekTo` is called before the first frame of video is visible, the player sometimes throws the following exception:    Steps to reproduce: - Build ExoPlayer Demo app at r1.5.6 tag - Launch app and play "WV: Secure SD & HD (MP4,H264)"- Seek somewhere in the middle of the video - Allow video to play for a few seconds - Without pausing, press device Home button - Tap Recent Apps button and tap the player activity- Before a single video frame is visible, immediately tap twice quickly near the bottom of the screen where the SeekBar is: once to show the SeekBar and once to seek somewhere in the middle  Expected outcome: Video continues to play Actual outcome: Video fails to play and Retry button appears in player chrome.Exception is thrown in log.Fails on these devices: - AT&T Moto X 2nd Gen (5.1/LPE23.32-21.9) - Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (5.1.1/LMY47X) - Samsung Galaxy S6 Active (5.0.2/LRX22G.G890AUCU2AOF3) - LG G4 (6.0/MRA58K)- Rebooting the device seems to stop the issue for a few hours.Not sure if attempting to play many videos causes the issue.- Even when `codecNeedsFlushWorkaround` is changed to always return `true` so that the workaround referenced in https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/603 is used for all devices, the error occurs.- I have never been able to reproduce the issue using the unprotected version of the video.

The world where I want players to be dragged to spawn when they log out is called "PVP-EVENT" The fact that this name contains a "-" makes me think it may be interpreting "PVP" as one world, and "EVENT" as another, therefore messing up the whole configuration.But this could still be a bug.1.8.8  ---  Original Bukkit Ticket (Outdated but commented on):  http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/authme-reloaded/tickets/957-forcing-spawn-on-login-in-specific-world/
HttpServer continues processing requests after closing httpconnectionIt looks like httpserver will continue processing requests after closing httpconnection in #2542We closes the connection in connectionHandler when a new connection happens above the limit.But the requestHandler will continue processing.So for the client side, it won't get any response because of the closed connection but the httpServer has already handled the request, which is out of our expectations.

, we have found a common issue: Pravega performs much worse and exhibits higher instability when _clients write as fast as possible (unthrottled)- When the client is throttled to 30MBps, the system is stable and the ingest rate of Pravega (`Segment Store Write Throughput`) and the writes to Tier 2 are balanced.However, at the same time, the write rate to Tier 2 drops dramatically up to 10MBps.One possibility is that, when unthrottled clients write data to the Segment Store, Tier 1 components consume most of the resources (e.g., CPU) and make the Storage Writer to starve, thus reducing the throughput of writes to Tier 2 (i.e., throttling clients may give opportunities to the Storage Writer to get sufficient resources to keep balance).

It would be a mistake that when I change to a monster, I go and when I turn, I always go back to that place.
Given a `_test.go` file containing a single build tag (e.g., `integration` to separate unit tests from integration tests), when any action is performed that creates a new "Go Test" run/debug configuration (for individual test or entire file), then that run/debug configuration should specify the build tag.With the current behavior, if I'm within a test file and I use ctrl+shift+r to run a test or all tests within the file, the build tag is not applied, and the run/debug config that is automatically created does not run any tests.In these cases, if it's clear that there's only a single combination of tags that would permit the test(s) to execute, those tags should be applied.If the build tags can't be resolved to a single valid combination, the current behavior should apply, and the run/debug configuration should be created, and the user can manually specify the tags.

It seem that the new contextId generation logic introduced in [spring-boot#11023](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11023) broke the [ServiceMatcher's](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus/blob/e57a4047959671b513d345344b2729a96f92a473/spring-cloud-bus/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/bus/ServiceMatcher.java#L36) check for own local events.However the `originService` gets the `-1` suffix, hence the mismatch.`  This results in local `RemoteApplicationEvents` being ignored [in the listener](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-bus/blob/509a216258cdd071c592bc921b83e979d3f0944d/spring-cloud-bus/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/bus/BusAutoConfiguration.java#L119).Here is a minimal config server/client sample project demonstrating the issue:Let me know if you need any more input.

It will be very convenient to use debug forms if they can be prepopulated with sane request objects, similar to what's done with Swagger annotations.If possible, would love to have a way that uses normal Java objects instead of annotations - swagger-style JSON strings are really hard to maintain.Not type safe unfortunately, but I personally would still prefer a map from method name to default value object.
(Many bugs are fixed in newer releases and upgrading will often resolve the issue)(Please include the content causing the issue, any relevant configuration settings, the SQL statement that failed (if relevant) and the command you ran.)We're using `drop` + `create` instead of `create or replace` since PostgreSQL doesn't allow reducing number/changing type of view columns via `create or replace`.Finally, we have configured our data source not to use auto-commit, and all non-transactional changes are lost once connection is closed (which happens in `finally` block near the end of `Flyway.execute()`, when `Database` object is closed).In our case, migrations for schema `A` were checked first (no migration needed, but search path transactionally set to start with `A` and not restored properly).At this point, `drop view` in migration script intended for `B` dropped the view from `A` (since the view has not yet been created in `B`).I've checked current state of related code here on GitHub, and although it is refactored quite a bit, the problem seems to still be there

Blank Notification in Phone's Notification List   For v3.3.6, backing out of a screen when a price fetch is still running leaves a blank notification in the drop down list, as long as MTGFamiliar is closed.The only ways to get rid of the notification that I know of are to toggle the app's 'Block Notifications' setting, which is only temporary, or to Force Stop the app, which gets rid of it until the above event happens again.Was going to see if the new version still had the same problem, but seeing as the split card and accented card name issue has been fixed, I was unable to reproduce the bug since the prices appear too quickly (in the emulator, haven't tried on my phone).However, since you fixed the problem that made this bug fairly easy to encounter, this could be a low priority issue.  !

Broken editing in grid modeHi,  Since updating to 3.7.5 I've been having a range of issues with editing, including: - when viewing a single record trying to set any column to `NULL` with the contextual menu sets the first column to `NULL`, - sometimes after editing a cell in the grid mode (not opening the dialog or the F7 editor) and pressing enter, the cell will stop being edited and a orange background will show, but very quickly the editing "pops back up" like I had just pressed enter on the cell or started typing, which makes moving through cells using the arrow keys really difficult, - sometimes `Ctrl-S` will not work to save result sets after setting some cells to `NULL` using `Ctrl-X`, clicking the green tick works fine though.

In `FilterPanel`, when assigning an ID to its components like filter text field and close button, the ID is set based on the panel index when created.e.g.1 create a panel to the right and then delete the first one, resulting in 2 filter text fields with the ID #dummy/dummy_col1_filterTextField.This isn't a big problem for normal usage, but could affect future tests when more extensive panel testing is added.

git_repository rule should error if a commit attribute is fed a non-sha   I don't think it should be legal to be able to do this - https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala/pull/100/files    and for bazel to allow it without either - throwing an error about the value of `commit` not being a valid sha - warning the user that the value of `commit` was resolved to a particular commit from that tag (in this case `0.3.1`) within the remote - but the user should consider using the `tag` attribute instead- I don't really like this, since if values can be arbitrary input, they could be branches, in which case those are mutable, and guarantees of the revision from the repository evaporate.

When attempting to start a brand new installation of payara-5.192 on MacOS, the asadmin start-domain command takes a long time to complete.When attempting to run arquillian tests with payara-embedded-all, deployment seems to never occur.This seems to only happen on native MacOS and not within linux VMs or docker containers, but the real problem is that it's affecting integration tests using arquillian and payara-embedded-all which are developed locally in MacOS environments.There are probably workarounds to configuring hazelcast network discovery or something within the domain, but what is really needed would be a way to get the workaround for payara-embedded-all so that integration tests work again.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but I can’t seem to find much help on the subject.We’ve noticed that when we put a space into the parameter then the API Gateway returns an Internal Server Error immediately.If I run the API from the AWS Console test facility and replace the space with %20 then it works.but if I test the API from Postman, then with the space or the %20At first we assumed it was the gateway returning the error straight away, but it looks like it might be the way the Lambda is handling the space in the param.From reading some stuff online, for a non Proxy API the suggestion is to use a message template on the parameters and use the $util.urlEncode(), but I can’t see how to apply this with a proxy.

Hibernate's @Version annotation to enable Optimistic Locking is ignored*Describe the bugAn `OptimisticLockException` should be thrown to avoid possible data override when two users try to update the same entity at the same time.When using Hibernate's `@Version` annotation to enable Optimistic Locking, if two users change the same Entity at the same time, no `OptimisticLockException` is thrown.To make it easy to reproduce the issue, a repository was created [here](https://github.com/manoelcampos/hibernate-concurrency).It provides two minimal applications to show the issue.

But this plugin seems to have the same or similar problems.The same errors were reported here some times in the past but never got a response.a Cordova app can have - finally being paid for the hard work of creating an app via the IAB plugin - can still contain so serious bugs which were completely ignored.Anyway, for me it is essential to fix this issue.I hope I do not touch any board rules here asking for a programmer..I cannot test it out on my own device.I never catch an error.Here are some of the catched errors from my Google developer account:

When initialising the web UI -- such as as the entrypoint URL, or pasting in/bookmarking a workspace URL -- there are a number of errors which can occur which prevent the system starting up in the browser.For example failing to connect to the websocket.Even when, for example, the websocket has failed to connect 100 times the message that che is giving up is only displayed in the console.Whilst as a developer I'm quite familiar with the console I shouldn't need to have it open to tell if the application is going to start!### Reproduction Steps  Any way that you can trigger a failure on startup.One way is to try and start che 6 in multiuser and single entry point mode under docker, but it applies whenever there is some form of problem initialising the web UI.

Upon automatic re-connect after a connection outage, a failure to automatically log back in does not update mLoggedInUserId and the Meteor class will therefore still think you are logged in   To replicate this issue, log in to the same user account with two different devices (one being an Android device using Android-DDP).Configure your logout to use the Meteor.logoutOtherClients() method which will log out all devices for a certain account when one of the devices logs out.When the Android device gets logged out, its DDP connection is lost and the Android-DDP library gracefully re-establishes the connection.However, the login token is no longer valid and Android-DDP can't automatically log the Android device back in.In this circumstance, the mLoggedInUserId field is not cleared and the Meteor class will still return true when isLoggedIn() is called.

When hosting a game with another client, the event gets replicated to the remote client and also triggeres the hosting player, opening up the renaming dialog on the host, each time a player connects.Switching the event filter on the client to `REMOTE_CLIENT` does not work because this will remove the renaming feature from the hosting player.A simple fix would be to skip the local event if the event has been network replicated and was an `@OwnerEvent` but before submitting a PR some feedback for this behavior would be niceThere is also a similar problem when a client sends an `@ServerEvent`, the event will trigger on the client too.However this is less likely to cause an issue as the serverside event-handlers are registered as authority most of the time.Simple check to reproduce/test the issue: Checkout the module, host the game with one player

Elasticsearch fails to start with error: "Failed to find metadata for index" on every restartAfter upgrade to v7, we have noticed a lot of times our nodes refuse to start with an error `nested: IOException[failed to find metadata for existing index XXX`.The first time I encountered this error, I searched the discuss board and found [this](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/failed-to-find-metadata-for-existing-index-after-node-restart/191507)which talks of stronger startup checks enforced by ES-7.x and points to data directory getting corrupted due to external factors.Thinking it may be the same probloem, I duly took the node offline and ran a disk check which reported no errors.So I deleted the data directory, started the node and that was that.However, the next time I did a rolling upgrade of my cluster, a different node failed with a similar errorI followed the same emergency procedure (delete data directory and restart node) and cluster was fixed.The error occurs only on restart (never while elasticsearch is running).Upon restart 4 out of 5 modes failed to start with same errors.On all 4 nodes, the names of indexes was different (The indexes in question were "closed").I had no option but to delete all data on those 4 nodes (Thus losing about 80% of elasticsearch data).

The final consumer consumes the messages with a rate of 250 message per second.But actually after the first ~880 messages, there appear regular DROPs!To illustrate the problem, I created a small unit-test (see https://gist.github.com/mlex/a7349216f32c4f94acc0c9d7c10d6321 for the full test):   ## Possible explanationIt then waits for the ringbuffer to consume `bufferSize*3/4` (in our case 96) messages and then requests another `bufferSize*3/4` messages.;` (see [RingBuffer.java:868](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/0d459836c9b3621846bedc48a3b839e465167726/src/main/java/reactor/core/queue/RingBuffer.java#L868)) that should wait for the next `limit`(=96) elements to be processed, is not triggered after exactly 96 elements.In the case of bursty producer, the `cachedAvailableSequence` does not increase constantly, but makes jumps (the size of the jumps being the burstSize).So we actually "loose" 4 slots ("loose", because they will never be filled again - even if the producer starts producing at a much faster rate).After 800 elements, we have already lost 8*4 = 32 slots.This means, that the next `Subscription.request()` is only triggered when the number of pending requests equals zero - in which case we start dropping messages.

Che tries to pull local images (and fails)When configuring a custom stack that uses an 'image' Che tries to pull the image.This fails if the image is purely local.In the default configuration, with `CHE_DOCKER_ALWAYS__PULL__IMAGE` set to `true`, che tries to pull the latest version, which obviously fails.If the image is not marked as coming from an upstream repository then it should not be pulled (or at least the failure to pull the image should not be considered a hard failure in this case.)The workaround is obviously to restart che with `CHE_DOCKER_ALWAYS__PULL__IMAGE` set to `false`, but as noted this has potential currency issues for other images.

Custom variable blinking/flickering at random in tablistIn tab list, the result is that the AFK tag repeatedly disappears and reappears at a constant but random interval.Reloading BTLP changes this interval, if the reload is timed correctly then at luck it works and is shown all the time.For debug purposes, I added the original tag to see if the players status was constantly changing but no, the value "true" repeatedly appears and disappears.Changing the tablistUpdateInterval from 0.5 to 1 seems to make a bit more stable but it is still blinking, just with a lower interval.

I found that re-enabling a previously paused stream doesn't reliably re-enable the associated alert.- Modify the alert conditions if necessary to fulfil the condition  ## Expected Behavior - Alert fires## Current Behavior - Alert does not fire (or in one case, fired half an hour later, even though the condition was set for a time period of 5 minutes)  ## Context That's dangerous behaviour:We might think we have re-enabled a certain stream, but an alert would never fire off.The workaround of creating the alert from scratch is inconvenient and time-consuming, esp on the less than ideal UI that GL2 has introduced for the whole stream/alert/notification setup.

Hi,  for some time now we've been having problems using the preview for our QA versions.the server limits the request rate to 10 requests per second, but our 5 requests get transformed into 15 requests, so they all fail.That is very frustrating, especially when we have to test the content and localization before it's published.I tried implementing exponential back-off but that doesn't solve anything, since all of the calls fetching the content fail (the five final calls after the 10 content checking calls) so they would all get repeated at the same time and would fail again.

The string input to `getMimeType` is treated as a relative path, which fails the security check.Prefixing non-absolute paths with `"/tmp/"` allows the content type to be correctly probed, although the file does not exist at that path.Issue #158 resolves a similar problem with the rest container mappings by disabling extension-based mime type detection and avoiding this call completely, but static resources are requested by a different route and not affected by the fix in that issue.

Issue with SocketChannelUDT blocking/non blocking sync with backing SocketUDTI think I have found an issue with synchronization of the blocking state between the SocketChannelUDT and the underlying SocketUDT state.By default a SelectableChannel is configured to be in the blocking state.From the docs it states  'Newly-created selectable channels are always in blocking mode.Non-blocking mode is most useful in conjunction with selector-based multiplexing.A channel must be placed into non-blocking mode before being registered with a selector, and may not be returned to blocking mode until it has been deregistered.'So when the SocketChannelUDT is constructed, it makes a call to isBlocking and stores a volatile copy of the result.This also means you cannot change the blocking mode to true without first switching to false since the AbstractSelectableChannel's default behavior is not to even call implConfigureBlocking if it thinks the channel state is the same as what is being requested.If so, I think it should be a simple matter of switching the SocketUDT inside the SocketChannelUDT to blocking initially so that they are in sync, then configureBlocking on the channel to true will work as normal.

When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application (server A) receives input from a remote client, and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B to use the wrong value for a part it expects.This could to lead privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a username or user roles.When static resources are served from a file system on Windows (as opposed to the classpath, or the ServletContext), a malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.4.3.14 Spring Security (Spring Security 4.1.x before 4.1.5, 4.2.x before 4.2.4, and 5.0.x before 5.0.1; and Spring Framework 4.3.x before 4.3.14 and 5.0.x before 5.0.3) does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints.By adding a URL path parameter with special encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint.In this particular attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.Both are not enabled by default in Spring Framework nor Spring Boot, however, when MappingJackson2JsonView is configured in an application, JSONP support is automatically ready to use through the "jsonp" and "callback" JSONP parameters, enabling cross-domain requests.If an application has a pre-existing XSS vulnerability, a malicious user (or attacker) can use this filter to escalate to an XST (Cross Site Tracing) attack.

For some queries, the base64-string sent by vitrivr-ng is cut at ca.6k string length when it arrives at cineast., jetty closes it with a 1006 error (which is not helpful at all).I have not managed to triangulate the issue, none of the available config-parameters from jetty fix the problem and it also does not seem to be a problem on the vitrivr-ng side.This is certainly an issue for novices, as we have neither automatic reconnect nor is it intuitive if a query is not executed.This would reduce the length of the base64-string without a massive reduction in the quality of sketch input and would be very low implementation effort.

I'm using Openllet to get a Protege-like inference experience within Apache Jena Fuseki, but I experience some problems after the repository in which inference is enabled is modified.the triples from which new triples are derived, the derived triples remain in the repository (i.e. they come up in SPARQL queries).I'm not sure yet, whether adding (SPARQL: CONSTRUCT)triples also gives problems.I would say the ideal situation would be the distinction between stated and derived triples remains and after each modification the inference engine should update the inferred triples (like Sychronize in Protege).

We have an use case when basically we need to start a Job immediately - `startNow() `- (based on a button click).If an error occur (e.g. failed to sync), another job must be schedule to run every 30min - `setPeriodic()` -.When our data is successfully sync, this job can be canceled.What have we tried to do:  1 - We create a simple job using `startNow()` 2 - If an error occur in this job, we schedule a new periodic job (with the same `TAG`).The periodic job is only scheduled if the job that receives the error when syncing data is the one created using  `startNow()`  3 - If an error occur when a periodic job is running, we just ignore and return `Result.Because that job is already automatically rescheduled by the library 4 - If the periodic job finishes correctly, we cancel all Jobs with the same tag (`cancelAllJobsForTag()`)Our problem is that when we cancel a Periodic Job (e.g. when successfully sync data), it strangely does not get cancelled and is rescheduled indefinitely (runs every 30min).

VisTextArea throws java.lang.This exception can be thrown by the `VisTextArea`:  > Exception in thread "LWJGL Application" java.lang.The first time when it occurred, area contained text with Polish characters, so I assumed this was the source of error.EDIT: after I removed the last `\n`, the error still occurred when I appended stack trace to the text area.However, the exception occurrence seems highly dependent on the input: when I slightly modified the way stack trace is appended (basically added `- at` prefix before each line), the error was no longer thrown.

In all versions of Elasticsearch where I've checked the source code, there's a bug in the error message for when a shard can't recover from the primary because the number of docs differ.It lists numDocsTarget as the doc count for the source node, and numDocsSource as the doc count for the target node, but it should be the other way around.Since the only way I've found to fix these problems is to remove the shard that we've deemed to be wrong, this can be really dangerous and cause removal of the wrong shard.if (numDocsTarget != numDocsSource) { >     throw new IllegalStateException("try to recover "request.shardId() + " from primary shard with sync id but number of docs differ: "

Unfortunately, in one of the apps I wrote using [akka](https://akka.io/), I'm hitting an issue where a benchmark I'm running will freeze and the program will stop functioning, and this issue is related to OpenJ9 as it disappears on Zulu9, but appears within 2-5 iterations on OpenJ9.I'm trying to nail down what exactly is going on here, but I don't know how to write a minimized test-case for you guys that you can reproduce.makes the issue disappear, though I'm not sure if this is because the bench is slower and less demanding on OpenJ9, or if it's because of an issue with the jit compiler.I'll retest this on a slower connection and see if openj9 works still...

shall we say less than explicit about what is to blame for the exception that was thrown.Which has had me running around for the last two days pulling mods until it finally stopped happening, which lead me to Matter Overdrive.This particular crash occurred with a frequency between ten and thirty minutes after a player would log in, subsequent attempts to log in would either yield the error again or repeat the pattern (a short time of gameplay and then the crash again), more frustrating still, it's a client side crash, taking them out to the launcher but leaving the server running, and it does not seem to effect all players equally(some players wouldn't crash more than once or twice, others nearly constantly).After removing the Matter Overdrive mod the crashes stopped, and things ran smoothly for a test period of two hours, after which the mod was added back in and allowed to gen a new config file (just in case of a corrupted one).Now, this is obviously not conclusive proof, but it is I feel suggestive, and unfortunately the biggest (and in fact only) lead we have, so I thought I'd post it here, and let you see if it rings any bells, I'm going to go turn, I'll let you know if that fixes anything.

-- I'm not positive that this is specific to `yidun` or not, however it was contained in the example application (`d03545df8d7a82e5dfd6c9baf4a8a22e437e74bc`).The smali code which hits an error is as follows;Seems odd and while it is valid smali - it is essentially a junk operation that would not be used by the application.I'd expect this to be just simplified out - however, simplify is choking on this.Feel free to assign this to me, I can dig into it later, just creating this issueso I won't forget and can dig into it later.
Parsing issue with JSmin processorThe JSmin processor fails to process the CKeditor JS files.It appears as though this has been a longstanding issue, unlikely to go away:    https://www.google.com/webhp#q=ckeditor%20jsminWhen a processor fails, log a warning, and continue with the unprocessed file.If minification cannot be done, it's probably better to serve the uncompressed file than it is to throw a non-recoverable exception.Allowing the opportunity to skip processing (or certain processing) in the JSON definition.This would also allow for already compressed files to be skipped by the processor.This would also save expected exceptions from (a).
` hanging on IEI cannot share the test that is failing since the system I'm testing is proprietary.Both `clickAndWait` and `click` are hanging when testing on IE (tried IE8 on WinXP and IE9 on Win7).They perform the click action properly, the page loads, but the commands do not succeed.They even do not timeout, they just hang indefinitely.The page that is being loaded has some Flash object in there, I don't know if that might be the problem.

If I scan the entire project folder, and do element.getSuperclass().getQualifiedName(), where element is the CtClass corresponding to TransporteurFragment, it returns the correct QualifiedNameHowever, if I scan only the TransporteurFragment file, it returns "CompletableFragment".At first I though it was not a bug and only a consequence of scanning a single file, but then I though about the imports that indicates where the used classes are from, and the fact that it works for other files ...but I don't know why, it works ...I have however detected that if CompletableFragment is in a different package than TransporteurFragment, even when scanning only TransporteurFragment.java, it returns the correct QualifiedName, which let me think that maybe there is a real issue, I can share you the files that cause me problems !

When I combine [executing command on a table](http://concordion.org/instrumenting/java/markdown/#execute-command-on-a-table) with ["before" examples](http://concordion.org/instrumenting/java/markdown/#before-examples), only the last row of the table gets executed for the second example.BTW, I clear the DB before each test.So, when the first example is being executed, the "before" example adds 5 rows to a database table by looping through the specification table and calling a command that creates a user in the DB.But when the second example is being executed, the "before" example adds only 1 row to a database table because the pointer seems to be stuck on the last row of the specification table.
Heres how it works, run really far away from either a sethome or spawn, about 5k blocks will do it, then find a mob, and type in the command to /spawn, right before you teleport, shoot at the mob, if you teleport on time, the distance between you and the target hit will be about 5k blocks granting MASSIVE xp gains instantly granting max xp level.
Whenever a player dies, regardless of their spawn point the player returns to the spot they died at.

Conditional flow fails with collections in API Provider   ##Regression (a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release)## Description Conditional flows cannot be used with collections in Syndesis, but API Provider makes a collection around its request body, even when it is specified in the API specification to contain only one object of specified type.So if I create a condition `${body.completed}` it should work, or at least `${body["completed"]}I tried also splitting it, but split doesn't work well on these types of collections (see #4862).Also I tried `${body[0]["completed"]}` but that also didn't work for some reason.The log reported something along the lines of `cannot call method [0]["completed"] on ArrayList`.

When we run the console program or program using presto-jdbc in JDK 11 environment, it is too slow to complete the execution.While the coordinator does not support HTTP 2 yet, it can be a problem when we access to the coordinator through proxy or load balancer such as ALB supporting HTTP 2.Currently, it is not a huge problem in the usual cases because Presto does not support HTTP 2 yet.But it can prevent Presto from supporting HTTP 2 migration.[The issue in OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/4029) says that we should close the connection pool properly by `okHttpClient.connectionPool().evictAll()` but it's not a solution in the long-running program like presto-cli/presto-jdbc.

NewPipe doesn't properly shut down audio streams when playback is finished/interrupted   - [X][X] I checked if the issue/feature exists in the latest version.- [ ] I did use the [incredible bugreport to markdown converter](https://teamnewpipe.github.io/CrashReportToMarkdown/) to paste bug reports.NewPipe ends up leaving open the streams when it's done using them.On low-RAM devices, this can cause problems if the user starts playing multiple videos.- If nothing is currently playing, and the user starts a new video, NewPipe will open a new stream.This includes having a video/audio stream currently open, but stopped/paused.If there's currently something playing and another of the same type is enqueued, NewPipe will use the existing stream when the new one starts.If there's currently something playing and the user replaces it with another of the same type, a new stream is started.- If audio is playing and the user starts up a video, NewPipe starts a new stream.Same goes for if video is playing and the user starts an audio stream.- At no point does NewPipe actually close a given stream.- This includes when the user manually closes a stream, regardless of whether the stream is still playing or not.The equalizer app can't actually close the streams itself, as they are owned by NewPipe and the system's equalizer abilities only allow for a passthrough adjustment for apps like this, not a complete change of ownership.Using the "X" button in the active streams window only tells the equalizer to stop filtering.This will kill all streams, including currently-playing ones, so if NewPipe is currently playing something and the terminal command is used, the audio will cut out and NewPipe will never be the wiser.However, it will be silent until NewPipe starts a new stream via one of the methods outlined above.The recommended solution is to have NewPipe close out each stream when it's done playing, as well ashave it recycle streams when shutting down currently-playing items in favor of new ones.

However, due to the use of `scheduleWithFixedDelay` for the positional job, which schedules the job starting from the termination of the previous job to the commencement of the next job, there is a small time drift introduced.This drift could be eliminated (or greatly reduced) by the use of `scheduleAtFixedRate` instead of `scheduleWithFixedDelay`.However, as the astro binding performs accurate calculations, it can be argued that the frequency with which those calculations are performed also should be accurate.

pulsar-timer-*" threads increases sporadically over time*Describe the bugpulsar-timer-*" threads increases sporadically over time and ends up consuming many CPU cycles.Each thread uses a few percent of CPU, but the number of threads created ends up with a lot of CPU used despite the system being idle.On startup, we will observe roughly 10 of these threads but when we check again in 12-48 hours, we will often see several pages of these threads.At this point, I have not seen the trigger that leads to the increase in the number of threads, but the issue might be due to network instability.Though I am not sure what caused it, this exception was observed recently when the number of threads increased:If the number of "pulsar-timer-*" threads increases due to load, it should also decrease when demand is reduced.

users cannot start/connect to a workspaceI have an issue where 'regular'(ldap) users cannot start and connect to a workspace.bar but does not complete.If I try the above steps as the Che admin user it works fine.Another interesting thing is if the Che admin starts a workspace and shares it then the 'regular' user can connect to that just fine also!The issue appears to be that the user cannot start and connect to her own workspace.but it only says:   'Starting workspace 'some-test' with id 'workspace....' by user 'someuser'   then (around 7 minutes later):   'Workspace 'some-test' with id 'workspace...' start failed  I also tried setting up a complete new setup on a different server and I get the same results..I looked at the section in the documentation about workspace starting failures but this didnt not help.

Possible NullPointerException when assigning generated keys to objects with custom hashCode## Steps to reproduce  While we request insertBatch, mybatis will throw a 'java.lang.NullPointerException' exception.because in src/main/java/org/apache/ibatis/executor/keygen/Jdbc3KeyGenerator.java line 174,  it uses paramMap.values().stream().distinct().count() == 1 to adjust whether the count of params is 1, but the method distinct() of stream in jdk8 uses hashcode of object to do distinct, when the object overrides hashcode method with the hashcode of id, and the insert operation doesn't have any content in field id, the exception then occrupt.But in mybatis before version 3.4.6(I have ensured), this never happened, because Jdbc3KeyGenerator in mybatis 3.4.6 didn't use distinct() method  to adjust the count of param.Anyway, in most cases, we will use  this logic to insert batch datas ,hope you can fix this bug in the future.

The root span and the first child span really ends at the same time, but still, the child span looks like it completes after the root span: !When looking at the JSON, it looks strange, because they both have the same duration, but the child span has a later timestamp.To me it looks like the bar length is now calculated from the CS/CR interval, but the timestamp itself seems to be when the SR started.

It seems that if there is a null value in resultset Projections.map generate a null pointer exception.
I saw the issue
Old dashboard parsing broken after update to 3.2.2   After update from 3.1.x to 3.2.2 one of our older dashboards broke Dashboards view in UI – it gave 500 errors.We resolved issue temporarily with removing dashboard at all from dashboards and views collections in mongodb.
RedissonClient still points to failed AWS Elasticache Redis node when failover happens   <!### Actual behavior 33 connections still point to previous (failed) primary Redis node, 34 connections point to new primary Redis node.Wait for a while, run step 2 command, out of 67 connections, half of them are pointing to previous primary node, half of them are pointing to new primary node.From AWS Console, if you select previous and new Redis primary nodes, then look at "Current Connections" of CloudWatch metrics, you can get the same result: Redisson client points to both previous and new Redis primary nodes.
but it's not working at all (empty list) on iSeries DB2 AS400
This is a very theoretical case (because generators with a frequency of zero can be omitted at all) but we have to cover it.

Intellij allows me to specify a dot path to a particular folder in my app structure, while `projectName` restricts to only the base package name.The issue I'm having, if you haven't guessed already, is the Java Debugger appears to be searching for classes and settings from `application.yml` via the path `app` which includes classes and settings found in the `test` folder.I'm forced to set `projectName` only to `app` which breaks my application in some respects because it applies unwanted settings automatically from the `test` folder.Also note that I am generally a beginner with respect to some terminology within the Java world, so if some explanations seem off that's why.I'm very keen to solve this issue!

I believe I've encountered a bug.Let me explain the bug and what I've tried to do to troubleshoot it: When I open the app I get this error:/DBeaver.app/Contents/Eclipse/configuration/1539781099771.log" Sadly I can't figure out how to open the log file, I tried going to console in utilities and looking at log files there, but couldn't see anything for DBeaver.When I opened DBeaverI got this error.Wiped all java off my machine after googling the error message a bit.If I recall) 1.I thought it may be a problem with not having installed eclipse yet, so I installed eclipse for javascript (which is what my dev team uses), then realized I should install eclipse for Java since DBeaver is a JAVA app...Seemed odd to me that it would require eclipse but figured I was out of other better options...

I am getting an issue where I can't move items in my inventory if I am close to an Observatory.I can pick up items and move them around my inventory, but after I close my inventory, strange things happen where items or blocks will disappear or duplicate.If I exit the inventory and try to place that oak wood in the world, the oak wood would be replaced with marble (which was previously in slot 1) and marble would be placed instead.If I open my inventory, the oak wood is gone, and there is another stack of marble in my inventory where I moved it.If I break the Observatory and don't place it again, the bug still happens.I can move items in my inventory properly only when I'm interacting with other inventories, like a chest.

Creatures adopt player pitch and roll angle   Because it seems that we broke the issue #95 down to player characters pitch and roll angle in their seat relating to the angles of the plane and you might have to rework this mechanics anywayAs you can see in the pictures below, it seems that not only the player character but all creatures in the world adopt the adjusted pitch and roll angles, which make them float through the air.It's still a bit odd, because they do not tilt in place but rather move like a pendulum on a string.I guess it's also interesting to note, that this does not occur in your latest test build which disables the feature that you gave me in the OpenGL bug report. !

nextcloud dev crashes and won't create user accountThe nextcloud dev app crashes unexpectedly or simply reverts to the initial account creation display  ###At the least provide a normal user some feed back as to why the app is crashing or can't create an android account (even if this isn't the nextcloud app's fault - see below)., I've had with so many flippin problems with this app (note this issue will happen on the non-dev version)This problem has not happened (to me) if the nextcloud account entry on the android device is preserved during an update event.Again apologies if this has already been reported and a fix is forthcoming...also affects fdroid nextcloud dev 20170707, fdroid nexcloud 2.0.0 RC5FWIW, this problem does not happen (I could create an account on the android device)when on my own network and using the ip address of the server without port redirection.but this problem persisted after I removed them and restarted the nextcloud server.The nextcloud app apparently crashes/resets after that./system_de/0/accounts_de.db (pulled from the android device while in recovery) showed no nextcloud accounts; however, four nextcloud accounts entries from prior attempts to troubleshootRemoving the nextcloud entries from the accounts_ce.db file and pushing the modified version back to the device fixes the issue.
I know this is not the most recent version, but I see the same logic is still used on the Master branch.So, the stack above just seems to “hang” in the JVM, resulting in 1 core getting 100% CPU load.By “hanging”I mean literally, hanging all day on that same stack frame.However, the queue is about 1000 elements long, so I wouldn’t consider that “big” in any way.
If you're currently using an older version of RStudio, we would appreciate it if you could update to RStudio v1.2 and confirm whether the problem still persists.If you're having trouble with R itself or an R package, see https://www.r-project.org/help.html, and if you want to ask a question rather than report a bug, go to https://community.rstudio.com/.Finally, if you use RStudio Server Pro, get in touch with our Pro support team at support@rstudio.com.3.6.1  ### Steps to reproduce the problem  1.-- Thank you for taking the time to file an issue!

Current behaviour: With one particular podcast, I have this problem that seeking beyond a certain position does not work correctly.When the podcast starts, I seek to a position beyond 35 minutes (e.g. `00:36:54`).Either the podcast stops as if it was hitting the end of the mp3-file.Or, and this is quite strange, the (visual) seeking succeeds, the new display time is `00:36:54` and continues to increase in every second (`00:36:55`, `00:36:56`, ...), but the audio track is wrong.: I have changed some setting, but can't remember what.I do not use any headphones or other devices with the phone.

LIWC word count (for add folder files) gets stuck at 40%    When attempting to do LIWC word count on three files populated by supreme court crawler (one of which was empty), it only got to 40% completed and then didn't get any further for 15 minutes.Had to force quit the program to stop it.I think it might be an issue where if any of the .txt files don't have text in them, the program doesn't know what to do.

: If pact contains array, SCC generates isEmpty() check which will always fail the testThis might relate to #797 and I checked already with 2.1.1.RELEASE, because I thought this should resolve the issue.But it still persists, so I thought it may have to do with the translation from pact to scc contracts.Problem: When a pact contains an array (of objects, this is what I tested), then SCC generates an isEmpty() check on this array.This does not correspond to the pact and also not the example in the pact.

At the beggining, the player puts a waypoint on the ground (where he hits) : we can see that the NPC goes correctly to that waypoint, even if it does not chose the best course to do so.As you can see the NPC simply does not recognize a correct path to go to the location and heads straight to a wall, where it stays blocked virtually forever.This issue however has major consequences with Sentinel, since it makes NPCs go completely nuts when trying to reach an attacker, as you can see on these videos : https://streamable.com/5m83 https://streamable.com/xgir
This LZF compression-related exception only appeared with the recent releases of MapDB.The Jython application works correctly without LZF compression, but fails with the following cascade of exceptions when LZF compression is used:  self.When a small subset of the data is run with and without compression, the application works correctly.Remarkably, the exception seems to be appearing at almost the identical line number (line number equal to or close to 254994) in all of the the input files I've tested (but doesn't depend on the specific content of this line since I have created multiple randomly selected versions from a much larger input file to test for this).If you would like me to send the application and the input data, please let me know.

Take action to stop the temporary directory being deleted due to lack of use   Since #27609` that deletes files and directories that have not been touched for 10 days:: If you read the man page you might think this _doesn't_ delete old files, as the man page says:  >If omitted or set to "-", no automatic clean-up is done.As a result, if someone does not start an ML job on a particular node that is running on RHEL or CentOS 7 then 10 days after ES startupIf an ML job is run on the node after this then it fails because the temporary directory does not exist.Due to security manager the ES JVM cannot recreate the temporary directory.If we created and removed a file every 22 hours then this would keep the directory modification time within the last day, even for days when daylight saving time starting reduces the day length to 23 hours.However, this problem could also affect 3rd party, so it would be nicer if the functionality to keep the temporary directory alive was in core Elasticsearch.The ML team can implement it if we can get some advice on the best place in the code to put it.

buySubscription does not resolve when changing subscriptions in iOS   ### Version of react-native-iap 2.2.2 ### Platforms you faced the error (IOS or Android or both?)iOS ### Expected behavior buySubscription should resolve when changing from Monthly to Yearly subscription, rather than reject and return an error, forcing the catch clause.### Actual behavior If currently subscribed to one plan, changing to another causes buySubscription to catch and return the following error:  !Real device, iPhone 6 ### Steps to reproduce the behavior This occurs when the modify subscription dialog boxes pop up in-app, asking if you'd like to change from your present subscription to the newly selected one.Upon tapping through this dialog the error is thrown instead of the expected resolved promise.This is breaking for me right now because there's then no way to confirm that they actually purchased or validate receipts for these cases.Please let me know if you know of a workaround or fix, or if there's anything I can do to help (though I have no Obj-C experience).The only possible workaround I can think of for now is if buySubscriptions returns an error, checking this error and if it matches this error then confirming the purchase.But this is very dangerous as it renders receipt validation impossible and some other error (like inability to connect to server or something) could produce the same error code, giving the user the subscription without actually having to pay for it.*: This may be an obvious consequence of what I've already described, but after attempting to modify your subscription, this purchase is not added to your purchase history.but I'm not yet sure how to reproduce, will report back if I find a way.When it works the first dialog box requests my password then proceeds normally as if I don't already have another subscription, as opposed to when the first dialog box is "Confirm Purchase" and it asks if I want to modify my subscription, which is what appears when it's not working.When it works, the purchased subscription gets added to my purchase history as expected.They use a different method and the differences could help explain why this is happening, though I haven't used that library and so can't confirm it wouldn't happen there.

Cannot authorize sync when focus is default browserWhen focus is set as my default browser, and I click on the "Confirm Sign-in" link in the Firefox Accounts email which we send when you sign into sync for the first time on a new computer, an error message is shown complaining that you need cookies enabled in order to access Firefox accounts.It seems bad that we can't authenticate our own sign-ins to one of our browsers if your default browser is set to a different one.  !This might be a Firefox accounts issue - I can close this and open an account there if it is more appropriate).
Do anybody experience the problem, that each hour pushy does not get response to some sent notifications from Apple.That happens at the time when  auth token expires (it happens for about one hour and ten minutes when it is issued).When auth token expires, and you send next time, pushy receives response about expired token for some first notifications, but for all other remaining there is no response at all.It looks like that Apple when it receives new auth token in some way fails to respond on notifications with old token that it receives shortly after that.Also have tried to comment out auth token change and continue to send with expired token.on first attempt have not got response on all sent notifications, but on next iterations all notifications are responded.So it looks like a problem at Apple side, but would be nice if somebody can clarify.

As far as I understand the problem, per class exclusion can be provided using several approaches: 1.So, if we decide to use 1st approach than `excludes` node in config  would specify pattern for class name, not a filepath.3rd approach is more native, but it would be not so obvious for user.In this case we can't use `excludes` but should provide external config somehow.

Suggestion: Notify if not scrobbling or account disconnectedRe-authenticating seems to have corrected the issue.A notification of some type if not SLS is not authenticated to some a last.fm or libre.fm account for x amount of time (maybe configurable per scrobble destination or only notifies if authentication has ever been actually established).(2) Played items be cached for (hopefully, later) scrobble whether authenticated or not so that, in the event of authentication failure, played track information isn't lost.I'll continue to happily use it as is, but wanted to share my thoughts.

Issue deleting things after converting to new build systemWhile testing the binding I noticed an issue when deleting a thing.After deleting a thing using Paper UI, even though the thing was deleted, when I stop/start my binding, the thing handler is initialized for the thing I just deleted.Using this binding I was able to successfully delete things with no issue.Then I built the binding, dropped it in addons, and repeated my tests adding and deleting things.Note near the end of the log where I delete the thing.When I stop/start the binding, the handler is initialized for the thing I just deleted.Could someone please take a look at this to see if I'm doing something wrong.Log file illustrating the issue

While trying to use [S3Browser](https://s3browser.com/) with the mock as a server I encountered a problem with uploading files (which translates to calling the `FileStoreController#putObject` endpoint).The code does not distinguish between the 2 calls and thus overwrites the original file data with the ACL XML content.A quick analysis of the requests shows that there are some differences between the requests in the headers - which do not seem definitive enough to provide a distinction, However, there is one significant difference that seems to be most indicative that the call with the ACL contains an `acl` parameter (i.e., `PUT /some/path/to/bucket?acl`).For the time being I "patched" my code locally by checking if there is an `acl` parameter, and if so ignore the payload and return the `S3Object` that was generated when the file data was uploaded.I do believe though that it should be handled somehow (perhaps the ACL is required somewhere else- I just did not encounter such a need).As a side-note - I looked for some documentation on this REST call but could not find any(I did not look very deep though due to lack of time...)

ANR on speficic devices when SurfaceView Visibility is set to GONE since version 2.5.0   ### Issue descriptionThis is important, on most devices the error doesn't occur, but on this and a couple others it happens every time you try to set up the player.When setting up the player, the stream starts running (you can hear the sound) but the video is not being rendered.(The first frame is shown but stuck)As soon as there is an attempt to interact, the ANR is triggered and the app does not respond anymore.After a lot of time spent investigating the problem (sorry for the whiningwe found out that setting the visibility of the `SurfaceView` during the loading time of the player is causing the problem.but I thought it would be interesting to know what is causing the problem.### Reproduction steps We could reproduce the problem on a slightly modified version of the demo app.The player gets stuck in  `ExoPlayerImplInternal.blockingSendMessages`  I guess waiting for a message that is never delivered.If you need any more input just let me know.

[BUG] MSI authentication fails due to expiry date format mismatchThe connection fails, with an opaque "MSI Token failure: Failed to acquire token from MSI Endpoint" error.Unfortunately there's no stack trace or log output that shows the underlying problem (even at `java.util.logging.ALL`), but by retrying with a patched version of the driver with extra logging I was able to narrow the issue down to [SQLServerConnection.java:4376](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-jdbc/blob/v7.4.1/src/main/java/com/microsoft/sqlserver/jdbc/SQLServerConnection.java#L4376) which throws a `java.text.ParseException` when attempting to parse the token expiry timestamp.ss a X", but the MSI API server (for my App Service instance in UK West at least) is returning a 24hr format, e.g.  `"08/30/2019 01:08:02Even if the issue is with the MSI server (in which case I'd appreciate advice on how to raise such an issue), I'd suggest it's probably a bug that the relevant exception details are swallowed by the driver without any logging.

Basically, the issue appears when I either want to scan a Rocket or Build a Rocket.The second I click either of those Buttons, my Screen goes blank, however, I noticed that once the Rocket Assembling Machine block gets destroyed, that the bug disappears (that can happen by clicking ESC and breaking the block in-front of you even if you can't see, or anything else breaking it, players, explosions, whatever).: I did a little test with a much smaller Launchpad (the smallest) and tried to scan, apparently, it ONLY happens when that Scan/Building Animation is going on,

During outage-testing some backend components (databases, Redis, ...) for our applications we noticed that from time to time applications crashed with OutOfDirectMemory errors thrown by Netty.As Netty uses direct allocated memory to bypass garbage collection and improve througput we were not able to learn which objects filled up the memory directly from the heapdump.As can be seen from the image below at the time the application crashed with an OutOfMemoryError, more than 12 million instances of `com.lambdaworks.redis.protocol.The difference between these two invocations though is, that we have only a handful of Apache Camel objects in the heap profile while almost all other entries (at least for the couple hundred entries I've checked) are strongly referenced by `lettuce-nioEventLoopThis indicates that there may be an issue on consuming commands via the PubSubCommandHandler or Spring Data Rests listeners, which we use also, in cases of connection issues.If you need the heap dump (~766 MB) or our Redis Spring configuration ping back.

but I don't use Stats2However, I've encountered issues, let me explain them^^  -[ ] Comments in AR's config gets deleted at server reboot or editing an option then /ar reload  - [ ] Assuming MySQL option is enabled across all servers, the /ar gcheck should be useable on all servers even if the player didn't join the server Y but does play on X and Z.  - [x]I'm on LuckPerms, so it doesn't even check if I'm already a Trusted player.Autorank 4.2.8 but Player1 gets ranked up again to Trusted (imagine with a 24 ranks on the server)would spam the chat.It will repeat on other servers if he didn't join since I updated AR.I'm thinking a solution, AR will check if the player already had Trusted in the permissions plugin (LuckPerms)then it will not rankup but updates the "completed ranks" in the playerdata.yml or in mysql (that would require a new table "playerData")  - [ ] Between servers,Despite the AR interval check of 5 minutes, seems the connection to the MySQL database gets dropped if another instance is started.I mean, it won't cause issuesif server A updates Player1's time, server B updates player2's time and server C checks Player's time.if its badly explained or vague, my english is quite bad =I still have these files on my main server, but I've already sync'dI've managed to add them permissions as a prerequestie, if they don't have that permission they wont be autoassigned.

MarkDuplicates throws unexpected IllegalArgumentException with queryname-sorted input   ## Bug Report  ### Affected tool(s)MarkDuplicates_  ### Affected version(s)- [x] Latest public release version [version?] - [ ] Latest development/master branch as of [date of test?]  ### Description  With SAM input having records clustered by QNAME (per the MarkDuplicates documentation) but not sorted as strings, duplicate analysis proceeds successfully but the program then halts with a java exception:   #### Steps to reproduce This can occur in two straightforward use cases: - SAM input is globally unsorted butrecords are clustered by QNAME (as output by a read aligner that does not guarantee sort order but does guarantee that records are clustered),SAM input is globally sorted by QNAME but numeric subfields in QNAME are ordered by numerical value, not as strings (as output by _samtools_    #### Actual behavior _Program throws a java exception_  #### Additional comments This problem could probably by hacked out by not doing any sort-order validation when SAM output is generated, but a more principled solution would be to perform only the validation required to support MarkDuplicates' unduplication functionality and to ignore the global sort order of the input (or, at most, issue a warning if an inconsistency were detected).In the worst case, of course, MarkDuplicates can continue to accept only QNAME-ordered input as generated by the Picard SortSam tool, but a requirement that the input be re-sorted in order to satisfy MarkDuplicates becomes increasingly burdensome as data set sizes increase.

[PaperUI] UI does not refresh channel types   My binding creates channel types during runtime, after initialize() finishes, but before thing status goes to online, based on the information it obtains from the remote device (which takes some time).This causes issues with paperui.On the first creation of a thing, binding builds channel types and channels in runtime as stated above, and UI shows the channels correctly as they appear, but it does not allow to add new items for the channels.When I click + to add an item to a channel, there is a JS exception, because it can't find the channel type in $scope.I tried to put breakpoints on where channel types are populated and it never gets updated in runtime, only when thing configuration is changed.It is also possible to force channel type reading, when I go to a page that needs explicitly this information.So, if I just click on "Items" menu and then go back to the thing channels, I will be able to create new items for the channels, because $scope will contain correct channel types.When I looked into paperui source code, the channel types are updated once in ViewThingController.

Eject targets a cell with a non-support pokemon and erases whatever is in the cell rather than erasing directly the non-support pokemon that was present in that cellAs found there in this reddit topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonShuffle/comments/4kspcx/how_to_eject_your_own_supports/ ejects rather selects the cell with the non-support pokemon and then erases it, but if the board is moving at the same time the effects is going on (in this case because moving aggron to an empty space causes the icons above him to fall down at the same time)I guess this also explains why skills that would clear rocks/barriers/etc that are being erased at the same time by the match itself (for example, a barrier bash match cleaning barriers of his own match, only leading to no remaining icons from the match, or rock break breaking adjacent rocks that would naturally break though the match itself)At lest it seems that metal blocks that will break in the next move can't be targeted by block smash.

I have seen that when you try to open an event that is defined for the whole day (no start/end times), if you open it directly by tapping on it in the calendar-widget, the event is spanned over two days (the day of the event and the day before).The problem appears if you try to edit it, as by default the event is changed to 2 days, and if you don’t realize that when you save it, the event is changed.However, if you open the same event by using Android’s calendar, the event seems to be correctly defined for only one day.I do not know if this is just a bug in the calendar-widget or if it only happens in combination with my system (Android 7.0 in a LG G5 smartphone).

(I suppose it'll land in 1.2 since it might be a non-retrocompatible change) if you think this makes sense.- The maven-resources-plugin when using spring-boot-starter-parent sports the default configuration, which leads to a filtering of ${...} values that exist at compile time in resources; e.g. I had an issue where ${java.home} , which I was using in application.properties, was filtered with the build box variable rather than being filled at runtime (which is what I wanted).This can lead to unpredictable results when using profiles: application.properties would be filtered, while application-profile.properties would not.The documentation at [58.3](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-use-short-command-line-arguments) is a bit misleading, saying that  <pre> If you have enabled maven filtering for the application.properties you may want to avoid using ${*} for the tokens to filter as it conflicts with those placeholders.The suggestion is fine (it's what I did in the implementation) but it would suggest that resources filtering is

Query parameters not marked as required still fail NullableValidator*Describe the bugIf a request has no `query` string, it will correctly pass the request validation.However, a request that has a value for `a` but not `b` will fail validation with the messageWhen the query is `null`, the `paramValues` will be an empty map.However, when the query is `""`, the `paramValues` is populated with `null`-values.Similarly, when the query is `a=1`, the map will contain the values  `{a: 1, b: null}` This causes the function to return `true`, thus marking the null-ish parameter for further validation.

Witches Oven creates Silver Ingots from nothing when supplied with fuel   ### Expected Behavior When nothing is in the cooking input slot for the Witches Oven, nothing should happen when fuel is supplied until something is put into the input slot.If the oven is empty and coal is put into the fuel slot, the oven immediately starts smelting as though there were something in the oven, and the coal is used up as you would expect from such an interaction.If something else is placed into the input slot, it will smelt that item accordingly, but will go back to producing Silver Ingots when the input and output slots are empty as long as there is still fuel.I assume the fuel source doesn't matter, but I haven't tested it yet.

Can't delete courseA course cannot be deleted because of sql constraint violations.If a course is deleted ArTEMiS (hibernate to be more precise) tries to set the foreign key  `exercise.course` to null, but null values are forbidden.However, that means that not only the course is deleted, but also all exercises, participations and results (git repo's and bamboo build plans might have to be deleted manually;  `on delete cascade` only clears the database)   Stacktrace:

We have had a problem with a memory leak in one of our applications.If I've tracked it down properly, the ClientRequestFilter is executed creating the span.Then, the networking tries to actually connect to the server which throws an exception and the ClientResponseFilter is never executed leaving the span dangling.but I believe that has been fixed in master.However, as these spans are never finished, the traces don't get sent to the agent and we have no record of these failures even if there was no memory leak.Connection refused.Inspecting DataDog debug logs, it's clear the trace isn't closed or written.

The button changes the layout weight of the view to increase and decrease the size of the view.The code of the fragment does not handle sizing of the map.When changing the size of the map over the button after the first or second resize the display of the loaded map changes and the map is displayed faulty.The map is still functioning and the map scale is not affected by this error.All drawn elements like markers, position marker and the map itself are affected.The effect does not disappear when we try to resize it again and again.It does not disappear when we try to change the display position or zoom level.A forced repaint does not help.We can not see this ill effect on the S3.We tried to debug into the matter but all we found is that pivot is not the cause of the problem.

Some Glow-in-the-Dark Textures appear to be... fading out, in a way if blocks surround them.--- Now... I am not sure if it's meant to be herebut I noticed this after updating CTMmod it kinda broke some of those glowing bits of the texture if blocks are surrounding them.If you look at the Right Side of the Image, you can see how they glow and such, but when you look at the Left Side, the Castle Door Blocks appear to be slightly faded while some of the other block don't seem to be affected.While it's not noticeable in this image it becomes more clear in this next image.[](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377171551155650560/458701514173841438/twilightforestglowCTMCastleDoor.PNG)  This one shows it more clearly when you surround the Castle Door Blocks.Right Side of the Image shows the glowing effect kinda being affected but that may be normal due to the way the lighting works however when you look at the Left Side of the Image, it's glow effect is pretty much almost gone.but I figure I mention this just to see if it's CTM or something.

Cannot map entities with generic arraysWhen I try to map a class with a parameterized array member variable in 1.0.1, I get this exception:  `java.lang.ClassCastException: sun.reflect.generics.reflectiveObjects.`  I ran into this while porting some code originally written for Morphia 0.99 over to 1.0.1, so I'm reasonably sure that this is a regression from 0.99.It's worth noting that this is the same exception as in issue #772, although that was closed for lack of information and it didn't have enough information for me to know if it was the same case or not.I'm afraid I didn't get a chance to create a test case that integrates with the Maven build, but I do have a self-contained class with a main method that demonstrates the issue, see here:
` and `@Consumes`   We made the `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` extension understand the RESTEasy `@PathParam` annotation, but if there is a `@Consumes` annotation on the same endpoint, it will require a body, when this is not the case with the JAX-RS `@PathParam` annotation.

and I create and dispose all of my entities through my Engine instance as instructed, however It seems if I remove a load of entities in an update cycle, then after the engine update has completed I create and add new entities, it sporadically throws this exception.My issue is, the code that's throwing that exception is the following:  Entity bloodEntity = createEntity(); bloodEntity.add(renderPositionComponent); bloodEntity.add(spriteComponent); bloodEntity.add(expiringComp); addEntity(bloodEntity);and I really can't, it only ever happens when stuff has been removed in the prior engine update call.so I can't exactly just throw a nice repro up

The problem is that when saving a projects back to WebDAV with a lock still enabled in ganttproject (padlock locked)I get the error response code 423 which means the resource is locked.This happens because ganttproject does not send its own lock token in an "If" header according to WebDAV [RFC4918][RFC4918], section 7.5 when saving.So this is not about locking other users out, but about one instance of ganttproject locking itself out.Ganttproject has to send the "If" header because this is the only way to avoid race conditions.I have checked using the nd command-line tool that my WebDAV instance reacts properly when requesting to overwrite a locked resource.It denies it if there is no "If" header in the request and allows it when there is an appropriate "If" header in the request (matching the lock token as returned by PROPFIND).
My logic is simple enough, and when checking wirter it shows it outputs redstone high, but it doesn't trigger servos.Triggering block update near servo does the trick, simple act of placing or breaking cobble.I'll test if having something in between writer and servo will make it work, like repeater, but it would be awesome if I wouldn't have to do anything.

Windows 7 stopped at 100%, no osumer beatmap import, when used actual browser to downloadI encountered something in 2.0.0 snapshot 5, osu!mer works fine after beatmaps download directly from the game, but once you downloaded a beatmap from a browser itself, the program would not import any beatmap to osu, it'll queue and download the beatmap but it won't import it, is this a bug or something I tick off in the options or preferences, and as much as I hate to admit the program doesn't popup a beatmap information screen on osu whenever you download a beatmap it just automatically imports it and download it without showing any information.I have to restart my computer without downloading any beatmaps on the actual browser everything must be downloaded from osu!mer if I want to download on it.

Don't write inside the arrows as they will be hidden when you post your issue.If you have a feature suggestion for EssentialsX, read the following tips:  1.You can search the issue tracker to see if your feature has already been       requested at https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/issues.You can       also check the wiki at https://essentialsx.github.io/ to see if the       feature was recently added.There are lots of features that we reject because most servers won't       need or use them.If your feature is very specific or already exists in       another plugin, it might not be a good fit for EssentialsX.  5.Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue!Kind of like what LiteBans does with what commands to disable when a player is muted.Won't really change how the current system works, but will just improve it.

Existing bugs or newly introduced bugs affecting the rendered will tend to negatively affect its visual output: from small artifacts to issues affecting the whole picture, i.e. a blank screen.An important aspect of debugging these issues is to isolate and identify the rendering node that introduces the problem.The current system has a number of shortcomings however:  - it is hardcoded and does not take advantage of the new, node-based, extensible architecture of the renderer- a number of nodes may write to the same FBO but the current system visualizes the content of the FBO only at the end of the frame: ideally we'd want to be able to inspect the contribution of each node separately  - the contribution of a node might be subtle:a facility to highlight a node's contribution (i.e. overimposing a semi-transparent color on it) would be beneficial - the current system visualizes the color attachments of the various FBOs but does not allow inspection of other important attachments, for example depth and stencil buffers  - the current system displays the content of an attachment and only that: there is no label allowing the user to uniquely identify the attachment on display nor additional metadata such as attachment type, size in pixels, size in memory and any other useful information.
When there's no data connection, the progress bar shows endlessly instead of alerting the user to the problem.When it has no data and no ability to get data, it  should display a message instead of the progress indicator.It may be nice to have the widget listen to the network state in order to trigger a refresh once the data connection is established, but that's not necessary and may be confusing when it comes to abstraction layers.

Upgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality under AlienDalvik (AOSP 4.1.2): K-9always crashes   Upgrading from K-9 Mail 5.008 to 5.010 breaks its Share functionality when attaching a file to an email under AlienDalvik (based on AOSP 4.1.2) in Jolla's SailfishOS 2.0.1.11  K-9 always crashes, a pop up window is displayed stating, "Unfortunately the application com.fsck.k9 has stopped.By clicking on [OK], K-9 restarts, and saves the message in the Drafts folder, but without the file being attached.Mail always crashes K-9 in exactly the same way (as described above), no matter if K-9 was running or not.- Sharing data (not a file) does not crash K-9 Mail, but seems to exhibit another bug: a handle (?) is inserted into the mail body, not the data sent, e.g. with data sent from BarcodeScanner:    [Subject] Barcode Scanner - Plain textI will file a separate bug report, when sufficiently tested to write up something more comprehensive.It also makes no difference, which Android application is picked, when using the Share functionality from within K-9 Mail for attaching a file to an email: K-9 always crashes.- Only when I pick SailfishOS' native Gallery application (which is the third application offered besides Amaze and TurboEditor when attaching a file in K-9 Mail on my Jolla Phone), K-9 does not crash and the file is indeed attached.But it is not Android's internal Share mechanism being used here, instead the still somewhat fragile Share functionality between Android and SailfishOS applications provided by Jolla's SailfishOS 2 is utilised.In this specific case (attaching a file to an email in K-9) it even works consistently stable, but unfortunately SailfishOS' native Gallery app allows to select picture file formats (e.g. jpg, png), only.Improved MIME type handling when other apps share files to K-9 Mail [...]

All those versions need to be available in the maven repository and, most important, when a change (e.g. structural change, bug fix) occurs in one version, all the others must be updated and re-uploaded in the repository.the last step is done through the Github plugin which is already configured (note it's working only if you have a valid Sease account) and cannot be used massively because Github stops requests that exceed a given size.
I'm happy to contribute a fix here if someone can point me to the best way to override something like this, or if this is feasible.

However, some libraries may disable interrupts for longer than 1 bit time.If they do, AltSoftSerial will  not work properly.If you discover erroneous results from AltSoftSerial, please try testing without other  libraries.SoftwareSerial would break with relatively low complexity I2C communication using Arduino's Wire library, it proved impossible to use with the AD5933 library for similar reasons.AltSoftSerial works very well in this regard, but as we begin to write multiple sampling rates and frequency sweeps that request timer interrupts and reset commands to the AD5933  more frequently, the time window for interrupts to be handled shrink considerably.however that has to measure and send impedance values, breaks at sampling rates over 80 Hz and completely garbles serial communication with AltSoftSerial library, you only need to look at Arduino's serial monitor to see the gibberish it spouts and functions

When wearing Dark Leggings that have a Speed Upgrade (any tier) with a charge in them and moving, you become unable to scroll through your inventory without it jumping back and forth, block without constantly unblocking, or eat without the animation resetting.This happens only when you are moving, running or not, and the leggings have a speed upgrade on them and have a charge, otherwise they can be worn without any issue.While waiting for the video to upload, I found out something.It seems to be whenever energy is transferring via your methods to anything.To test, I broke the charger, noted that the bug disappeared, then I turned on the Sound Locator function of my Dark Helm, and it reappeared (both times happening while moving, as before).
Tika stage fails to extract contentThe problem was that Tika managed to find the correct content-type for the data, but could not extract contents.Even weirder was that I couldn't replicate the problem when running the same code from within Netbeans.In the end, I have managed to isolate the problem to some sort of resource conflict when using "jar-with-dependencies".To fix the problem, I've instead used the onejar plugin:

On 21 July someone enqueued 18 regional jobs at once on `analysis.conveyal.com` and the system lost track of which jobs existed, and stopped processing all of them.So at the moment when the job's being enqueued, each of 350k tasks exists as two objects and three serialized copies of those objects.We could easily be at 1GB of memory per regional analysis, so it's no wonder this failed as the 6th analysis was enqueued.We would have to consider how to enqueue static-site regional jobs if the broker was not a separate process with an HTTP enqueueing endpoint.

ANTLRworks does not recompile parser or lexer for debugging   An issue that I think is present also in versions before 1.5 is:  Usually if you made any changes to the grammar or if the Lexer/Parser classes or __Test___input file are missing, ANTLRworks would regenerate and recompile them when asked to Debug...E.g. if you delete classes, it still will assume they are there and run into timeout when trying to debug.Also the test input seems to be stored by ANTLRworks internally because it suggests the previous test input even if you delete the __Test___input file.Once you run into this behaviour you have to shut down ANTLRworks and restart it.

As you can see, Bazel now thinks `a` is out of date despite us doing nothing but restarting the server!I believe the problem is `CompactPersistentActionCache.Specifically, Bazel has a heuristic that if the action cache journal is much smaller than the action cache, it keeps the journal instead of applying it to (and rewriting)This is fine in principle, but in reality, `PersistentMap` simply forgets about the journal once it closes it.This means that if the journal-keeping heuristic is applied twice in a row, the first cache journal will simply be overwritten by the new one, losing data.When we build `a`, the large action cache causes Bazel to write only to the cache journal.When we build `b`, the same heuristic applies and Bazel writes to the action cache journalWhen we restart the server, the action cache and journal from step `3` is read.All references to the work done in step 2 are lost because its journal was never applied.

Bug when close and reopen   Thanks for this class.If the user cleans his dialog and opens again the app, this secod time, the permissionHelper.check() method automatically executes 'success' and assumes to be granted, without showing the dialog again and without actually having the permission granted.In this way, clearing the screen and reopening the app in the same point (i.e. moving the app to background and back to foreground) we can navigate the app skipping the dialogs until the final security crash.

The error log now shows that we've failed to load the gpdsc file.Generate the gpdsc from STMCube which should remove the error, but it still remains.the issue shows that when ticking the STMCube tickbox, cmsis pack tries to locate and read the gpdsc file.As the file has not been generated yet, fGeneratedPacks in CpPackManager is registered as ["name of gpdsc", null].Moreover, trying to add the gpdscwatcher to the file generates a NoSuchFileException thus failing to register a watcher to detect any changes in the gpdsc file.{ 			return fGeneratedPacks.get(file); 		}` returns null as the fGeneratedPack map contains the file id registered with a null thus preventing a new read operation of the gpdsc which combined with the failed gpdscwatcher prevents any recognision of updates and changes in the gpdsc file.Everything work as intended when restarting Eclipse, as the maps and watchers

If you have a keyword field, the value bytes will likely come as utf8 bytes over the network, then be converted to a String when we call `text()` on the json parser from KeywordFieldMapper and finally converted back to utf8 bytes by Lucene's terms dict.Lucene already supports indexing keywords from utf-8 bytes, but it does not look Jackson supports avoiding the UTF8 conversion.Even if it might not come naturally for json given that it is character-based, it should eg.

As far as I can tell this is because the area calculations are not implemented in a totally numerically stable way, so degenerate polygons (which should have an area of `0`) actually end up with a small "epsilon" remainder in the variable [`areasum2`](https://github.com/locationtech/jts/blob/4c4ccd7fe5c758abb48647da60dacf8e4cd7f9df/modules/core/src/main/java/org/locationtech/jts/algorithm/Centroid.java#L127) caused by floating point rounding errors.polygon geometries](https://github.com/locationtech/jts/blob/4c4ccd7fe5c758abb48647da60dacf8e4cd7f9df/modules/core/src/main/java/org/locationtech/jts/algorithm/Centroid.java#L127) should maybe compare against a small epsilon value in order to circumvent this issue.(Or maybe a comparison against totalLength would make more sense: if a condition like `areasum2 << totalLength²` is true, than one could assume that the polygon's geometry is degenerate.)

Melting ores in a forge causes world breaking crashes.*Describe the bug
When `driver.loadSchema`is executed, it uses the registered `ExistResolver`.This limitation will lead to a deadlock anywhere multithreaded code is used within the same transaction (if the same collection (or sub collection/resource) is accessed.If so, then that may be deadlock prone also.If `ExistResolver` is likely the only multithreaded code, and we can accept a single threaded limitation.Perhaps one solution is that `getOrCreateCollection` does not need to register a `WRITE_LOCK` with the transaction.

I think I came across a bug that affects a general graph behavior.When using ListenableDirectedGraph one can add a listener using method 'When using DirectedNeighborIndex a listenable graph should be passed in the DirectedNeighborIndex's contructor as a parameter.According to the DirectedNeighborIndex's spec "If it [DirectedNeighborIndex] is added as a listener to a graph other than the one it indexes, results are undefined.I suppose, that graphs concerned shouldn't be affected in this situation.IllegalArgumentException is thrown   at org.jgrapht.graph.() when trying to add a new edge in the graph.The following JUnit test highlights the problem:In the jgrapht mailing list there's a bug which looks related, although I cannot be sure:
the only way to get rid of those threads is to terminate them with (deprecated) Thread.stop.After yet another such spike I now took the time to investigate this further, here are my findings:, there never is any more content and isFinished does not return true .This triggers a NumberFormatException which in combination with a servlet that tries to read from Request.inputStream after said exception causes the read-call to loop.but I was able to reproduce the issue with a skeleton-servlet as well.this read-call will block             request.getInputStream().read();         } catch (IOException e1) {

Async learning w/ history processor is broken    When attempting to use A3CDiscreteConv or AsyncNStepQLearningDiscreteConv with a history processor, the history processor is ignored and therefore the input data won't match the shape of the network input and you'll get an error like this:  `org.deeplearning4j.exception.input array depth does not match CNN layer configuration (data input depth = 240,But even after fixing that, the code in AsyncThreadDiscrete doesn't properly use the history processor.I've attempted to fix it myself, and I can get the code to not crash, but the learning didn't seem to be converging (although that could be because I was trying A3C with only 2 threads).I'm happy to submit a PR for this, but would probably need some pointers as to the intentions of the code AsyncThreadDiscrete.trainSubEpoch.

App crashes on notification when in background   ### Actual BehaviourThe App crashes on notification, when in background.Receiving notifications when app is in background worked already but at a moments notice it stopped working.
(Many bugs are fixed in newer releases and upgrading will often resolve the issue)(Please include the content causing the issue, any relevant configuration settings, the SQL statement that failed (if relevant) and the command you ran.)The issue is that when Flyway runs the migration in DbMigrate#migrateAll in while loop it executes during first iteration and metadata is successfully written to master node.But immediately after that next iteration is updating local Flyway cache in JdbcTableSchemaHistory#refreshCache that is sent to Read slave that sometimes had not yet replicated from master.Migration is not read to cache and executes second time with either failing on existing table or corrupting data.
I have my mouse settings currently set to scroll 3 lines at a time, but changing this setting has no effect on how fast I can scroll in the console.Zooming in or out on RStudio (from the View dropdown menu) does not change this, but changing the font size does.When I lower the font size, it scrolls more lines, and if I increase the font size it scrolls far fewer lines.It scrolls 3-4 lines at a time, like I would expect, but this does not change when I change my system settings, so it seems to be some fixed setting there as well.The other issue is that when in the view window, viewing a dataframe or table, the horizontal scroll bar is very thin, almost invisible.I should also note that when I connect my lower-resolution wireless display (1366x768) and drag the RStudio window over to it, the problems are not present while it is on that screen.

When working multi-window Android Studio, save actions plugin only works in the first instance.It may be a luxury problem,  but when you're working multi-project in Android Studio 3.0 (and thus also multi-window),  i.e. opening a second project that has a demo in it, bit with bad code formatting,If it's easily fixed, that would be great, like the plug-in already is; if not, then it's maybe nice to know this limitation, hence the FYI.

Sometimes when I log back into our server at least one of my ID networks have stopped working.The indication is at least one of the writers showing the status "network corrupted", although in one or two cases I've seen that status although it still seems to work.So far I've been able to fix it by either pulling out the data card in the writer and re-inserting it (rarely) or breaking a couple of cables around the writer and replacing them (usually).my suspicion is that it either happens when the server restarts or is related to the chunk loading issues we have on the server (our version of ftbu seems to be rather random about actually keeping the chunks loaded I set it to).One other thing I noticed (which I'm just going to mention, not sure if that is ID's fault), if I "repair" a network after such an incident, my fps in that region often go to hell although the regulation shouldn't have set anything off that causes it.

@MockBean leads to Mockito Validation Exceptions presumably masking problems with @Async annotated servicesWhen using the `@MockBean` annotation on the service in my test class all usages of parameter matchers fail (either while configuring in before method using given/willReturn or while verifying method calls).The tag "problem" contains the failing test while the tag "workaround" contains the profile configuration deactivating the async configuration for the test (the test passes without exception).While researching the errors I stumbled upon issue #6405 - could be linked to that to some extend.While debugging the test cases I got the expected behavior while inspecting the mocked service with the IntelliJ Idea debugging tools - might have resolved some proxies manually which maybe cannot be resolved reflectively by Mockito (but that's just guesswork - haven't had the opportunity to reproduce that yet).

We are seeing an issue where the number of documents successfully created/indexed in ES is different  (more--very odd, or less) from the number of documents which we are giving ES to index.The difference in documents only seems to occur if there is a large number of documents being inserted (specifically we tested with 929,660) and too few shards (specifically 1).The fact that this only happens when large numbers of documents are created/indexed and that it seems to alleviate when more shards are added to balance the load points it to a load issue.I believe this to be an issue with ES core, but I was interested in seeing if anyone else here had seen this due to ES-hadoop being able to create a load issue more easily than the normal api.I can provide more details as needed, but as there is nothing in the logs, there are not many other observables that I can detail.It is very similar to: http://elasticsearch-users.115913.n3.nabble.com/missing-documents-after-bulk-indexing-td4056100.html, however I  am not seeing any exceptions.Please let me know if anyone has seen this issue or has any resolution.

Instead we rely on an exception to be thrown when we try to sort the buckets at reduce time.Apart from the not being a nice user experience as we should fail quickly on bad requests this also causes a few other issues highlighted in #14771 and #19851: - No exception is thrown if an invalid order is defined but the aggregation returns either 0 or 1 bucket because we never actually sort the buckets.- Because the exception is thrown in the reduce phase it is a `SearchPhaseExecutionException` which maps to a `503 Unavailable` status code when in fact it should return a `400 Bad Request` status code and ideal the exception should be a `SearchParseException`

Sonar scan fails if there are no class files availableSonar scan fails during findbugs execution in the case where there are java source files available and there are no class files available.In some cases, the class files might be not be available and for this case, findbugs execution should be skipped and should not be failed.Earlier in sonar-findbugs-plugin-3.2, findbugs execution gets skipped and now we are seeing the exception being raised and sonar scan fails.Can we skip the findbugs execution (fallback to old logic) instead of making the scan to fail.

App leaking deleted files in "failed" section of "Uploads"   ### Actual behaviourHowever, the app will leakyou deleted a long time ago, which I imagine is not preferred.The concerned part is the "uploads" section -  if you set a certain album to upload automatically, the error list may get populated with long-deleted photos.  !Please read the steps to grasp the issue in full  ###I guess do not show deleted images - they were deleted for a reason and may display sensitive data.Delete the screenshot from the deviceUnder "Uploads", your screenshot will be shown in "failed to upload" section.

When the EwsXmlReader encounters empty spaces between tags, it will improperly parse and wind up throwing an Exception.This does not apply to empty tags if there is no whitespace between them.The read() method deliberately skips whitespace, but this is not taken into account in EwsXmlReader.readValue().This will skip the space and go to the end element.It checks XmlEvent.isCharacters(), which will return false, and it throws an Exception instead.

PlayWebContext incorrectly sets port for requests coming from load balancer   PlayWebContext incorrectly uses `80` as a default port ignoring `request.secure()`: https://github.com/pac4j/play-pac4j/blob/master/shared/src/main/java/org/pac4j/play/PlayWebContext.java#L181  This is causing problems when library is used in apps that are working from behind load balancers or reverse proxies and security and port of the call is defined by `Forwarded` headers.In such scenario `request.secure()` will return `true`, while code in question will claim port is 80.This causes problems in DefaultUrlResolver of pac4j's core library: 1.`context.getServerPort()` will return `80` as it does not take `request.secure()` or `X-Forwarded-Port` into account.

the `ApplicationContext`'s resourceLoader, or a new `DefaultResourceLoader` if that is null:  This potentially introduces another problem however, in that an `AbstractApplicationContext` registers itself as `ResourceLoader` in the main `BeanFactory` and this registration is not reset when a custom resourceLoader is assigned, therefore DI of `ResourceLoader` will continue to resolve the `ApplicationContext` itself.I need to file an issue with Spring Context for this, as this is not a Spring Boot problem.

Due to the [introduction](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/da8fb9e108abdf593f02258f0b3f52093124c937) of [checkStatics](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/1.3.1/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/utils/Timer.java#L262), if any Timer is created within libGDX, it runs the risk of wiping out user-created timers.Specifically, if one is created after a pause event, and before a resume event, the Timer constructor will call checkStatics and will clear existing Timer instances.Since GestureDetector creates a new Timer instance every time the touchDown event occurs, it could do this if it happens to run before resume.The following code demonstrates the issue by manually calling touchDown on the pause event.Simply run it, then switch to another window to pause it, then switch back and the timer will not resume.) that occurred on mobile where the game's create event is called when the game is resumed, preventing old Timers from running again.Perhaps a better solution would be to call checkStatics when this event occurs, rather than every time a Timer is initialized.

Yes  Explain issue in detail: When modules are installed in a space suit, they vanish when their suit parts break.I don't know if this is intentional or an oversight, but it can waste expensive resources and doesn't make a lot of sense.Break the suit, but not the separate add-ons.They should be popped into the inventory or dropped, not just disappear.The wiki also says that the space suit shouldn't take damage or break, but mobs definitely damage it.That's how I found out all my expensive modules vanished when the suit broke.But at least a breakable space suit makes some sense; deleted modules don't.

When playing a Smooth Streaming presentation where the fragmented MP4 segments contain a timecode ('tfdt' box), the internal timecode computation gets confused andA/V synchronization does not work properly (the 'tfdt' timecode gets added to the segment start time).While most Smooth Streaming media comes without 'tfdt' boxes, some media does have it (for example, media that's packaged to target both Smooth Streaming clients as well as MPEG DASH clients, since MPEG DASH requires 'tfdt' to be present).The Smooth Streaming spec from Microsoft remains silent on 'tftd' boxes (neither requires it nor forbids it), so it seems that such a stream (supporting both DASH and Smooth) should be valid (and desirable).The simplest way to support this may be to have a policy that when a 'tfdt' timestamp is found, it should _override_, rather than be added to, the segment start time obtained from the Manifest.Alternatively, 'tfdt' timestamps could just be ignored in Smooth Streaming mode.

It is sometimes desirable to run it in test classes the same way as in real ones, but during testing of the class annotated with it might cause problems.One cannot have two tests that create instances of given class because it (correctly) throws exception.My initial idea is to add another annotation that can be used to mark given constructor that will disable the scheduled execution, but that creates artificial constructors and pollutes the code.

Older reflection-based bean introspection appears to fail on EclipseNotice that in the method above if a method is associated with the Object class then it is assumed that no more class methods will follow (break; versus continue;).When running OpenJ this assumption does not hold true, the first method is always Object::getClassThis is the only case where I've noticed a runtime difference between Hotspot and OpenJ. (The actual scenario was when serializing an x-www-form-data body via a `@Client` for an OAuth call, the form data uses BeanMap.of and falls back on this version of introspection.)provided - [X] Example that reproduces the problem uploaded to Github - [X]Introspected bean does not reveal any properties.
Only enable access control if roles are configured   Our latest version of Dicoogle breaks backwards compatibility because it requires a roles configuration file (roles.xml) for the WebUI service to work properly.Hence, after the problems that @tmgodinho is facing because of the new layer of access control, I suggest that we disable all access control if roles were not defined during deployment.
Notes disappearing, crashingOnce I have a high enough amount of notes in the same song, individual notes start "disappearing" when I place or remove another one.In other cases, the program will just freeze when the notes initially disappear, making me unable to do anything but exit via the "X" button in the window.Also, after freezing, the text and buttons in the confirmation message for exiting are not there.So essentially I can only close the program via task manager after this happens.

My code is throwing an exception for this constructor:I believe `Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();` is returning null in certain instances in my app.I don't understand enough about Java or AIDLs to see what's happening here, but suffice it to say calls to log functions (such as `Logger.trace()`) are crashing when they are invoked from very specific interface call backs in my app which use AIDL and are on a background thread.Running Logger.trace on the main thread from within the interface callback fixes the issue, but I am worried now there could be places in my codeThis is probably an Android only problem, but would love to know what the cause is and how I might mitigate it.It's super difficult for me to try and make a reproducible sample because I am seeing the error in an SDK dependency which uses TinyLog

However, a properly designed max-size reactor can produce 100 million RF/t or more.A reactor which doesn't produce any heat per tick is fine, but at these levels even a little bit of heat generation or a brief fluctuation in active coolant supply will cause a instantaneous meltdown.: If the RF/T and heat/t numbers are large enough, they overlap in the controller GUI, making them hard to read.
LogFactory` uses the Thread Context Class Loader (TCCL) when _discovering_ which logging APIs/backends are available for its own logging.This problem was noticed in a real application-scenario, but can be simplified and reproduced as-follows:When `Flyway` is first classloaded, it initializes its own logging, and uses the TCCL classloader for detection of the available logging APIs (SLF4J, Apache Commons Logging), but when loading the API-wrapper e.g. `Slf4jLogCreator`, normal classloading is used, which is _not_ the TCCL.It should not use the TCCL classloaders when testing what classes it can load for itselfWhen an application loads Flyway, Flyway's own internal-logging and public logging API attempt to discern the logging-framework used by the application, and load and use that framework along with any associated configuration.- Care with classloaders. - Cannot use static members to store logging-instances, lest they be shared by Applications

Thus, even though the reputation may go up and down, the badges will keep track of the achieved milestones (e.g. taking up students, graduating etc).The reputation does not mean that you are a good developer at all -- if you think it means that, then the drop makes sense, because if you don't practice programming for a while, you forget, lose experience.But I think it doesn't mean you are a good developer or architect, since you can achieve it in many ways besides writing code or designing an application ; it could also mean that you are a good manual QA and opened 20 valid issues/day.If they reached that point, they spent well over 2 monthsYou don't forget that even if you take a few months break, it's something that should have gotten in your blood if you reached it in the first place.Well, we could kick them out if they have a long period of inactivity, say 1 year.

While I think that `master` is rather stable, I did not have any sufficient time and will not have until beginning of October to test it in deep (e.g. compass related).So although the gap between `master` and `release` is quite big and will get bigger until beginning of October I would still prefer a release from `release` as far as I am concerned for testing it.There could be one alternative if needed: If we could strip the compass related changed from `master`,the remaining changes on `master` could be made ready for release without too much effort IMO.but I would still like to see the bundle of other changes on `master`to be out there rather soon.

Players' time deleted during startupUnfortunately, we had issues that caused us to lose the playtime of many players.More recently though, one of our admins created a script that scanned all our old Autorank backup files to recover people's total time over all of the past 4 years.However, when Autorank starts up, it erases basically all of the data.It erases thousands of entries each time, leaving only 20 or so out of nearly 18,000.We would love to give all our players their total time stat back and have the plugin store this data so that when older players return, they still have their total time as well.We already did the hard work gathering the time data; we just need the plugin to stop erasing it all.

SlidingTimeWindowReservoir getTick() can overflow and breakThe getTick() function of SlidingTimeWindowReservoir uses a collision buffer to allow for measurements which are happening within the same "tick".Under certain circumstances, nanoTime() returns a long sufficiently large that when multiplied by the collision buffer, it overflow into a negative number.The next line in the function will then check whether the new tick (nanos \* buffer) is larger than the old and, if not, it will return oldTick + 1.The offset value can be a final field which is initialized when the class is constructured or a static.Following each call to Clock.getTick(), we would reduce the return value but this absolute amount.

Leech causes mobs to disappear or get deleted.or - the mobs disappear if its on armor or sword.do not work on the swordbut after hitting them with a leeched sword it makes them disappear 3 seconds later.This is a very annoying bug and would be awesome if it was fixed.This would solve most of the issues after their armor breaks no other items like this would spawn again, but the bug still needs to be fixed.But now its causing players to duplicate items when they die.When they die it duplicates random diablo drops items that they are wearing.It also keeps on making some players boots get deleted and get replaced with items they pick up such as clay dirt string etc.

When a user taps on a place that is outside transport network boundaries (for example at the sea) but inside server limits, the error message is:     `<string name="tripplanner_error_outside_bounds">Origin or destination are outside region limits</string`   I think that this can be very confusing, because if the user is having this message he is probably close to region limits, hence he will clearly see the line of region limits but he will notice that he should be inside region.Also for doing this I thing that will be easier if I just change all files at once (because I also need to comment all the other translation files) and I refer the commit to this issue.

The Tinker's tank appeared full, but the backpack one appeared full as well.However spilling it on the ground and then collecting it with a bucket appears to work just fine, as does filling the bucket directly in the inventory.-When I die, the backpack gets put on the ground in rather weird locations.When I died from a Silverfish nest, couple meter under the surface, my backpack got placed OVER the surface, instead of right next to my grave; something similar happened the second time I died, way farther underground, and I lost it :(I am not completely sure this second case was a bug in your coding, though: there's a tiny chance that the backpack got instead blown up and destroyed from the TNT zombies (damn DeadlyWorld).I'll explain further: I get attacked by something with it on my chest slot, it obviously takes damage, and whenever I place it down and grab it up again it hasn't got any more damage.I said "recrafts" because I have the "You Will Die" mod installed -amongstwhen I place it down and grab it up again I could end up with a pristine "Hardened Cow Backpack" with an armor bonus of 3%, just as if I crafted another cow backpack for free.I don't know if that's intentional, but I suppose not.

RStudio v1.2 is currently available as a preview release, from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/. If you are reporting a bug with RStudio v1.1, it would be greatly appreciated if you could check if the issue also reproduces in the preview release before reporting an issue.If you're having trouble with R itself or an R package, see https://www.r-project.org/help.html, and if you want to ask a question rather than report a bug, go to https://community.rstudio.com/.Finally, if you use RStudio Server Pro, get in touch with our Pro support team at support@rstudio.com.3.5.2  ### Steps to reproduce the problem### Describe the problem in detail Code with unicode characters like `catapultsString.delm <- gsub("–", "", gsub(" – ", "", gsub(" –", "", gsub("– ", "", catapultsString.delm))))This prohibits string manipulation in R in RStudio when characters are unicode...Thank you for taking the time to file an issue!

Once i try to serialize the object, i get the following exception:   Fails to find a UserSerializer for this.For code cleanup, it would be nice if we could annotate a property/method with @JsonbGetter to define the getter Json-B should use.The second workaround was to create a visibility strategy that blocked fields or functions of typebut it seems to get the work done.I noticed that Yasson's default visibility strategy has the ability to look both at the field and method to judge the visibility of each, which is not possible in a custom visibility strategy, specially to enforce the spec.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what caused the issue, I believe it to be kCauldron, since it didn't appear until we added that and plugins to the server, and it persists even with the plugins gone, and since that means it is the main difference, I used deductive reasoning.Anyways, the issue I'm having is now, when Reflection is active, projectiles will reflect just fine like they used to, as will damage, but it no longer negates damage to me.In fact, while reflection is on, all damage I take bypasses my armor.This makes it far less useful in combat situations, although it _may_ be able to be considered a type of balancing, just... not the kind intended.I first encountered the issue in 1.0.1, but since I had no way of knowing what exactly caused it, I didn't want to submit it as an issue until I could pinpoint a cause, but with it persisting through the version update, I figured I'd submit it anyways.

HA and HB should never run concurrently if we do a graceful container failover, however it is possible that they are both running at the same time, and writing to the same Segments, if HA's host loses connection to ZK/BK and still thinks it's the leader for the Container.However, there is a case that is not handled: 1.While the write is happening, HB open-writes Segment X, which causes the last file of X to be marked as read-only, and after that, its length is retrieved.HA completes the write to Segment X, altering it (and increasing its length) after it was marked as read-only.They can happen concurrently and any permission change will not affect ongoing writes.Note that due to the fact that there is no known server-side feature to support this, any solution may not work well in a general case, but it should solve the use case that the Segment Store is concerned aboutDuring a write, we set this XAttr (to `true`) on the target file right before we are about to open the write stream, and clear it when we're done (whether successfully or not).If it's set, it will need to wait until it's cleared (or a timeout expires).

Compiler does not create needed .srcIf you have two modules where one depends on the other and you compile them separatelythe compiler will complain on the second module that it can't find the .src archive for the first module.You can work around this by compiling the first module with the java backend compiler, but that shouldn't be necessary of course, the JS compiler should be able to make its own .src archives (which should be 100% the same as the ones generated by the JVM compiler of course)

HashMap.hashCode throws NPE after deserializationmethod throws NPE (the field `hash` is null).The reason I'm opening this issue is to keep track of this issue on the latest release, and to be able to prioritize the upcoming release accordingly.While investigating, I realised that the reason behind this problem is that the lazy [`hash`](https://github.com/javaslang/javaslang/blob/v2.0.x/javaslang/src/main/java/javaslang/collection/HashMap.java#L35) field is marked as `transient`.While it makes complete sense to throw away evaluated hash value while serialization (as the contents' hash values might change), still, there should be some additional serialization logic (e.g. `readObject` and `writeObject` methods) that should reassign the lazy `hash` field into its unevaluated state.Lazy`](https://github.com/javaslang/javaslang/blob/v2.0.x/javaslang/src/main/java/javaslang/Lazy.java) could clear its calculated value upon serialization while serializing its _supplier_.PR fixes this issue by removing the lazy `hash` field altogether.It might worth mentioning that we stumbled upon this problem after we started using javaslang's persistent collections with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), a distributed computing system that heavily relies on serialization of data.

When httpServerEnabled=true, Prometheus reports doesn't set content-type*Describe the bugWhen running with `httpServerEnabled` set to true, `/metrics` endpoint stops sending a `content-type` header (this uses the `MetricsService`, see code here https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/28dee8464764b0edceeb31ce24424f0947b5789b/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/server/http/service/MetricsService.java).The content-type header is expected by some prometheus tools to differentiate between plaintext and protobuf formatted metrics and no content-type is considered an error.Default to a given content type might cause problems with other providers.

Timer thread dies on androidThe following is a description what causes the problem to occur: -The thread registers itself as a `LifecycleListener` - The app is left (works best for me when I turn off the screen and wait for the device to be pattern-locked) - When the app is entered again, `onCreate` is called, leading to a new `initialize()ation`=> `Gdx.app` is new, with a new list of LifecycleListeners - `Timer.thread` is not null, for it "statically survived" =The thread remains dead  For fixing the problem, I suggest setting `Timer.thread` to null in `Timer.If you are concerned about increased unnecessary `TimerThread` instantiations, one might as well keep a reference to the actual `Thread` which is created in `TimerThread.resume`, allowing to poll the thread's state in `Timer.instance`Strangely, I was not able to reproduce this issue when being connected to the pc (i.e. a power source).

Scanning pauses when I stand still, but doesn't resume when I start movingSome time ago there was a Stumbler update which was supposed to pause scanning when you stopped moving, in order to save battery.That seems to work, however, since that time, I experience a large unscanned gaps in my travel routes.If I stand still for a while (e.g. waiting for a tram, or filling gas in a car), Stumbler turns off scanning.But when I start moving, it does _not_ resume scanning.It resumes only when I manually wake the phone.I'm not sure whether this lack of reliable resuming is on purpose or not, but it makes the app much less usable for me.I turn Stumbler on just ocassionally when I go into "uncharted territories".If I realize after a few hours of moving in that area that most of my effort was in vain, because I stood still for a few minutes somewhere and Stumbler turned off hours ago, that makes me...I have found an option in Developer section where I can increase sensitivity and timeout, but still, standing a few minutes on a tram stop will turn it off even with maximum settings.

We include Groovy in our build and updating its version from `2.5.4` to `2.5.5` (and any above) leads to the following exception when we run the build:    Searching through the "old" issue tracker I found just [this similar issue](https://sourceforge.net/p/proguard/bugs/768/), not sure if it is related.I found this because we used the Groovy version that comes with Gradle and they updated it from `2.5.4` to `2.5.8` in Gradle 6 which broke the builds we make.I could try creating a reproduction if you can't figure out what's going on.

Updates to Camel route information causes a large number of requests which clobber the UII'm opening a new one for this, even though I see things that could be potentially related.I've been seeing a problem with multiple versions of hawt.io where anytime a count changes on a Camel route, the dynatree containing the route list immediately becomes empty and so does the rest of the Camel information.I decided to finally see if I could get any information on why the dynatree becomes blank after something like a count changes.If I tell Chrome to show paint rectangles, when I exercise a camel route (causing the data in hawt.io to change in the display), I'll see the Camel Contexts dynatree gets hammered by DOM updatesIf I look in the network timeline, you can see the updates going every 5 seconds and when the Camel data changes, you see a lot of requests going out at the same time.Attached is a screenshot, notice it shows the page was last refresh about 20 seconds previously but shows that in that 20 second period, 72 total ajax requests were made.I think  all the updates from the requests clobber the Camel Contexts dynatree.

If the `findBiomePosition()` method is called for `ChunkManagerPlanet`, it will crash with an NPE because of the `genBiomes` field being null in the super/vanilla class.There may be other similar issues/fields, but this is one crash that occurs for sure.This happens when using for example the Just Enough Dimensions mod, version 1.5.0 or newer (due to some spawn point search related changes in that version, which now causes the `findBiomePosition()` method to get called), if the WorldInfo override is enabled for an Advanced Rocketry dimension (which causes JED to try to find a spawn position for the dimension).And here is the situation at a breakpoint at the line that will crash:

But this is not realistic - imagine a situation: - Country A has 1000 area, and 50 arable area.However, it shouldn't be the case - Country A is heavily "crowded", so that little area left should be much more precious than for country B (much smaller country), of which most area is unoccupied.This is analogous to CarbonReductionhandler model, where the price of reducing carbon depends on the cleanIndustry factor.I would be happy to modify CarbonAbsorptionHandler when CarbonReductionHandler is working.

I'm running into an issue when re-opening a vault that I had opened before without properly terminating Cryptomator before windows shutdown.When I properly shut down Cryptomator before a reboot/shutdown of windows, everything works just finebut I still get a dialog box with the message: "Tresor in Gebrauch" (vault in use)although nothing is accessing the folder at that point in time (windows is finicky/strange when it comes to open files imo).Also when I delete and re-create the folder I can unlock the vault just fine.[cryptomator1.log](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/files/3854065/cryptomator1.log) - stopping cryptomator, restarting itThen I delete the folder and create it anew and unlocking works: [cryptomator0.log](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/files/3854067if not I'm happy to gather additional debug information if needed.
(on windows we do some window arranging when the download dialog pops up b/c it used to show up behind the IDE, perhaps that code isn't working properly w/ qtwebengine?)

Aside from the slightly less important but kindof bothersome lack for things like chat and list formatting, Essentials doesn't seem to recognize any group names established in LuckPerms.And so on... from that point on whenever a member of those groups does a /custom or /info, they should see the appropriate file.However, the only file that is ever accessed is "info.txt" and "custom.txt", so it would seem that Essentials is not gathering that critical group information (the name).

I have a number of libs installed using hexelib, but to make auto-completion work I need to add them to IDEA's project manually., I think I even prefer that over parsing the HXML file and adding those automatically without my knowledge, BUT I'd like to be able to select the lib I'm after by its name and version somehow instead of having to find it on my disk (and having to edit it's name after it's added, because the name is always a version number or "git").

WebSocket client does not report server protocol violations on the WebSocket exceptionWhen a websocket client receives a payload larger than the configured max size, it seems that it just immediately closes the socket without warning - no logs, no exception, no close frame.I may have misunderstood something, but nothing I did short of changing the max sizes in the options gave any indication of the problem being displayed or fixed.

setOnMenuItemClickListener() does not get called when a menu item is clicked.Currently if devs set menu item click listener to a menu item using setOnMenuItemClickListener then the current implementation cannot handle that i.e. even if the menu item gets clicked the listener is not invoked.I tried many things and searched a lot but there seems to be no decent way to handle that.if devs have used MenuItem.setOnMenuItemClickListener in their code.It should be suggested to devs that they use onOptionsItemSelected() instead of attaching a listener to a menu item if they are using InputAccessLib.

On multiplayer servers, the server is in charge of assigning block ids (it has `generateNewIds` set to true in `BlockManagerImpl`), so if a client attempts to retrieve a block by `BlockManager.getBlock` before the first time the server does, it will fail (and return air).This can occur, in particular, if the block is only referred to by a system with `@RegisterSystem(RegisterMode.
checkClusterId breaks the corfu runtime in the management server on cluster reconfiguration.If B is added to A's cluster, then the runtime that runs on B fails with WrongClusterException when fetchLayout is called.This is a reasonable behavior for "external" clients, but for clients that run on the servers, we might want a different behavior (i.e. track the cluster id from the layout since that's the source of truth) .

WebSocket write may hang foreverThe `CLOSE` frame is enqueued and flushed by the `FrameFlusher`, but its callback is not completed yet.This is possible because `FrameFlusher.enqueue()` does not stop accepting frame after a `CLOSE` frame (which may be ok - see below).[T2] Tries to `iterate()` the flusher, but it's a noop because the flusher is currently processing.[T1] `FrameFlusher.succeedEntries()` is called, which calls `FrameFlusher.terminate()` which terminates the `FrameFlusher` with still one entry in the queue.FrameFlusher] Terminating Flusher@b665ba2[queueSize=1,aggregateSize=-1,terminated=[T1] T1 returns but the entry in the queue is never notified, possibly hanging T2 forever.The combination of `FrameFlusher.enqueue()` not checking for `CLOSE` frame, coupled with `FrameFlusher.terminate()` not draining the queue, or alternatively `FrameFlusher.process()` not draining the queue if closed make the events above possible.

"Extension Office" broken with DBeaver 6.0.4 on linuxHere is the plugin that is broken.An error occurred while collecting items to be installed session context was:(profile=DefaultProfile, phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.engine.phases.
For example, the video has a duration of 100 seconds but the last subtitle should only display starting from position 70 seconds and ending at position 80 seconds.I noticed a problem in that I was never getting the onCues() callback to clear the last subtitle at position 80 seconds, so the last subtitle ended up being incorrectly displayed all the way until the end of the video.However, before the TrackSampleTable is created, there is code to edit and/or trim down the samples based on an edit list:      //Thus, endIndex ends up being the index of the last sample which is supposed to clear the last subtitleHowever, this causes editedSampleCount to be one less than sampleCount and thus the last sample gets dropped by the time the TrackSampleTable is created.Also the same change probably needs to be applied a few lines down when endIndex is calculated again.I don't know how this change would impact video or audio tracks, but for me, this change prevented the last sample in the TX3G track from being dropped from the TrackSampleTable() callback at position 80 seconds to clear the last subtitle.

Spring boot dedicated management context causes Tooglz warning during startup   With Togglz 2.5.0.Final and Spring Boot, if we setup the actuator endpoints in a dedicated context (by using the property `management.server.port` to specify a separate port), Spring will emit two `ContextRefreshedEvent` events, one for the main context and another for the management context.This results in the following warning by Tooglz in the log:  `2018-06-29 13:52:41.414  WARN 29069 --- [           main]However, I cannot be certain that the order of these events is always the observed one, and I don't think Spring Boot makes no such guarantees, which means that even if the order is correct now, it may not be in some future version.I think that Togglz should not rely on the order of these events, and I propose that `ContextRefreshedEvent` events originating from the management context should instead be ignored.If you agree with this idea, I can work on a PR to implement it.

RepositoryHostedIndexCreatorTest and MavenIndexCreatorTest fail on MacOS   #, as of commit https://github.com/strongbox/strongbox/commit/868626f3ec2f0616d5110d3c363780ebbcd67ada, the unit tests `RepositoryHostedIndexCreatorTest` and `MavenIndexCreatorTest` both fail on MacOS.Observe the two tests above may fail.The HFS+ filesystem does not support sub-second granularity in the mtime on files.However there appears to be an issue in the JDK resulting in subsecond-granularity information not being available in the Java nio APIs.It appears that recent Travis-CI builds on the master branch have failed for unrelated reasons, but the Travis builds have not been successful since the introduction of 868626f3ec2f0616d5110d3c363780ebbcd67ada.

Hi, I found a problem during creation of async executors proxies in ExecutorBeanPostProcessor.Namely when creating proxies for the executors they are created with null fields inside, which is a bit problematic if you use any delegating executor, e.g. DelegatingSecurityContextSchedulingTaskExecutor.From what I have seen, CGLib uses no-args constructor if no constructor arguments have been passed, hence the fields have null values

When calling some methods from the SDK, like `Client#exchange_rates_get_specific_rate`, there are some edge cases - in particular, the test API Key has no access to the "specific exchange rate" endpoint, so it gets a 403.But the method still tries to parse the date before returning the object, which results in an obscure "nil can't be parsed" sort of error.

When you get civilian dependants as a reward through missions, it overflows the number of astechs and reduces astech hours to zeroThis happens when I take extraction raid missions, specifically the kind where you have to escort civilian vehicles to safety.However if you already at maximum astech capacity this seems to confuse the game, when you advance a day the astech work pool drops to zero hours available.To fix the problem you have to release all temporary astechs and rehire them, then advance the day again.This seems to be a problem specifically when the game adds the astechs you get from missions, because if you simply hire more astechs than you need nothing bad happens.

If you're maintaining a linked files directory, and you run "Rename attachments", then immediately run "Rename attachments" again, ZotFile will add a "2" (or a "3", etc.)to the end of the filename, because it detects a collision between the file's _current_ name and its "new" name.It'd be great if ZotFile saw that this wasn't really a rename and left things alone without adding extra 2s and 3s to all your filenames.(You might, for example, want to do a "Select all" -> "Rename attachments" if you changed the ZotFile naming pattern.If that resulted in _any_ file collisions, though, then you'd get unnecessary numbers on some of your filenames.

The UI menu for launch configurations freezes completely and refuses to subsequently open after switching to the overview for the GWT launch configuration.Eclipse is often waiting a long time for background work to complete, which delays many user actions like saving of a file and rebuilding the workspace.Since this is pretty much a show stopper that makes Eclipse nearly unusable for us, we started investigating the cause and found it in `ProjectBoundSdk.createClassLoader()` (in `GwtSdk.java`), which is called when the `getVersion()` method is used to retrieve a string for the SDK's version number.I don't know if this is something that's specific to Gradle Buildship or if it is done the same way in other project types.The `GWTProjectValidator`. - The `LaunchConfigurationUpdater` calls this several times, which in turn gets activated whenever the `LaunchConfigAffectingChangesListener` detects changes to the classpath.If it's missing, we fall back to whole classpath lookup thing, but that case shouldn't ever happen again for us if the project is set up correctly.We could confirm that this change solves the perceived problems.

So, my issue is, whenever I try to start a game, join a game or start searching for ladder 1v1, the client will give me the following error message: `You are already in a game or haven't run the connectivity test yet`.Now, I do realize that this message is returned by the server but using the old FAF client, I can join/start/ladder normally, so I would assume it's either an issue in the client parsing the server response, or this client using another APII can attach the full log if you want to, not sure how much information it discloses, so I'll just post a snippet for now

Postgres COPY FROM STDIN fails on data containing string delimitersImmediately following this statement, Flyway appears to skip reading ~8500 lines and continue processing the file.Surprisingly, since the sections where Flyway stops and restarts reading the file end on valid statements, no errors get thrown!The issue was initially caught by developers when they found expected data was missing from a handful of tables.Since no errors were thrown from Flyway, it has been difficult to ascertain what the precise issue is.Suspect it has something to do with Flyway parsing statements and getting hung up on some of the additional markup language which may contain reserved sql words and symbolsReading and executing all statements in file just as if it was imported via Postgres command line.

It reliably stops after 30 minutes or so.I can be using the Shield for something else, or not using it at all, but Syncthing will always stop itself after 20-30 minutes or so.After Syncthing dies, I can't restart the Syncthing service without plugging a mouse into my Shield TV - because I can't hit the 'Restart' button without a mouse (see issue #486).The app does not seem to 'repair' itself from this state, I _have_ to hit the 'Restart' button.It seems that Force-Stopping the app and launching it again does restart the Syncthing service.Syncthing continues running in the background, or at least is able to restart itself in the event of a failure.

When a player tries to use a piston to move a track to an empty square with another track next to the empty square, multiple tracks will fall, and the console will report an error, which will not be logged.Then when players cooperate with some of the module's automated placement/pickup devices and cycle through them, the console will keep reporting errors that are difficult to use.(even if it is not automated, players can brush the rails indefinitely by right-clicking the mouse, causing the console to keep reporting errors)In addition, this problem seems to lead to the probability that the game thread is stuck in the background, and the player will disconnect, but the server can still be searched, and the server will show that the player is online, even if the plug-in is automatically restarted, there will be no response.(it is not 100% certain at the moment, but when the rail brush machine is turned off, there has never been any jam phenomenon)  当玩家试图使用活塞将一个轨道移动到一个空的方块上，而在这个空方块旁边存在另外一个铁轨，就会掉落多个铁轨，同时后台报错，并且这个报错不会被记入日志。 然后，当玩家使用一些模组的自动放置/拾取设备的设备并循环使用这些设备时，控制台将不断地报错，并难以使用。(即使不是自动的，玩家也可以通过右键鼠标无限刷铁轨，从而导致控制台不断报告错误) 而且这个问题貌似会导致后台出现概率游戏线程卡死，玩家将断开连接，但是依旧可以搜寻到服务器，服务器会显示玩家在线，即使是自动重启插件工作，也无反应。(暂时不能100%确定，但是在刷铁轨机器关闭的时，从来没有出现过卡死现象)

I was trying to upgrade `fastutil` from version 6.5.6 (an ancient version from Jun 14, 2013) to the latest, version 8.3.0, when I came across a really insidious multi-part bug.The tl;dr is that there's a bug in RM3, which will affect all regressions.In the current implementation, when estimating the relevance model for the feedback docs, we truncate each individual feedback document:This was probably done for performance reasons, although query latency really isn't affected.on my iMac Pro, query latency doesn't increase with that line removed.but it doesn't consistently perform tie breaking_.This means tie breaking is _implementation specific_, which means that the fastutil upgrade changed the tie-breaking behavior, which means that different terms are selected from documents, which changes the results.To prevent future issues along these lines, implement consistent tie-breaking behavior in the `FeatureVector` implementation.
First two lengths are ignored, last one is used and is computed wrong.The left-shift is by 8 bits, while it must be by 7.In most cases it works (for lengths < 128), in rare cases it produces invalid length and array overflow afterwards, making entire playback to fail.

Putting a mapping with an empty request body throws a NullPointerExceptionI have been struggling with an issue lately caused by my own fault of providing a valid request body when attempting to add a mapping to an existing index.The issues is caused by https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/a059a6574a1c270ccc28ddec1671888fb0cfba28/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/xcontent/XContentFactory.java#L213 which returns null if the input stream is empty.While this is fine, the real problem lies in `XContentHelper.convertToMap()` which does not properly check for `null`.and I'm more like asking to yield a proper exception in case a developer is as dumb as me and fails to provide a proper request body.

` `mvn package`  Looks like the 2.0 build is broken.
The API contract for `Vertx.cancelTimer()` appears to indicate that if it returns true, the timer has been successfully canceled.However, the timer handler is not properly synchronized with the timer flag, so the handler can see the `cancelled` flag is false and start the handler execution before the CAS in the `cancel()` method runs.Currently, we have to do our own synchronization around timers to ensure that when a timer fires indicating a timeout, we are guaranteed the handler does not also execute.It would be better if `InternalTimerHandler.handle()` also did a `cancelled.compareAndSet(false, true)` and only executed the handler when the CAS is successful, ensuring that canceled timers are guaranteed not to execute their handlers.

Everything works, except when both are playing animations, it's all messed up.Even if both players have different materials and textures, it won't play correctly.So my guess is, that if an object is added after it was ended, it has inherited the last sprite coordinates being displayed.So I tried to go around this by playing the initial sprite once when the object is ended, but it doesn't help much.It's very strange, but it plays the animation of the first player 3 times in a row, and then it plays the animation of the second player 1 time, and so on.I checked if the animations are somehow connected, but I can't seem to find the connection.

Hi,  We are using SentinelServersConfig and during the tests we observed that if a slave is down, and sentinel properly reports this by putting the s_down flag, Redisson still considers it at initialization and during the operation tries to connect to it.This affects badly the performance, since RoundRobin tries periodically send though that slave.As I see, the SentinelConnectionManager constructor does not check for the "s_down" flag when initializes the list of available slaves, thus the Redisson snapshot of slave status does not reflects the status of slave servers.

### Actual behavior Sometimes HttpClient does not read inbound data from connections obtained from connection pool.Because of this it fails to process replies causing those waiting for them to freeze.When such channel is returned back to connection pool its auto-read property is set to false, which in turn freezes read operations for subsequent requests re-using it.if (msg instanceof FullHttpResponse) { 				super.onInboundNext(ctx, msg); 				onHandlerTerminate(); 			}  With the following fix it starts working as expected:  			if (msg instanceof FullHttpResponse) { 				super.onInboundNext(ctx, msg); 				channel().config().setAutoRead(true); 				onHandlerTerminate
First time it failed without any error messages in the outputs panel (although it appeared to be frozen, so maybe it was a timeout).There was an event indicating a failure.In any case non of this worked and there were no errors I could find (even looking in the console where the Che container was running) to help me find out why it was failing.

Popout seems to die when re-opening the main app (or resuming playback)   - [x] I carefully read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/HEAD/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and agree to them.[x] I checked if the issue/feature exists in the latest version.- [ ] I did use the [incredible bugreport to markdown converter](https://teamnewpipe.github.io/CrashReportToMarkdown/) to paste bug reports.This has been an issue in NewPipe for a couple of years, but I never got around to sending a bug report (since there was no real "crash" to paste in an issue).Effectively, the issue is that (seemingly randomly) when you have a popout video playing the popout will die when you re-open the main app.This also happens sometimes when you try to resume a paused video some time after you paused it.I can try to rustle up a video of it (if I can get a useful reproducer), but I'm opening this issue for visibility to hopefully get some sort of resolution.I've had this issue on a Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, OnePlus 1, OnePlus 5T, and I've seen other people hit this issue as well after I recommended they use NewPipe.

I am attempting to write unit tests for RPC systems without mocking stubs, which would be lovely if it worked.The 1.0.1 release notes imply that this is now deterministic (after the removal of the `grpc-ready` thread pool, which was causing issues for me before), so I expected to see determinism in my unit test, and for the server handler to be called on the same thread that made the stub method call.The RPC method is a client-side streaming RPC, but I don't know if that is relevant.its `scheduledExecutor` might fix it, but I don't know if there's some reason it's not done that way.

What appears to happen is that netty issues a connect request to the proxy, however the next request, which I would expect to be the upgrade request is not correct.WebSocket ClosedIt's also not clear if it's reading the response from the proxy server before sending the https request.It appears that the websocket is closed when a HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established is received from the proxy server, which is intrepreted as an invalid response.

As soon as I crafted a Powerglove from MachineMuse's Modular Power Suits mod, I noticed this problem.Basically if you just craft a Powerglove then equip it on your hotbar, all your conduit facades go transparent.I realize that Ender IO is checking if the Powerglove can act as a wrench, which is great.it is detecting the Powerglove as a Wrench even if you don't have the OmniWrench upgrade module selected or installed.Facades should only go transparent when holding a Powerglove AND having the OmniWrench Module selected..

*Describe the bugAfter quickly leveling skills with giant skill crystals, I got Anima to 100 and got Anima armor and quickly put it on while in Creative (was looking at durability of stuff).But as soon as I switched to survival the armor popped off of me, but I still had the protection.When I get hit more copies of the armor appear in my inventory.If I attempt to scroll over them in the hotbar they get away from the currently selected slot.Though it seems I can still interact with the invisible pieces and take them off.Though going in creative and pressing the red x button doesn't delete them, I had to manually drop them to get rid of them.but I put mine on before the level 100 fanfare played.Not sure if this has been already reported but just in case.Hopefully this doesn't delay 3.0 lol

However, I realized that mongo server throws exception due to missing operator.
In Java class code (maybe in other place, didn't check), if you have a string containing the pattern 'cndNamespace:[A-Za-z]+', the plugin will try to match against declared nodes.If the nodetype doesn't exist, the editor will mark the string as if there were an error.But sometimes you need to reference a property that has the same pattern (for example, jcr:title) and is not a node, and the error will be there, even if you know that's not an error.I don't know if that affects the build process, but it's middly disturbing.I think the plugin should warn about the fact that it's not a known node, but not mark the string as if there was an error.

Obfuscator breaks jars without processors (Bad ASM?)Bug Report I was testing the obfuscator with some jars and it was breaking some of the classes without any processors on whatsoever.The jars would not play nice with other obfuscators or decompilers (because they were broke)I not only disabled all processors, but I completely removed them from the code, I applied function isObfuscatorEnabledForClass(node) {     return false; } and everything, and it is still breaking jars.I found that kilo best represents this bug, so here is a compiled version for you to test out.Try to obfuscate on top of Jobf with something like Radon or another obfuscator and you'll get multiple errors about failing to read/write classes; errors that weren't there on the unobf version.This only happens when jars are obfed with jobf, and since no processors are applied, I would assume it's a bug in your reading/writing part of the obfuscator.it told me WARNING: Could not load net/minecraft/command/common/CommandReplaceItem.class

[This stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6138396/custom-tomcat-valve-contained-in-web-app-war-file) claims that custom Valves don't work when placed in `WEB-INF/lib` because a different classloader is used, but from the linked [Tomcat documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/class-loader-howto.html) (link updated for Tomcat 8), I cannot see anything that would explain it, except for the fact that different class loaders exist.However, if I copy the JARs described in the article from `WEB-INF/lib` to `tomcat/lib`, everything works.
There are no problem with the videos themselves, as trying a playback again will not produce any error.The only thing I can think of, and I’m only guessing, is that maybe there is some type of OS lock when the system is in the process of releasing the MediaCodec used for encoding, making ExoPlayer to fail.Although, besides the fact that I don’t know how long does the OS take to release the codec resources, I don’t see why ExoPlayer would need a video codec which was used only for encoding, and not decoding.

My expectation would be that Hono would still be able to handle the amount it can handle, but it looks to me as if the HTTP adapter mostly breaks down.If such a request cannot be handled in a specific amount of time (default 200ms)then it will be aborted and the HTTP request failed.That would also mean that, if requests stay longer than 200ms in some kind of queue on the EventBus side, then they would time out on the Protocol adapter side.A possible solution for that problem would be to delay the accept of the request until the response was send.

#3840 breaks PathResource so that it behaves like a FileResource, and breaks some projects which depend on the newer Path API in the Java runtime.Now, with a File short-circuiting to the default filesystem, Path resources do not work as intended.Reverting back to 9.4.* fixed the issue for me, but I will not be able to use 10.Simply, using a File instead of a Path causes any relatively-pathed resources to break out of the intended encapsulation back to the default file system, breaking Path abstractions.This may qualify the issue as a blocker for release of 10.

However, in about 20% of the cases, the Bootsfaces components do not render.I can solve this problem in one of the following ways:- Undeploy and redeploy the application - Undeploy, shut down Payara, remove the OSGI cache, restart Payara, redeploy   - Undeploy, shut down Payara, remove the OSGI cache, reboot the machine,In 100% of the cases, one of these steps will fix the problem.If the same EAR can be made to work by restarting the container, etc., it does not seem all that likely that the problem is in the way the EAR is built.There do not seem to be any exceptions thrown in these methods.I also tried breakpoints in various other renderers, such as b:panel, etc., but none are ever called.It seems that Faces is skipping rendering the Bootsfaces components entirely in the Render Response Phase.But in (roughly) 20% of the cases, something seems to go wrong in deployment, and from that point on, Faces does not seem to call any of the Bootsfaces renderers during Render Response Phase.I'm more than willing to continue to debug the situation if you can offer any suggestions as to where to look.I've noticed a few other posts alluding to the same problem, so I don't think this is an isolated instance (though it might not be very common).We think Bootsfaces is terrific and would like to continue using it, but this issue makes each deployment a bit of a guessing game.There are no other complicated libraries included (e.g., my project does not use Shiro, etc.).I could probably create a simple demo application if needed, but then in ~ 80% of the cases it will work perfectly, so I'm not sure how helpful that would be.

- broker starts triggering creating `/managed-ledger` - cluster-metadata-initializer attempts to initialize cluster metadata and fail since `/managed-ledger` is already there.However I think we also need to improve the logic on initializing cluster metadata to better handle such corner cases.

AtlasDB clients cannot communicate via load balancersThis would be useful when setting up AtlasDB product in a cloud environment with custom certificates, as it makes the management of those certificates easier.Here is one example of where this breaks:  1.When another node wants a timestamp, it continues to ask the load balancer for the old leader, since this is cached in our remote proxy 3.The node asking for the timestamp doesn't consider this a retriable exception, and propogates the error up to the user, instead of trying another oneWe can resolve the above case by making 503 a retriable exception, but we also need to take care to ensure that we don't introduce performance issues.
