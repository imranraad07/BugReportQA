Can you retry this? I remember to fixed this shortly afterwards.

Or chunked transfer encoding, which happens at a different layer?

Maybe we should not publish the library if the category is wrong?  BTW, even doing so, a library can always switch valid category between releases, so we can always end with different versions of the same library belonging to different categories. And IMHO it seems wrong to deny this possibility... 
Maybe you changed core dep and new tests appeared.What do you mean about branch? You can fix jelly directly and check that there is no plain html in some variable (then they need to be not escaped).  We can release some 0.9-beta-1 for testing. I'm very busy right now, but can join for testing.  
Can you try to run the jar version from the terminal? This should produce some log visible log statements we can hopefully use for debugging. Thanks!

Can you suggest a minimal sample, that could be turned into a unittest for this?
However, we have a unit test that verifies the behavior at hand => https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/hateoas/client/TraversonTest.java#L234-L248  Do you have a particular URI or hypermedia JSON fragment that actually makes the code blow up?

Does that means it is a clientside problem ? @sleshchenko @garagatyi  ![screenshot_20171218_142401](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1651062/34106019-4700f550-e3ff-11e7-84a5-ec82f87c9e4d.png)

could it a problem of visibility in the specific case of your project ? 
Can you describe more about it? What's the recipe like? Does it crash for every recipe or just certain recipes? 
Can you try to set the acl/right to the specific user you are trying and not to a group on folder C:\cache ? see : https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/IcedTea-Web/issues/184#issuecomment-493107043  Also can you confirm the presence of many empty folder into c:\cache named 1, 2, 3, until 10 (retry) ?

Shall we close the issue, then ?  
Which version of growthcraft are you using?
May I ask **how** it is shown or indicated to the users?  **On AIMSICD-Persistancy:** AIMSICD seems to just quit when clearing all opened Apps, even if the persistance-service is enabled. Would be cool if AIMSICD could really hook as deep as possible.

Would be great if you can provide the code that you are using that causes this error? Would be great if you can include the (invalid) generated code as well. Maybe it is a similar but slightly different case here.

What's your owncloud news version? 
could you include the version?  (and perhaps the graph you are trying to visualize?)  The problems is that the error is hidden because the exception throwing mechanism throws an exception :( 
Would you have a code example?  Also a few common problems to diagnose/workaround: - are you values immutable? - is key hashing consistent?  - try to disable cache (`DBMaker.cacheDisable()`) and do not enable async writer.  - possibly transaction problem? commit have to be called to persist updates, or disable transactions.

Can you post (or email to me) the file `<glowroot dir>/tmp/preload-some-super-types-cache`?  In the meantime, the problem looks like it was caused by 6fb2204d4c4c0337ed910d46df6649dd8de641aa (which was introduced in 0.13.1), so you should be ok for now if you downgrade the agent to 0.13.0.  Thanks, Trask

Shouldn't it have the same behaviour? 
Did you debug this part to check the behavior?
maybe we should create a new project, something like "HR", fund it and send payment from there?

What's the status of this issue? I face the exact same problem. You can easily reproduce it using the below trivial code:     public void func1() throws Exception {         throw new Exception("Bla Bla...");     }          public void func2() {         try {             func1();         }catch(Exception je) {             Log.p(je.toString());         }     }  Now simply call func2()

Can you see if this still occurs in 4.0.3? I think it might have been caused by them trying to take damage, and being thrown out through walls, that should now be dealt with.  I also fixed the issue with not being able to link to controllers from inside the lift itself. 
Will this be fixed in the foreseeable future? I am not used to Vaadin code at all, but if someone could provide some pointers on how to fix this, I would be willing to create a pull request.

Should it simply remove the tool if it fails to create the plot because the name already exists? 
Do you by any chance have custom images on your accounts? Do all the tokens have the same refresh time (eg. default 30 seconds)?

We are about to switch over our docks to use this format - it's a lot simpler.  Please run the "nightly" version.  https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/docs
Does this help?    Note that OkHttp is rather aggressive about what data it _stores_ in the cache and does most validation on the backend. 
How does test tags correlate with work items declaration? I was trying to identify tags duplicates running: select test_id, count(*) from stage.test_tags group by test_id, tag_id having count(*) > 1; but nothing was found.

Does it work if you inject directly into the field or into the JAX-RS method?
Can you provide a reproducer? `VaultReactiveBootstrapConfiguration` checks on the presence of Project Reactor and WebFlux. We don't check for the presence of Reactor Netty.

Should optional/wildcard be specified somehow? 
Can you give a try using the following option (before creating the reasoner)  ? `OpenlletOptions.RETURN_NON_PRIMITIVE_EQUIVALENT_PROPERTIES = false;`  This may be related to a recent change (or not). In both cases, to debug this I will need an ontology that produce enable the exception.
Can you be more explicit / post some code? I can't reproduce it.

Do you have a mod list and the type of server? These information are not enough, as those multiblocks might be good on the server but somewhat it does not sync correctly onto the client. 
Did you choose the country with the dropdown? I just tried to select and save "Uruguay" on beta and it worked (see https://beta.oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:53ffda91-eebb-4e08-8ab3-eb55b04b8899). 
how are you reusing the instance? Do you have any example code?

Do you have a .fai index file?
What version of IDEA are you using?  You might also try version 0.9.3, which you can pick up in the releases section (https://github.com/TiVo/intellij-haxe/releases).  We fixed a problem with unit tests for other languages that only cropped up when haxe support was enabled.  I'm not sure that they're related, though. 
Can you send it to me please? It is located there:  > saveactions_settings.xml: The settings file is saved by project in the .idea folder. That file can be committed in git thus shared in your development team. If you are using the default locations, it would be in ~/IdeaProjects/PROJECT_NAME/.idea/saveactions_settings.xml

Maybe try to use embedded file manager like this one http://www.openintents.org/filemanager/ ?  > The OpenIntents file manager allows you to browse your SD card, create directories, rename, move, and delete files.

Why create a new issue when it is perfectly clear on the existing 1.8.3 PR (#503) that this is an issue that is being worked on? If you are using those builds you should at least be aware of the conversation surrounding them.  
What's the status on this? What needs to be done? I think that this is a really nice (and long overdue) addition to the LocalExecutor.  What about adding an extra argument to the execute methods of `LocalExecutor` instead of having a new `DistributedLocalExecutor`? 
How are you changing your language?
Could you elaborate a bit more?  I think I see what you're getting at but I want to be sure I'm understanding you.

Would you mind taking a look?

Did you read my comment? I said that updating wouldn't fix the state your quests are now in. It only fixes the original cause so it doesn't happen again.
Can you post your config so I can see if it's generating properly?
What other mods do you have installed? When testing with the 2.1.0 release on Curse alongside Actually Additions (as shown in your image) I can see that all clusters have their oreDict names. I wonder what other mods might be toying with the oreDict :V

Do you have any stacktrace that could help on investigation?  Thanks

Can you please confirm that you migrating backed up copy and not the original database?
What exactly are you trying to do here? Retrieve a single entity instance based on its ID? I think we need to add more arguments or methods to allow it, or you should add a query param that id equals the desired id. Or do you really have / in your entity name?

What's the output of these commands?   
Can you please provide items and persist configuration?  Thanks, Thomas E.-E. 
Can you get the customer to provide the output of `mvn dependency:tree` in the affected project? I suspect there's another dependency resulting in `commons-codec:1.4` being pulled in.

can you attach a screenshot? I don't understand what do you mean 
Do you have the same problem when serviceRelativeUrl is set to other value?

Shouldn't this also happen for the main repository [here](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/4c5d58946bb2a4df350e8d19c0ba9f2b4885bb2f/web-bundle/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/resources/RouteResource.java#L156) as well?

Can you please provide more info?
Do other pdf's crash too? What device is this on? We have other crash reports too with any pdf's so there must be something common between them.

Would you mind trying a snapshot build of current master to verify the fix works for you?

Did you mean "double click in the task name cell clears task name"? Because it doesn't delete a task (or I don't understand how to reproduce it).
Can you reproduce this issue every time you run the crawler? And can you check if you have this issue with another data store (like the default one)?   @essiembre why do you think the .job file already exists? Should the code handle this possibility? 
What do you think ?
Can you give an example GC code? I'm not sure if I really got the problem description... 
However you did set skip-used-one-time-kits-from-kit-list: true in the config.yml, so is that what you mean as a bug (like it doens't hide them anymore)?

Do you have a simple app that demonstrates the problem? 
Do you use the Rest Client 1.1.1 version and REST API 1.1.6?

Could you say what db do you use? Thanks in advance
Could you please post the crashlog?
Can you please report which API call is failing on BK ? it is not clear from the stacktrace
Does this only occur in single player, servers, or both?  Does this only occur for machines straddling multiple chunks?
where did you get forge Forge 10.13.2.1307 ?? the latest version that i can find is 1291 ,, it's probably something to do with Waila config EIO option appear in Waila config when installed try messing with those , or use a dev version of EIO and see if this problem still occur 
Do you have an example of a "corrupted score"?  (And maybe compare the score metadata with the beatmap metadata?)  That'd be helpful to have.
Can you try again using this? This build should include some more useful debug information. I can't reproduce this on my own machine.  [recaf-1.15.1-debug.jar.zip](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/files/3292912/recaf-1.15.1-debug.jar.zip)  ***  In the meantime if you download the source code and compile via `mvn package` it will generate a proper JDK 11+ compliant jar. 
Can you check if the crash occurs with _just_ BetterStorage and NEI and if not remove mods until the issue disappears? 
Who did you send the private message too? 
Do you have something like below? ![screenshot from 2016-08-01 14-40-14](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99590/17284493/1c8707ec-57f6-11e6-8f8e-67ecb021bc7b.png) 
However, if you are running on the latest version and currently manage to reproduce the bug on all worlds created, would it be possible for you to create a small world with a setup that reproduces the issue and upload it somewhere, so I can have a look at it in my development environment?  #376  
Do you have an example where this is not happening? 
Can you check your version of bash? Please try to replace this conditional operator with `if groups $(whoami) | grep "docker" &>/dev/null; then` Is it working in with that change?

What OS on host?
Maybe because the VNC Viewer only have one cursor?
Could you let me know when `5.1M2` will release? Thanks.
What version are you using?  The line-based text importer shouldn't be doing any interpretation/conversion of the text at all.  Does this happen immediately after project creation or after you've applied other transformations?  Can you provide a small sample project that demonstrates the issue? 
Could the command be parameterized so it take the file name? We used to have that in the commands macro? cc @RomanNikitenko and @azatsarynnyy 
What mods and version of MTS are you running?  I seem to recall someone having this issue with Sponge, but I'm not sure.
Could you provide some detailed info?  NVM, I just need to pause before switching client.
Could you try using the latest build: https://luckperms.github.io/ ?  
Could the rat have been under him and that's why he was highlighted?

Can you give an idea of how often this happens?
Can you send in a pull request?
What is `context` in your `Glide.with`, is it the service object or `getApplicationContext()`?

Could you create a small reproducer?
May be related to recent changes to when rockets are allowed to take off, are you launching from a planet or station?
Do you get this error using the 1.0.0.Alpha2 release? If so, you could try building the latest master yourself, as it contains a fix for this issue (#112). The next release, 1.0.0.Beta1 contains this fix and will be out soon. 
What version of Neo4j and Spring Data Neo4j / setup are you using? 
Could you provide a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the issue?
What is the output of mode con on your system?  Thanks Axel 
Does this happen on all versions of the SDK? Does this only happen on OSX?
Would it be possible for you to join my discord at https://discord.gg/9J7yhUP ? I'm going to do a build and test, but I'd like to have you test as well before I push to Curse.
Does the same thing happen if you try with the same luck tool, but replace a part for a sponge one? Sounds like embossments are just missing a compatibility check, but it could be a big with Sponges trait
Can you test it? 
Which Version are you using?
How much RAM have you allocated for a workspace?
Does adding `CloseableReference.closeSafely(ret.first);` to the line below this one https://github.com/facebook/fresco/blob/master/imagepipeline/src/main/java/com/facebook/imagepipeline/producers/ResizeAndRotateProducer.java#L161 make any difference? That is a bug that will be fixed in the next release.   If not, do you get anything in logcat?   Thanks for your help. 
Can you pls verify if it was fixed in the meantime?
Maybe you could help us debug and fix this problem? OpenPDF is volunteer-based. 
Do you need property only? Env variable will do the same. And users can define them
Could you show me the demo, and which version of agent are you used?
Can you give us some more details please? What phone do you use,  OS, app version etc. Did you already try to clean the cache?
Do you know if it exists?  The import did not fail, because the imported file does not contain any data on which to evaluate the expression. The minor issue here is that the error message is a bit unclear (why couldn't it be created? because it was invalid).   
Does the garbage go away when you click on "Full Log"? 
Could you let me check out the font you created and give me a sequence of keystrokes that reproduces the issue? That will definitely help me track it down.
Would you mind sharing the class you are using this library in? It will help me understand the cause. 
Could this be a good time to re-raise the issue about automated testing? At least one code import and export for each (partly) supported language would help with issues like these.
Could you please doublecheck your scenario and confirm that you really get the exception with no messageType property set at all?  Thanks 
can you ask him for his logs? 
Do you have a stack trace? 
Would that have any additional value? It's probably more complex than just giving everything a versioned name though.
What version of Spring Boot are you using? The line numbers in the stack trace don't match up with Spring Framework 4.3.6.RELEASE which is the version using by Spring Boot 1.4.4.RELEASE and 1.5.1.RELEASE. 
Does the crash only happen when you relog? Is it reproducible?
How can this be triggered?
Could you check error view (or log file) for any errors? https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Log-files 
Which of these are failures here? 1. That the message "due to unsupported checksum type" appears to be wrong? 2. that we log a stack-trace? 3. there was a timeout? 
Can you give more details about what map, what theme is not working? 
Do you mean the `Full Application Restart` button? When I click that one several times I do not see this problem (but I do get another, so it needs work). 
Did you set that field to true and/or installed the LunarG SDK? 
Maybe modtweaked recipes I guess? 
Do you have autocompletion enabled?
Can we update gestalt? 
Would that make sense?  As it stands now, it really doesn't make any sense that you hit a `debugger;` statement and just see obfuscated code.
Would you be able to either upload the crash to http://pastebin.com or get me a public facing link?
What mod(s) are you experiencing this with? Because this sounds like a bug.
Which version of the iOS client have you used? Was it only the images or the whole row missing? 
Can I see a picture of your setup? Make sure that both chests are on the same wired network.
why do you say that? I've seen that in the code of inputText, the renderLabel is managed and also in the Renderer.. so, where is the problem? can you explain me please? 
What environment are you using for this? 
Can you upload any screenshot or video to show this problem? I'm not able to reproduce it. 
Can you see if this has been fixed as of the [latest release](https://github.com/jagrosh/Selfbot/releases/latest)?
What version of spring-cloud-function are you using?
Do you have a case where a master is referenced by its name? AFAIK Redis accepts only IP addresses and refuses to accept hostnames because it does not want to resolve hostnames. 
which version did you update from and which did you update to? Need more details whenever you have these kinds of problems 
Can you point to a link that contains the mentioned `doWithRestTemplate(…)` reference?
Which build of nukkit are you using?
Can you not get actual device models, build numbers etc?
Does it happen with only TFC installed? 2. If so, what specific steps are you doing that causes a crash (world, tp, seed, etc.)
Could add an example for your graph and how you create the graph? Config, Schema creation and graph.  This should only filter internal vertices.
Did you test this with a very recent build? I made changes in the navigation apps to no longer use the resource of the activity but instead of the application: cdd9939761c09dc0b00c825cfbab80aa198348f2 This might be related. 
What happens? What do you expect to happen?
Can you give some more details, like: What is your storage medium/plugin? Is it conceivable the multichunk was altered in any way? Can you reproduce this starting from a clean repo? 
Did he try to transform an existing Deep Tank into a High Oven? 
Can you please provide a small sample that illustrates the problem? 
Can you check if the CNL is shown in the registered devices menu in the uploader? Is there any error shown on the CNL itself?
can you change docker compose to use my public server ?    Can you send me more logs ? they may be in the data/ directory ?
Maybe it got lost in this refactoring?  https://github.com/togglz/togglz/commit/fa17ecc0261f71bb94757d7b999e75a4500f5888#diff-4feaff2a3f4df2be606b35f9f19104bf  Yeah, sure, we should add the missing entry to the provider file.
Can you confirm on 2.0-SNAPSHOT if the issue is gone? Also take note that it's a follow up issue on https://github.com/GwtMaterialDesign/gwt-material/issues/569  Fixed via https://github.com/GwtMaterialDesign/gwt-material/commit/a9d6e94bf0ab02a3adec45b907823ca564a55ec4
What version of Fabritone are you using ?
What key do you have assigned for the Android Ability Use ? What key do you press to teleport or to use the shield. 
Could you have a look?
Which sample are you referring to? 
Did you see it before as well?  Also our themes in the showcase seem to be broken a bit. For example, if you select readable first, then lumen, the style is a bit... mixed. 
Would you mind to reproduce it in a unit test? 
Should we still be able to stop bridges early with climbing tokens? 
Can you provide screenshots and a crash log?
What skinned version of Android do you use? 
Can you provide logs from Android Studio LogCat?
How did you use Crouton? As long as I can not reproduce the issue I can not do anything about it. 
Wouldn't it be more efficient to fix and use a constant (`static final String`, some random UUID) instead of creating a new UUID everytime the instance is created? (I'm genuinely asking.)
Could you put it here? Thanks! 
does this still happen? haven't been able to replicate it 
When you do the reset, you are teleported to your old island, correct? 4. What does the spamming error say? I cannot read it because the resolution is too low. 5. If you do /island after you fall, do you end up on your new island? 
Does that apply to us as well? 
What is the `file_picker` version that you are using?
Would you be able to upload the sample file you were using to https://www.openmicroscopy.org/qa2/qa/upload/ for testing?
Can you post a snippet of your layout?? 
Can you post a screenshot of the subscription manager page you see only? 
Which version of BK do you have?
What "error code"?  We can't read minds and would be happy, if you could provide us with more informations
Would this be caused my requests executing concurrently? 
Can you edit zap.sh and change the line: `JMEM="-Xmx512m"` to `JMEM="-Xmx1024m"`and try again? You can change this via the ZAP UI, but thats not much use in daemon mode ;) In the next version of ZAP you'll be able to change this via a command line switch. 
What Android version are you running? And can you check that you don't have any battery savings, battery optimizations or data savings settings enabled that might prevent the app from running in the background?
Could you please share what the error message is? 
Can I take it?
Would you please help provided a detailed steps to reproduce this? 
What do you mean to ground level? Y == 0 or just a bit into the ground (i.e. one or two blocks lower than it's supposed to teleport)? 
Do workspaces fail to start when attempting to start them in an organization? Can users create own individual workspaces and start them?
Can you please provide a screenshot of the IDE when launching the debug action, specifically the Console tab of the debugger?  
Do you have an intake somewhere near? 
Might related to Windows environment since we both have the same eclipse version? I assigned Jens in order to check this.  
Which version are you using?
How can this be solved? Showing images separately from text might not be a good idea as it would lose context. As can be demonstrated by the post in question itself.
Does this affect travis or just local testing? 
How much complex? Do you use Picasso/Ion/async tasks? Some details about the hierarchy both of the card and the contentView (that is wrapping the AdapterView)?  
Can you please give a small, reproducible example?
Can you provide an example? 
Can you try to reproduce it with vanilla js and bootstrap?  Thanks 
Could you run this again with `mvn clean verify -X` to get the full error stacktrace?
Do you have a China access token? If not, please contact Mapbox via https://www.mapbox.com/contact/sales to start the process of receiving this special access token.  https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo#setting-the-mapbox-access-token has instructions on how to set the Mapbox access token in this project.
Do we know if there is a schema available for the Status XML?  Honestly, i was unaware of this setting in mythtv.  I am gonna enable it and see what extra data comes back.  A schema would help take all the guess work out of it, however. 
Can you please provide more information on how to reproduce this? A video or an example project would be ideal.
Do you able to login from the web interface?
May I work on this?
Could you add a full stack trace? An executable demo project (like [these](https://github.com/harawata/mybatis-issues)) is even better. ;) And please use three ticks `` ` `` for code blocks. See the [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for syntax highlighting, etc.. 
why don't you use an HTTP lib to download? 
What about timing, can you install the app on an isolated system and take note of the timing of event? Lastly, map lookup failures could be related to the html templating, maybe empty form fields are submitted without the underlying xquery code designed to handle empty inputs?
Can you make a pull request to fix it?
Can you provide an example of the code that changes the event time? It may be possible that a new event is created but I think you would still need to explicitly add it to your calendar object. In any case the UID property should be unique so we may need to add some deduplication.
Can you try the 2.0 RC7? You can register for the beta program here: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.nextcloud.client
What mods/plugins are you using?
Does this not occur in 2.0.3? 
What were you hoping to gain by creating a `TestRestTemplate` from your existing `RestTemplate`?  My feeling at the moment is that we should drop both of the constructors that take a `RestTemplate`:  - `org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate.TestRestTemplate(RestTemplate)` - `org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate.TestRestTemplate(RestTemplate, String, String, HttpClientOption...)`
Can you share a screenshot?
Do you happen to have the client log?  I need to see if I can figure out the order of events.  What the trace is telling me is that the sound engine is not fully initialized when the ding logic is run.
Could you try replicating this with either PEX 1.23.4 or LuckPerms? We can't guarantee consistent behaviour on the PEX version you're using.  In addition, does this occur on [release builds](https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX) on 1.13.2?  ---  #2166 may affect this, but it seems unlikely.
Might try to add a Side(c/s)-check, when did the crash happen? 
Does that do what you need or are you looking for something different?
Can you create simple project with this problem?  Thanks 
Can you click the JSON button and add that to the issue? It will help us figure out what's up.  -A 
Can you try it with the new version?
Do you mean connection type configuration or connection itself? I mean this prefs page: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398845/70162211-57c7b000-16ce-11ea-928c-1d7189997f5a.png) 
Can you please add a `.get()` after the reply() method and check which exception it throws? Something like this: 
Can you provide simple example?  
Why are people sending bug reports for older versions?  I can see the cover on 0.13.0 beta. So at least i don't have this problem.
Did you try removing `/root/.cache/bazel/_bazel_root/install/e4abe4ff56d8f229afa015dc729c5bd9` as suggested by the error message and did that help?
Would you mind submitting a patch for this? 
Did use quotes?    
Does problem still exists? I can't find version for Nokia 7210, but siemens version works without any bugs.
When does the error occur exactly? 
What is your use case? 
Can you provide a screenshot of it ?
What export format do you use?
Which issues are you seeing in 74rc3? 
Can you describe what you are getting in the results vs what you expect? It's also important to call out if any of the queried fields are part of the ddb range or hash key. 
Does changing the font size (in the settings menu) have any effect? 
Would you be able to open a PullRequest for this and singe the CLA so we can pull it in? It would be great to have that in the next release which is coming very soon 
Do you have any ideas? 
Would it be possible for you to give us access to the search results the user is trying to process in PeptideShaker so that we can try to reproduce the error on our side? 
Can you post up a small example code?
do you mind providing  a PR ?
What about on Windows?
Do you enabled BungeeCord support in the sponge configuration?
Do you rename the files on the server or on device?
What do you mean with current solutions? Gadgetbridge has support for some hardcoded [vibration profiles](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/blob/master/app/src/main/java/nodomain/freeyourgadget/gadgetbridge/devices/miband/VibrationProfile.java)  One could easily change that to add a single vibration. The number of repetitions is already configurable. 
Did you check in the log when starting a new game whether your buildings get loaded? Would give some hints on where to look :) 
Do the schematic files in the schematic folder have the same names as they do in the config file?
Could that be the case? Is that directory (or a parent directory; e.g. the home directory) mounted or something similar?
Could you try 1.2.1 and see if you're still seeing this behavior?  If so, can you check the linked test?  I can't recreate this on master. 
Does your issue also happen in production mode? Your mapper should work as long as it is annotated with `@Provider` which is missing in your reproducer code.
Do you get any other messages when the plugin reloads ?  Also woth mentioning that you should not really have the server reload on a schedule, all that will do is waste some RAM. 
Could you post a minimal version of your `Test.java` that produces this error? Thanks! 
Which version of Big Reactors are you running, and on which version of Forge and CoFHCore?  When you say it "wasn't ejecting", do you mean that it wasn't being ejected into attached pipes/inventories, or that cyanite ingots weren't appearing in access ports at all?  Screenshots would be helpful. 
can you share the hprof file ?
Does it help if the file input format builder accepts GenericDataSource?  In the long run, we want to refrain from the config based parameterization and simply pass parameterized objects. Not exposing the config keys are a step into that direction. 
Can you create us a test account, test if the problem occurs also there and if so send the credentials to tobias at nextcloud dot com with a reference to this issue?
Will be set to null instead`  Does it fail or is it just wordy? Because warnings aren't errors, this alone does not necessarily mean it fails.
Does that come from a named query (I did not look in the code yet)? 
Can you try this build, and see if it helps? https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z-Va5dJW-olRnObiBYhgcR1rB1k-LuC2
Could you create a single Gist with all the files needed to reproduce the issue? 
Can you provide a screenshot with the exact configuration causing it?  Also, check if the problem still occurs in [the most recent version](https://jenkins.ironhide.de/job/Keridos%20Mods/job/FloodLights-1.12/11/) of the mod installed.
Would it be difficult to publish a new point release with this in? Thank you very much! 
What's the workaround?
What version are you using? 
Could you create us a dummy account on your home server ?
Can you say  C# plugin version?  ![](http://klikr.org/5a49acf26583d44e3983581812c7.png)  I think you need only call About -> Check for updates 
will this be looked at this week?  
Can you please confirm what SDK version you are using ?   You could declare the dependency [as shown here](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK#completely-disabling-direct-credit-card-payments). 
Would it be possible if I could work on this? I have an idea as to a possible fix.
Can you make a screenshot? 
Can you confirm? 
Did it result in the same crash? 
Do you have the option to upgrade to 0.8.15 (https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=radiobeacon&fdid=org.openbmap)? 
Could you provide the stacktrace? 
Maybe it has something to do with the JDK version? Since it seems that we are both using Win 8 for these tests, so the only difference left is the JDK. 
Could you provide an anonymized version of the dashboard _before_ the migration? That would help a lot. It is in the `dashboards` collection and has the same id before and after. 
Do you use only one master and one slave, right?
Do you see at least current schema name for DB2/iSeries? Could you post a screenshot with this error?
Should we do the same thing? Or do you think that throwing `IllegalArgumentException`, which is case for negative frequencies now, is better?
Which version of Sleuth are you using?
Did you follow the installation guide? 
Can u send me the complete log files? its in shared/local/Bitsquare. you can open it also under Account/Backup. Do you have another machine where u can try it? I did not get OutOfMemoryErrors reported from others, so I assume its some config issue on that vm. 
Which build are you looking at? 
Can you attach your pool configuration for PostgreSQL? 
Should we just disable or remove the field from the Web UI?
Could you share your argfile? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14052197/69030835-a2c99e00-0a13-11ea-9fd9-bb03f0445f12.png) 
Can I work on this issue? Pointers on how to go about would be appreciated
Do you think any other details/format can help user to understand? Any suggestion @mdehghanim @joh03067  
Does this solve a problem?  What device do you have? 
Which flag are you using? speed or cruiseSpeed?
Can you post your Adapter? 
Can you check the testdatalib table has the service column ?
Can you provide the file in question? If not by GitHub you can also give me some download like in private send it by e-mail. 
Could you please describe about application architecture how app uses Listener and Replicator?  Thanks! 
Can you perhaps share the stacktrace that you are getting?

Which NPC (id number) are you referring to? (There's a lot of them saved there) Can you provide a screenshot of the how the NPC appears in game?
Do any exist and do they look well formed?
What locale are you running the tests in?
How did you set up the database? If there is only a `citydb` but no `citydb_pkg` schema, you did something wrong. Have you followed these [steps](https://3dcitydb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/db-setup-postgis.html)? Which Postgres/PostGIS version are you using?
Does your pipe have a cover? 
Can you try to check that or provide contours source?
What version of the plugin are you using?
Did you also experience that in other VST3s? (I do not have Fabfilter -> if there is a VST2 , is it correct there?)
what are the options, etc?
Do you have logs from this database? Preferably since the creation of a class Report? That is very important.  
Can you provide more information?  All I got from that was that your server crashed (due to a reason which you haven't told me) and that pets weren't saved, without providing any extra information as to why this might have occurred. I'm not psychic and can't read minds ;). 
what kind of odd Routing ?  as i again have this problem ..
However they added a "try...catch" around the call at some point, so what version of NuclearCraft are you using?
Can we close this issue and follow this in issue #1562 ?
Can you show us  the full headers of a request that fails?     
Does that look better? 
Does this still happen without ProtocolSupport?
WhatsApp or telegram?
Can you retest on 982f4ca?
Does the issue persist without Galacticraft? 
Does it work as normal for VDM++? 
What OS and version are you using? Which ZAP installer did you use? 
Do you fix it? 
Would you care for trying out the new 0.9-SNAPSHOT branch? It contains a lot of improvements.

Can you try to make some logs during the sync using logcat? Looking for the Tags TLSClient and TaskWarroirSync.  Which version of mirakel do you use? Due to taskd-api-changes there was a change in the configfiles. So the current configfiles will only work with Mirakel 2.1 and above.

Did CQL-to-ELM report any errors regarding that line of code or did it run smoothly and just produce unexpected ELM?  I'd hope that it would have reported an error since `@12:30:00.000` isn't really a valid construct in CQL.
Does this happen in other clients such as vanilla/OSBuddy?

What is "TaskQueue.access$502"? I think the legitimacy of this race rests on that and the thread safety of ThreadPoolExecutor (and I assume it is, since it's in Java's concurrency package). 
Would you be interested in creating a PR for this? 
can you provide a curl based recreation? Including setting up the index, indexing some sample data, and search that shows the failure? 
Does the browser share its uid with other system components?  I am afraid Google is connecting to the internet in a non-standard way, by doing direct sysyem call. This will probably end up in the limitations section.

Would the .getRow() return null or the Result itself be null? Seems kinda silly that .getRow() would return null if the entire row doesn't exist.  I think you can also try to make use of Result.isEmpty() instead of the null check. 
What version of IDE do you use ? 
What do you think? 
Does it happen only with your libgdx app? Is your device rooted?  EDIT: If you have kitkat maybe it's something related to the new translucent system UI API, see http://developer.android.com/about/versions/kitkat.html

Can you tell me is this happening everytime you advance days? Or is this after advancing multiple days? If you can not upload the cpnx file is there a better screenshot of the issue?
Which project you're using?

What do you use to gather logs?
Did you add the pdf manually or did you use a fetcher? As far as I remember there was nothing changed in the behavior. Maybe a cleanup call is needed. I currently have the code not at hand.

Does anyone know what this comment refers to: https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/blob/master/app/src/main/java/fr/free/nrw/commons/upload/UploadService.java#L133 ?  I've repro'd the bug and I'm trying to track down whether it's a permissions issue or whether the temporary files don't exist anymore.  Is there a way to delete a failed upload to retry later for the user?
Could you provide some code snippet to reproduce that?

What device/OS version you test on? The library itself uses `Context.getApplicationContext()` inside on the `Context` passed into `RxBleClient.create(Context)`. I doubt that this is the problem.

Another easy workaround is to skip tests by adding `-DskipTests` to the build command in [this line](https://github.com/dice-group/Palmetto/blob/master/webApp/Dockerfile#L15)  (the web app project does not have any test cases so it will not influence the quality of the build)

Do you have the metronome plugin enabled by any chance?
Do other (java-based) programs generally have this functionality?
Did surface switching always work reliably for you, on this device?  It may be that we need to target the workaround more specifically to cases where `DummySurface` is being used, since perhaps that's the only case to which the ANR issue applies.

What about 'lower' values like 30Hz? 2. Is it gibberish regardless or does it become gibberish at higher sampling rates? 3. Are there other serial libraries we could potentially use?

What would be the solution here?  It seems that client should be resilient against such state, because it might happen for other reasons too (e.g lost communication between client and Presto).

Do you get the same error also with only Antique Atlas (and its dependencies)?
Do you have local discovery enabled on both devices? If they are on the same network they should find each other.  As for announce server, check that the announce server address is actually an IP rather than an hostname, since hostname resolution is broken on Go for Android.

Do you see the behavior on Android or on iOS? 
Could you please also provide your proguard config? 
Does the error pop up immediately or after trying to open the file? Does this happen for every APK file you try to open? It might be something with the FileProvider and fetching the correct URI + Intent... I can investigate. 
Can you create a separate issue for `Content` class string addition? Thanks.
Can you give an example of input/output that shows the different behavior in 1.5.1 and 1.6?    Also, are you using the 1.6 release, or building (as yet unreleased) 1.6.1 from source?

What’s your bukkit version? -edit- Wait, it worked in one spot.
Why has this occurred? Turns out that this error will only occur when entities exist within the AABB in question. I suspect all my testing was done without entities in the AABB!  @Hiroku I know you were having this issue too - figured you'd like to be pinged to know why!
Did you follow the instructions here?  https://www.rstudio.com/code-signing/  (If so, we should amend the above to include SuSE specific instructions.)

Can you reproduce the issue every time consistently? Which version of liblib are you using?
Do you have QK Reply enabled?
Can I get a screenshot? Seems like some other mod is probably manually drawing the overlapping text.  AppleCore uses the [relevant Forge event and simply adds a string to the list](https://github.com/squeek502/AppleCore/blob/1.7.10/java/squeek/applecore/client/DebugInfoHandler.java#L41). 
Do you have a sample JSON that causes the issue? Try turning on logging to see the data that goes through the wire. 
Shall we remove it (in order to simplify both the code and the UI) ? 
What version of the game did you try? What did you download? The very latest developer build is pretty unstable.
How do I reproduce it? 
how many simultaneously running workspaces are you targeting? 
What is the suggestion to do here? The way I tested it the partially stored cache can be found on the default list "Stored" and correctly counting to the total of saved caches. 
Can you share how you're making the request so I can try to replicate?  Also, are you certain it's not the API you're proxying to that's returning the 500? Since there's no stack trace in the 2nd example you've given, that seems like it might be the case.

Could you attach the testtoy.class or paste its source code? 
Can you give some system info? Did osbuddy run fine all the time?
Do you use a third-party reporter, parse a some servlet output or read out a `MetricsRegistry` manually? I think the best way is write some decorator where you can perform a conversion to the CloudWatch format. For instance, `GraphiteReporter` converts measurements to 2 digits after the point.  See [here](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/blob/3.2-development/metrics-graphite/src/main/java/com/codahale/metrics/graphite/GraphiteReporter.java#L349).

Can you send me a picture shot by your camera app that way? I'll need the original file so please send it using e-mail (I don't know if GitHub processes it in some way). 
Can you post the liteloader log? Click where it says `about liteloader` and click `LiteLoader Log`, then click `Upload Log`. 
Do we have access to those at all? I can fix the title bar rather easily but I need a Info.Plist to make it work which apparently can be made through a JAR generator found here: /Developer/Applications/Utilities 
What is JS size produced by GWT? What is JS size produced by TeaVM? How should I realize what is the source of size difference? Can you give me source code of your project? If no, how can I reproduce the problem?

Can you verify if this is still reproducible in your environment?  
How to repro though? I built `//scripts:bash_completion`, sourced the result, but `complete -o nospace -o default -F _bazel__complete` fails: `complete` requires one more argument, the name of the command it activates on (e.g. `bazel`).

Can you provide some debug that shows the double call? 
Do items use the same drawable instance?
What values did you modify before calling update in this case? thanks
Does it only apply to the above id, or to every ID / query you try?   I tried it and it worked for me. Moreover, we have automatic tests in place which also pass. Thus I guess there is a problem with your connection or something like that.
Can you show what `recreate()` does?

Could you provide a sample application we could take a look at? It's hard to figure out where the problem is without a way to reproduce the issue.
Could you try to delete old version (rm -rf /usr/share/dbeaver) and then reinstall deb again?  Your workspace is in /home/../.dbeaver or /home/../.dbeaver4 (depends on your previous DBeaver version) so you won't loose any data. Unless you run it with -data parameter.
Does it happen in latest build? Looks like all fine, except list height was only one row, so only one row was visible on screen. Should be fixed already.

Will FSB miss any vulnerabilities? It does not affect the stack state this is less critical. 
What does the other devs think? @AndyScherzinger @ezaquarii

Could you try Finchley.RC1 and see if you have the same issue?  
Could you provide sample images that reproduce this? 
Maybe set the threshold to about 40B to be safe?
How is the json code created? There is a mismatch between the definition and the Java result type. The reason is the steam `appId`, which is interpreted as a number in javascript, but java requires a `String`.
Could you maybe give some more background for the TODO? 
Maybe you could provide your codes? @dodomao   @zhaoyuguang Please take a look, look like Gateway plugin is still no stable.
Does the Env var need to be set as a first step?  What would a sample value look like?

Does my reproducer work on your machine? If not, can you give me a hint what's missing?  Thanks in advance! Stephan
Would you like and be able to make a PR?
What should I do ? @pleku  
How big is your cluster?  Using DistributedRender.sld _should_ do the trick.  Often GeoWebCache is used for larger datasets to handle the map requests at low zoom levels, but it unfortunately is limiting in how dynamic the layer can be.
Can we come up with a better solution than to just inject these parameters into every event so we can still try to prevent unnecessary traffic? Maybe once after the id has changed?
What else is useful to know? 
Can you perhaps try and enable HCChicken from BWM? @Councilor 
What table are you trying to import? Hive doesn't support struct data types (at least thru jdbc).
What kind of LDAP server is this? Active Directory? I've never seen `groupOfNames` return `uniqueMember` and from the screenshots it looks like Apache Directory sees it as `member`, too. 
Could you please give it a try and post some feedback so I could close the related issues ? Thanks !

The issue could not be fixed just by searching the exchange by URI instead of token in the [matcher](https://github.com/eclipse/californium/blob/master/californium-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/californium/core/network/UdpMatcher.java#L246) for block2 notification ?  (I know we will add some specific blockwise behavior in the matcher :/)
Does it return an empty array or it does not reach that line?
What Event and Condition do you use?
what exactly are you doing?
Could you please elaborate on the problem and what behavior you would expect?  Thank you!
Where's the second lock? It seems like Android's Watchdog will complain if a lock is held longer than 1 minute. Maybe this is happening here. Not sure why there are two downloadCompletionThread... I think the DownloadService needs a partial rewriting

Do you mean that the aggregate selection is not saved when changing tabs? That is so as designed! If this is the case please make a feature request! It is not a bug. 
Does it happens with any other demo model? Please, what android device do you have?   
Would you like to work upon it?
Would you be able to provide us with more detailed description of your actions? Screencast maybe?  AFAIK Nextcloud android app is not uploading anything to Google Drive. I suspect that Google Drive is scanning your files and just slurps whatever it finds or something else is trying to do it.
When will Android N be released? By that date we need to have a solution. 
Can you double check to see if the worker settings conflict with the master global settings?  Thanks, Nakkul
Can you please revisit it and update your fork?

Could you paste here more about the error log Maven is giving?
What are the  values of the PostgreSQL database of this MOLGENIS instance? Should be 1024 and 1GB (see #8255 and 25/03/19 mail conversation)? If the settings differ, could you try to reproduce the issue with the correct settings?

What would the expected behaviour be?
Can you be more specific? Copy on the same instance? Copy from pipeline list, or into another pipeline.

Do you really have just Forge and Vampirism installed?  Could you update to MC 1.12.2 or is there a reason you are using 1.12.1?
Whyt?

Can you send me the source file (via slack if you wish to keep private)?
What if we change the order in which pause of LifeCycleListener and ApplicationListener is called? Smells fishy, but i guess i'd be a workable "solution". 
Can you install Android Terminal Emulator and look at aria2 console output? Note, that WebUI has tendency to overload weak devices by frequently sending huge requests to aria2 server. You may want to try out a couple of other clients and look if that fixes the lag.
What do you mean by application master? So if I understand it right, the webinterface should be accessible when using a proxy, for example by using http://localhost:8088/proxy/application_1386532236961_0001/jobsInfo? So we'd need a new configuration value on the client side to specify a proxy url.

I expect you will see error logs describing exceptions instead of "JNA: error handling callback exception, continuing".

What coordinates is your base located at?  I need to check if Java actually casts `int` to `long` in that formula, it's most likely overflowing the `MAX_INT` value. I doubt that Vanilla changed the formula at all and I know that it worked fine when I tested it last time.

Don't we already read that source as-of #354?  See lines 64-75.  If that's not working, there's a bug.  Can you be more clear on what "can not be read (on manjaro)" means?  Should we be looking for a return value from a file rather than just checking the file's existence?

Could you make a video of that?
Would you be interested in submitting a PR?

Can you give me a hint where to look at? What do you mean with "available locations"? Additional for me it works, so it is even harder to debug ;-) 
Could you maybe upload your event listener code here so I could take a look at it?
Maybe something is messed up with the TreeWalker externs? https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/master/externs/browser/w3c_dom2.js

What do you think?
Can I just skip places which doesn't compile?  I don't think we can skip compilation error, now you can build the model without the erroring files: by default, Spoon is in "no classpath mode", which means it will work even if not all sources files are given as input.

What version of Spring Boot 2.0 and what version of Spring Cloud?
How do we prevent that?  Also, having a timeout means that our promise can be broken in the presence of a slow system. Before we go down this route, I'd like to understand why the length is not accurate after setting the last file to read-only.
could you upgrade to 0.6.0? One of the apps we unit test against has zh-Hans and we don't have a problem.  https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ios-driver/ios-server-0.6.0.jar 
How are you breaking it, pickaxe, hand or wrench? Does the cable have any other multiparts on it?

Which one? Could you provide a snapshot?
Can you show me the yml files? Perhaps as a pastebin so that the formatting stays in tact. 
What about improving it even further? I.e. displaying the BootsFaces code to render the icon instead of displaying the class name?  While we're at it: the same list might be useful for the Glyphicons, too. Only Bootstrap 4 is going to drop Glyphicon support.
Do you want to file a pull request preferably with a test? If that's the case can you try doing it against the 2.2.x branch?

Could you suggest a change?
Do you use `LocationServicesOkObservable.createInstance()` function in your code?
Could you tell me the value of  on your machine?
Could you try it with FreeOTP?
How recently was this? Are you still seeing the error? On Tuesday we realized we'd accidentally re-activated the geoip code, and promptly removed it. Entirely my fault, but fortunately a problem on the server side that could be quickly fixed. Everything should have been working since Tuesday.

How do you get the metadata? do you harvest from a server? 
Can you work around for now by splitting the workload amongst enough client instances to keep the work for any one of them below MAX_INT? that'll mean inserting duplicates, but depending on your use case that might be okay?

How can I reproduce it? Do you touch/change image position before cropping? Please attach the original image. 
Can you show me what test, what line failed?  Also be sure to pull a fresh master, I'd fixed a bug just like that not too long ago.  Also, again, you can pull a released .jar directly from the 'releases' tab- you don't have to build it yourself.
Would you mind to push a simple project to Github that demonstrates the class hierarchy being used? 
Do you remember how we solved this? Unfortunately we do not have much control over how Android builds the settings UI. Do you think there are other options how we can select that item? I also wonder why we do onData(anything()) here. Did we try onData(withText(..)) and does this try to scroll?

What projects do we need that feature for?

Why do you need to solve this problem?
Do you have a picture of your inventory size in normal and large mode for reference?
How about a combination of 1 and 2, where we set MediaInfo language to the same language that UMS is configured for? We would just have to make sure that the rest of our code isn't relying on that raw language, but I think we use the keys instead of the values so it should be ok.

What did you use as your connection settings in the client?   Mine was: Name: Tanner Address: 127.0.0.1 Port: 9999 Password: test  Also where did you import the certs from? They should be right where you ran the server, so ~/go/bin/burpServer.X in your case.
Do you have an example where this fails?  See the discussion about these constants in #221, e.g. rMin is the radius to the rectangle and if that is bigger than ALL found entries we do not need the second iteration and it should be possible to leave earlier. 
Can you, please, check if your `Gson` configuration is correct? Just a note that, by default, `is` prefixes are not handled and is tweakable using styles, or apply `@SerializeName` as you've mentioned. 
Which way of file handling do you use in auto upload?  "Original file will be…"? 
What do you mean by in-text citation?  The above reference shows "JabRef Development Team" in the main table and  `Manual (JabRef_software) JabRef Development Team JabRef 2015` in the preview. Both seem to be correct.

What is the popup that you expected? Is this reproducible? 
Could you post your code here? 
Could you please also have a look in the client log files if there are more error messages? The above is just a "lost connection" and not really helpful for finding the cause... 
Do you have any ETA on a fix?  I'd like to push presto-yarn to production, but need this to work first.  I'd be happy to help test.  Thanks,  Rob

Can you share some information on how you reproduce this ? What version of fresco do you use ? 
Maybe you can send me the code of your app as a minimal working example? I never encountered a similar issue and without any code being available it is very hard to reason what is going on there.   By the way, the 1.0.0 branch is still under heavy development and cannot be considered stable yet.

Does this happen every start, or is it random?
Could this be the case? 
Would the same approach work for macros? 
Can you please tell us what's causing this? From that warning I'd say you're trying to make a NPC inventory of an invalid size. If I'm not mistaken, inventories must have sizes that are a multiple of 9. So 27 works, but 30 doesn't.

Did you try a clean?  
Can you get rid of that code and reproduce using Atmosphere JS API? I suspect the browser is blocking the connection because too many are opened to the same host (2 connections limits). 
Where is that class in your clean clone? AFAICT it's still in the wrong place. https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=OneLineSimpleLayout&type=Code

Can you maybe retry with fresh files and the latest 3.1-beta1_unstable-SNAPSHOT? It's a new build which has some fix for the animation system. Then we know if it's related.  Note: This is an unstable build so rather don't overwrite your original install. 
Do you see WebSocket use in the browser dev tools when doing the same actions in DVWS?
Why not just remove the value WORST from the PriorityCode enum ?  This brings the benefit that priority changing upwards and downwards is symmetrical. It is unlogical that there should be 4 values for decreasing the priority down and only 3 values for boosting up. 
Do you need this for fully circular images or just for rounded corners @dmitrychistyakov ? As a workaround, if it's fully circular, you can use a BitmapTransformation that uses the native rounding filter instead, which is much more performant.

maybe something to do with 5.0.0?
How to solve this , temporarily ?

Did your RPCs have deadlines?  That *may* be lucky enough to cancel the RPCs and not have them get wedged.  Obviously it isn't ideal, but perhaps your binary wouldn't hang.
What if you provide the complete path, not a relative path?
Can't you just cut back the statements and the data to the bare minimum that is causing the error and anonymize the data to ensure no proprietary info is leaked?  Private support channels are available to Flyway Pro and Enterprise customers if you prefer to go down that option.
Which OS do you use? Windows? The code probably miss the special handling for windows... I assume beside the error popup it does not has any effect but would need more time to investiage/test...

What is going on?  How is this thing configured? 
Did you check the Float/Filter Option in the Search? It can either hide all other entries or just gray them out. Maybe this is the problem?

Do you by chance know why it works with 2.3.25?  i.e. what's the key difference?
Why not use enums? StringEnumValue has a doc comment that indicates enums don't work due to the need to extend values later. What exactly does this mean and why can't this functionality be provided as a method on standard enum types?

How does loading less than 9 routes react with your phone? If it helps with the situation for now, I suggest doing it, but it's obviously a very suboptimal solution.  Other than that, if you're familiar with exporting logcats, it would be great if you could give yours to us! 
Do you get a stack trace or do you happen to have a debug log?  If you don't then I will test it myself and try to get stack trace in the IDE.   I wonder, why would # cause a crash, perhaps it's being interpreted as an anchor.
