The client does not return any error. Unfortunately, there are also no entries retrieved from the davical server. 
I'll test that on tuesday, keeping you aware :)
Thanks...  I made the change to annotations locally - but it didn't help. I took your PR and built, but the same issue.  My environment is:  - MacOS  - master (up to date as of now)  - Java 11  - I launch 3 platforms & UI as per coco pharma environment  - I run through server configuration & server start notebooks, then asset management (this creates some assets and puts a variety of servers into a cohort)  - the error here occurs after login to the UI   Note that without the fix I made for #2432 (now merged to master, in queue for release 1.3) Asset Catalog OMAS was not working AT ALL - and hence nor would asset search in the UI. With that fix at least the UI works, and searches are successful, so it's just a warning error at login time.  I will attach the error, but my simpler test case was just using httpie (or use curl)

I'll try to after I tweaked the MCforums thread and read through the site forums 
Phil,  Thanks for getting back to me on this.  Sorry, I did not grab the error message, trying to get ready for a course delivery next week.  But one diagram would not open and the other was fragmented (could not make out any structure or interact with it).  However, I have tried to repeat the error but have not had it reoccur.  I did the rename with the pull down menu not when I created the diagram.  I will let you know if occurs again and will capture the error message/log.  By-the-way, I think you have done a very good job with the editor. This is one of the first issues I have had with it.

I have my addresses entered into Chrome and Firefox autofills. That's all I can think of. I could try deleting them from one or the other and see if that has an impact. 
Yeah, I get it when switching between projects regardless of whether the plugin is configured for that project.  Also, just tried a clean install of the plugin and still same issue. Are you running on Ubuntu? 
Correct. The data is not deleted when scaling down. No, not with a single node, because the code will prevent you from scaling to less than 1. But you could replicate it with 2 or more nodes. 
@Starcommander  Sorry, just realized I forgot to answer. I was able to download the maps to my internal storage without any problem. The sd-card should not be mounted as read only since I've got other apps (e.g. NextCloud) that store their data there. I'm not sure how to send that bug report, but I guess the problem is one of my device, since I was able to get a log via logcat from the DonwloadManager. I'll add the exact excpetion, but I guess this problem is not related to this app.   Here's the promised excpetion  ` [225] Failed: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid UUID string: 34E6-19EB java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid UUID string: 34E6-19EB 	at java.util.UUID.fromString(UUID.java:194) 	at android.os.storage.StorageManager.convert(StorageManager.java:1952) 	at android.os.storage.StorageManager.getUuidForPath(StorageManager.java:756) 	at android.os.storage.StorageManager.isAllocationSupported(StorageManager.java:780) 	at com.android.providers.downloads.DownloadThread.transferData(DownloadThread.java:585) 	at com.android.providers.downloads.DownloadThread.executeDownload(DownloadThread.java:470) 	at com.android.providers.downloads.DownloadThread.run(DownloadThread.java:312) `  Since the UUID is correct ( `/storage/34E6-19EB/` exists ) it seems to be a problem of the DownloadManger itself?
This happens with both newly-placed vehicles and existing vehicles.
I've fixed it in a slightly different way, though the result is of course the same 
yes, just upload large images, it will happen。Because it doesnot work.  Anyway,bmOptions.outWidth = 0 = bmOptions.outHeight.   if not add ‘BitmapFactory.decodeFile(imageFile.getAbsolutePath(), bmOptions);’ before 'int photoW = bmOptions.outWidth;'

I tried it and the bug in random initialization seems fixed. However I got another exception in `JCublasWrapper.gemm`, and the training score is NaN. I am attaching the error log. I will check it carefully tomorrow.   
Thanks for explaining the presentation!   No error appears on the ErrorLog.   After a bit more digging. It seems that classes that are not inherited (ie class <name> : MonoBehavior) are working as expected and I can access transform, gameObject etc.   It's the inherited classes that aren't accessing the MonoBehavior from the parent. (ie class <name> : ParentClass). Does that help?  
Hi. The app version is 0.15.3 and android version is 4.4.4 And ocsms is enabled. I don't see any conf field, so I presume there is no config. Thanks 
@DragonRaider5   I used `react-native link` command and verified manually that it has linked correctly, according to the readme. Unfortunately I can't share the repo I'm working on right now, but I'll try to setup a clean app and reproduce the problem.
When we run Che with a limit for a workspace RAM consumption set to 3GB anybody can create and run a workspace with a sidecar with 30GB of RAM. We don't check how much memory sidecars consume, so this feature of Che doesn't work in that case.  On OSIO we also have limits on the OS side, so it wouldn't be possible to misuse service, but in case Che starts workspaces on a cluster that doesn't control RAM consumption by workspace (so only Che is responsible for RAM limits) users can use as many RAM as they want.  If the explanation is not clear enough or you still think that we don't need to fix that, please, elaborate.
I need a permission to access your file. 
Have not tested that yet but it does move around a block, I tested that in a single car garage and as soon it hit the wall it stopped, but moving forever... Unconfirmed as far as my testing goes
It shows that exact message in the Android GUI near the repo path — "Interrupted system call", nothing more. Unfortunately, I didn't open the web UI, there could be more details. Will do that when it occurs again. 
Yes, the solution would be to remove the `/display`, but I have no time at the moment. 
Yes, this is for a custom `Encoder`/`Decoder`.  As a temporary workaround (until this issue is addressed), I was thinking about extending `EncoderHttpMessageWriter` to make it work like it did in spring 5.1 if the inputStream was a Mono (i.e. call `encode` rather than `encodeValue`).  I haven't actually looked to see all the places where the new methods are used.  If it is limited to `EncoderHttpMessageWriter`, then I guess one of two fixes could be made there: 1. have something that made `EncoderHttpMessageWriter` always call encode, rather than encodeValue (i.e. revert to spring 5.1 behavior), OR 2. have something that made `EncoderHttpMessageWriter` pass the context as a hint to encodeValue  The more I think about it, however, the more I think that having the context as a hint seems hacky.   And neither of these implementations handle _all_ the possible locations that the new synchronous methods _could_ be used.  So, this would limit any Encoder that uses the context to only be able to be used from the newly patched `EncoderHttpMessageWriter`.  I.e. it couldn't be used in any other location that called encodeValue that doesn't put the context in a hint.  What if the new synchronous `encodeValue` and `decode` methods were revisited, to instead take/return Mono?  This would allow implementations to access the context normally (via `Mono.subscriberContext()`). And it also seems more inline with the fact that the Encoder/Decoder are _reactive_ Encoder/Decoders.  i.e. It seems odd for a synchronous encode/decode method to exist in reactive Encoder/Decoders.  e.g.: * In `Encoder`...  `default Mono<DataBuffer> encodeValue(Mono<T> value, DataBufferFactory bufferFactory, 			ResolvableType valueType, @Nullable MimeType mimeType, @Nullable Map<String, Object> hints)` * In `Decoder`... `default Mono<T> decode(Mono<DataBuffer> buffer, ResolvableType targetType, @Nullable MimeType mimeType, @Nullable Map<String, Object> hints)`  I know this would mean immediately deprecating the newly added synchronous methods, and adding another default reactive method in their place.  But, it does seem "cleaner" to have only reactive encode/decode methods in Encoder/Decoder, and to allow implementations to access the context "normally".  Also, the default implementation of the new methods _might_ be able to delegate to the other existing methods, rather than throw an exception.  (I haven't completely thought that through though)  
Yes the response was missing "token_type" and this is more a bug of the Authorization server. Just a little surprised that this cause app to crash.

@kfeinauer I retested on a different "clean" box and I'm seeing a little bit different results. On this RSP instance, I get the correct working directory in the console but the Files pane is in Home still. Is this what you are seeing? I'll try to find the old box I was working on to see what could be different. Tested on 1.2.666-2 RHEL 7.3
Yup, I did some tcpdump and saw some references to segment numbers that should be sealed.  The current segment number is around ~2400 and I saw some segment metrics reported for 641 (for segment_write_bytes).  ![screen shot 2017-08-31 at 2 07 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9335655/29935839-971bd7de-8e56-11e7-9c1a-c2aa53218638.png)  My understanding with the dropwizard metrics, it just sends whatever it has in memory as a gauge to the configured statsd endpoint.  I'm assuming if Pravega isn't actively removing those metrics, then they will continue to be sent on the interval.  Also note that the 65K points per second includes our downsampling points (writing data to lower precision), so its not all pravega traffic.

Yes, problem exists on both android mobile chrome browser and desktop browser accessing the mobile UI. Here is the only output from the javascript console:   Consider using 'dppx' units, as in CSS 'dpi' means dots-per-CSS-inch, not dots-per-physical-inch, so does not correspond to the actual 'dpi' of a screen. In media query expression: (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio: 1), (max-resolution: 120dpi)  I believe you are correct that it is related to #126 because I have, on some occasions, opened the mobile UI on my phone and did not see one or two devices, even after waiting for a while, they never showed up. 
Sure.   `BanManager/config.yml - onlineMode: false` `/server.properties - online-mode=false`  It also may be possible because I'm using dev build of EssentialsX, I'm using this right now https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX/792/
@jtaubensee Sample code attached.

> Do you know how that could be reproduced easily locally so we can test it ?  Hello @vietj, I suspect this happens if the host name (of the client) happens to be an internal network name and not exposed to the outside world. That's a guess based on the use case which seems to have triggered this. It's a bit late in the night for me here, so I haven't had a chance to experiment with it and reproduce this in a more isolated fashion. I'll probably find some time tomorrow evening and see if I can provide an isolated reproducer for this. 
Below is the link of file, however, I can't navigate to the next screen to even select the file   https://www.thunderbird.net/media/caldata/SouthAfricaHolidays.ics
It's a good thought, but my gut is to leave it as-is.  Here's a couple reasons:  - if a misformed MAT-file happens to have the `global` flag set in a non-root array, what would you do?  Ignore it?  Throw an error? - looking at the `MatFile` interface, the only way to get the `isGlobal()` value is through the `Iterable<NamedArray> getEntries()`.  That's okay, but it's a little awkward for people who care about the `isGlobal()` but want to access via map or index  It's not crazy to change it, but it does seem like a bit of an impedance mismatch with the file format.  It's too bad that there's a mismatch between the underlying format and the semantic meaning, but there's too many MAT files out there to change it now ;-)
@eivantsov  Thanks a lot.
@jgcmarins  I didn't check the example project. This issue happens in my react native project FYI I am using react-native-navigation v3 for navigator.
I doubt that because the fragment list is inside a singleton class. Maybe the FragmentManager are not cleared up correctly?
1.9.4 
I tried, but I can't replicate it because the URL has been fixed by the owners of that URL and I don't know another example.  Hopefully it works. 
there is not a real bug. I found the problem. I thought I turned off battery optimisation but instead it was still turned on - but I gave permission to get App Status / Usage. The next time I opened the app it asks me again for both - turn off battery optmisation and App Status / Usage -  so I thought it was not working. It works now.   Some more suggestios:  let apps been added to a running Lock. Let's say I want to add Chrome for the current time period without the need to restart the program.    Turn on Flightmode (turn off phone, mail, wlan) for a custom time, would also be nice to have as an addition. So you can say, don't disturb me for x amount of time at all but turn on again automatically in 30 minutes. And of course shortcuts would be nice to activate it quickly.   Reverse Timer is also a good idea. thanks!  
Sent you PR with test and bug fix 
Due to the second case happening sometimes, this is definitely a blocker. 
@samtstern Ya sorry! It's kinda hard to explain but I'll try my best!  First time users are logged in Anonymously. Then I have the login builder with the enable auto upgrade.

Two actually, the second apparently being the official (and rootless) fix:  - swap the `<family lang="zh-Hans">` lines with the `<family lang="ja">` ones - add "日本語 (日本）" in `Settings → Language & Input → Languages` (if you have any Chinese ones, drag it above them)  Second one assumes an unedited `fonts.xml`, ofc.

The test for my previous logs was gold ore, I believe, (I was trying to set up ore processing when I initially discovered this), and for the client logs I'll be including here, I did plain smooth stone just as a test. I also tried a few modded items when I submitted my initial report (so, it's possible the original logs I provided are one of those), to see if it was something specific, but I can't remember what ones I tested then.  [This is the latest.log from my client.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c7sllafc5o429m1/latest.log?dl=0) Right at the bottom of the log, you'll see I gave myself a logic programmer (I admit it, I was too lazy to run across my base for a quick test), the very next thing I did was try it and get disconnected. Then exited the game to grab the log.
@samtstern  I don't want the modal message to prevent interaction with the Maps View. I hope Google Map is normal when banner style in-app messaging is shown over the app. Could you help this?

@Ashish-Bansal  Hi Ashish,  As I tested, it seems like that bug has got fixed.  Great job, Yashwanth Krishnan 
I have no idea what you're talking about @ekager . No one said anything about replacing any buttons That's all fine @brampitoyo , but I think you guys have lost the point...   Whether it shows as "Open in Fennec" or in the "Open in ..." menu thing is .. bikesheding. The bug is that Fennec is both not showing up as its own button nor in the "Open in..." menu when Focus/Klar is set as default. There is no way to open the webpage in Fennec at all (but, in contrast, the Xiaomi browser does show up in the ... menu) Maybe I should submit an issue to Fennec?   To anyone else having this problem - The work around I've found is to hit "Share" then I can open it in Fennec through that menu (it's a bit weird)
@Joker4632  A fast fix is to Delete the player file inside the worlder folder.   How to do that: Find out the uuid of the player who created the shop.   Destroy the shop in the world (if you doesn't have done it already)   Go to your worlds folder Then inside this folder to  data/sponge Inside this folder is a file with the uuid (the same as above)   Delete this file, restart the server.  Done.

Thank you TylerJewell!  I also used docker to start che  `docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/che/assembly/assembly-main/target/eclipse-che-5.0.0-M9-SNAPSHOT/eclipse-che-5.0.0-M9-SNAPSHOT:/che  eclipse/che start` the result was the same.
After deeper investigation I see that in normal configuration indeed it works.  However, when you look at the code above it should be clear, that for hierarchical contexts it won't work because of recursive call with the same argument for each call.  And this is exactly my case.  I am using 'spring-cloud-starter-config', so I've got contexts hierarchy as follows:    will be trapped inside infinite loop leading to StackOverflowError 
yes @SamMarkowitz  
Ews Java has two Base64 classes (Base64EncoderStream and Base64) for reasons unknown. Base64 seems to work just fine, but a third party library may do the trick as well. I haven't used Guava, but I've heard good things. Apache Commons would be a candidate as well. I don't think Java 8 is viable. It's too new and isn't widely used. 
It's part of the DNSTechPack version 7.6.2.2 it's on the ATLauncher https://www.atlauncher.com/pack/DNSTechpack/ To list the mods would take a while, it might easier for you to just look.  I just assume this would also happen even if the mod was by itself. I hadn't tested that, before posting the issue, until just now and it doesn't seem to be doing it. 
Sure.  The screenshot highlights the 3 configurations I mentioned.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3874799/35154321-d47158b0-fcf7-11e7-812c-cb15a901ed1a.png) 
I always use the default configs. If deleted before server restart the default config.yml and the 3 language files are regenerated. So this error makes no sense. Joining impossible! 
I just upgraded the IntelliJ to 2019.3 And I tried out the debugging and now I am not encountering constant load on the CPU. It goes up to 115% but just for temporary, after starts to drop down. For me this operation acceptable now. Thank you for your help!

At least full application on/off would be helpful.  Yes, I use traccar-web for 20 cars with GPS data and there's a problem with some (half) that, every minute, send same positions. 10 x (7AM->20PM = 13 hours) x 60 minutes = 7200 per day x 1 week = a lot of entries.  I should filter from the datasource so that the DB doesn't get redundant data (i'll do it anyway) but I found strange the high CPU and analyzing queries in the DB, found it was related to events...  BTW - my GPS data collector only gets data at work hours... so, by night, it's all devices being 'offline' x deviceTimeout 
Unfortunately, I'm not the one with access to the server's files. I'll see if I can find them.
hi,It's MEIZU PRO5 which use samsung CPU 7420. thanks. 
You can simply download the [Project Base for Vaadin 13](https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base) and copy the code from above into the `MainView`. Of course you must first add the add-on to the `pom.xml`.
The problem occurs when document.toByteArray().length % 256 == 0   
Thanks for the response. It's a home grown kms client that expects a configuration object. The configuration object is constructed from values that are read in from a .properties file and injected as parameters into the enclosing @Bean method. The issue is arising from the fact that one of the injected parameters is somehow null when @EnableSwagger2 is used, but non null when it's commented out. The code runs and builds fine in the absence of swagger.
1) Yes and no. The form on my page will always crash, but at different spots. 2) Pixel (1st gen) 8.0. 3) I haven't tried reproducing it in another app yet.  It seems like the issue is coming from the auto fill service added in Android 8.0. When auto fill is turned on the app will crash. When auto fill is turned off I can complete the form with no issue. As mentioned previously it seems like it only happens with the 8.0 auto fill, so something in the newer versions of Android is probably fixed with it.  Is there anyway to disable the auto fill service in a cordova app? Or is this issue not related / cant be fixed via cordova?

Of course they are, that's how routing works :)  I didn't run any updates, because my code only does indexing. It doesn't even know ids that are assigned by elasticsearch.   
I'm at work right now, but I'll make a PR when I get home.  Note that it'll really be three PRs, since GitHub PRs only target a single branch and I want to fix this in all the active branches.
I see.  No, I was assuming that the communication with the email server was the issue; but I think you've determined it was a database problem that seems to occur some time after reboot.  Let's leave it as is for now regarding email.  But, if there's an additional error situation you can trap and display a meaningful message, that would be best because I think it wasn't displaying an error.  This may have been simply because of the other elusive problem that prevented me for registering and/or using an account within our domain where email responses are currently limited to.  In fact, I'm almost sure of that.  This issue can safely be closed by you if you feel that same. 
Sure, I noticed in my recording that this does indeed work when using the integration editor. But links outside this editor work without any conformation. IIRC clicking on the logo also displayed the dialog on the angular frontend and it would be good if it is possible to keep it that way.  ![Peek 2019-06-10 08-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46345469/59178129-6178bc80-8b5e-11e9-9fd7-cb9b90f654cd.gif)

Roger. I'll whirl it up right now then.
Quite sure... @samueltardieu asked me to try more things like that, so I did :) 
Well my issue is that the controller doesn't seem to have broken state. The weirdest thing being the "connection order" thing which made the system behave correctly when it's the p2p on the drive which is connected first.

At least in 9.4.20 the method "isOpen()" is implemented as:  That means, "isOpen()" throws an "RuntimeIOException" which extends "java.lang.RuntimeException", **not** "java.io.IOException", which is indeed catched by all invokers of "isOpen()". But the "RuntimeIOException" is not catched by any of the invokers. 
Hrm, I thought there were more, but it looks like it's just the Closure compiler that doesn't really need reflection.  All of the other tools (routes, twirl and play run) have two or more versions they support and rely on reflection.  It would be ugly, but one way to deal with this would be to split out the version specific tool code into a separate subproject and have compileOnly dependencies on specific versions.  So you'd have a routes-2.3 and a routes-2.4 subproject that contains the version specific implementations of RoutesCompilerAdapterV23X and RoutesCompilerAdapterV24X.  You'd avoid the reflection that way.
@nitaliano ah sorry yes I should have said this is on iOS. I take it a video isn't necessary anymore as you've reproduced the problem.
Well, document() is an XSLT function (http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#function-document); doc() is an XPath/XQuery function (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-doc). Both are supported by Saxon: http://saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!functions/fn. The documentation for doc() documents the URI argument as:   > The URI of the required document (relative to the static base URI) >  > By default the URI is dereferenced using the conventional URL behaviour, as implement by the Java runtime library; this behaviour can be modified by means of a user-supplied URIResolver.  (http://saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!functions/fn/doc)  Actually, _loading_ the document with the relative URI in eXist doesn't seem the problem (see style3.xsl); only when that document is processed directly, without first copying it into a fresh XSLT variable. Note: when the files are run from the file system (not from the db), no errors occur.  Indeed, replacing the relative URI with `http://localhost:8080/.....` makes it work everywhere.  
Seems like the json fields are different (private vs is_private) 
Yep. I print the actual values right below the gauge like seen in the video. Also (because I knew you would ask 😄) I added debugging code before setting the values that prints the values to console/triggers a debugger breakpoint if they are below zero. If needed, I may record a video for that as well.
I recorded two videos:  one with "Enable notifications background" on and one with the setting off. When switched to off, notfications show up as expected when ambient display is pulsing. https://goo.gl/photos/pUZtmT9hkYw3YSEU6 
@mc1arke The screenshot before was background jobs from one particular project: This is overall for entire server: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19437418/75394126-77313c00-58bd-11ea-8897-a2e61a8be972.png) Note the time that is displayed above is pure running time, it excludes time waiting in the queue. In the above screenshot it waited in the queue for 2 seconds, then the analyze started. here's the log snippet related to screenshot above:  so at 22:25:56 we went into the plugin execution, 40 seconds after the analysis started.
pex, latest version, 1.23.4
I have downgraded my platform to Node 6.13.1 and Cordova 7.1.0: It works now! Thanks
@amlcurran Library is 5.4.0 and we tested mainly on A samsung s5 (G900P) running android 5.0 
The cached values were not empty, but IIRC the lists were. I evaluated the functions that compute the cached values manually with a debugger and got the results mentioned in my first post.  I did not modify Glide's registry and neither did I register any custom components.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to reproduce this problem yet, since after a restart of the app it disappeared.
Sure. It's The Nerdist - http://nerdist.libsyn.com/rss  I'm referring to the large thumbnail rendered above the playback controls in the player activity. The small thumbnails in the queue list are fine.  I'm on an AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3 running stock Android 4.2.2. 
Here you go:   
Hikari bean config    I verified the properties values being loaded correctly. 
Yes, I can confirm it does the same on build 1330 but I haven't tried it with builds older than that one.
No errors on Developer Tools console, the button simply does nothing, completely inactive. 
It should be "resizedImages" 
1.12.2
I'm using spoon 6.0.0   The trick is that when I fisrt run this code it works, then when I tried second time it doesn't work any more.    
no, I tried all the permutations, and no difference. Is that update in master, or on your private branch? If it is public I can check it out.
This happens when only one specified player joins, "Mp4_SvK", idk why O.o Config: https://gist.github.com/Rukes/e98cdd36135f54b41eb19a0b680bf5eb
Just straight up Python. Pretty much exactly as shown in the menu in step 2 [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html).
An encrypted one.  I've never tried it, but I think, in a "normal" backup, there aren't my old keys or?

Ok thats weird. Ill share a sample project asap 
The charset for my server is UTF-8 and runs the test case. When I manually specify the encoding format as UTF-8. The server can respond normally. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5573215/60379073-e456ae00-9a5e-11e9-9b2d-8151059d0471.png)  At the same time I noticed. If no charset is specified, the default encoding format of “StringEntity” is “HTTP.DEF_CONTENT_CHARSET” and the variable defaults to “ISO-8859-1” ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5573215/60379103-41eafa80-9a5f-11e9-910c-e5407cae7a88.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5573215/60379132-dc4b3e00-9a5f-11e9-8b4b-a02142df893f.png)    
I created some Origins decks and had no bug.  I close the issue. 
Hi, I am getting the primary keys in input for all the entities . Consider an Test entity   I tested post method in swagger ui by providing values in body only, it works fine.But when the entity does not have embedded id, the path parameter id is required=true. So the documentation is incorrect in that case.  As 2.7.0 is listing the associations nicely as separate apis, wanted to upgrade to this version. Let me know if I can help with anything else.  
we dont do anything, except add -javaagent:xxxx/skywalking-agent.jar arguments in the spribgboot   startup.sh script.

Thank you for you quick response! I fixed this bug by add    as configuration for maven-compiler-plugin 
I ran it last night again and it seems to happen in jit_vich_0 test, where the server hits the assert while client is running the jit_vich_0 test. However, when you run the test just by itself the assert doesn't come up for me. To see the assert, I think make _sanity has to be run.
@ojw28 Unfortunately, I can't share that file currently. I'll see if I can share some sample file that has the same issue, so you could investigate Mp3Extractor. In the meantime, can you please help me with my question? Is that safe to do?

The problem is that cropper set wrong cropzone - http://prnt.sc/bmh51x 
Which `a` are you referring to? I'm confused.  if you have imported module A, the common keyword `int y = 0` has been defined on X. so in a module that imported A, anything of type X should return a value for the `y` field.  if A is not imported, then I agree, makes no sense so still support the access of field `y`. 
I just copy pasted the dependency straight off the plugin page, but I'll put what I have here:

Yes, that is the default. The issue comes up when the sorting is disabled with `@Command(sortOptions=false)`.
I just put the setting "Disable all sound effects" to No and a get all .wav effects failed to load. Putting on Yes it don't happen maybe it's my Linux sound driver  
Sorry for the late response. So when I tried doing the changes on the workspace , the workspace wasn't starting. The changes were very minimal like adding the environment variables, or updating some files in project workspace. This happened when I was doing on the cloud account. However when I have the eclipse che on my local host, i am not facing this issue. Looks like only in the cloud ee are having this limitations while on the local host it works absolutely fine.

I tried the latest build Network drives seem to operate faster but  Selecting a new file still takes like 2-3 seconds and the more you select the slower it will get until it freezes for a couple of seconds (little annoying but much better than before) Scraping of 4 videos takes 1-2 minutes.(which seem okay) Writing files of 4 videos takes about 1-2 minutes. (ok as well)  In explorer the network drive is explored in an instant and files open instantly as well. The cursor does not change when the program freezes while selecting files.  The network drive uses the SAMBA protocol on a ARM router (Asus RT-N66U) running modified Asus firmware "Asuswrt-Merlin" with the Linux kernel 2.6.22.19. Accessing is quick and without any freezes on OSX, Debian, Win7, Win8 and Android

So what i see is, on the first page there are 10 notifications, and on page 2 there are 10 notifications. What i'm seeing is on page 1 is notifications with title 1-10 and on page 2 i see notifications 2-11. So on page 2 i'm not seeing the top most notification entry from page 1, but I'm seeing the other 9, plus 1 extra which isn't on page 1. Hope it doesn't sound to confusing. I've included 2 screenshots, where you can see the bottom of page 1 and page 2, and you can see that there are 2 identical notifcations displayed altough i only created it once. The json that curl returned is valid, i posted in duckduck.go json parser.  ![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26430811/23950825/9499c90c-098c-11e7-9954-99daab57713c.png) ![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26430811/23950829/97791024-098c-11e7-978b-59f1ecd109fa.png)     
[example-project.zip](https://github.com/qoomon/maven-git-versioning-extension/files/3392737/example-project.zip) see attached file. I've tried to simplified the project as much as could and kept only the relevant information. As you can see, we have a <version> specified in the root pom.xml. This tag refers to a ${revision} property, defined in the same pom.xml. The maven module pom.xml inherits from this root pom.xml and also refers to the ${revision} property. At first, the ${version} from the extension didn't like the fact my version was referring to a property, so I've hard-coded the version directly in the version tag. But still didn't work for maven module that also refered to ${revision} property.  Anyway, let me know if you have enough information with the attached file. Maybe it's the way we are configured with the flatten plugin..
@eivantsov I pulled the latest but getting similar error. See below:  
I do not see this message in the console logs. But, after setting the JVM DNS Caching to zero as mentioned below (JDK1.8) it works!    Thanks @mrniko. 
Someone changed the title.  It does NOT crash the server.  It crashes the client when on a server.  And one other note, this was copied from my original post of the GitHub for the mod pack I am using.  It is called, "The 1.7.10 Pack" on Technic.  The author after looking into it believes it is not on his side and a bug with Chisel. 
I mean setting something like this in the spec file    and then upload files like this  `curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/multipart" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "type=2" -F "name=test model" -F "file1=@testdata/classes.txt;type=text/plain" -F "file2=@testdata/test.pb"`  this will result in a validation error  `Error during validation of request. Parameter \"file1\" inside body form not found`  I tested patching 3.6.3 version
I'm trying to try other versions. 
@garagatyi I'm using Oracle, and @TylerJewell  running the shortcut to start the server.  @eivantsov how do i copy and share logs 
I will provide logs a bit later. I don't manually call `holder.getAdapterPosition()` anywhere. When I click sticky header the ViewHolder's `onClick()` method is called. But inside this method `mAdapter.isEnabled()` returns **false**.  This    and this method returns **-1**. `getAdapterPosition(`) retruns **-1** and `mBackupPosition` is also equals **-1**.
We tried by setting the env variable. But `$JAVA_OPTS` is used after -jar which doesn't work. So, used an new variable `AGENT_CMD` as a work around:     
Sure - just a basic filter by service UUID - nothing fancy:  - this works on many devices, but on Galaxy S6 there are no results.
https://pastebin.com/CS43XGFp  There it is. Happen 1 time only on 10 players. But this will probably happen again in the future.

Hi! Thanks for the quick answer. Here it is :   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5181433/17556373/7926380a-5f13-11e6-8429-96cf5d76e8ed.png)  Is it what you were looking for? 
Sure. We have many custom plugin that we developed for us, but the common one are: `BanManager, ChestShop, Citizens, Denizen, DeathMessagesPrime, Dynmap, EntityLWC, Farmlimiter, FastAsyncWorldEdit, HolographicDisplays, iConomy, LogBlock, Multiverse, NoCheatPlus, PEX, PlayerSQL, ProtocolLib, SimplePets, SuperTrails, SuperVanish, Vault, WorldBorder, WorldEdit, WorldGuard`  Originally i've tested LuckPerms with version 4.1.87 and this version still works fine.
They seem to still be on 345, i'll wait to report after our next reboot and confirm, but it seems to be fixed to always give 4 at a time properly. I will give an update tomorrow to see if it continues to work great. Thank you for all that helped! 
Ohh, yes, that was the problem. Didn't know that, sorry for the issue and thanks :)
Well, in PHP, we don't have concept of longs ;-) 
Yes first one close connection every batch insert in second one I try to reuse connections if they are not closed. Yes I don't use Connection Pool and I try clickhouse4j 1.1.1 and 1.4.1 with same results.
I will try, though I don't have a great environment to do this since I can't disrupt our production setup more than it has been disrupted this week already. Also, we've been holding out on upgrading to 2.2 or newer due to #697.  I should have mentioned that I did update asynchbase jar from 1.6.0 to 1.7.1 and that didn't make any difference. 
Try the following steps:  1. Start profiling 2. Source the following script with the for-loop line copy-pasted for 300 times    3. End profiling 4. A very large Rprofvis is produced.  5. RStudio Server should hang for a long time.  6. If RStudio Server is able to show it, save the Rprofvis file and reopen it. 7. Copy-paste as many lines of the `for-loop` so that the profiling get large enough to cause the web browser hang. 8. `rstudio-server kill-all` does not solve the problem. Removing `~/.rstudio/sessions/active/*` does not either. Removing the saved `.Rprofvis` file does not help. Completely removing `~/.rstudio` solves the problem but everything in config is lost.
I'd suggest to accept both .tei and .xml, as naming TEI files .xml makes sense. Maybe, when no files are matched, output a warning such as "No file found with extension {extension} in input directory." 
1. It is method parameter. 2. Not seewo_sys_users,It is t_demo.
@felixbarny yes, it should fix both methods.  > There also seems to be a problem with the sources jar which made debugging a bit harder as line numbers don't match.  Oh wow! We're running Delombok to make the sources look better (otherwise IntelliJ compains) but apparently it breaks the debugging experience. Thanks, will check what we can do to make both work 👍 
Latest version, different factions and I believe it only message was this land belongs to someone else.
yes, i tried to uninstall and start clean with the same result of the crash. only downgrading helps. i wish you the best success to find the right code 👍 
Sure !

Thanks @timpokorny , The locale is English (United States).  I just want to emphasize that if I added portico to the class path, serviceloader works fine.
Hi @laa , the logs just printed the stack trace that I have copied above and the DB content is too large to be shared.
It was a long time ago, and I should have been more specific when raising the issue.  I think it was 'shared' to non-shared at the package level, and moving packages between modules.  At least that is what I did a lot of early on in my project. 
Here is a link to a session with two networks.  One is called "How the network looks" and the other is "How it should look"  https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m74365hgamt2bb/example_session_bug216.cys?dl=0  Genesets that have significant and postivie NES values are showing up but if the same geneset has a negative NES in a different dataset the negative value is showing up in the pie heatmap chart.  If users have selected NES positive values only they there should be no negative values.
Here are 2 sites.  The first one  https://www.guiyou.fr/piwigo doesn't show any picture. I own this site, on my own server.  And  the second one https://tugdualgaro.piwigo.com works well. It belongs to a friend of mine, on a  piwigo server.

I think it affects everyone on every local run. New projects won't work, as we no longer export it (`export="false"` in `plugin.xml`). Converted projects don't seem to work either, which is not surprising, as we saw in the user report.  I vaguely remember we briefly agreed that the dev appserver really should provide the JAR, but I guess that's not going to happen soon.
I use the version 2.2.0. I read the lastest release, this problem was resolved, i am going to upgrade it to the new version, thanks. 
@timtay-microsoft The clients are sending at least 1 message every 4 minutes and they're authenticated with device key.  As for MQTT that's the last exception that appears, it seems there's some serious problem with the reconnect, right now the only way to make iot hub work continuously and reconnect on connection loss is to treat DISCONNECTED_RETRYING as DISCONNECTED, closing the client en opening a new one.
I use the following CacheConfiguration    Also I added many cache aliases.  I use Simple Spring Memcached 3.3.0. 
Hi, thanks for the reply!  The ClassGraphFacade.searchForPublicConcreteSubTypesOf() method must be called with an inner type to illustrate the problem. The following code does fail: 
I just tried. It crash like last time. 
Hey guys. It's just me being an idiot It never occured to me that the manual would be in-game. I was trying to find one on the net at source of download 🤣 haha just ignore me.  All correct now with the mighty spanner!
No I do not have a local full node running. And I have the default network settings. And I never had any issues with tor browser but I do not use it very often.  I rebooted and shut down my vagrant-virtualbox Ubuntu VM I use for development that always runs in the background but never give me any issues, tried again and was finally able to take a trade. The same trade it failed on many times b4. Not sure if this has anything to do with the VM running. I am looking for another trade that fits what I am looking for as see if another works as well. At this time there is none that interests me.
I can't reproduce again. It working now. But it's not worked when I need :)   
Not sure just yet, needs to be looked into.  Installing them all may lead to issues, not sure, don't think so since they're classpath loaded in on launch.  I think the best option would be to check the libraries when play is clicked and create new fields in the instance.json for the OS and version it was installed on so that if they change, the libraries are reloaded in. Sounds like the best solution, but may be other ones. 
I recreated your steps and the megatorch worked as intended. The issue seems to come from Forge. When I use Forge 14.23.3.2659 like in my sp world, hostile mobs spawn despite the megatorch.
Maybe. Do you know if this leads to a crash? Or "only" some output in the logcat?  Edit: "auto upload" preview from https://cloud.nextcloud.com/s/ftZraTruRQjTe0R cannot be installed in parallel with fdroid dev nor with manual downloaded dev version as of apk signature problems. So an user always have to uninstall the previous dev version.  So it can only conflict with the 1.4.3 and a dev version (either "official" dev or "auto upload" dev"). But this I tested as said in the original post...
Thanks @shorea, I'm sorry, after seeing your hint above, I looked closer and realized that I was setting the Policy retrieved the function on a class which goes through some custom jackson parsing, using ObjectMapper.  My fault, but thank you for your quick attention to this.

UI don't show any error. After trying for a while it just gives up and a retry button appears. This is VM IP. So Che is running on EC2 using run --remote:[public-ip-address_of_ec2-instance]. I checked the security rules associated with the ec2 instance and the required ports are open. Interestingly it worked earlier. I can't get as to what might have changed to cause this issue. On the ec2 console I don't see any message corresponding to the create project task. Is there any other log that can guide us?

Hi @johnscancella - many thanks for the quick response. My D: drive is a partition on a hard disk. I wasn't aware that the zip functionality has problems associated with it so this information is extremely useful as we're using zipped bags to add data into our digital preservation system (Archivematica) and I don't believe that our vendor is aware of these issues. If you could elaborate more on them I would be most grateful (or point me to somewhere I can find more information). Thanks for the workaround, I will share it with my colleagues.
Yes,  I'm using the chcp cli tool. It just happened again on my config.js file.  Starting to think it's with generated files somehow. My css file is generated from a preprocessor and some gulp tasks updated the config file. The other 20 some odd files that I manually updated match.  It's almost as if generated files from windows get a different hash from the objective c function. I've verified all files from the server match the hash in the manifest. 
Some, yes, but I'm not sure what version these changes were made. If you want to take a look at the recent changes in FMLControlledNamespacedRegistry, you can find it [here](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/commits/1.10.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/fml/common/registry/FMLControlledNamespacedRegistry.java). I looked through it some, but I just don't know enough of the code to understand it. 
I still seem to get this issue occasionally, and I believe this is more due to us using multiple repositories - in the instance I had this morning, a code review I was looking at had a parent commit that was NOT in my local repository, so the object references didn't exist - if I manually did a fetch from gerrit then the plugin worked.  When the gerrit-intellij plugin does a fetch from gerrit as you click thru reviews, is that fetching directly into my local repository or just fetching in-memory? I suspect something like the later... 
Sorry the report is misleading. The service search is fine and should not be changed.  My comment referred only to:  > Sometimes a partial word search works (e.g. exampl instead of example).  This is the difference:  [Steps to reproduce] 1. log in at marketplace as customer a subscription exists with name "example service" a service exists with name "example service"  [Expected result] Search with similar words "exampl", "Examples" will will find "example service" for service/subscription  [Observed result] Search with similar words "exampl", "Examples" will will find "example service" for service, but NOT for subscription  => Missing stemming for subscription search.

I've found my bug, a convertion from the old versions to the new versions can cause this. Thank you! 
Need to check that. In case it doesn't it seems a duplicate of #4611  
If all things are equal for all countries, should GDP not increase either?   I think the trend prior to Kyoto was that for countries who's GDP increased more, their CO2 emissions increased more too.   I think it might be worth trying to model reality a little closer on this as it's not a particularly tricky issue, and it also shows quite nicely what would've happend without kyoto. 
  I couldn't find anything useful in it but here you go. 
It's more that while I'm scrolling, the popup opens and prevents me from scrolling more, so I have to wiggle the mouse to continue scrolling for another second before the popup reappears (and prevents me from scrolling again).
Yes that's right. Just tried the lock screen and that works fine. The buttons in the drop-down (notifications) also work fine. But still not the main player (after selecting the episode).

Timo,   The Brand class looks like this:     The BrandCode class extends the abstract EntityCode class which was also already given previously (see issue description). Obviously, I have left out all unimportant members and methods from the classes given above.   Basically, the given classes are all part of two class hierarchies: one for entity codes (1) and one for entities (2): 1. BrandCode extends EntityCode 2. Brand extends AbstractNamedEntity<C extends EntityCode> which extends AbstractMultilingualEntity<C extends EntityCode> which extends AbstractEntity<C extends EntityCode> which implements interface Entity<T>  Nothing special really. Hope this help to figure out what is going on here....  Cheers, Pepijn 
Sorry, as stated: no I can not provide such a sample as the actual algorithm start with building a RANDOM route. So any given data set will work or fail ... from experimentation I'd guess a rate of 10:1 but that is highly subjective.  While stating this ... I did *not* look at the random-route-generation code itself! It might well be the error is in that routine producing looping random routes and "fixing" it in the optimize is not the right approach.  
Yea 
Here is a gif a player made, No it does not matter where they stand. It is very weird, as I said I have tested as OP its fine, then I de-op and set myself as a low rank and I can re-produce it 100% of the time.  https://imgur.com/a/idxRkM8
@yegor256 in general, yes, but it would be the best to have this behavior completely transparant for the library user 
Sorry, I put it wrong. My idea is not to crash the app when Non-IOException occurred inside interceptor. 
mainly with snapcast (https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) but behaviour is the same, if I don't play pipe at all  but... I created the pipe as a file with touch. I will try mkfifo and report back
Yes, maybe I can but: How to retrieve "application logs"? 
@tobiasKaminsky The pre-existing auto upload folders can be changed from Instant Upload to something else, but the auto-upload folder connections themselves can not themselves be deleted, and when I reinstall they revert back to be set to Instant Upload (I believe this last part is correct, I need to reinstall to double check but I'm currently traveling so haven't had time to check. I can soon though, perhaps tonight).   Also there are some folders that it it trying to sync such as "reddit_sync" (which is from a reddit client app called Reddit Sync which I have uninstalled and deleted all trace of on my phone.) As no new images are ever going to be placed inside the reddit sync folder again (because the app has been uninstalled and won't be reinstalled), NextCloud Android Client will never recreate the reddit_sync folder (as it did with the Screenshots folder in Instant Upload after I took some screenshots) but it's still junking up my list of autoupload folder connections. 
I presume you don't need system details anymore?

Hi Fabio,  Sorry, the MQ broker cluster environment is absolutely independent from Payara domain configuration, you dont need to start appserver for reproducing (practically REMOTE type, but we still use parallel inprocess EMBEDDED configuartion in Payara to achieve the "useSharedSubscriptionInClusteredContainer" feature for topic subscriptions and lookup from code to the not configured remote instances, so the embedded instances not in use, but this is a long story, it is not related to this case).  imqbroker start command (modified with loglevel parameter as workaround) on 2 server nodes: `\bin\imqbrokerd.exe -silent -force -name instance_x -vmargs "some_mem_args" -loglevel WARNING`  \mq\etc\imqenv.conf (original +java home): `IMQ_DEFAULT_JAVAHOME=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_131`  \mq\instances\instance_x\props\config.properties (with many cluster, port and MSSQL server jdbc persistence parameters, and with the ineffective log level option): `imq.log.level=WARNING`
also SELECT_SCRIPT and SELECT_PASS_WORDLIST. I would do it. 
Here you go https://github.com/sgupta304/wdraTEz3ieJAbC9Zp_rep. When you build the project you will see the build pattern is gradle->testng.xml->TestSetupRunner->TestSuiteRunner. I'm trying to run the same scenario on two different browsers in parallel.
You are correct, I apologize. My settings were wrong in the xml file. Importing settings is working just fine. 
We don't use guava (in the projects that I care about for this, mostly api projects that need to be broadly available, hence 1.6, and have minimal dependencies). Up until now, immutables has been generating 1.6 compatible code without guava (at least with the features I care about).

It works somewhat, though I had to modify the `TokenClickStyle.Select` case a bit to toggle my button and not fall through to the `Delete` case.  Basically my custom Token view has a Button with `visibility:gone` and then in the `Select` case I toggle the visibility.

This was referring to oasp4j 3.0.0, maybe this has been resolved already. Anyhow, I was generating the batch application by the archetype and starting the batch generated spring boot application without any success. 
I don't know. I don't think adding an XML file to the classpath makes sense TBH.
Hi all  thank you for your replies, I would like to run the examples from command-line how to do? and which version I can use for Neo4j ? as following scala -J-Xmx5g -classpath $jars org.opencypher.spark.examples.CaseClassExample such that $jars contains all required jars: caps, scala, spark, neo4j best 
Thanks for the quick response.  >> if you set a tunneling audio session id on the track selector we should prefer using a tunneling decoder  Yes, you're right. I should rephrase that, the statement was referring to point 1). Currently ExoPlayer decides to list the platform codecs with 'REGULAR_CODECS' or 'ALL_CODECS' filter depending on whether the app needs a secure decoder or not.   In file: library/core/src/main/java/com/google/android/exoplayer2/mediacodec/MediaCodecUtil.java codecKind = includeSecure ? MediaCodecList.ALL_CODECS : MediaCodecList.REGULAR_CODECS;  I guess if the utility class knew whether the app preferred a tunneled decoder it could select the right filter.  Anyway, I figure these are implementation details so you guys should know better how to address it. Looking forward to try out your changes when they're ready.  Thanks, 
AFAIR in nearby/location search at least. 
Yikes, talk about fast! :)  You're right, my bad:  RebornCore-1.11.2-2.13.0.12-universal TechReborn-1.11.2-2.1.0.32-universal  There you go!
I can't run our server without sponge, as it's a live (production) server which people play regularly.  Also, it is difficult to reproduce the bug on purpose, although the bug was happening multiple times per day (10 on the day I entered this bug).  We had to remove Astral Sorcery to stabilize the server.  I'd like to report an issue to [SpongeForge's github](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge/issues/), but was wondering if you guys could give me some insight on what exactly to report.
I have not installed any set up file in my PC. I have opened the code in NETBEANS and run the project. I inserted the breakpoint in GT06Protocol. But it is not getting called.  What do i need to do for me to debug the Live data sent from device to the project running in NETBEANS. Is it possible.  Regarding tracker-server.log ......after installation of setup file only it is updating.....but when i run the project in NETBEANS ...there is not log file created. 
I was finally able to recreacte the inconsistent behavior: Consider the ontology [example.owl](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/files/1468436/example.zip), which consists of three logical axioms:  Axiom | Content                         ----- | ----- a1    | FatherChristmas ⊑ owl:Nothing  a2    | SantaClause ⊑ likes.Cookies   a3    | FatherChristmas ≡ SantaClause   When extracting the modules using the class `SyntacticLocalityModuleExtractor` and `ModuleType.STAR` for the signature of each axiom I get  Axiom | Module(Signature of Axiom, example.owl) ----- | ----- a1 | {a1, a3} a2 | {a1, a2, a3} a3 | {a1, a3}  Since there are modules containing _a1_ and _a3_ but not _a2_, these axioms should be parts of different atoms. Contrary to this expectation, `AtomicDecompositionImpl` (again using `ModuleType.STAR`) only returns the atom _{a1, a2, a3}_.  Interestingly, `uk.ac.manchester.cs.jfact.JFactReasoner` behaves in the same way.  Below you will find source code to replicate the above results:   Thanks for reading, Robin Nolte
Thank you! I just upgraded on Google Play and I am back in business (if geocaching can be considered "work"). 
[Example](https://feeds.betterfeeds.org/LinuxAndWhatnot.atom)  Atom is by far the better standard, but It will never take over RSS. It would just be nice for something to support it properly.

Progress bar reaches 100% and my application not going forward.  I am getting something like this:  Collecting  rows 100% ││ 4/4 (10:59:00 / 0:00:00)  I was investigating the problem and probably problem is in default updateInterval. It is set to 1000ms. But if collection is faster then 1000ms (in this case only 4 rows was returned), soI am getting out of loop faster then progress bar get refreshed if I understand well.

In my test case, I'm creating (and selecting) edges the following way:    The edges in re have a unique index on in, out and the where params.  This function is executed multiple times by 8 concurrent threads.  After some time (about 10000 runs), the server hangs with the following thread dump: https://gist.github.com/gerdhub/7459ddda0565d2104892 (Server + Client)  As the server is running on a remote server, I cannot take a complete memory dump at the moment.  I meanwhile also updated to Version 2.1.13...  Does this help? 
Sorry, it's my fault. I'm using the version 18.5.1 that is defined in README.md, not the recent one.
Again tried it, without using ImageOnMap and it looks like it's happening because of fast placing and destroying item frames. https://i.imgur.com/cpQ549N.mp4 Looked to the timings then and it was high
Maybe there is a height limit on one but not the other, so the user only sees, or notices, less on one.
Done. It worked!  Thanks!

The first question: When the notification bar has only one notification, and this notice can be extended (can click for more information), when I turn off the screen, open again, the notification will automatically expand, if there are other notice to occupy The first notification position, the original notice will automatically move down and automatically close the notice.

  I checked 2.0.9.RELEASE as well, and it has the same problem. 
It looks like the error would be somewhere else after my associate has jumped into the topic.  Please see #8845 
@kbagchiGWC Thank you for your response. Here I am giving you all answers of your questions -  1. I have faced the crash,I have already handled exception via try-catch block however app is crashing. For the crash logs, I have already mentioned in above comment as**"Check Crash Logs below -"**.  In above crash logs, you can see **com.twilio.voice.ConnectivityReceiver@fbdfa9b** this receiver has been crashing and this is the internal receiver of Twilio APIs, I didn't mention it in my app anywhere that means some internal logic of Voice quickstart SDK is crashing.  2.  Steps to reproduce -   - Open the App  - Having running Cellular Call (Optional) - Now Incoming call comes to App - Reject the App call - App will crash  3. No it is not device specific, its crashing on all devices.  4. I am not able setup all things with **"voice-quickstart-android"** yet, so I am able to test on **"voice-quickstart-android"**.  5. No **CallInvite.reject()** does not work even I don't have a cellular call.  6. No its only reproducible with beta18.  As per above answers, you can sure that its only issue with beta18 and its crashing when I reject the call even Cellular call not running.  Please verify and response ASAP.
1. In Eye are two changes (one assigned to a teacher), maybe the date selection is not equal in the parser and Eye. But at least tomorrow it should show two changes. 2. So there's no possibility to leave both fields empty? Then I would assign it to the class/teacher "-", rather than "all". 3. OT: Why is this an enhancement? I would rather label it as a bug.  Thank you for your quick reply :) 
I haven't been able to. The message "Processing " does appear, but around number 540, it simply hangs and stops checking. I've checked the file it hangs on, and the does not seem to have any issues (not corrupt, not 0B etc.).  The folders are located on a Samba share, perhaps that could be the issue? I'll try to check with a local folder some time later today.

Awesome MinusKube! 
They are 2 blocks high. The top half is the filter, bottom half is dangling below the filter. There are 2 filters side by side. Nothing above or below the filters. It was meant for them to drop down a 2x1 shaft all the way to the void. So yes they seem to be stuck in the filter suffocating.
Alright, if you place a inactivated division signal in a crafting bench normal it would give you some iron. If you add the recipe to the autocrafter to transfer it into iron, it will make the iron and retain the signal, allowing you to keep putting it in the crafter and duplicate iron. 
I'm using v2.2.0. 
I can't reproduce it either on my desktop, so maybe this is some cache issue on my laptop.
This is the case of postgres as well.  I observed though that if you add padding to the length of the column, queries with these where clauses work.  following works  
it leaves the inserters inventory and doesn't reappear if I take stuff out of the chest, I can make a quick video if you want. 
Not sure yet. Still, I would try to keep jooqfaces seperate and not require the app to register an own extended faces context..
Hi,  So I tried to create a message with no number in the 'To' field, but the app doesnt allow me to do that. It does not even save it as a draft without a number in or contact name in the field. I went through all the logs in that phone, to see if a specific phone number came with no phone number, but that is not the case. They all have either a contact name or phone number attached to them.
Sorry its 1.10.2 tested on both the direwolf20 pack and the skyfactory3 pack on curse. 
Thanks, fixed by running `ALTER TABLE``bm_player_mute_records``ADD COLUMN``soft``TINYINT(1);` manually. And yeah, I updated from 5.6. 
I will try this later today, thank you.
Yes in that way it works

I used Firefox version 60.3.0.esr. I just tried with Internet Explorer version 11.09600. Again the incorrect input is accepted but this time without the brief red frame that I see with Firefox.  By the way:  I'd consider the bevaviour you described in your comment, i.e. replacing the incorrect value by a valid one, as a serious bug, too. It is as if the application said: "I don't like the value you submitted, so I'll take one I like instead." An incorrect value should neither be accepted nor replaced by a valid one.
I know that Traian is right. I am trying to figure out why the following definition works and what is the difference between the one above and the one below:   
@kim-vde , I just checked. This problem only happens with Visualizer. And if you turn on the equalizer with Visualizer, the problem goes away. Bug only happens when the EQ is off and Visualizer is on.  I use SimpleExoPlayer. I tried to change all the settings and the bug is reproduced anyway.
Yeah, I copied from the notifications on the library sample and it's still not working. I'm looking at my push logs on my Dashboard and I'm seeing `publishing the message failed with error: MismatchSenderId`, what could that possibly mean. Adding the device was successful
Zero upgrades. I brought my configs to default values by deleting the config file and rerunning the client again. No change.  I insert X item into, let's say, slot 5, it automatically goes to slot 0, for some odd reason.  I open it again and it's at slot 5. I insert another item, and that item goes to slot 0, and the previous goes to slot 1. 
Locally I run the whole test suite at once, and I see the tests being run sequentially. I don't know exactly what happens on Travis CI unfortunately, apart from that it runs them all. 
Works. Thanks!
Thanks, I'll check it out! 
It is not clear to me this will solve the issue and may present more issues than it solves. Other project types do not have the ant scripts (in nbproject) either. They maybe provision for this I have not had time to look. Perhaps a better (or at least quicker) strategy would be to disable plugin functionality on non compatible project types ?

This happend after dbeaver restart. Im not opening hude number of gui resources, this is latest eclipse ptd, with few plugins. Also I have try to add more memory in eclipse.ini  - 2gb.  If I go to one table, got error, then go to another table - then error not appears, when clicking on er diagram, just light gray background displayed in tab.  When installing DBeaver, I miss installing GEF and draw2k. Then add update site for GEF and installed both, latest versions. I guess it was possible without adding update site, just unable to find them in list of all packages and categories for oxygen.2

The thing is it breaks if you enable merge paths but doesn't if you turn them off.  I have the same behavior in my flutter port and I'm looking for clarification on these mappings.  Flutter's been great.  I nearly have parity with the Android version and I'm hoping to release an initial version soon (need a PR I have open in the engine to land that enables path measure and path operations).

The documentation itself is tied to the version the respective site has deployed. So on opencaching.de/okapi you can see `ver. 1133 (54ad2cf)` in the upper left and the cache field list names the short_description. On opencaching.org.uk/okapi you see `rev. 515` and no mentioning of the short_description field. So in essence you have to check all sites you want to call WRT their ApiSupport level. In our code we currently have only two levels (current and oldapi) as luckily most of the sites nowadays update regularly with only oc.uk staying behind. 
They're just called crystal pylon. They are part of worldgen, they look like this: http://i.imgur.com/O2fUnQH.jpg?1, and they come in all of minecraft's 16 colors. 
Indeed, I was able to log in now. Thanks for the speed :-) (quite disappointing to spot an accent bug in a French app, though :-P) 
Hi @gallandarakhneorg, I would not like to be a burden on your resources, but unfortunately I am on a very tight deadline at the moment and this feature is rather crucial to my program API. Would you be able to release an intermediary patch including this fix?  Thanks very much and sorry for being an inconvenience! Matthew McNally

I have a mod that when opening a specific GUI will freeze the game for a few seconds. However I later found out that this was not the cause, it is a simple nullpointer, because the items displayed are ghost items without a real ItemStack. Adding a null-check fixes the problem immediately.
I tried to only simplify "xshield" or other names, it success but no optimization, string still obfuscated. All I want is to deobfuscate string.  The decoder seems to be in xshield. `invoke-static {v9}, Lcom/xshield/b;->h(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;`  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40742924/46244986-5d997580-c3e7-11e8-8c4a-cb478fd85423.png)  Maybe I can try re-create string decoder in java app if i have good knowledge in smali and java.

@moskvin I was not able to reproduce the crash that @librelioniv experienced on 2 different devices.  However, here is the scenario: - install the app - don't wait for the new covers to be loaded, start downloading Wind 355 immediately => downloading the pdf does not start immediately (in my case, it started after about 20 s).   The reason seems to be that the app cannot start downloading the pdf before all the covers have been downloaded.  A copy of the LogCat is at https://gist.github.com/libreliodev/5419804 
Here is a sample file. While preparing it, I found that my diagnostic is wrong. Some milestones with accented characters show with their name.  [GanttProject milestones.zip](https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/files/2371084/GanttProject.milestones.zip) 
The following code produces the same error when trying to extract a method from the body of `test`. 
Yeah it does seem similar to that. The code I use is part of a larger code base.  The csv code is here: https://github.com/51zero/eel-sdk/blob/master/eel-core/src/main/scala/io/eels/component/csv/CsvPublisher.scala#L25-L52  Which then shows up in the csv tests here: https://github.com/51zero/eel-sdk/blob/master/eel-core/src/test/scala/io/eels/component/csv/CsvSourceTest.scala  And also here: https://github.com/51zero/eel-sdk/blob/master/eel-core/src/test/scala/io/eels/datastream/DataStreamTest.scala#L14-L16  I've played about locally with extra logging to print out the record before my codebase fails the tests because the rows are malformed.  I think it might be concurrency related because when I use the debugger I cannot re-produce the error, indicating that the slowness of the debugger is giving the parsers extra time to do something.  A logging example...  In this one, the values array contains only a single quote mark, but should contain a row.  This then happened for 4 out of the 47 tests.   
Here is   
I have worked around it by extending ConcurrentMapWrapper and overriding the appropriate methods with the fix, as you can see here: https://github.com/TheGoodlike13/twitch-sahyun-bot/blob/master/src/main/java/eu/goodlike/sahyun/bot/http/cookies/CorrectConcurrentMapView.java  Then instead of Cache.asMap() I manually cast the Cache into InternalCache and use the constructor. It's not pretty, but it works :)

@sduskis, #1477 would actually reduce the number of errors you would see, since we would delay failing RPCs until we try all addresses for a host. So you may be more interested in it. It is more of a real fix. 
Yes it does, so are we just waiting for it to be published?

It's right there first line. It's  something like '{{case}}' or '{{case.id}}' I realize now that case is a liquid thing not necessarily a java or clojure keyword. I think the parser does not like ppl using those words

Yes to 1.0.4b, and yes I do have the logs.  I unfortunately don't know exactly when the problem happened, because I didn't notice the problem at first, so my apologies for that.  Here is a ~2000 line gist of the logs, from startup until a time where I know the problem should have already happened by: https://gist.github.com/gth828r/1ddb13ed89ba57de8015  I suspect the problem occurred toward the latter half of the logs.  I am working within the "samevlan" slice, and the "diffvlan" slice intentionally doesn't have a controller for the duration of this test.  Here is my fsfw config file as well, in case it is useful. https://gist.github.com/gth828r/126827c92cd3c34a2bc0  This was one stress test against the various tests against fsfw in a series of them.  If you want to know more about the steps leading up to this test, I can describe it.  FYI, I have not been able to reproduce this again, but I'll be trying many times, and I'll report back if I see it again (hopefully with a more narrow log snippet!) 
The entire DBeaver application crashes. It closes (the window vanishes) without any alert or error message displayed. Only examining the logs reveals the cause.

Good point, this started happening after upgrading to BuildCraft 7 
UIButton.java
Wow that was fast! Thanks!  I cannot share the specific code, but I can tell you what led to it and how I "fixed" it.  I was using a cache with an interface (implementing Serializeable) as Key and an Interfacearray (`InterfaceType[].class`) as value. The only implementation was generated by [https://github.com/immutables/immutables](https://github.com/immutables/immutables).  I think the problem occured by accessing the cache without the implementation class used elsewhere in the code.  I added the `@Serial.Version(value = 1234L)` annotation and removed the interning annotation (which causes immutables to use interned strings).   Thanks for looking into this. I know that the thrown cause was generated by my code, but since also errors could occur, I really think your new approach is more correct.   
I do also have two sources active (geocaching.com and opencaching.de). @rsudev exactly describes my scenario.

I started down that road yesterday but backed off when I saw the list of existing chars came from the WHATWG spec. I shall resurrect the change and see if there are any problems. I think it will result in the UnknownHostException / not following redirect behavior mentioned above, which constitutes a behavior change but not one that I can (currently) see causing too many problems.

You are right it seems to be only a problem with rule34.paheal.net. My guess would be that a wrong status code is more likely than a wrong content-type. But checking the returned body content is probably the only way to be sure :( Nice app by the way :)
Not really, this happens on both of my computers (Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 10 64-bit), I just downloaded the Windows 64-bit ZIP archive from your website: http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/files/dbeaver-ce-latest-win32.win32.x86_64.zip 
This happens with `--forceName` as well. In the sample app, jar name is without version suffix, and therefore module name matches default name of the app.

`InFlightMessage` has nothing to do with this. This class is part of another library we use (this is a comm. stack). Basically what happens is that `Thread-33` tries to close Spring application context. While on the other hand the JVM `SIGTERM handler` thread is running the shutdown hook to exist the JVM.  There is no issue in thread Thread-33. The issue is on lock `0x00000005cc3bde18` caused by the `synchronized` blocks.  The `close()` method in `AbstractApplicationContext` could be called at the same time the JVM shutdown hook is triggered. 
Hi, thanks for this hint. The validator gave the same error. It turns out that the endpoint itself accepts the SPARQL query as I posted it in the first comment. However, the pagination class as well as the query validator only accepts the "count" in brackets as it is described in the SPARQL standard (there is an example in section 18.2.4.1 on http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query ).  So, my query should look like:  <pre>SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?COUNT) WHERE { ?a &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFormat&gt; }</pre>  Thanks again and sorry for opening this issue.

This is on a Jolla 1 phone (Qualcomm Krait dual-core) under SailfishOS 2.1.3.7 (basically a regular Linux distribution) with AlienDalvik 0.17.35 (based on AOSP 4.1.2, API level 16) as Android runtime environment.  Crosschecked on a Blackberry phone under BBos 10.3 (based on QNX with Qt) and its AOSP 4.4 based (API level 19) Android runtime environment (i.e. with a similar architecture of the software stack, but quite different components compared to SFOS / AlienDalvik): Yes, the vertical grid lines and X-axis marks are indeed present.  Shall I capture logs on the phone under SailfishOS with AlienDalvik, i.e. may logs be helpful?
No problem.  Should I have one commit, and put "GH-41, GH-43:" in the header?

Thx for pointing me to the calculation function. I'll try hunting the bug ;)  It's somehow strange only on the Nvidia Shield K1 (7" / 2015 / 7.0) there is this problem.  I'll send you a merge request or a sample project if I can't find the issue.  Thx!
Thank you for amazing response time 😄   There is a doc site for that: https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html  If you're using gradle I think it would just be easy to do a small subproject that applies the android plugins and follow that guide. I don't think you need to do any real android programming for this but if gradle complains you can just generate an empty android project with Android Studio.  I'll test the snapshot later today and come back! 
Well, the website said that the proxy is still alive. But It seems like I cannot connect into it  So, this is prob caused by the proxy. Not the program. I'll find another proxy then, ty for helping btw

Thanks, updating version works for me.  BTW, is it possible to force restamp the binary if the head commit changes, even if all dependency is unchanged? AFIK go rule is using STABLE_BUILD_SCM_REVISION instead of BUILD_SCM_REVISION which can force restamp, can cc_binary configured in this way as well?

Sorry, my mistake, the server port and the management port are treated in the same way. I have updated the example accordingly.   Nevertheless, the main issue remains. The `@Value` annotations gets resolved to the values specified in the `override.properties` file (which I believe is correct, given the order of the `@PropertySource` annotations). However, when Tomcat starts, the port values are not being overridden, and the values specified in the `some.properties` file are used. IMHO this makes the overriding mechanism inconsistent, and it would be better if the Tomcat properties are resolved in the same way as "normal" Spring properties. 
Attached a test case. The int[] has a size of 603. All length values added make 1804 which is the length of the string.  [Test.txt](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/files/289855/Test.txt)

@rohanKanojia I've been talking about "Java Console", which you can find the link at the pod page of a Jolokia-enabled Java app. I'm using `oc cluster up`.  ![screen shot 2018-04-12 at 10 31 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156692/38651528-bc2a2c42-3e3c-11e8-90f3-1482caae8c79.png) 
Sure, I will, in a few days I will add some extra info, sorry for the delay;) 
I added some words to censor in the config under the "Words to be censored" region, then set censor to true. (it was false before) After a server reboot to put the changes in effect, everything typed into chat had the "censorSymbol" displayed before and after each word. 
OK, I have made some progress in better characterizing this issue.  It appears that the upgrade process doesn't result in a "proper" boot loop but, instead, the tablet simply takes 2-3 times as long to boot.  The short version of what I did is as follows: 1. I attempted the same upgrade (1.8.3 -> 1.8.7) after a fresh boot and got the same result (I force rebooted after being stuck on the boot screen "too long").   2. I performed the same reset procedure outlined above except that I didn't import my settings.  I then repeated the upgrade process and got a successful boot in the normal timeframe for this device. 3. Just to further nail things down, I then imported my settings and rebooted.  After it looked like the same "hung boot" results, I started to write this post.  It took long enough that, when I glanced back at my device, I noticed that it did in fact eventually boot to the home/lock screen (I then had to re-compose this post...:>).  It did take significantly longer than normal, though. 4.  From there, I performed a standard upgrade to 1.8.10.  Interestingly, the reboot time for that upgrade seemed pretty normal.  Since this is an easily reproducible issue (on my device), I am more than happy to go a few more rounds if you would like me to gather some specific data for you.  Otherwise, the underlying issue seems far less serious than I originally outlined and I am content to just move on.  Let me know your thoughts!  I think the squarely point to a problem in my settings (and/or possibly some room for improved error-checking imported settings within XPrivacy).  Regardless, based on the changes made in XPrivacy btwn 1.8.3 and 1.8.7, can you suggest some settings (i.e. apps and/or hooks...) I could look into to determine what is causing the problem?  Thanks in advance!

I will be with pleasure to provide a first fix PR soon.
Ah, sorry for the poor report. No errors, just the values no longer show up in the manifest.  If I use 0.6.0 the values like mavanagaiata.commit.sha get properly picked up and that info is captured in the manifest. If I use 0.6.1 then those values just show up as empty values.  I tried to downgrade the version of jgit used as a dependency to what was used in 0.6.0 but that didn't work.  This happened on both Win 7 and our CI linux box. I've tried both maven 3.0.5 and 3.1.1.  I've had trouble debugging the issue with eclipse (linking the code to the source), but I think that it's not finding the .git folder.  I'm most confused how the artifact from central doesn't work, yet if I run "mvn install" locally with the tag 0.6.1 tag from github, that artifact works.  If you're unable to reproduce it, I'll try to whip up a project that can demo it. 
I did. No problems at all. Issue is resolved. 
Looks good, I did not run into the error again! Thanks for the fast fix!

I can't reproduce it either. It's happened exactly once and it was following a change. I was switching branches last night (probably from issue_14[145] to develop.) Figured it was better to document it.  I can't recall any more steps to reproduce than in the original post. 
Thanks for the info. The reason I asked about it is that we have a need to validate parameter field for provisioning PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id. According to the OSB spec https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.15/spec.md#provisioning, it should return 400 bad request if parameters are not valid.  We can't do it because there is no such exception exists in the library  
Sorry... I've not been that much clear in my first post...  I'm using swagger-editor, export to JSON format my API spec. The json generated with swagger-editor is:    (without quotes for the version number) is expected... 
I used the default one that DBeaver downloaded when I created the connection. There is any option to force full unload of the driver?
Stone brick blocks and ordinary glass. Screenshot attached showing tank, currently missing it's valve.  I do have another, smaller tank underground. I have no issues with FPS dropping with that tank. The smaller tank is about half the size of this one. (IIRC 4x4x5 (WxDxH))  ![2016-03-16_23 16 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10439814/13808925/4a31570a-ebcd-11e5-891e-00f4a261d5c9.png) 
I will try to provide an example. But the error happens on a big project with multiple modules. So that will take some time.
Unfortunately I don't remember which dataset was it.... I'll try to reproduce it and keep you in touch.
How could I get a full stacktrace where the excception occurs? 
Fixed with #262 
I thinks it works, I don't have the "Could not find referenced cmap stream Identity-H" error now. My app recognizes most of the documents with this fix. 
The .java and .class files are re-created, but the error persists. 
Yes, data explorer 1.0. I will put the label on this issue

Thx, it fixes it! 
@tobiasKaminsky Thank you for your reply! I use Swift as my owncloud primary back-end storage while demo account uses Database. I test it works when using Database.  
Of course,  http://sonic.medyainternet.com:9632/;stream.nsv http://radyodejavu.canliyayinda.com:8054/;stream.nsv  These are standart shoutcast v1.9.x  Same application works on shoutcast 2.4 servers. Example; http://stream.radyovaveyla.com/;stream.nsv http://radyobozcaada.canliyayinda.com:4000/;1  Update: Also problem in 2.0 http://www.mediasrv.akdeniz.edu.tr:8000/;1  Update: icy://www.mediasrv.akdeniz.edu.tr:8000/;1 works fine.   Also; I'm using ExtractorRendererBuilder. Only this works fine for shoutcast.  Thanks a lot. 
I can't see the visual representation of how full the tank is. WAILA / functionality works fine.

No, I don't. Tried enabling debug mode and received this error: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Khz1bsi1 Tried World Edit operations again and only received this error: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=83tJnKCW 
It's a new world, imo there shouldn't be problems...
A quick chat with @wilkinsona indicates that the problem is likely to be around the dependency on a `-SNAPSHOT`.  Our guess is that Aether is trying to resolve a newer version of the dependency using the _entire_ repository chain.  Since trying to run a `grab`, offline, against `-SNAPSHOT`s, that have been populated into `~/.m2`, but nowhere else is probably an edge case, I'm going to close out the issue.  At some point you guys are going to have to deal with the on-prem case (access to internal repositories, but not external), but there's no need for that to be today. 
I am using Lg G6, do you thing that it is device related issue? I will check it tomorrow on other devices. Thanks for issue link, I will check it.
Cable headphones.  I don't see the relation between network usage and responding to pause event. 
It brings up the file explorer and says no files available. Doesn't give me the option to look in Google Photos or drive
just to softly remind :)
Tried it on Windows: Included rt.jar - everything worked, Gui, including. Process started then: Java Heap Space - out of memory Error. Maybe the obfuscator  just not working on linux. Do you have a solution for the windows error above? thank you.

Steps I did for the creation of this zip.:  - Download a demo application from start.spring.io (Spring Boot V2.2.1, Java 8, Dependencies: Web) - Extract the demo application - Ran command mvnw clean install spring-boot:run in the demo application - Waited for Boot - After boot -> Stop with ctrl+C   Result: A Build failure  [demo.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/3823451/demo.zip) [output.txt](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/3823453/output.txt)

D:\workspace\mymavenparentproject\myproject\src\program in case you suspect the path's length, the actual project names are shorter.  Windows 7  It's a very basic project following the example available here on the site (math.go)  In the "program" folder there are two files:  program. go   and  program_test.go which has this content (it actually doesn't test anything from the other file) :  package main  import (     "testing" )  func TestHelloWorld(t *testing.T) {     str := HelloWorld("xxx")     if str != "xxx" {         t.Fail()     }  } 
Its my own theme that I modified using [this editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) I have read/write rights for ~/.R/rstudio/themes and I can manually delete the theme from that folder, and then add my new theme as usual in the R studio app (ie he problem is fixed if I do this). But the remove button still doesn't work for me. It also doesn't work with the preview. Thanks
it doesn't have the `template` key in the body as is required for index templates. Executing it on `5.6` cluster produces an error: 
Yes, putting a piece of redstone in between the torch and the port does "fix"(more like a workaround) the problem. About the redstone dying out? If you look "closely" you can see that WAILA reports a power of 2 on the redstone that is powering the torch, which is also off. 
The fix didn’t work in a quick test of something else last night.  Not sure where it’s at now, but I’ll take ownership.
Well, now I can't replicate it either. I wonder if there's some intermittent bug with dates getting set in the future. If I notice it again I'll try and get more log info. 
Hi Serge,  I found this issue at work. On next Monday I'll give you detailed information about this issue.  If my memory does not fail, I found the bug when trying to autocomplete column names in the query _right after_ the with statement.

Using Java 8 works better (interestingly enough, since the pom file specifies Java 8 to be used?), but generates other errors as below:  
Because if you want to support java 9+ too, then you need to depend on `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-alpn-java-server`, which brings `org.eclipse.jetty.alpn:alpn-api` as a dependency, which contains that same class 😉

Thanks for having a look into this. - Exception is thrown with every log statement after channel has closed.  - The channel closes always at the same log statement, why I don't know.  - The next entries in the stacktrace are from classes from our application (can't disclose).

In Showcase and in my application. Note: I don't use any css of showcase in my application. The problem can be simulated with the code below (tested in Firefox 12, Internet Explorer 9 and Chrome):  public class TestPage implements com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint {    }  The problem appear when the browser width is less than 980px. 
I can provide code tomorrow if you still need it, but simply: 1. create a query that would yield no data (without a reduce function) 2. `query.setGroupLevel(1);` 3. `query.run();`

Umm, maybe since it's using the Sailfish mail client to send the email, something gets lost in the way.`:(`  May I use the option of sending via Riot itself? Where to? You may send me the address to ivan at selidor dot net if you don't want to publish it here.  Also, I'd like to include a screenshot of the room screen, but the app only allows me to send the report from the room list.  Thanks a lot for tracking this!
The video in "up next" used to be just the first element of related videos. IMHO it doesn't separate UI part
I am looking into the feasibility of asking for access to the byte-code.   If the user consents I can probably obtain the maven project so you can test it directly. 
I didn't installed any Scripts/mods. Here's a logcat: http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=a7a6de-1453221373.png Nothing interresting.

@sharkykh yes you're right! This is repo I'm member of.  But why can I not close my own issue there w/o authorizing as member of the organisation, just like any regular user?
![PicsArt_02-18-01 27 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5763466/74675166-f3f15580-51ed-11ea-996f-3cc57d8d631a.jpg)  Yes in browser it is working fine
Well. The remarkable thing is, that selecting a picture with c:geo and selecting a picture in my mobile browser opens the same selector. When opened via c:geo it shows every file except *.jpg greyed out, via browser several image file types are selectable.  That made me think we apply a filter or preselection when calling the file browser. 
@florianesser did some testing with a local proxy, unless we get any further feedback that would be sufficient for me to close the issue.
When I do /npc select with the id it says no npc could be found, while the other times I did /npc select nothing happened. I can see the npc's using /npc list 
I did a little research and testing, and didn't come across the ad infinitum problem. If my fix works on your phone, go ahead and close this ticket.
@Yongyao I don't see how the changes in that commit would affect searching. The only Java file that changed seems unrelated to searching.
No. (I tried, using `doSessionWith(...) `, casting the `restOperations` to a `RestTemplate` and replacing that Builder with one into which's constructor I passed my own `ObjectMapper`.) Vault seems to assume seconds as default,  unless a time unit postfix like `s`, `m`, or `h` is applied... A little while ago I found a page listing all permissible postfixes, but unfortunately I can't find it anymore...  Update: this might help... https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/master/ui/app/components/ttl-picker.js#L16
Yep, you're right. It works the same way with just code rearrange.
yes, it might be the case that this was an issue due to old cached assets. It seems to have gone away for now. I will keep this issue for a while. If anyone sees another case, please report here, with reproduction steps. I will close the issue in a few weeks if all seems clear. It used to be a sporadic issue that would pop up every now and then!
Thanks for the comment.  The code works when compiled and run with Java SE, but as soon as I use RoboVM it dies with the Runtime Exception.  It doesn't tell me which specific HTMLUnit class is causing the issue; rather I have commented out all references to HTMLUnit line-by-line and any HTMLUnit class calls to causes the same Runtime Exception, even with try-catch.  Is anyone else having problems with HTMLUnit or other 3rd party JARs with RoboVM in  RoboVM Eclipse? 
i just saw the message about cardinal components. i removed that and still have this issue. once i get home i can run it to get a crash report.

Hi, can you advise what else needs to be done or what I am missing to have custom devfile registry working? Thank you.
The project type is Maven. We were able to make it work on another javac project by manually specifying the jars, but so far have been unsuccessful with Maven projects. I tried the sample Maven project in order to see if it was something wrong with my project or with the overall setup. Since the issue occurs in the sample project this points to either a system setup issue or an issue in Codenvy.   The issue seems to be isolated to the IDE classpath. Since we set the project to type Maven, we cannot edit the classpath, the buttons are disabled in the popup window, shown under Project->configure classpath. Maven downloads the defined jars into ~/.m2/repository/ directory. I am not sure how Codenvy resolves this directory. Another interesting thing we have noticed is that dependencies defined in Maven do not get resolved however java utility classes like java.util.Date are correctly resolved by the IDE. You can see this on line 8 in the included screenshot.  ![correctlyresolve](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10276740/16619176/1418e90e-435b-11e6-962f-eb8f370d4599.PNG) ![classpath](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10276740/16619179/17033494-435b-11e6-868d-1a253871faf0.PNG) 
1.0.4. I just updated and tested, same problem unfortunately. 
So the issue is that our library is grabbing all of our owned repositories and putting them in a mapping of repository name -> repository object. Originally we assumed this would only grab in my case, agduncan94/* repositories. We had another function to grab repositories from organisations you belong to.  Turns out "owned" repositories is not only those in your namespace (ex. agduncan94), but also include others. So if you had a repository agduncan94/foo and another one you "owned" called dockstore/foo, only one would show up in the mapping.  The function returns all repos according to the following: > List repositories that are accessible to the authenticated user (public and private) using the specified page size. >    >      * This includes repositories owned by the authenticated user, repositories that belong to other user, where the authenticated user is a collaborator, and other organizations' repositories that the authenticateduser has access to through an organization membership.  What we actually want is is just the first point (repositories owned by the authenticated user)

No, every time I've opened the app since, my wishlist was still blank. I tried adding a few random cards and repeatedly opening and closing the app, but I can't seem to replicate the deletion or the sudden app crash. The crash happened during an update of the database, it that helps any.
The function `getTypesafeValueForField`makes a promise: To get the value for a field in a typesafe way. But it does not keep the promise and `getRequestPayload` (and other callers as well) will suffer from it.  I like the idea of `getTypesafeValueForField` a lot, as it makes the caller's code much easier and separates concerns. I very much prefer a solution that fixes `getTypesafeValueForField` so all callers can benefit from the improvement.  Does that answer your questions?
Dear Ron, 1. Same Windows 7 build as you 2. I'm actually using the French (Canada) Keyboard. I see the same expected behavior as you (press twice to have the "hat" accent in French) in any other application, but RStudio IDE.   Actually, I found that the bug is happening more cleanly when I switched from English to French keyboard : 1. Using Windows Language Bar, I've mapped the sequence "Ctrl + 1" to get English keyboard, and "Ctrl + 2" to get French (Canada) keyboard (quick way to change between language when programming)  2. The freeze happened systematically when I pressed the "hat" key AFTER switching from English to French keyboard using the ctrl keys. 3. If I switched between keyboards using the mouse, there is no freeze when typing the hat key.  I've downgraded to RStudio 1.1.463 and everything working as expected (there is no interference between switching keyboard using Ctrl keys and the hat key)  Thanks for your help,  Hans
Thanks for your reply. My Attr class does not have a single String argument constructor but only a "valueOf". However this should still work according to the documentation.  I will create a reproducer and report back.
@andriizhumela I have a single activity architecture and always initialized Stream in my activity's onCreate. But on Application death, the stream chat isn't initialized anymore, I have handled this, but this is generally my biggest discomfort with the library, the god singleton streamclient which isn't in anyway lifecycle aware, makes it very hard to be flexible and adds restrictions. It's not a good approach imho. Having such kinds of classes in a view would always lead to a crash like like this. I'm not initialising stream client in my Application class as I save my keys in my server
I didnt understand but it work with clean setup. https://pastebin.com/z2wFeGM4 Its my config. Whats wrong?
When I write a .ics from ImageJ, the header states the seemingly right dimensionality and scaling. The dimensions get mixed up, but not lost, when opening the image there. That’s why I only referenced the according issue of SCIFIO.

Well, my idea was to wait for the COBOL stuff, to merge this e.g. into my branch (i.e. definitely not directly in the fesch/Structorizer.Desktop/master - the master should only contain tested and releasable code) then to scrutinize the resulting version thouroughly (both on your and my branch) and then, after it had undergone and passed the tests, induce a pull request on fesch/Structorizer.Desktop/master as last and final step. So, what I'd like to recommend you is that you either fork from my master branch or pull the content of my master branch into your fork cloned from fesch master. Then we would merge it among our versions until is sufficiently stable and create the eventual pull request for the release. If you think the COBOL additions will take significantly more time, however, then I might finish release 3.27 still witthout it and we add the COBOL stuff (together with other possible fixes and accomplishments) as a follow-up version.
It was working in a earlier version of the private "modpack", but now it isn't: http://imgur.com/a/sRNiJ I will try it with less mods.

Wow, that was quick. I just checked it again with 2.0.2-SNAPSHOT and does resolve the issue. Thx a lot. 👍 
It's a similar symptom, but most likely a different cause. In 1.10, null item stacks were allowed, so the exact same fix will probably not work. In your case it's getPickBlock throwing a NPE rather than returning null causing Waila/Hwyla to throw one.

Tried a few different build, it breaks in #1488 as well. I just converted my server from using the built-in sqllite database of Mytown to a mysql server running separately and that works perfectly, if that helps any. Unfortunately it's not a bug I can provide much testing feedback in as I had to get towns working for my players asap, as no towns on a pvp allowed server had the potential to be devastating for my server. If others have this issue, going from sql lite to mysql fixes it. 
fixed 
@dmzaytsev @yegor256 I agree with Dmitry. We can add one more field "Owner" to identify bout creator. In this case we can avoid using roles, actually we do need roles here we just need to identify bout starter.  
Hi Martin,  Thanks for the prompt reply. Also, it's my pleasure to support AEDict on Patreon, as it's a piece of software that I use every single day and that has simplified my language learning process considerably.  As for the current issue, I think that your proposed solution of beginning with the "correct" stroke count probably makes the most sense. Another option would be to add "Sort by Stroke Order" checkbox or menu option, in order to give users the ability to disable the new sorting feature.  Typically, I wouldn't have bothered you about such an issue, but I noticed that it actually had a marked effect on my translation output. I'm working on a pretty technical text right now, and having an additional 5+ seconds added to each search (scrolling to find the correct stroke count) is actually kind of non-trivial over hours of work and 10s or 100s of dictionary look-ups.  Anyway, I appreciate the reply and the tireless work you've been investing into AEdict.

Ah, I thought the removal of ALL might have been intended, so I used feature, instead of bug. Thank you for the fix though. :)
For your question , i suppose you solved the problem in last weeks :)  I use 2.0. I try to download 2.1 
It was on all kinds of devices as far as I know all had the software step detector.
When I try to use the previous scoreboard, I get a problem with BungeeCord. At the player's respawn, he is thrown from the server. I also tested version 1.11 and found the same bug there.  This [plugin](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/easy-scoreboards-v2-3/12746) uses a static scoreboard, but updates its values. The problem is the same as for my code.

No, I've deleted my setup since. I'll make sure to save the log if I encounter the problem again. 
Thanks for the info.
Yes, you are right. But ATM we should still fix this particular bug.
In the demo application, I'm seeing that the seekbar goes to ~4:30 (270757ms) when I drop it (I hardcoded the seekbar to use that number - this is replicating a seek based on chapter metadata), but then it jumps back to ~4:00 (240047ms) when playback resumes.  In my own app, I've verified the location where playback resumes by polling the current state of the player.
I think it changes the javascript too.  Doesn't appear to be a treeshaking issue.

That works, but it starts crashing once i add the metals package.
I'm always for properly documented and flexible configs. Can never say no to that.   I went through most of the fluids and had a couple of question: **Helium/Deuterium/etc.**  Are Helium and Liquid Helium both recognized as a fluid by forge? Or is one registered as a gas and the other is a fluid? Mostly asking for CraftTweaker reasons for processing blocks like the SuperCooler.  Would I need to use Mekanism gas tubes/gas tanks to store Helium, and then use Thermal Dynamics fluiducts to extract the output? Same with Deuterium and any other 'gasses' that have a fluid counterpart?  **Fluids** Do the fluids have any functional in-world use? If I use the configs to disable the registered fluids, will the player be missing out on any gameplay that you have in the mod? (aside from burning themselves in molten plasma). I'm open to in-world mechanics (eg how Big Reactors uses fluids to cool its own reactors), but I just wanted to weigh off opportunity costs with the Block ID's (eg. the ID's used up by fluids could be used for adding PnematicCraft instead).  **Steam** Is NC steam oredict'd to steam? Is steam produced from reactors also functional with turbines from other mods (Extreme Reactors/Mekanism/Advanced Generators, etc)
Hi   I understand what you mean. But my question is simple. I define an experiment with a seed. I load the model. The seed value is correct in the parameter view. In parameter view, I change a variable and reload the model from parameter view (with the anticlockwise circular arrow). Now the seed is changed. I don't want the seed value to change.   Do you confirm that even in this case, only one experiment, it will change?   I do not understand what you mean by seed for experiment and seed for simulation.  I have my seed in experiment section as a float. I guess this is experiment seed.  What is simulation seed?  Please could you clarify? regards, Srirama 
I found similar generation in Mesa Plateau M biomes on 1.7.10.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv38m5wvh303zlj/Screenshot%202016-12-07%2019.53.40.png?dl=0  I've also been seeing this issue again: https://github.com/Team-RTG/Realistic-Terrain-Generation/issues/817  But it always seem to trigger in savannas or similar biomes as of late.  I still have Magia Naturalis, but I'm likely going to pull it soon to see if it solves the issue for me, or if other stuff keeps causing it.

Hey, no worries.  I think you can probably close this one.  I updated some of the other mods I'm using and the problem has gone away so I suspect your diagnosis was spot on.  Thanks.

Thanks for your input.  > Weird thing, debugSettings entry is supposed to be gone, so an ordinary user shouldn't be able to click it. Do you think this issue has something in common with this post on Reddit?  That's a very good pointer. This really could be the case. I already wondered why I still get so relatively many crashes from version 1.3.0 although 1.3.1 is already released for quite some time. Of course, it could be that user's simply didn't update. But the weirdness of this crash hints at a bot. Maybe it send touch events so early in the activity lifecycle that the view hierarchy was not properly initialized yet or something. I don't know but I guess the crash is an anomaly. I'm going to push a "proper" fix anyway like you suggested.

Sure thing, let me test it 
2.12.0 (but seems that 3.7.0 also has this problem)
I don't know if crates needs to be redone, but your implementation seems fine by me.  As far as I can tell, it's just a matter of casting on the interface and not the class. Everything's alright in dimensions that use the default SaveHandler instead of declaring their own. Casting on  `ISaveHandler` would make it work with everything.

I have missed the fact, that an exception will be thrown automatically if it wasn't cleared, so some things in the rust-bindings still should be updated. :smile: 
I've been unable to reproduce the Web GUI unavailable part of the issue, but I just upgraded syncthing-android to v0.7.4 (Syncthing v0.12.2+18-g56f1c29) and now the Android device isn't connecting at all when it's not on the same network as the other nodes. This was also true of earlier versions of the android app until 0.7.0 iirc.  I've attached an android log - it should show my android device disconnected after the update, then re-connecting once I switch to to the same Wi-Fi network as the other devices [syncthing-android.txt](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/files/35828/syncthing-android.txt) 
OK I feel that we are missing the point here. Let's ignore the round-to-nearest-second and the fact that we DO have sub-second ticks and also the fact that we get many, many ticks per day.   We're talking (in a Carl Sagan voice) "billionzz-and-billionzz" of rows in the database.  Whether the time period is ms, sek, minutes, days, years or centuries shouldn't matter btw. Every time period has an open&close and high&low, as well as total volume. This is what I understood your Tick class was handling, by having an addTrade() method for all trades that occur within the Tick period.   Anyhow, we are using TA för intraday trading, and I was testing your framework on our data, by doing a quick hack of the TradingBotOnMovingTimeSeries.java example. It immediately gave exceptions on "Cannot add a tick with end time <= to series end time".  I read trades from the database for a whole day (symbol, timestamp, price and qty) and feed it into the program. In this particular testcase I had about 34000 trades. A few of them has the same timestamp. Whether the TimeSeries period is 1 second, 10 minutes or 1 hour shouldn't matter, right? For the sake of argument, I created Ticks with period 1 minute and 1 hour too, but got exactly the same exceptions.  Since it occurred every time we had two trades with the same timestamp, so I started to see if I could find a way around the problem.  The Tick class computes beginTime as the given time (stored in endTime) minus the period. Doesn't this complicate matters when you add trades sequentially? Wouldn't it be a lot easier if you took the given time as beginTime and set endTime to beginTime + period? Since you normally have trades in time-order with increasing timestamp? How else can I test that "this timestamp" belongs to the "current Tick" or if I should create a new Tick? I must have misunderstood something here.  Thats why I had the "lastTick.inPeriod(d)" call, to see if my tick was to be added to the current Tick object, else I would create a new Tick for the next timeperiod. Also, the rounding was just trying to avoid the problem with the endTime/beginTime I mentioned earlier.   So, to clearify, we are not talking HFT and we are talking intraday TA (of course in coop with other proprietary analysis). I just want to be able to feed in my data with duplicate timestamps.

@aaaaalbert: The method "_enable()" for the Bluetooth sensor will be called when the user enables it on the settings, right? When the Bluetooth is off at that time, the sensor won't start scanning. However, if the sensor is enabled by the user and she turns off the Bluetooth (for example, when the battery of the device is low), the scanTask callback will not be removed and keeps scanning. You can confirm this by looking at the logcat following the scenario I proposed (you should be able to see "restart bluetooth scanning" message on the logCat every 10 seconds, which is the scan interval for Bluetooth sensor).   Sure, I'll submit a pull request related to this issue.

Actually, I found it's because my test is under androidTest folder, not test, which causes the package unavailable.
Simply left clicking the current syringe with the new one in the spawner GUI. 
I'll check it out but I definitely think that will solve the issue.   Have you looked into DeferredRegistry<T> and RegistryObject<T>? It's a slightly more complex system but it automatically generates suppliers that are then automatically registered, allowing for static initialization of anything that has a Forge registry. I mostly based the code in MysticalWorld on [Tropicraft's system](https://github.com/Tropicraft/Tropicraft/blob/1.14/src/main/java/net/tropicraft/core/common/block/TropicraftBlocks.java). [My library for it in MysticalLib](https://github.com/MysticMods/MysticalLib/blob/1.14/src/main/java/epicsquid/mysticallib/registry/ModRegistry.java) is still fresh, [here's an example of it](https://github.com/MysticMods/MysticalWorld/blob/1.14/src/main/java/epicsquid/mysticalworld/init/ModBlocks.java).  I'm not sure if it would precisely resolve the issue in this case, but at the very you'll be able to tell if the serializer is being accessed *before* the actual registry event for the serializer.  (Just beware that it's better to do EntityTypes statically.)  Upon testing, there's now another error that appears to be shifting back to an optional failing, so ... I think it's fixed!

I want to say yes. @amysueg @catrobson - can you please verify? 
To Reproduce: 1) Click e.g. on a bestow enchantment creature card on your hand. 2) The ability picker window opens, with three choices. 3) Click now on any other card/permanent outside the ability picker window. Nothing happens, the ability picker window stays open. 4) Now try to pick an ability from ability picker window (that's still open). You click on a choice and the window closes. But no ability is picked, Nothing happens.

Note that this is the consequence of another issue, so it might be relatively hard to repro, I think that it was caused by https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/issues/4871 but I'm not entirely sure. I've removed some addons from the 'binding=' line in one of the addons.cfg file and it seemed to fix the issue, I'll put them back and see if the problem repro...  The suggestion here was to limit the number of elements that can be contained in SitemapResource::eventOutputs.
Seems to have used 2000 LP when I tested just now, but the OP from the SevTech issue states it used 1000. So not a dupe on my end? but still annoying.
Yes I get normal drops from zombies and skeletons, (bones, arrows, flesh, etc) just no heads.  I have custom mods installed, quite a few really, they include Solar Flux, buildcraft, villager trade tables, extra utils, elevator mod, enderstorage, forestry, autopickup, JEI and JER, minecolonies, weirding gadget, waystones, tech expansion and torcherino, and of course, woot.  I build the T4 factory and add Tier 3 upgrades for Rate, XP, Mass and Decapitate, as i said before I know power is no problem (High Tier solar panels) and I get Creeper Heads and Wither Skulls fine, but not the other 2.
Apologies: 1.10.2.  I'll add mod-version/mc-version to my other tickets as well.  In fact, I just realized I'm several versions behind (1.1.17).  I'm going to quickly update and see if I can close some of these.
It happens nearly every week (on both servers, with low traffic).    At the time it is not working I have a established connection in netstat:   ApnsClient says also it is not connected and connecting again is not working. And tcpdump shows that their is a open connection. I'm using DI and queueing so their is only one instance of apns client in my application. Seems that he is losing the correct state internally.

Sorry for the delay with answer. Yes, it must be an IDEA 15 issue because it is ok for me in 14 version.

In this first screenshot I have created an encoded pattern for a chest as an example.  You can see the encoded pattern in my inventory. ![2017-10-15_10 48 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/314107/31586429-85a3389a-b196-11e7-9eed-0dec5de1f644.png) When I hold down shift, the encoded pattern is supposed to show me that it is a pattern for a chest by changing to an icon of a chest.  Instead, it just disappears. ![2017-10-15_10 48 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/314107/31586431-88949026-b196-11e7-9343-17971b9fe659.png)  I do not see any lines added to the log when it happens.
Indeed same id as #502. I'm not surprised that more than only I tried. The offer was 'too good to be true', Over a hundred euro under marketprice. It must have been a mistake by the seller. Could it be that you can't see the offer because the seller realised that it was a mistake and he/she **withdrew** it, **yet** it is still visible for (amongst others) me and martysto of #502? While it was actually long gone?  I confirm I lost 3 x 0,001 btc to 1FdFzBazmHQxbUbdCUJwuCtR37DrZrEobu = € 1,67 @ 555. 
Yeap, fine. Changing CPP flag makes some progress and again fails 
I didn't create any new connections so it all affects the old ones. I now reverted to 6.1.4 and the same error persists. It must be something with the new driver that DBeaver 6.1.5 prompted me to update, which I did.
We had the parameters the other way around:   If you fix that it's ok :-)
@bensku both
Hello @ferdicus thanks for your fast reply what do you mean by make sure that the linking was successful? Sorry I m kinda new to this stuff...
There is nothing wrong with these cards, they expose bugs in the game engine. We should fix the game engine, not remove the cards.  An analogy is say if attacking with first strike causes the program to crash, do we remove all cards with the first strike ability or fix the implementation of first strike? Replace "first strike" with "cycling and madness" and that is the situation here. 
Could it be to do with EBS file storage?
Complex type schema:   Nothing specific in build.gradle, I have just included plugin. Also both schemas are in src/main/avro
Hi Harald,  The first three tabs are empty, the latter three aren't. I have sended you the individual searchgui output files, the database and the parameter file (the cpsx was too large for wetransfer).  Thanks for checking it! Tim
NP, the use case is that I want to using two databases and expect the result from these two databases. I try to using these two way: 1.    But they can't give the right expect result as AfterInsertDataSource1.xml's expect data doesn't work.  Could you help to make a demo like above? I think you will get the same result as mine, thanks. 
Yes that was what I did. Otherwise it is not possible to start the plugin inside of Intellij. The same SDK works fine if I create a simple Intellij Plugin (without anything) so I think it is configured correctly. 
Think like the cave spider, but a bit more potent. It attacks anything that attacks it, and inflicts poison.

It looks like the blocker was merged - does that mean the fix for this is in? 
Its on the latest version of ATM 3 Remix running version 4.2.3 of Electroblob's. Tried it on multiple worlds and still get the same result.
The triggered abilities belonged to Fleeting Memories and Graf Mole, the clues were produced by Drownyard Explorers, I believe. 
Yes, I'll set it up.

I am on OS X El Capitan 10.11.5. I just found out that this only occurs when I have multiple images in one row. I read 4 images from disk and then use a "Transpose" node. Before the transpose, absolute values can be set, after it not. 
A save and cancel button would be nice, and it would be more obvious I think.  At first I thought it was focus issue, since the popup seemed to lose focus when I alt-tabed, and the popup has no window controls when you right-click on it.  This is on Fedora 20 with KDE, btw.

Here a list of all AE2 and Computercraft related mods: http://pastebin.com/S2gDvLwZ  I have to add that this issue isn't new to me. I have this issue since I started using Peripheral++ (Means not inevitably that it is the cause) 
I just exported the settings, enabled NAT traversal, confirmed "restart now" and exported again.  The second export has no `<device>` entry inside the `<folder>`s, other than the Pixel itself.  I re-imported the first export and the folders were (of cause) shared again. I then enabled NAT, chose "later" and restarted with the notification. This time, the folders were still shared. 
Hi @manoelcampos, You are right. By decreasing the length of the cloudlet or increasing the scheduling interval the problem disappears. I have been using the scheduling interval of 300 seconds in order to match Planet Lab utilization traces, but I guess my cloudlet's length was way too large.  I will probably change the UtilizationModelPlanetLab to get a random trace from the resources folder whenever this exception is raised.  Thank you!

Hi,  Thanks for investigating this issue. I tried it using EA last week, and today I tried CE 4.0.6 and the issue was the same.  The stacktrace hasn't changed. I also noticed that on loading DBeaver I get the following error: `Unable to retrieve the bundle from the URI: bundleclass://org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.application.addons.ModelCleanupAddon`  This occurs on all installations where I run the error (EA 4.0.5, CE 4.0.5, CE 4.0.6). However, I am running EE 3.8.5 and there is no such error, and I can also export to CSV just fine.  Thanks a lot.
Yeah, [this line](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/storage/DBReader.java#L1066) should be `return lhs.getTitle().toLowerCase().compareTo(rhs.getTitle().toLowerCase());`  I didn't take into account multiple languages, it's not really a major thing anyway. 
thanks for the help :D
Works perfectly! Thank you!
Seems to be working now... maybe some caching issue? We'll see...

@sladomic I suspect this is because I have not yet copied `vgg_faces.pb` to the SD card.  Can you modify the code to show a descriptive message when the file is missing, and instructions on how to add it? To help future developers experiencing the same.

- Yes, it was a clean install. - LineageOS: lineage-14.1-20171109-nightly - I tried two things: Clean install and a Titanium backup. Both failed to import or to restore the entries. - To my knowledge, I set the correct password, yes.  However! I did a complete reinstall of the app again in the mean time and manually purged the andOTP folder. This time, it seems like the import worked.

To clarify. The quaternion `q` I get above is: `(0.5207592020221827, -0.8259585968557868, 0.0, 0.21587554236)`. Also the `vExpected` I get above is: `(-0.22483835035103564, -0.4576197070184389, -0.8602510796039625)`.  I should not have called it `vExpected`, but `vResulted`. The expected value is actually `v`. Also there is a typo in the type of `vExpected` above, it's actually `Vector3` instead of `Vector`.
@cescoffier yes this solution would be great and working perfectly for me. 
9.6.1.0 This is the latest version on the site right? 
Yeah, that does work - but this way I can't set my custom quit message and it just quits without any message. 
@yegor256 I think there's some kind of intermittency or environmental factors that cause it to fail sometimes  I uploaded the jacoco.zip report after having the coverage check fail when solving some conflicts due to updated `master`. Still, I pushed solved conflicts and saw that Travis build did not fail. Weird.  Closing this, will open new issue in case it happens again
Changing the Toolbox to not extend TLC causes it to marker a symmetric set of model values as broken. This is because it requires the "Permutations(S)" operator from the TLC standard module. A fix is to insert a local definition of "Permutations(S)" into the MC.tla file generated by the Toolbox similar to what is done in commit 640df81 and 5249fa5. 
I observe the same behaviour with Mongo 3.0.7.

I had a bunch of laser fluid relays feeding water to some IC2 ore washing machines and a canning machine along with biomass to a bunch of fermenters, it worked fine at first but then started crashing whenever the chunk was loaded, I removed them with worldedit and it stopped, I've not had any problem since switching to using xnet, might have something to do with the different fluids being used in the same network but I'm not sure how AA deals with that.

I'm much more familiar with bukkit than forge so forgive me if I sound like a raving lunatic.  The event in question is the PlayerInteractEvent ...which occurs when a person right clicks on a gui capable block  http://jd.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/event/entity/player/PlayerInteractEvent.html  within that is an isCanceled() method.  To properly support this, I believe you need to add an if statement to you gui opening code to check for this isCanceled() method to be true.  If it is then skip openning the gui.  Does that make some sense to you or am I on crack?

Thanks for this @thomaswue, I'll give this a try next week and maybe have a crack at a smaller test case
Yea. But i have stacktrace only:   
@vahdat-ab Here's a screenshot showing which tests failed. I haven't looked into all of them, but I think they're due to empty files.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8980400/22496678/a377db92-e800-11e6-95f0-1197652ab6cf.png)  I started looking into the JavaInheritenceTemplate test cases. It doesn't look like the interface methods are showing up in the classes that implement them (I tried adding a class that extends ISecondChild and didn't see any methods in class body). It also looks like at least one of the interfaces in the .ump file associated with that test contain attributes, which I believe is invalid syntax.

I am installing the eclipse che chart given ingress enabled to true, thus both keycloak and che supposed to accessed from DNS of edge node.  For keycloak it should be keycloak-default.bcmtdeb.dyn.nesc.net/auth  for che it should be che-default.bcmtdeb.dyn.nesc.net  If the redirect response  results in this unexpected character <, what I am suppose to change? I am still confused about this. Could you explain a little bit more?  Thanks
Depends... Lets say, I would have full artistic freedom. I would then catch this by testing with Mockito that certain dependency injection methods  created by us are called inside a function "injectSimulationEnvironment" into factory classes and to make this simpler, I would create a generic factory creation interface that is used for injecting the environment into the factories we need and implement a registerFactory method (add factory to a list of managed factories) and implement the actual injection as working on a list of factories (so we can define new factories without needing more than copy and paste in one function of simulation).  The first JUnit test would then be as simple as creating a simple factory mock object with [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito), register it at Simulation, call the "injectSimulationEnvironment" method in Simulation, expecting that "defineSimulationEnviroment" in the factory mock object gets called once.   Next, I would repeat the test with three factory mocks to make sure it also works with more than one...   Finally, I would add contract testing to the JUnit tests of all factory implementations: injecting null objects should result in IllegalArgumentExceptions, etc.  Again... with full artistic freedom and a lot of personal taste. For example, its easier for me to spot errors in the creation of factory objects, the function creating them is just made of similar looking likes with helpful indentation, for example:   For the actual objects, we can't use mocks - but we could then create an abstract upper class for them and test it with a dummy implementation. For example: AbstractBuildingFunction and "DummyBuildingFunction" and then test AbstractBuildingFunction that it has proper error handling should null values get injected.   There are also assertions around, but those are rarely active when you need them. But they are helpful in unit testing as well, so its good to combine both approaches. 
Hi Eugen,  I've just updated all building, platform and emulator tools, and have done a clean rebuild of the 2.1.1 sample. And also I've downloaded the latest versions of emulators API 23, 25, and 27.  I can confirm that everything works excellently on emulators API 23 and API 27. Both enter and exit transitions work smoothly.  But on my device with Android 7.0 and on the emulator API 25 (7.1.1 x86 with Google APIs) the exit transition doesn't work.  Here are recordings from my device (a zip-file with a video inside) and from the emulator. I've increased the duration of animations 10x in the developer settings.  Device (API 24):  [Android_7.0_Huawei_Honor_8.zip](https://github.com/consp1racy/android-support-preference/files/1819490/Android_7.0_Huawei_Honor_8.zip)  Emulator (API 25):  ![7 1 1_x86_google_apis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10563821/37525491-aefe3a98-2935-11e8-9119-258e415e5ee2.gif)

Yes, you can still wear it. The model is fine, but it has the purple/black texture. Not sure which log is the one that you need, so I'll attach both.

I reinstall the plugin, and it worked fine! I'm not sure what is going wrong. Thanks for your support!

@raphw I'm not sure what do you mean by "outside of an IDE" as I don't know how to debug outside an IDE. What I can prove is that:  1. It works quite well in Running mode inside an IDE 2. I think there is another agent indeed, because you should add a VM option "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005" to the remote application if you want to do a remote debug. but I'm not sure what this agentlib actually do. I would dig it deeper about "jdwp" later, thanks  
Do you think that an `naturalComparatorIfPossible` comparator would be possible?    The check to verify the type of element would occur only once, and wouldn't require a catch to `ClassCastException`, and this would just add an additional boolean evaluation and a method call. If you're worried about performance then you could maybe remove the method call and put everything in the `compare()` method. Also that comparator should be thread-safe event if mutable as the only state shared is the boolean, and even if it's overridden, it shouldn't be an issue. That comparator can't be shared across many trees as the `useNatural` is specific to a tree.  Do you think this could work? 
I'm looking at andlytics/src/com/github/andlyticsproject/console/v2/AccountManagerAuthenticator.java which seems to use the Ubertoken method described in  http://nelenkov.blogspot.se/2012/11/sso-using-account-manager.html (excellent blog post btw). That blogpost mentions under 1. in "Logging in using AccountManager" that the first step is to get a ClientLogin token.  If it's not a ClientLogin token, what token is it used to pass to IssueAuthToken? 
The issue I'm seeing is that valid sessions are getting erroneously invalidated.  `currentSession` can be `null` if `Request.getSession()` was never called by application code during the lifetime of the request (which is a perfectly valid scenario).  In this case, `isRequestedSessionIdValid()` still returns true because the sessionId is still valid.  However, this triggers Spring session to invalidate the session, thereby removing the cookie.  Why would we want to invalidate the client session if the sessionId _is_ valid? 
Didn't updated ChickenCore, thanks for the pic.  
Hi, neither worked, but I follow them and found that when the F.class static initializer runs, when it gets to  ComputerThreads.NO_THREADS = Config.JAS_NO_THREADS;  this causes an exception and aborts the try, including the runnable that would do the F.COUNT_DOWN_LATCH.countDown(); - so you are right, it is not called when F.class is initialized.  Note that the app does not freeze at this point; there's only a logcat output from the catch. The app will only freezes when evaluate() is called with an operation later on.  The logcat shows:  07-14 03:02:29.792 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError 07-14 03:02:29.793 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.matheclipse.core.expression.F.<clinit>(F.java:3312)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine.<init>(EvalEngine.java:192)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine.<init>(EvalEngine.java:308)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine$1.initialValue(EvalEngine.java:72) 07-14 03:02:29.794 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine$1.initialValue(EvalEngine.java:64)         at java.lang.ThreadLocal.setInitialValue(ThreadLocal.java:180)         at java.lang.ThreadLocal.get(ThreadLocal.java:170)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine.get(EvalEngine.java:82)         at br.eng.it.jsvcalc.StackItem.<clinit>(StackItem.java:24) 07-14 03:02:29.795 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at br.eng.it.jsvcalc.StackItem.setPrefs(StackItem.java:219)         at br.eng.it.jsvcalc.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:124)         at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:6984)         at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1235) 07-14 03:02:29.796 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2783)         at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2909)         at android.app.ActivityThread.-wrap11(Unknown Source:0)         at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1606)         at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:105)         at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:164) 07-14 03:02:29.797 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6592)         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)         at com.android.internal.os.Zygote$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(Zygote.java:240)         at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:769) 07-14 03:02:29.799 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err: Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to get length of null array         at org.apache.logging.log4j.util.ReflectionUtil$PrivateSecurityManager.getCallerClass(ReflectionUtil.java:308)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.util.ReflectionUtil.getCallerClass(ReflectionUtil.java:218) 07-14 03:02:29.800 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.apache.logging.log4j.util.ReflectionUtil.getCallerClass(ReflectionUtil.java:197)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ClassLoaderContextSelector.getContext(ClassLoaderContextSelector.java:72)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ClassLoaderContextSelector.getContext(ClassLoaderContextSelector.java:57)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.Log4jContextFactory.getContext(Log4jContextFactory.java:140)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.Log4jContextFactory.getContext(Log4jContextFactory.java:41) 07-14 03:02:29.801 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getContext(LogManager.java:267)         at org.apache.log4j.Logger$PrivateManager.getContext(Logger.java:59)         at org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger(Logger.java:41)         at edu.jas.kern.ComputerThreads.<clinit>(ComputerThreads.java:30)   With the older version that works, this exception does not occur.  
Basically anything will cause this to happen. I have been trying to figure out what is happening, what is going wrong but I'm not sure. When I uninstall/disable the plugin the issue goes away. Also when this does happen (which is often) it will keep happening until you stop mining/breaking the block, once you stop it stops and goes away.
@vsch, thank you looking into it. I believe making 'disable GIF' option working for Swing would do. If it were possible to implement some behaviour based on file size, that would be great. E.g. if image size is bigger than X Kb then display a stub saying 'the image is too big' or an initial frame from `.gif` just like default JetBrains markdown support plugin does.
If I'm sorry, I've been busy, I close this.  The only thing I would like you to look at is the EssentialsX option, "allow-direct-hat", which defaults to true, which allows you to make this bug in survival mode, even if you only have to set it to false.

@jasontedor all clear, i read your first statement as the logic is the one that we found to be accurate for most cases, but i think that what you meant is that we need to find a better logic for this, which we don't know what is the best.
I can, but is that the right link there? Couldn't find anything other than a tmpworld.
Okay, I dug further into this and it's definitely a mod interaction bug.  Specifically, EnderIO dark armor is using the gadgets in inventory as a battery.  Same symptom - the gadget drains while walking around (assuming you're wearing the armor) - but totally different cause.    I believe you can prevent this by making [`IEnergyStorage.extractEnergy()`](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/6a11e1d0f7f6c47dcd49c2f2e958bfa6aa43dd30/src/main/java/com/direwolf20/buildinggadgets/common/items/capability/ItemEnergyForge.java#L31) always return 0.  Sorry for the confusion.  That's what I get for investigating player issues at 2:30am.
Sample test project: [gh846.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/files/1691783/gh846.zip)  Attached is a sample Initialzr project with a simple test case illustrating the issue. A simple `mvn test` is enough.  The test case contains a bean with a `@Autowired` RestTemplate. It compares the number of interceptor registered in the RestTemplate at `@PostConstruct` and after the app is fully initialized. It fails if the two counts are not the same - which illustrates the issue described in this case.
Maybe. The code that deals with populating the `GATEWAY_HOME/temp` with the bridge is in CE.  I would think that the same bridge would work for both 4.x and 5.x clients. If that is the case, then there wouldn't be any need for separate bridges for CE and EE. 
Hi, it works fine :) many thanks for the quick response.  Shay
>  So it seems you are suggesting that the responsibility of verifying how many replicas a write was acknowledged by, will be borne by the requestor?   The PR I mentioned is just a first step to bring more transparency into the process, by no means the goal.   > From the primary selection logic I can't spot anywhere where it's trying to pick the most "recent" replica of the candidates. Does ES currently exercise any such preference?  "recent" is very tricky when you index concurrently different documents of different sizes on different nodes. Depending on how things run, there is no notion of a clear "recent" shard as each replica may be behind on different documents, all in flight. I currently have some thoughts on how to approach this better but it's early stages. One of the options is take make a intermediate step which will indeed involve some heuristic around "recency". 
Sorry, I wanted to put "CHE_CONTAINER", which is the name of the docker container. On the command "docker network ls" the output is as follows: ![seleccion_209](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10332003/31861792-fe711a6e-b72a-11e7-883a-5de9094c9695.png) When I run a single user server everything works fine.

@rpappalax It's more related to the Android version of the device rather than the actual device, as I've mentioned, Android 8 and Android 9 devices do not seem to be affected by this issue, only managed to reproduce it on devices with Android version < 8.
That is actually hard to say, because it happens with so many items. One example would be an upgraded armor set. You craft the first set like any other Vanilla armor. For the second you have to put any part of the first set in the middle and an upgrade material above. The upgrade material is crafted with 9x the item, that is used for the 1st tier armor. EVERY item needed in this process is a RPGItem that is given by playerkills or by commandblock over time.  The weird thing is, that the 1st tier armor could be crafted without problems, but NONE of the 2nd tier armor worked. Sometimes even the 1st tier armor is bugging.
It seems to (a call to a synchronized method do not enter in the method)
I can't seem to replicate it again. It happened about 3 times so far on accident, but when I go and try to do it the way I did it before, it just works normally with me throwing the sticks or items on the floor. I don't have a crash log that I can find. I checked logs and couldn't find anything about it. Maybe I did something before dragging sticks and clicking the buttons that it didn't like, but trying to replicate it not working...

@bkerensa titles help look at the tips at a glance. Also, say we have some tips which are too long, the description can be cut off and user will need to go to full view to read it (I'll mock it up).  Also, aesthetically, plain paragraphs of text don't look very pleasing without any headings and not glancable.  I had this in mind - title -> do something - summary -> why to do it and how - action -> click to do it 
Hi @benas,  Just tested and looks like it's working now.   Thanks for making this project - its been very useful to me.  Peter

how do i go about getting the logs? I tried the same area with all my plugins disabled as well.
@jerrypeng okay, all my bad it works. It was about not specify `--parallelism` during `update` doesn't change it to default value which is normal.

I have three hard drive (C, D and E), and I have some tests, Here is the results.  - when zap.bat located at drive C, %HOMEPATH% can find .ZAP_JVM.properties - when zap.bat located at another drive except drive C like drive D, %HOMEPATH% can't find .ZAP_JVM.properties    I think maybe windows can automatically add current drive when use %HOMEPATH%. So when we use start zap in drive C, everything is fine. When we start in another drive, %HOMEPATH% is not we want.
As a test I changed to the default cookie spec providers and had no substantive change in my one test case. Changing the version solved my issue. I don't know what the more wideranging side effects of changing that will be. I think a check to see if a cookie value contains whitespace and then setting it to version 1 might help some future compatibility issues.  On Mar 22, 2017 11:17 PM, "D. Hollingsworth" <notifications@github.com> wrote:  Does this need to be hardcoded? Can the CookieSpec implementations not figure out when cookies need to be sent as Version 0 or Version 1?  Not sure on this. We do set the HttpComponents cookie handling policy to a custom one defined in the project by the class LaxCookieSpecProvider. I figured that was mostly responsible for how cookies are parsed but it might also be affecting how cookies get sent too. Apache does allow for cookies to be explicitly set too rather than rely on these manager/spec classes.  — You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

Thanks for looking into this! We are not directly using Spring Security. See our Gradle files [here](https://github.com/yonadev/yona-server/blob/master/build.gradle) and [here](https://github.com/yonadev/yona-server/blob/master/adminservice/build.gradle). 
I'll see what I can do :)
in my case, I am talking about the NC cache folder, but the procedure is the following: I have a file which is **not available offline**, click on the file in the NC-App, it is beeing downloaded, in the action menu, I press on "Open with" and select an Editor (e.g. DroidEdit). The editor openes, I change something, save it and return to the NC-App, but nothing happenes.   Same issue with a PDF-Document.  So we are not talking about the phone's download folder of course, just the NC-Caching folder!
Done - https://github.com/MovingBlocks/CrashReporter  @msteiger you should have admin rights on it :-)  I can make a Gradle build for it in Jenkins later tonight, as well as test that tweak, need to get to work shortly first 
@maxanier 1.8.0-221 64bit Java is installed and so far it's not been corrupted since every other mod seems to work just fine and minecraft starts up as well. A datapack is a "mod" within a minecraft that will allow you to get items that you wouldn't normally get from mobs or items you get from mobs that rarely drop do more often, if I'm correct and I'm usually not...The only mod I can think of is [All loot](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/all-loot) mod. Funny I don't know what a jdk.nashorn.internal.runtime.ECMAexception is, I've seen it though.  I'll go through my mods again and see what happens when I figure out which one doesn't get along with vampirism. I'll let you know when I find out  @ProsperCraft I gave it 6gigs since anymore than that will be unnecessary at least for my current system. I doubt this mod would go above that 6g limit since I normally have around 130 mods (including some game, and lighting optimizers seeing as Minecraft 1.14.4 isn't the best in terms of optimization nor are some of the mods for it.) Right now I only have 94 mods. I don't feel the need to go overboard. Thanks anyways though. It's possible the arguments could've been cut off after a certain point. Wouldn't know why unless gist has a hard-coded byte limit.  **Edit:** @maxanier It's not All Loot as I tested it with Vampirism and it worked just fine. I'll keep looking though.  **Re-Edit:** I found the mod that's causing all the issues and it's Underground Biomes. I'll make sure to give that FML log to the right person this time. Although all mods seem to cooperate now. x_x I don't get this at all.  **Re-Edit Again:** And now there is an error again.  I may have a solution to the problem and it involves a mod I found on curseforge called Nashorn and it deals with EMCA Scripts, however, why a mod requires it or even makes mention of it is beyond me since the mod in question is for 1.12.x not 1.14.x. @Aang23
I feel so dumb now, apparently it requires you to use conduits, I was using the power pipes from TE. My bad, sorry! 
Codenvy only 
I was looking into and can propose two solution (if you like any of them please let me know I will write the code, unit tests and create pull request).  The fix could be implemented in **org.mockito.internal.creation.cglibClassImposterizer** class.  - My first suggestion is to try again class creation in catch block using different class loader.   When creation of requested class fails, code could try again using class loader of the requested type. So something like:    I investigated other possibility (SearchingClassLoader), but unfortunately I don't see solution using it. The problem is creation of SearchingClassLoader already causes the access issues and defineClass is final in Java... If it wouldn't we could pass the call to parent and everything would be working.  To be fair I think the proper solution should be implemented in cglib library - they should not use reflection to hack the defineClass in my opinion they should ask for class creation interface, where we could simply proxy our call to different class loaders (defineClass is protected)... But I guess noone expended those can of issues at the point of library creation :(   What do you think about it? Is any of my solution viable? Or would you like me to try something else?  
@jpricketMSFT there are no any exceptions. Also, there are about 85 000 files.  
> In 1.1.0 textinput layouts crash if your app theme does not inherit from a Material theme. Can that be the case?  I dont know how to check that! im new at all this 
As we're talking about e. g. "visited waypoints" the caches *have* to be saved offline, right? ;)
Yes, switching to async would certainly solve the issue. Though that would require some kind of persistence to avoid dropping messages when the application shuts down? Which effectively duplicates DirectoryResender?  I am not sure if this issue is really relevant for most users; the core problem is "sync" resending, which might be an edge case.  The way we are currently using the lib requires sync (re-)sending; so for the moment we are going forward with the modified MessageProcessor.  So maybe you don't need to "fix" anything; possibly document the problem w.r.t. ImmediateResender (or even deprecate it). I mainly wanted some feedback, feel free to close as wontfix :-) 
The best way to explain the issue is to use a unit test (you need to modify the unit test the way you can grab mongo and datastore instances):  public class MongoDbContainerTest ...    }  Here's the output:  IndexOptionColl index after drop [] DepIndexColl index after drop [] IndexOptionColl index after ensure [{ "v" : 1 , "key" : { "_id" : 1} , "name" : "_id_" , "ns" : "ut_base.TestWithIndexOption"}, { "v" : 1 , "key" : { "name" : 1} , "name" : "name_1" , "ns" : "ut_base.TestWithIndexOption"}] Jul 06, 2015 12:34:03 PM org.mongodb.morphia.DatastoreImpl processClassAnnotations WARNING: This index on 'estalea.base.setup.springframework.mongo.MongoDbContainerTest$TestWithDeprecatedIndex' is using deprecated configuration options.

Thanks for the comments. The liblockdev1 library does fix the problem on the RPi3 but not the RPi2 on Wheezy.  The answer came from cvanorman : "The current build of nrjavaserial requires glibc >= 2.15. Debian Wheezy has glibc 2.13 and so it will crash on that platform". As a result I moved on to Jessie and my problem ended.
You're welcome :)  I forgot to mention the scenario why this is important: If you want to use bootsfaces on a page that's unauthenticated (like a login page), an attacker can run your server out of resources easy[ier] by creating millions of sessions. It's best to not let a public facing page modify the state of the server.  I'll get a reproducer to you tomorrow or wed, it's pretty easy to reproduce. Cheers, -Jonathan

@justacodefan  I would be able, but I do not have the necessary time right now, we are having an upcoming deadline for the project containing this issue and we still have a lot of other tasks to complete. The basic steps would be: 1.Create a project in android studio: “AndroidProject” 2.Create 2 flavor dimensions: “dimension1”, “dimension2” 3.Create 3 flavors: “flavor1” and set “dimension1” for it 		 “flavor2” and set “dimension1” for it 		 “flavor3” and set “dimension2” for it 4.Create 2 sentry projects: “SentryProject1” and “SentryProject2” 5.Set “SentryProject1” data in sentry.properties in the root folder of “AndroidProject” 6.Set “SentryProject2” data in sentry.properties in the source folder for one flavor/combination of flavors, ex: “..AndroidProject/app/src/flavor3” 7.Set build variant to something including flavor3(all of them should since we got only one flavor with “dimension2”), release variant. 8.Set autoupload for proguard mapping. 9.Compile 10.Notice that the mapping goes to “SentryProject1” instead of “SentryProject2”  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.  
#3029 is now in master.
One is `R` and the others is `Ctrl+R` so we should be able to have both. 
Hi, The right place is in the Entry Editor. I saw that there is already a paste handler for the the URL field in the fieldseditors class.   I think it should be sufficient to create a copy of the  RemoveNewlinesFormatter which only removes newlines before the first opening brace and the last closing brace and then add this as paste handler to the code area

i just replicated the bug as described. and yes, it involved the return button the first time it happened. 
This is the same behavior I was experiencing, though I didn't try with plain redstone. It also doesn't seem to matter what kind of light is used, or from what mod.

@rentalhost that's because `isset(null) === false`, but `array_key_exists` returns `true` for such array values.

Hi Marcel,  Thanks for your prompt response.  Thought I attached logcat to github but it’s attached again to this email.  Clearing XPrivacy data has restored Wi-Fi connectivity. Never thought to do that as previous upgrades didn’t require it. Now have to re-enter permissions authority on each of 214 apps but well worth the time and effort.  Do I need to run XPrivacy free and XPrivacy Enabler concurrently or should I just run free or Enabler with the Pro license?  Thanks again for your assistance.

Some more observations.  Platform.nextObjectId() is being generated as async, even though its content is just:    The AsyncMethodFinder it adding it because it claims it makes a call to String.<init>(char[]), which it also considers to be async.   Perhaps I don't understand exactly how the async generation is supposed to work. It seems as though nearly everything is generated async even if the method clearly is sync (e.g. only returns a value).  Is this how it is supposed to work? 
Yes it does. I am using version 2.5.2 now. But I think I have found a way to reproduce it.. It does not always work but (since I am using a Launchpad plugin), often when activating the Bat Blaster at the moment JUST BEFORE stepping up the Launchpad and flying away from the Launchpad, I get the error:  `23.08 00:34:35 [Server] Server thread/ERROR Could not pass event PlayerInteractEvent to UltraCosmetics v2.5.2 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO org.bukkit.event.EventException: null 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPluginLoader$1.execute(JavaPluginLoader.java:320) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.plugin.RegisteredListener.callEvent(RegisteredListener.java:70) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.fireEvent(SimplePluginManager.java:529) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.callEvent(SimplePluginManager.java:514) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_14_R1.event.CraftEventFactory.callPlayerInteractEvent(CraftEventFactory.java:429) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_14_R1.event.CraftEventFactory.callPlayerInteractEvent(CraftEventFactory.java:396) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.PlayerInteractManager.a(PlayerInteractManager.java:136) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.PlayerConnection.a(PlayerConnection.java:1185) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.PacketPlayInBlockDig.a(SourceFile:40) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.PacketPlayInBlockDig.a(SourceFile:10) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.PlayerConnectionUtils.lambda$0(PlayerConnectionUtils.java:19) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.TickTask.run(SourceFile:18) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.IAsyncTaskHandler.executeTask(SourceFile:144) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.IAsyncTaskHandlerReentrant.executeTask(SourceFile:23) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.IAsyncTaskHandler.executeNext(SourceFile:118) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.MinecraftServer.aX(MinecraftServer.java:909) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.MinecraftServer.executeNext(MinecraftServer.java:902) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.IAsyncTaskHandler.awaitTasks(SourceFile:127) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.MinecraftServer.sleepForTick(MinecraftServer.java:886) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at net.minecraft.server.v1_14_R1.MinecraftServer.run(MinecraftServer.java:819) [spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) [?:1.8.0_152] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at be.isach.ultracosmetics.cosmetics.Cosmetic.getOwnerUniqueId(Cosmetic.java:126) ~[?:?] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at be.isach.ultracosmetics.cosmetics.gadgets.Gadget.onPlayerInteract(Gadget.java:361) ~[?:?] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor387.invoke(Unknown Source) ~[?:?] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) ~[?:1.8.0_152] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source) ~[?:1.8.0_152] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPluginLoader$1.execute(JavaPluginLoader.java:316) ~[spigot-1.14.4.jar:git-Spigot-798ea6a-368f4e9] 23.08 00:34:35 [Server] INFO ... 20 more 23.08 00:35:39 [Server] Craft Scheduler Thread -

you are correct. this was an issue with the font rendering, and not GestureFrameLayout's issue (btw, I set the max zoom to 40, and it does affect all fonts).  Specifically, the problem results from a bug in the hardware acceleration, resulting in a "Font size too large to fit in cache" error.  I resolved the issue by adding android:layerType="software" in my xml.      <com.alexvasilkov.gestures.views.GestureFrameLayout         android:id="@+id/ll_gesture"         android:layout_width="0dp"         android:layout_height="0dp"         android:layout_gravity="center"         android:gravity="center"         app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"         app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"         app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"         app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@+id/font_name">          <TextView             android:id="@+id/tv_text"             android:layout_width="wrap_content"             android:layout_height="wrap_content"             android:textColor="@color/black"             android:layerType="software"             android:textSize="40sp" />      </com.alexvasilkov.gestures.views.GestureFrameLayout>

I am currently running in Eclipse, but I believe this issue would happen in any OSGi container.  If I do something as simple as    This is because Flyway is expecting "org/flywaydb/core/internal/version.txt" to exist within the custom ClassLoader.  If I instead have Flyway use its own ClassLoader, then of course Flyway can find "org/flywaydb/core/internal/version.txt" within the Flyway JAR, but it will never find my SQL scripts in a different bundle. 
For me it would be a menu entry on the main screen: "report problem", with a popup then asking "Do you want to send the logs as well? [Yes/No/Cancel](with the default being yes)".  I would not like an additional setting. It is not a big deal if we store, say, 500 messages of 40 characters, that would be 20kB of RAM (we would only store the severity and the data, we wouldn't duplicate the tag for example). 
The syntax is actually working for me. I use it in all of my scripts. But yeah you are right. I should not split a list variable as it seems not to be working this way.
I have sent in crash reports when it has allowed me, often kills everything, so no opportunity. I'll see what I can find next time it crashes.

If I understand you correctly, telling AP to only use wifi (disable mobile data connection), but that you don't care for particular ones (no filter), would be rather complicated.  I think there should be a "Use mobile data connection" preferences. The summary tells the user that this allows mobile data to be used when wifi is not enabled and that it cannot be used together with the wifi filter (just to prevent confusion). When activated, this disables the wifi filter (because we cannot restrict android in that, then; android uses whatever connection it wants).

I mainly started thinking about it because I had a lot of cells of data that contained the string "N/A", so I just transformed all of them with `value.replace("N/A", "")`. Now I realize I could have used `null` instead of `""`, but I guess for my end location (any PostgreSQL compatible DB) it won't make much of a difference for the data analysis workloads I'll do.  I also noticed when I delete a column all the cells get set to null when the option to view null is enabled.  I guess I just wondered why there was a distinction, but I guess it makes sense in the context of an SQL DB, or even for example, what value to store for a blank cell in a numeric column.  I think it is the type of small distinction that it is important to mention, even if it is just to say: "it doesn't really matter which one you use," because now I've spent a while thinking: _oh no! which one is better/more idiomatic! etc etc..._  I haven't tried doing the SQL export yet so I haven't hit any problems but I'll keep you updated. Also, I'm glad + excited to hear about new plans for Records Mode!
Do you mean specifying a different port for server explicitly in machine configuration? If yes, then my answer is no. There two reasons why it won't work - when machine configuration has specified server that has the same name as installer's one but with different configuration then an exception will be thrown. See https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/148fe48c1e116301d46cc40204856089cd419329/wsmaster/che-core-api-workspace/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/api/workspace/server/spi/provision/InstallerConfigProvisioner.java#L97-L103 - ports for agents are hardcoded in installers scripts or in packaged agents. See  https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/8ad7973a80eaf1ec9ed2d1f594907a54737d299d/agents/exec/src/main/resources/installers/1.0.0/org.eclipse.che.exec.script.sh#L228 https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/e67979d3379eaa435f7ffb6b5bcc673bd23a60ac/agents/terminal/src/main/resources/installers/1.0.0/org.eclipse.che.terminal.script.sh#L224 https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/b0dfd90f8c10e8561a8b3ff5e1c51b70e14ca015/assembly/assembly-wsagent-server/src/assembly/server.xml#L72

No, there is no box on the right side 
Single player.  There isn't a crash so I'm not sure what part of the logs you want to see. I don't see any mention of mana batteries or prisms or the power cache you mentioned in #741 in there. What are we looking for?  There is a AM2PowerData folder. It has sub-folders for dimension 0, -1, 7, and -31. -1 and 7 are empty, 0 has files for chunks near the origin (though these are all empty) the one for dimension -31 has a single file corresponding with the region where my base is, though my base is in dimension 0.  The one in dimension -31 is 36KB in size, and seems to have references to many, many nodes in it, though there are only a few anywhere in my world (and I don't really know how to parse the file here).

 I ran the template Genes [All] --> GO terms and was trying to filter on the Ontology Term.Name column. 
I checked and there is nothing in the "Regular Expression Pattern Remover" configuration. I also did some further testing.  The script appears to run fine when I send it to the machine.  It is only when I attempt to test the code using the $C option that I get the errors.  Usually it is either error code 20 or error code 1. (see below) The UGS program then hangs up and I have to disconnect and reconnect to the router to get the UGS program to respond again. The problem does not always occur at the same place in the code, and (rarely, perhaps once or twice) the script has completed successfully in test mode.    Example: (error:20) Unsupported or invalid g-code command found in block. **** Pausing file transfer. ****  (error:20) Unsupported or invalid g-code command found in block. (error:1) G-code words consist of a letter and a value. Letter was not found. **** Pausing file transfer. ****  (error:1) G-code words consist of a letter and a value. Letter was not found. ok

`docdir`. (As `document.attributes.docdir` is empty).  I needed that to work out a default images directory in case `imagesdir` was not set or was relative. (Code I roughly translated form Ruby in the way the epub3 converter works out the location of the frontcover image).

Hey - thanks for taking a look - the software looks really good - and works fine for a local backup. One thing that might be unique about my setup is that I am using a usb drive plugged into a tp-link router that has ftp enabled. I've been able to use duplicity/deja dup on it though with no errors connecting the the ftp drive though. Connecting from cmd line or filezilla also work fine.   When I log into the ftp manually I see it this way: ftp> pwd 257 "/driveloco/test" ftp>   If I log in using filezilla the ftp path appears the same:  Command:    PWD Response:   257 "/driveloco/test"  I've just tried to set up the backup using the following settings: matt@rse ~/tmp/syncanyremote $ sy init --debug debug Application version: 0.3.0-alpha 27-12-14 17:14:48.389 | CommandLineClie | main           | INFO : Application version: 0.3.0-alpha 27-12-14 17:14:48.860 | Plugins         | main           | INFO : - org.syncany.plugins.ftp.FtpTransferPlugin 27-12-14 17:14:48.863 | Plugins         | main           | INFO : - org.syncany.plugins.gui.GuiPlugin 27-12-14 17:14:48.865 | Plugins         | main           | INFO : - org.syncany.plugins.local.LocalTransferPlugin Choose a storage plugin.

I haven't tried mounting the ftp location as a drive, if you think that's worth trying I can test it later tonight.   I know little about java so was really hoping the error message would be more helpful. 
I use the last one, but any of them still causes the same problem.
Thanks for the quick answer! The fact that you haven't heard this from anyone else certainly points towards an issue in our application.  We are using a custom `DrmSessionManager`. In our application, rapid zapping between different streams (most of them DRM protected with the same init data) is crucial. Therefore, we have implemented a `DrmSessionManager` which uses a `DefaultDrmSessionManager` as delegate. When a DRM session with a specific UUID is aquired for the first time, our `DrmSessionManager` acquires an additional DRM session (using the respective method in DefaultDrmSessionManager). Additionally, we have a method to release all of these artificial DRM sessions which is called in our Activity's `onPause()`. Hence, the stream switching is a lot faster since the key request is made only for the start of the first stream because the artificial DRM session is kept open throughout the lifecycle of the app. I'm aware that this is somewhat experimental, but with most devices (except the ones mentioned above), everything works fine.  Apart from that, we recently also implemented the dummy surface workaround discussed in https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3835#issuecomment-390646933. However, we saw the crashes before implementing this workaround, so the issue should not be related to those changes.
Thanks for investigating this!  In general, we have a `package-info.java` with annotations, but not in the default package where I put the test class.  I have uploaded my `.class` file here: [Issue616.zip](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/files/1965950/Issue616.zip) Can you reproduce it with this?  Is the class path relevant for this kind of problem? I have (among others) Guava 23.6-jre, spotbugs-annotations 3.1.1 and jsr305 3.0.2 from com.google.code.findbugs on the auxiliary classpath. 
I know how to reproduce this issue, at least on my device:  1- Reboot phone. 2- Connect Mi Band 2 to GB. 3- Play some song on VLC > instant GB crash. 4- Reopen GB. 5- Play song again > instant crash. 6- Reopen GB, problem gone.  Somehow it only fails two times, then GB no longer crashes. I provide the logcat of doing all steps above. VLC version is 1.9.0, the F-Droid one.

Hey @hideki  When couchbase calls `changeListener.changed(changeEvent)` and within this callback I do some faults (e.g. Nullpointer) the app won't crash because the exception is catched from your catch block and consumed. This could lead to inconsistent app data/behaviour.
Nope, it only happens when a compile error occurs. You also do not see the compile error in the REPL
Yes, the bar near the bottom of the audio player that indicates the current playback position. I am playing downloaded audio files. I haven't checked the streaming case.

Here is the link to apk file and .jar packs with functionality (I was using release apk and module pack for snapchat 10.41.6.0 when the bug occured): https://github.com/jaqxues/SnapTools_DataProvider  And here you can find source code: https://github.com/jaqxues/SnapTools
- The following occurs when I start jmxtrans and delete a config file. This happens when the start command doesn't contain a path to a config file, when it contains a path to a different config file, and when it contains a path to the deleted file. (For the most part, this is probably easily avoidable).   There may be other similar scenarios, this is just what I have run into.
Do you have a test for the above case? If so, please close them both. 
@rwillett My bad again. I've updated the post with the exact version. And I don't know why I can't use res:. I can use it to set the icon but it does not work for the sound.

I also dont see an example in the docs where they show how to use a custom sound kept in the res: of android.

@robinpaulson I can try when I find some time.
I use the following grammar which I modified to compile with C# Target by commenting out some Java methods. https://github.com/exKAZUu/Code2Xml/blob/master/Code2Xml.Languages.ANTLRv4/Processors/Java/Java.g4  BTW, Can I use good .NET methods instead of some java methods such as `Character.isJavaIdentifierStart`?  I wrote the following Java client code.   
The  road is not tagged with "access=private", only the access by vehicles is restricted. The restrictions for pedestrians are either inherited from "access=" or they are explicitly set by "foot=" (and similar the restrictions for horses). 
@PrajwalM2212 this is to reduce the overhead. Home is like main part and wherever you go you return to home.

I'm using spring boot 1.5.6.RELEASE which is using jetty 9.4.6.v20170531  On the test you mentioned, the forwarded url has the same parameter as as the original request but with another value ... not sure why this would be the case, but ok ...  In my case, the forward is not changing any values, I'm simply removing the language part of the url so it can be handled by the controllers as if it wasn't there ... so the parameters are the same and so are their values

Hi @bsideup , Initial Test "passes". But There are several logs like this.   It reproduces all the time on my PC.   But before making it reproducible, I played  around with `sc` properties and delays.   I've updated TC so it will fail test.

It's localhost, have (or have had) several plugins use the mysql database, never had an issue with it being too slow, usually runs pretty smoothly, can change database and player's balances update right away so don't think it's connecting to the database slowly.  But baltop seems to have problems, sometimes I can run it fine, but seems sooner or later it'll have problems connecting. Thought it was just from running baltop as a player with a currency that doesn't exist, but run into the same problem when running the command from console (just /baltop) and tried it in game after, and was able to run /baltop with a non existent currency name (though kept trying and eventually timeout problems)

It's the same issue as jenkinsci/docker-plugin#339 - it looks like swarm gives a different response when pulling images, even on success, which throws the plugin off and gives `Could not pull image: null`. The original plugin had an `Ignore Pull Return (Workaround)` option for this, re-adding that is probably needed since it doesn't look like docker-java fixed the actual problem yet. 
It returns macosx-x86_64.  I also did trace the call, everything looks fine.

Ok, I made a new link : https://pastebin.com/zw4WPaRK
Yes, that's the point.   Many tools including check_jmx4perl (Nagios check using Jolokia) and j4psh (command line shell for Jolokia) use the encoded form for accessing the agent (and in fact plain Jetty works perfectly since it uses `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI#getDecodedPath()` for decoding the pathInfo).  
Isn't it the same contactform from either top or bottom? I have the link 'Contact Us' at the top.  Did not push to github yet. Can do. I have headMenu.jsp, layout.jsp etc.  (its been a while and probably a matter of not configuring properly..) 
@fpj I hit the problem while developing a unit test for the writer.  I don't think the specific error is significant.    Take a look at the referenced code block, observing that the `pendingWritesCount` is not decremented on error, causing a subsequent `flush` to wait forever for `pendingWritesCount` to reach zero.
Yes. I'm just testing it and no combination of buttons (that I've tested: q, x, Esc, Ctr+x, Ctrl+w, Ctrl+q) seem to make it close. Being a "real" modal window, I can't click on anything back in the app.  (I say "real modal", because the welcome window doesn't capture the action, and you can keep clicking back in the app, so that isn't so critical for me)
It's hard to clarify since English is not my primary language... but basically 1/ If a player knows the username of a player that is *rich* or got a lot of stuff 2/ That player still have to know the password to log in and do the bad things 3/ But before (2), they might need to know if that username is worth griefing or not by using this bug a/ If that username is worth griefing, then they will use some password leaking tools and waiting it to be cracked that is downloadable on the internet. b/ If that username is not worth griefing, they may stop do it at first glance in inventory. 4/ If they can't use this bug, they'll need to hack this account first. If it success but that username doesn't have the prize, it'll be their failure, every account in their glance should be hacked again and again. Why I want this bug to be fixed? Hacker is doing bad things, they should work harder to get the prize, or they will not get it. Not just knowing that username had a prize then spend 10 hours of breaking it easily without thousand hours. Of course there's a chance, that player is hidden their treasure before log out, but I want to make it impossible to exploit Or there's a big chance that I'll not use /authme reload anymore, but it's inconvenience that I have will to run it 24/7 *Speaking of the "/authme reload" command, is this bug related to "/reload" command or sort of AutoSaveWorld plugins? So each update might be recommended a full restart. I haven't tested it so I can't tell. If this bug exist it'll even more inconvenience. 
Hello Harald  Sure.  Here are 2 .par files that will not work. Essentially the newly introduced attribute proteinInferencePreferences (see below) never get initialized properly in code because they do not exist in the old .par files. This causes the NULL Pointer Exception.   Please note that this may only be the first attribute that causes a problem, there could be others once this one is fixed.  "proteinInferencePreferences": {     "proteinSequenceDatabase": {       "path": "C:\Work\2\2\ABC.fasta"     }   },  Regards  Tek Wojenski  On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 4:31 PM, Harald Barsnes notifications@github.com wrote:  > Hi Tek, >  > Thanks for telling us about this.

@davidfestal this went from 100% reproducible (over multiple days/weeks!) to 100% non-reproducible :(  With an error like:  > The Ceylon Java backend compilation failed"  it's really hard to know what the precipitating factors are.  I guess we should just fix https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon/issues/6730#issuecomment-261806500 (correct the `target=7` config in ceylon-sdk) and see if people complain?
Greetings @tobiasKaminsky ! Have you tried bigger files? I run into this issue when editing  PDFs. (40-100 MB).  I'm sure it's new to 3.5, because I used to do the same with the same files (I used to use the deprecated __available offline__ feature)  I use XODO to add annotations to PDFs. They get saved, and they used to get uploaded automatically without a glitch.  Now, after upgrading to the 3.5 version, I edit  the files, I sync them by hand, the uploading starts, it gets __to full 100%__, and __then__ it spits out a message "Upload failed".  I have to use  __share__ button from the XODO reader, upload it to Nextcloud (works flawlessly  every time, but it gets uploaded under a modified name),  delete the old file,  and  rename the new file to the old filename.   Did those details help?  I'm  right now  in the middle of exam madness, and I don't have neither logcat nor adb set up. It won't be until the beginning of March when I might be able have a look at it.  I've also tried uploading small text files, and they work well, but the larger PDF do not.  Could you try those? (I can send you one of the files, if you want).   If it helps, server logs might be more accessible for me..
Although it doesn't contain business logic since its a LinkedList, it's restricted by corporate copyrights. So I would send you the instrumented class file via Mail (the one published on GitHub), if that's OK for you. 
I don't have any extra information since I don't use this mod myself or actually play much MC at all atm, I've only seen it several times in nps files sent to me for analysis. The issues mentioned appear to be not just minor oversights but more in depth implementation issues, thus it's unlikely to be fixed. I quickly verified that issue part 1 is still there by looking at the source code.  From experience a good guess for the cause of the redstone conduit problems would be having much less than vanilla's 1 loss/block, which is required to reach a steady state from omnidirectional propagation quickly if the propagation algorithm works similar to vanilla's. Low or no loss requires significant extra care, which is easy to get wrong as soon as there's a connection back to some vanilla redstone for example.  This report may be the first of its kind due to the various issues being very difficult to track down to EnderIO although those performance problems are likely quite widespread. The spike heavy nature of the slowdowns combined with heavy inlining by the JVM makes it practically impossible to see in Opis and difficult to spot in Sampler while sampling normally. The lag spikes can usually be observed with Sampler's spike trigger, assuming there's a problematic setup in the world, which I don't know the conditions for. It may be required to disable the JVM's inlining or even run in interpreter only mode to see more, which of course has significant influence on the unit under test. 
I guess you are launching the executors from the scheduler, right ? Why don't get the hostnames of the slaves from mesos, and resolve the ip ? 
0. Use Java 8 1. Checkout the branch 2. Edit [`src/main/java/test/TestSpringApp.java`](https://github.com/bob04619/sleuth-grpc-framework-testing/blob/kafka-with-grpc-framework/src/main/java/test/TestSpringApp.java) and apply the workaround    * Add `@EnableConfigurationProperties(KafkaProperties.class)` 3. Run the project with `./gradlew clean bootRun -x test`    The tests needs to be skipped if you don't have a running kafka (configured).
@robertotru I tried within my project at first, I got the same NullPointerException on the location of the file. Then I cloned the Thymeleaf example from this project, adjusted the yml(gmail username and pwd) and got the same result. By the way, on line 58 of TestService.java.
Seems to be impersonation issue. I was able to resolve the issue by adding these to my `alluxio.properties`   
Can I email you the project?
Hi, thanks for the quick response! I'm using maven central so I just copy/pasted your changes into one of my classes, and it's working perfectly. 
@swankjesse the full URL is just `https://>`. I have created a quickfix by [SdkEditor](https://github.com/iwhys/sdk-editor-plugin):  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5214214/74396915-60670000-4e4e-11ea-9f30-833789109c5f.png)  It works, and if it is acceptable, I can create a PR for this our Okhttp.
@enriquepiatti You click on this icon, than you will have window "Data Source", wait few seconds and then you use ALT+M and have NullPointerException. See screenshot: ![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1873745/2420497/2a454dfe-ab72-11e3-8fc0-1fd482e03043.png) PS: AssertionException is in PhpStorm Core module, it's not your issue. 
You mean flip arguments to an operator? I tried something like that before, but I always cleared the variable cards when I was done with an experiment.
I tried to reproduce it but it fails every time... it seems like it was a one time thing ... I don't know what was the cause, sorry ... if something happens again then I'll let you know 
Because those are the most recently built versions of both mods... If it still happens in the most recent alphas, then it's also going to happen in the stable version which were built **before** the alphas. 
Have seen it also on 1.0.3 and I am using Grbl 8. 
@violetagg  I cannot use snapshot build.  we are not allowed to use snapshots. More error details below issue https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client/issues/1035  The code is below as mentioned in the document. https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client

Below is an example from a instance run locally. You can see a lot of `<b>` been added to wrap the search term. Logically, the client using the REST API should already know the searched term, so strong them isn't necessary. You can also see `&` been substituted to `&amp;`. 
I have not been able to reproduce this issue since reporting it. At the time of reporting it the bug occurred multiple times each session. I will open another issue if I find a more solid way to reproduce it
Still the same problem on 3.0.9B 
figured out that setting the colors in the activity cause the problem, i set the colors in the xml it works  
Generally I use Kubuntu 17.10 but just try it out with Windows. It works with Win 7. 
I get the opposite result with `WILL_START_LOADING_MAP` where the desired drawable is used for a couple of frames and is then replaced by the default one.
I know....weird...but I just copied your email to draft folder, went back to home screen and turned display off...a few seconds later it was on again. Delete draft and its fine.

I am not sure why, but I have been unable to get any traffic coming from strongbox. Requests and responses from clients to strongboxes are showing up fine, but requests from strongbox to the web are not showing up in my proxy program(fiddler). Maybe does strongbox not respect the system proxy? Or fiddler is not capturing everything for some reason. I am not sure why, but I am working on it.

I am sure it is absolutely specific to 6.0.3. My app "Charging stations" in play store used versions 5.x.x and 6.0.0 to 6.0.2 with this hires tile provider - no "OutOfMemoryError" problems at all have ever been reported by any user. I wanted to upgrade my app to 6.0.3. Found the problem very soon while testing with 6.0.3 - it is easy to reproduce with 6.0.3 and I never managed to reproduce this with 6.0.2. even though trying hard.
I will try to reproduce this on singleplayer and will provide the info asap.
Ha, I figured it was more likely to be a bit random vs having "nested"  in the name! My steps were: - upgrade index from 0.17.9 to 0.18.5 - delete random indexes from previous debug (different names) - run above test ("nested" fails, "test_type" works) - delete indexes - rerun above test, same result  So on a sample of 2, yes! I'll fire up my VM and try a few more samples/deleting ES and rebuilding from scratch. 
uh, actually. its working. I spoke too soon.   been working on this for hours now, updated to 1.7.2 beta (running 1.6.4 resonant rise).   All good, sorry for taking your time 
I just saw that the new version si available on f-droid
> I cannot reproduce on my test device (Pixel 2 XL). >  > What version of ExoPlayer are you using? Is this the demo app without any modification?  I used the latest one in this repository without any modification.  I can't reproduce in samsung S9. But always happened when testing in Xiaomi devices (one of popular mobile brands in asia) Do you think this issuse related to sensor of specific device?
Nope. Simple `<div>hello</div>` yields same result.
@quintinali Branch https://github.com/mudrod/mudrod/tree/mudrod-117 is deployed to UAT where the error is occurring.

Please use nlpCancer in domain repo. I reran using that ontology and the same error was produced in pt02 report.
Immediately after this message appears:   Hope it helps - as far as I can see nothing else is logged after this.
Nice!  I just ran into that scheduling issue last night and hadn't yet diagnosed it, but looking at your commits now realize that you've fixed both of my problems in one swoop!  Thanks for the quick turnaround! 
IHL platinum group wont process, tiny platinum group doesn't work with GT counter parts 
Can't seem to replicate the block changes on the road.   It would replace some of the blocks with water, and also changes the biome on the roads and neighboring plots on ~~the E,S,W sides~~ all sides.  [Debug Information](http://hastebin.com/ifivoqotak)  Edit: Okay, so i got it to replicate. It didn't change any blocks on the road, but it did generate trees in the adjacent plot.  ![Image of bug](http://i.imgur.com/jcHF1XL.jpg) 
No, the problem only occurs with an "upgrade" (backup-domain, restore-domain).
Cave sounds, and no errors 
Yup its fixed thanks!

No it doesn't, at least not at work nor at home. One thing I should mention and I believe this is closely related to the following post: [https://github.com/nextcloud/android/issues/1653](url) One thing was an issue with the certificate. At some point in time, I couldn't even browse the content of my account within the app, eventhough I had files which were already "synchronized" (downloaded). The account I was using was recently created for the purpose of this trip and only a handful of files were present, so no issue with memory limitation in any way. However, all I was getting from this account was absence of every folders and documents (5 folders or so and about 10 files, including default Nextcloud default pictures and documents). I should also mention I had automatic upload enabled and I did take a picture at some point, but I believe it was already late in the day and battery was already around 15% and dropping.  On my day to day live, my phone will normally drop around 3-7% overnight when phone is left alone. I constantly use GPSLogger and the lack of GPS coverage shoulnd't really affect the performance, but moving around could have an effect as it accounts for Gyro and acceleration interrupts.  At the end, I still suspect this is something related to certificate request and managing local and remote files. As mentioned earlier, I am using "Nextcloud SMS" and I did find peculiar the number of failed events related to SMS synchronization but then again I have it set to 15 minutes, so maybe it is just fine. It would just try to update when I start using my phone (accessing the lock screen).  This is a lot of unknown and possible feature interaction that are causing such issues. Tough one to evaluate and debug. 
you're right, closing
This one is fixed now (#538).
I am seeing this in AcmeAir, client and server on the same machine. It happens quite often. Another example

Yes, it partiality sync as you said.  I made tag on Y9 2019 and it appeared on Mate 20X. The "recently viewed" with tag is same on both phone. Only notepad is still not.

@tobiasKaminsky I am still having this issue with NC Dev 20170810. I have noticed the following once the app to share from open NC: 1) When you use the folder that is presented, the buttons take effect. 2) If a new folder is created, NC will enter the folder, then buttons have no effect. 3) If you create a new folder NC enters it. If you exit the folder, buttons have an effect. 4) If you create a folder, concecutively create several folders (getting down deeper in the folder structure), the folder NC enters never have any effects on the buttons. However, if you go up once, then the buttons will behave as expected.

Sorry, Samsung Galaxy S3 using the official 4.1.2 rom (albeit rooted).  EDIT: Clean installed 4.1.1 rom using Odin, then did an OTA update to 4.1.2.  Then I rooted it, so it should be stock with stock kernel and recovery.  So far, I haven't deviated at all from the official 4.1.2 except for rooting it.  EDIT2: AT&T model. 
Perhaps they are vengeance spirits, I'm not sure of the nomenclature. I can assure you that the ghosts are not part of another mod.  The ghosts which I'm discussing are the semi-transparent clone entities that appear after you kill a mob with the EvilCraft mod. IE if you kill a pig, it'll spawn a semi-transparent pig with altered sound effects. Normally these "ghosts" are only visible if you're in creative mode or using an item from EvilCraft in survival.  I haven't been seeing either the expected ghosts or the glitched dragonflies myself. The provided screenshot shows what one of my users has seen - a mysteriously appearing dragonfly that I theorize is a mistakenly identifying the ghost entity type as another ID (the dragonfly). Since the entity takes the form of whatever it was killed when a living mob was slain that's the best guess I've got.  Again of course I'm no expert. This seems to be exclusive to EvilCraft and doesn't happen with it removed - though I have no doubt that it is due to an interaction conflict bug with another mod.  If I provided a console log would that be at all helpful? Like I said it isn't causing crashes or anything, its purely a cosmetic issue. I will keep an eye on the console in the mean time and see if anything catches my eye.
@monperrus  I plan to investigate it this week. Then PR or close.
Yes I did enable "Cache CLOB values" option. Results get truncated at 8k (not at 4k as I stated before):  `Actual content length (8192) is less than declared: 25809` 
I am using 0.8.1.  I had problem with loading images from phone gallery on some devices - some images would show up rotated by 90 degrees. I figured out that images that have 90 or 270 (i.e portrait orientation) in their exif would show up horizontally. I read that fresco can auto-rotate images, so I tried setting .setAutoRotateEnabled(true), but it didn't have any effect. So I just started to experiment with fresco settings and figured out that setting .setDownsampleEnabled(false) solved that problem.  
All strings I enter then press a result for have done it. https://gist.github.com/mxmilkb/f26a8c7083f6ec12e69953497a5e6e18

Hi twillouer,  Thanks a lot, it works great ! I will live with this patched version for now. When do you plan to release a new version including this patch ? 
Vampirisim's entity "Vampire Hunter" is attacking AncientWarfare2's NPCs (e.g. NPC workers/farmers).  As far as I can tell the responsible AI task is added by AW2 here: https://github.com/P3pp3rF1y/AncientWarfare2/blob/6daddb2b1d5da793ff5c3c47bb909e16d6294e05/src/main/java/net/shadowmage/ancientwarfare/npc/event/EventHandler.java#L103  However, the actual hostile target task only selects vampire players and it does not make much sense for them to attack NPCs.   
My Os is Ubuntu and i am running che as root. 
@philip-lamb The original issue was that keys are detected but you can write a different key by mistake if you release the input outside of the target key. The PR fixed the problem but has caused missed keys instead.  I pushed a new solution in https://github.com/MozillaReality/FirefoxReality/pull/1159, which captures the down key until the press is released, so it always types the correct key even if you release the pointer outside.

Thanks, @adamretter. I don't think the extra text node is an issue. I have a hard time thinking up a real-life scenario in which one would access text nodes by position (and get the wrong one because of this) or count text nodes inside the document element (and get the wrong count). My example is contrived. 
Ok, well, looks like ProtocolSupport was the reason of that problem, i'll update if this appears again.
I just sent you a private message through curse. It has the dropbox link to my setup. It should have my server already setup in the multiplayer window. If not, let me know and I will message you the IP. 
Tested on a clean machine - you're right - that does not happen there (so there must be an error with another script)  But the issue with canceling the click is there, too.
yep , I just changed  java version, do not change javac version, thank you ! !! 
Hi David,  Ok, several hundred MB definitely sounds big. I don't have an upload server to post files to, but other users have used http://www.dropbox.com to provide me with larger files. http://www.fileconvoy.com/index.php would be an alternative without the need to install anything. Can you use one of those two possibilities?  Regards, Jörg 
I can confirm that. Fixed.
Yes, I have to use TextureView for renderer where using complex shader to draw final frames. I can't use a SurfaceView for my renderer because a layout contains complex hierarchy of different elements and TextureView elements among them with overlay views. A SurfaceView doesn't allow to implement that.  There is example how I use the YuvConverter:  
> Maybe we should encourage any project that uses the framework to create their own context and therefor their own codec -> type mappings  This is an interesting concept. I think we should probably keep a default mapping, but perhaps add better documentation around customization so that a developer could do that trivially if the default doesn't satisfy their use-case?   I'm thinking that the change proposed by this ticket will allow us to support all use-cases though, although we'll know more once I finish the CCP codecs.

Hi, I've run jProfiler and YourKit. This is where it gets weird, I cannot find any threads that are chewing CPU. Everything appears ok and EHCache doesn't appear in any of the dumps I've taken. But the presence of EHCache is all that is required to max out the CPUs. If I swap to JDK or Guava caches, the system stops chewing CPU. I'll give JTop a try. Thanks. 
My idea for a change is two-fold. 1. add a 'forcepull' option. Default false. If true, ignore isClean and discard any local changes. Take from remote. 2. add a logger.warn statement that triggers if local repo goes dirty. This log statement could include details about which files are dirty.

Nice, I've tried it with a simpler project and it worked now. It gave me the expected output. However a more complex project failed.

I do not have experience with other Java EE applications using native memory instead of heap. I am only aware of memory analysis tools for heap dumps, not for the native memory.  Unfortunately, even if the observed behavior were considered normal, WebSphere administrators would take issue with an application using several times the memory figure allocated to heap.  I could see the memory grow on the Java process corresponding to the JVM in the Windows Task Manager, not using some WebSphere tools. I let the memory grow to 5GB before pulling the plug. The db usage volume was minimal although the few records affected were relatively large (~1MB). The database size was small (~2MB). I was basically adding, reading and deleting a single record. The heap size was 1024MB. The physical memory available on the server was approximately 5GB.  Now, I did open issue #6493 which could well be related. Since deleting a record results in error, I suppose that it could factor in that record being preserved in memory. 
Yes, it completely helps! :)  Thx!  For those who are in docker-land and want to see how i overcame it, i use the following assets to build my ES json logging docker image:  
Sorry for the confusion. That is set to true as well.
Ah ok, i thought was a problem to convert exception for passing it to client. this error appear rarely in server log , i will investigate asap , just i i ll see it again. 
As I haven't changed any setting startup routine before and after the upgrade, and the drive letter, which is "X", is not configured to be used by another program so I doubt that's the case here, though at the same time I don't know what the exact cause is.  If that would be the case, it's just not understandable why that hadn't happened since `1.4.7` to `1.4.10` at all.
Probably yes. The annotation processor does basically nothing (i.e.. no XML file outputted, for instance). I will try another way of serialising XML files.

 [focus_issue.zip](https://github.com/vaadin/framework/files/1603412/focus_issue.zip) Hi Adam,  I tried feature with simple app as you mentioned and it worked. But the problem occurs in a more complex project structure.  For example: In my company, we took your Bakery starter App (Jave EE) and adapted it to our requirements, but here FocusListener event doesn't work on some browsers (Edge, Firefox).  For better understanding I attached .zip file. Here you'll find two maven projects:     - focus_example_1 - simple app where everything works fine    - focus_example_2 - project where FocusListener doesn't work on Edge and    Firefox browser.  I also tried FocusListener on Bakery App project where issue also occurs.  Vaadin version: 8.2.0  Best regards and of course Happy 2018!

@shorea I'm using parallel.  
sure! where exactly am i looking for that version number? i dont see it in the output from the server start command. I can tell you it was done via a git checkout from master this morning.  Im currently running `Ubuntu Server 14.04_3 x64` java is technically installed to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java` but it is linked to `/usr/lib/java` JAVA_HOME is pointed to `/usr/lib/java` 
It looks that it happens after field addition or removal in serialized class (may be without change of serialVersionUID). It is hypothesis,  it never happened without modification in serialized classes. When the problem appears, then the Tomcat's log is full of serialized data from sessions (each ~1M in size) without any additional log. According me, there should be null ptr check in the CommandDecoder and the problem should be handled by reddison, I'm sending full exception:    I don't have enough time to do test case now...

I guess the question regarding the cloud backup is probably more related to user's privacy or preference than on merely the settings. Thanks for explaining me what was going on.  I guess we need to devise a strategy for updating resources and the like robust to that.
Hi @robfrank !  Yes, You are right! I try to use JDBC in remote with standalone server.  About stack trace .... I see "Error deserializing record to get field-names, send this data for debugging" string in log. Also I get NPE at Java site. I insert entity by query: insert into Hypothesis content {"pos":1,"description":"NP != P","id":"1234567890"}; I get same error then I execute my query by Native OrientDB API. I guess that is problem of JSON Parser.

Based upon your comments I did some more digging into how spring data is processing the sort request parameter. You correct spring data does support the csv format.  However, the csv format appears to be processed differently than multiple sort request paramters. For instance, the SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver.parseParameterIntoSort it would appear that only one direction is supported so in the example that I provided sort=firstName%2ClastName%2CDESC the direction on first name is set to DESC.  Java doc states "If the last element can be parsed into a Direction it's considered a Direction and a simple property otherwise."  However, when the values are submitted as sort=firstName&sort=lastName,DESC the sort request parameter processing set the sort direction on firstName to ASC and lastName to DESC.  So even though its supported the functionality is different which is why we are detecting a regression.  I will work today to put together a sample applications but hopefully this clarifies the issue more.  I didn't realize where the break down was happening until you mentioned that spring data rest was successfully parsing the comma separated values.    
Yes, I did. This can be easily reproduced by applying [this patch](http://pastebin.com/6H4nMz12) to the sample project. It basically sets FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS and fitsSystemWindows="true" in the main layout file. This will make the crouton appear [behind the status bar](http://i.imgur.com/YmfKcg4.png) when It should appear below the action bar.  The solution I suggested, by the way, won't fix it, I just tested it. 
@kevinushey I'm not sure what that would look like, since I can only get the bug to reproduce from within RStudio console...  As far as `debugonce(.jinit)` goes, it gets to right about where you'd expect (`.External(RinitJVM, boot.classpath, parameters`)... at that time we have:  
See https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/minimesos/blob/master/opt/apps/chronos.json.   It seems Mesos adds an extra `--http_port` with the port from the configured port range.
You have to enable autocomplete in the main template. Then start typing and select one of the autocomplete items. Now it should focus that location on the map. But you get the exception.  
The URIs mentioned in the issue should come from UriBeacon.getUriString() so they are indeed coming from the ScanResult. 
It will not block immediately, but after a period of normal operation, it will stop at the start method and will not continue to run. Even if other threads enter that method, they will be stuck in the start method and will not continue to run.
Desktop info updated, tried recently 1st blob saved fine, after that hung up, random 
Actually, my setup looks almost exactly like the 'edge case' you've described (with HaProxy instead of nginx), but with one important difference:  > [ Browser ] -> HTTPS -> [ haproxy ] -> HTTP + X-Fowarded-Proto -> [ Tomcat + RemoteIpValve ]  So haproxy sets the X-Fowarded-Proto header, so Tomcat knows that the original request is secure. I.e. requests.isSecure() returns true. No need to configure HTTPS for Tomcat! IMO this is the correctly configured version of tne edge case - which is not so edgy at all IMO. 
GraphHopper should not produce corrupt shortcuts anymore (as #980 should fix this) but in case of a new bug it would load such broken files without reporting a problem or stopping. To reproduce this, the following should work: create a graph with multiple CH profiles in parallel via an old version and provide too few RAM and then some CH preparations will stop with OutOfMemory errors or similar and then load these files with a recent version.
@TWiStErRob Thank you very much for your help. I tried 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT(glide-4.0.0-20151212.212519-126.jar)but it did not fix，the same  effect as above:( 
Yes, I'm using the fix now, and it works. 
Finally had time to reply at atomjack and got an email its fixed by the dev! Nicely done!  Just wanted to thank you :)
I used scala.util.Random. Here is the complete Scala code with imports:    Maybe `(pos * neg)` is lifted to double after the overflow? 
You are right. The event is not lost. It remains in the queue ✔ Unfortunately OwnTracks **does not** retry the transmission, as soon as the WiFi receives the internet connection (WLAN Symbol changes from ❗ to OK). A retry is done when it changes back from WLAN to Cellular. This means that the Exit Event is delayed for the duration of the car drive 😒  thanks, michael
Hi, looking in Eclipse Installation Details the SpotBugs version seems to be:   SpotBugs	3.1.2.r201802250230-59118d9	com.github.spotbugs.plugin.eclipse.feature.group	SpotBugs Project  I configured my workspace to use compiler level 1.8 only across all projects. The problem occurrs even when trying to scan an empty new project (tested with workspace settings and with manual "Java 10"-level settings).   Okay, I installed the latest version from https://spotbugs.github.io/eclipse/ now and that seems to work. I hadn't realized that 3.1.2 wasn't the most recent version, which I had obtained from the Marketplace. So the issue should rather be: Update the Marketplace version. :)
https://postimg.org/image/4jxmy2udt/  Yes,  is public  https://github.com/demicro/SM-J510FN_KERNEL
@erikfleischer yes that's what I meant. I will do some tests with an emulator to see what I can do. 
Tried, the device code login works fine. 
yes I checked the remember-me box. if I'd not select, the package manager does not open at all :-(  (this is a second serious issue)
Unfortunately the smartphone is not mine and I can't install the newly updated version on it again. It's android 4.4.2 (Galaxy S III). What I can see is that the smartphone doesn't riconnect to the band when it's in proximity with it. And in notification centre the band is displayed as always connected (despite it's actually not).
I was missing a config file in the classpath, I expected it to fail gracefully
Thanks for the clarification.  You can click/change the state when it becomes "Disabled" or "Temporarily disabled", but not "Permanently disabled". The state is disabled, and not clickable (see below screenshot).  <img width="807" alt="dump_2018-12-30_23 11 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/359918/50551999-80f3eb00-0c8a-11e9-91cf-515217568c43.png">  <img width="557" alt="dump_2018-12-30_23 27 13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/359918/50552001-86513580-0c8a-11e9-9037-27dbd42d581c.png">  I'm no Bootstrap expert, but the button seems to be disabled via code;    Happens in both index view/list, and when trying to edit a specific indexer.
You don't have understand what I said ? 
Of course. I was using dropwizard-jdbi to query for rows in an Amazon Redshift DB with timestamps that fell on a particular date (1/1/2015) in UTC (Redshift timestamps are always in UTC). So, I created the DateTime objects with UTC timezone and binded them to the SQL using the SQL objects API. The returned rows, however, did all fall on the date I wanted. Instead of getting rows between 1/1/2015 00:00:00.000Z and 1/2/2015 00:00:00.000Z, I got rows between 12/31/2014 18:00:00.000Z and 1/1/2015 18:00:00.000Z. So, both of the binded dates got shifted back 6 hours, and my JVM's timezone was US Central (UTC-6). When I passed the JVM argument "-Duser.timezone=UTC", I got back the correct rows.  To answer your 2nd question, there is no peril in the conversion from DateTime to milliseconds. The peril happens after this, either in converting the milliseconds to the Timestamp object (in "new Timestamp(value.getMillis()") or converting the Timestamp into a binary value that's sent to the database - I'm not sure which one, but my guess is the latter. Either way, the root cause is that Timestamp is a thin wrapper around java.util.Date, which is known to use the JVM timezone in some unexpected situations. 
@sberyozkin that's the thing.  I have not listed quarkus-keycloak-authorization as a dependency.  Not sure why I'm seeing exceptions related to KeycloakPolicyEnforcerAuthorizer.  Is it a chained dependency when using OIDC or Undertow?  I'll give v1.1.0.CR1 a shot and see if that corrects things.
@yegor256 Here is the log https://www.dropbox.com/s/ryvqdk5j3tacyz2/qulice_log.txt 
I've managed to get it to reproduce reliably, and this time even in the initial message, not just in the reply.  `Original subject: 🐕🐶🐩🐈🐱🐀🐁🐭🐹🐢🐇🐰🐓🐔🐣🐤🐥🐦🐏🐑🐐`    Shows up as `Re: 🐕🐶🐩🐈🐱🐀🐁🐭🐹????🐰🐓🐔🐣🐤🐥🐦🐏🐑🐐` 
Thanks for the quick response. The whole stack trace is extremely long, but I'll paste it in at the bottom of this comment along with the log messages from the start of the manual version creation. As far as I can tell the effective time is populated in the extension files. The extension can be found here - https://vtsl.vetmed.vt.edu/extension/  
Hi,  I just checked and it says that I was using java 6. I believe that I downloaded tacit on March 30th and I used the tacit website to do so.  Thanks, Charlotte  
Technically nothing. The benefit is having a lot of states of one project that can be examined at one time = during one (longer) execution. Also, if we knew that the project is "buggy" which means that the master branch fails quite often, then we could verify the fail time and fail coverage.

I get my heads with the plugin hdb  https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/head-database.14280/
Below's the code to reproduce the scond problem. Just hit ctrl+space after start. I'll try to find a similar easy way to reproduce the first.   
@bogdanudrescu I confirm I see the same thing with my example: the `Must be false` shows briefly after refresh in Firefox and Vaadin 14.0.7, then "shrinks" and disappears. [Screencast from 01.10.2019 12.30.49.webm.zip](https://github.com/vaadin/flow/files/3675455/Screencast.from.01.10.2019.12.30.49.webm.zip)

Here's the new event I exported from my phone right after creation: [event_before.vcs](http://glesik.ru/share/event_before.vcs). And this is the one exported from ownCloud web interface after sync: [event_after.ics](http://glesik.ru/share/event_after.ics). 
I've reduced the crash to a minimal example. You can find it here: https://gist.github.com/cypressious/5ccfe84a31fd836fe125  As it seems, any class that extends Google's `SupportMapFragment` and uses any lambdas will crash retrolambda. Should I open a new issue on the original project? 
@galadril difficult as it's inside my home-LAN. The domoticz bug (mentioned above) contains a domoticz database you can play with.
I simply had the source code in an Eclipse IDE which had all three JDKs configured. PDE will do the validation for you.  To be honest, this was the only workspace I had configured with all three JDKs up until now.  Tycho could so some validation as well when multiple JDKs are configured [1], but I never tried it out. So I am not sure how good and easy that works,  [1] https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html#useJDK 
From what I can tell, it has to do with Drones from PneumaticCraft I think.... 
IMO @k-wall is right, also given that we have this issue too #2863 related to resources not deleted probably due to lack of owner references I think it's worth giving this a look. Apart from that @lulf , It's maybe correct to adapt systemtests to use the documented uninstalling process, I'm thinking of a reason not to do it but nothing comes to my mind, maybe @kornys have something to say
I had a smokestack imprinted, and then it instructed me to choose a value of X. I chose 4, and was instructed to pay 8. Then I clicked cancel, chose 0, and was instructed to pay 4.
I have just tried the shell script and it works like a charm!! No problem when using the output certificates! Thanks for so a quick solution. 
I've now run my PRONOM parser (for issue https://github.com/digital-preservation/droid/issues/237) on all the signatures for v91.  These are the ones which can't be parsed at present:  fmt/899	4D5A{126-128500}50450000{20}0B01{66}**[0000:1000]** fmt/900	4D5A{126-128500}50450000{20}0B01{66}**[0000:1000]** fmt/1105	4244{12}0003{6}**[!&01]** 00 fmt/142	52494646{4}57415645666D7420[!10]{3}**[!FEFF]**{16-*}64617461  So we have three things which need clarification:  1.   Multi-byte lexicographic comparison   [0000:1000] 2.   Bitwise & operator            [!&01]                3.   Not a 16 bit integer           [!FEFF]  **Multi byte lexicographic comparison** The spec says to compare multi byte values lexicographically, but DROID does not support this.  It will treat this as a range of 00:10 (with the other two 00 bytes added to this set, which means it's still 00:10).  **Bitwise & operator** The documentation states that this is to only match even values.  This works in DROID, because the **&** operator is a byteseek bitwise operator. that says match all values matching the set bits.  So you get all the odd values with &01, and all the even ones by inverting it with the **!** operator.  This signature almost certainly doesn't work at all in versions of DROID before v6 or v5 when byteseek was introduced. The & operator is also used in a few container signatures.  It's really useful to be able to specify what bits must match in a byte, but there isn't currently a standard for it.    **Not a multi-byte sequence** The documentation for this signature states that "wformat Tag not equal to decimal 65534 = 0xFFFE". There is no support in DROID for matching "not a sequence of bytes".  This will be interpreted by DROID as not either of the two bytes FF and FE, rather than "not FF followed by FE".  **Recommendation** Bits of byteseek syntax are creeping into PRONOM signatures.  Some signatures use multi-byte sequences which aren't currently supported in DROID.  TNA should define the official syntax that PRONOM and DROID supports. 
@Cjballard yeah that's correct https://www.paintcodeapp.com/ > generated the `LaneStyleKit.java` code.  I don't think there's a huge cost in efficiency either way here.  Optimized vector assets (like the ones you provided for the route overview button) are pretty much standard for Android at this point and imo, would be fine to be used as replacement.  
@dilipkrish What can we expect?   When I have class like:    Now the Springfox generated swagger.json contains a `HotelResource` definition containing these properties but ordered like: `country_alpha2_code`, `id`, `name`.  Is that expected? Should it not keep the order of the properties in the class? 
Thank you. I'll check.
As stated in my second post, I am running the example from the repository with absolutely no modifications (on Lollipop device). I am posting build.gradle file for reference.  #   apply plugin: 'android'  android {     compileSdkVersion 21     buildToolsVersion "19.1.0"    } dependencies {    compile project(':library')     compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:19.+'  } //apply from: 'https://raw.github.com/chrisbanes/gradle-mvn-push/master/gradle-mvn-push.gradle'  #  
e.g.    ThEn I replaced `camelCase` named properties with `snake_case` named (e.g. `requestContext` with `request_context`) and came a step further in the code.  But just from reading the code (with very basic knowledge of Micronaut) it seems, that the global `ObjectMapper` is used for parsing JSON into `AwsProxyRequest` which then lead to errors when I change the jackson config in `application.yml`.
You can just change 3 first rows in MainActivity class of round example  private static final Uri URI = Uri.parse(  "http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5192/55ba/b3fc/4b8d/f000/005b/large_jpg/MBS_Image_by_BIG_01.jpg?1368544661");   private static final int WIDTH = 240;   private static final int HEIGHT = 140;  and result  ![zte](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2329931/19380380/b2a2fcca-91ff-11e6-831b-c41d799d9220.png)  And there is also one interesting message in log 10-14 11:14:55.533 15505-15532/com.facebook.samples.round E/OpenGLRenderer: GL error:  Out of memory! which appears when i start to scroll up and down, and after scroll other images becomes black  Without bitmap shader rounding everything is ok, no errors in log 
At start screen it shows a toast saying "to get downloadable areas restar connected to internet. Problem while fetching remote area list: http://graphhopper.com/public/maps/0.2/". I've tried connected to 3G and WiFi but always shows this message. 
You need *.sfa or *.sfb file?
@laa Sorry, My database is confidential so I can't send it and this problem is completely random. Anyway, could you tell how me how to get a full stack trace? Also, I would like to try your new build. Thank you.
@justinedelson Looks like this is the culprit. Including the pre-minified `angular.min.js` in the client lib seems to resolve the compilation issue, but there are still some other issues going on; QE works but Fiddle still doesn't. Also, it looks like HTML Library minification breaks ace editor just like version clientlibs does (can't remember if you noticed it on the versioning or both).

Sure. Https://rcrdbrt.com/blog If it's too much of a big deal or there's a lot of code refactoring involved tell me, I could just add a subdomain, in that case I think it will work. Maybe no one else uses a setup like my current one.
It started to happen after installing the plugin. It happens quite frequently, and before I didn't really notice it. So it's quite save to assume, that it is related to the plugin.  The JVM already has an unusual big heap of 4gb.

It started a long time ago but just now finally narrowed it down to what the issue was.  I had avoided the issue by looping things differently in past.  But I would say I first ran into the issue at least a year ago but it may be older than that

Exactly. Opening the file "encrypted.asc" from K9 only shows "import key". I guess the issue is the mime-type matching. DecryptTextActivity is defined as:   text/*   message/*  DecryptFilesActivity is:   application/pgp-message  But my attachments (received from Thunderbird + Enigmail and Posteo.de "inbound server encryption") are unfortunately of type:   application/pgp-encrypted

Correct. I changed items in hand  placed a block and then switched back. 
Embarrassing... your memory is better than mine. It looks like I never created the issue... until now! Yes, this looks to be the same issue, but different feed.
No, with just RS it works fine.  I've narrowed it down, it seems to be an incompatibility between RS and GameStages. Any recipe that isn't gated with GS works fine, any recipe that is gated (even after it's been unlocked) fails to craft.  If I remove the staging on an item it can craft as normal, so it seems that RS isn't reading recipes after they've been unlocked.  Again, RS shows the working recipe when items are placed into the crafting grid, and plays the crafting event sound effect, but the completed item can't be taken out of the grid, it just vanishes. If I attempt to craft the item before it's unlocked, the completed recipe doesn't show, which is intended.
Yes I was using the Official 5.5.2 version, same I couldn't get a round to start properly.

Here's a Link to the video showing the problem https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uW2p9GP6_TODdrZz_I384-XT_mi_xS1F   PS: The music is bad.
@tolusha  My workaround was to create project first and then run `chectl` to install che. Some how chectl does not create project if one does not exist any more. 
It's a relatively non-issue. 
I don't have chrome/chromium installed on this device :s 
The missing mods are server sided, so they shouldn't affect it client side. And I'm using a custom pack, but I can upload it if you need.
The key problem is unexpected filtering by 'order by' clause. If it filters null value with 'ignoreNullValues: true', I can say it doesn't fix the issue. Maybe I can accept it as a work-around.  Anyway I'll test this in 2.2 and feedback. 
Hi Francisco!  Those changes to work with the new API are in our code (we read CKAN contents to show them in a browser), not in Cygnus CKAN. I am sorry about the noise.  We are using Cygnus CKAN without any changes and configure to publish in demo.ckan.org. I have tested 0.8.2 and develop branches, and both have the same issues.  Thanks for the quick response! 
I will see what i can do.

I did, and I'm not sure why it didn't work right from the start. Wiring was always cross-checked. Maybe a intermittent contact failure in the pin header contact though. First Idea was about a driver issue because of the other Wire1 issues I already had reported and which are still defective on either Due. 
Heres when im not http://prntscr.com/6rpryb 
I just ran the rebuild. Now I do get back that parent when I query the MAIN/SNOMED-VET endpoint, but it is very slow to return (like 6-7 seconds). Before it was pretty much instantaneous. I also see this log message output when I call that endpoint now:  that seems surprising for just a single concept parent query.
I am using latest sources from master branch 
Version 1.6.0 is in the pack, and this was in an RFTools Dimensions world.  It may have something to do with a dropped entity bug that I noticed, where any thrown/dropped entities keep teleporting (you can notice it in the above GIF with the dirt blocks.)  If this is the case, it may not be Cyclic's problem.
- CraftBukkit version git-Spigot-2086bb0-8cc5a7e (MC: 1.12.2) (Implementing API version 1.12.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT) - AuthMeReloaded v5.4.0 b1877  It doesn't restore the flying state properly that means when i logoud in the air while flying, it disable fly at the next login so the players will get fall damage even if I had the essentials.fly.safelogin permission. I've tried with RESTORE and with NOTHING in the restoreAllowFlight config. :(

The exceptions are observed again even without data of long type. I am doing some testing to figure it out.
yes, i'll check on it.
@createbyte I am not sure what you are requesting. are you trying to fix this bug? or just be able to send notifications?

okay update to the issue: it seems to only be when you break the core ill test it on its own 
It's ok, this will certainly help Gama users, since i lost a lot of time looking for why my texture was not displayed, and Gama should simply say that my path is bad.

@gpx1000 When I try to attach to the debugger, AS show me an error and tell me to close other adb, then the choose process dialog dismisses. After I kill the demo process, the AS debugger works and the choose process dialog doesn't dismiss as well.
Same behavior using com.mysql.jdbc.Driver and the latest version (5.1.26).  Extract from the pom.xml :    
I do not.
I've done the backup with the old version (I'm rather sure it did not contain any of the new directory logic, independent of the exact build date, since I wanted to avoid that code before travelling to Asia a month ago), then uninstalled manually and installed the new version. I'm not sure if cgeo recognized to migrate anything, I have not seen any UI indicating a migration. I'm fine with closing this.

ah ok, got it :)  yes, I put the @DebugRemove above Application class declaration for build up towards prod release, but that will take some time.  But I get the logic now. Thanks for the quick reply !
@dmzaytsev I think a better approach is to check for an existing bower version first:    This returns the available version and if present, there is no need to re-install bower again. Agreed that this is a pretty trivial thing and even running `npm install bower` might get it from cache instead of actually downloading, but installing a package each time you build doesn't seem like a good workflow (or maybe I'm missing something, @dmzaytsev ?) 
 
The error occurs when attempting to build JavaHelp and HTML  Help. Please try building in those formats. 
Its a prison server, i use silkspawners to spawn the mobs, mobs like pigs, cows work fine anywhere and even on a fresh spawn. No matter what it doesnt work on hostile mobs on a natural spawn or spawning from a spawner and thank you for the fast reply
I'll attempt to reproduce it when i get home. It's happened to me on all servers.

Nope. No response from the repository maintainers either so it seems to be abondoned.
Test in: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/test/games/strategy/triplea/delegate/StratBombTest.java  Does nothing really. I have tried to get it to work, but had to comment out the lines 113-115 because they fail. It seems that the .getUnitDamage() method doesn't get the bombing damage but I can't see how to get the bombing damage - reading the code, getUnitDamage seems like it is correct but obviously I am missing something.  Is that clear now? 
Thanks for reply. I tested on my local environment. Below is the postgres9.4 db function   
@l0rd No, `chectl` works, it just seems strange and unexpected. 
I'll check in a few hours once i wake up again. 
They don't show up at, except in the All Recordings list.  Some titles have no inetref, e.g. news programs. Shows currently recording won't have one 'til mythmetadata runs.

I think its an issue caused by IC2 and struct pro after removing that mod I no longer suffer the issue. Love your mod by the way nice to see you didn't abandon placemod ;)
Oh indeed - I wondered why I had been finding it more annoying than usual, but it's just because I've been working more in `.Rmd`
Thanks for looking into this! I will try to produce a sample project which reproduces the error, but it might take some days.  Maybe there could be a problem with the order postProcessAfterInitialization-method is called: if postProcessAfterInitialization is called first with a DataSource argument, and directly after that with a EntityManagerFactory argument, then properties variable is not yet set and this might lead to NPE. Just a thought, I might be totally wrong about the inner workings of Spring :-) 
@jameskleeh Thank you for your reply.  I think it's ok to return null in `computeContextPath`:  https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/7b2a80bbfa85f2adac42486565c5d0399ca9f1a7#diff-a946190c84ccce1758d26fa8b96b352aR37  Then it's treated as empty context path here:  https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf/blob/bb2fd0e9005f8aab0de0a3f9f3897edea8084b88/src/main/java/org/thymeleaf/linkbuilder/StandardLinkBuilder.java#L125-L126 
Thanks for the `$regex` tip.  I am not familiar with the internals of your plugin, but would it be possible to support some sort of regex (either Javascript or Java)? I guess for most common database queries, any regex format would be similar. I guess the differences are noticeable only for very advanced queries. 
I stored the file in the root of the vault. So its like _"S:\1111111111111111111langer [...].txt"_ `Len=213` The vault itsself is located in _"d:\test.cryptomator"_. `Len=230` I tested such a file in a longer (non vault) folder name _"d:\test.noch laenger als crypromator"_ and it works. I guess its not 255 limit. 
I have test  2.1.4    2.1.6   2.2.0      2.2.3         cpu and memory also increase more than 2.1.3. 
Hi @jgcmarins. This is my code :  `const URI = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(this.state.uri, {encoding : FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64})` ``const URI64 = `data:video/mp4;base64,${URI}` `` `Share.open({url : URI64, message: "Some message",title : "Title"})` It only works well on a few apps like Mail, Imessage. On Facebook, Instagram, It only has video and doesn't have the message.
Seems so. I just tested this on a beta3 and there the switch is working for all bulbs/firmwares. 
If I clear the workspace, then my history will gone. I would like to preserve the history results, but without test cases that are not in the project. 
I will try to reproduce tomorrow.  Btw: do you have tipps to speed up schema-information (tables, colums, foreign keys) for an oracle db. My account hat full-access, and it takes very long (20-30 secs) to produce the catalog information; and this is fast because I already restricted to one schema....  I’m currently building an web-app where the people can create special triggers ... and therefore I didn’t want to re-invent the wheel and just tried to use APIs already in the wild, so your API was choosen.... but somehow I still have this performance problem....

Yes and it doesn't fix the problem.  
@saudet Thanks for the response. I'm running the following maven command on my project:    I'm not very conversant with Maven, so maybe I forgot something. If you could help me with that, I would be grateful.  Thanks

Well "Listen to events" can only be understood by technical persons imho. Replace it by "connected" or anything simple like that. A color could be good either, but I'm not sure Android allows that. And, most importantly, having at least a notification in the system tray informing the user when it's disconnecting (with some tolerance, so that user isn't spammed). You can take as example how does conversations.im works as a XMPP client.
Ok while preparing a demo I created a project with both the spring initializer website (https://start.spring.io/) and via the Netbeans Spring plugin Issue is the Netbeans Spring Plugin creates nbactions.xml that passes additional flags to debugger which seems to cause the issue.    Removing the nbactions.xml file resolves issue.
No, it doesn't work with manually installed texture pack.I redownloaded the pack serverside with /emojichat resourcepack but always the same result. I also have this problem when I use vanilla textures.
I created the package by simply 1. starting a new RStudio project -> package 1. deleting the original hello.Rd and NAMESPACE files 1. putting `#' @export` and some text with non-latin letters above the hello world function 1. building documentation using roxygen2 1. building the package  RStudio or roxygen have added `Encoding: UTF-8` into DESCRIPTION automatically for me.
The iOS app also doesn't do this yet, but its on the list. Do you have a strategy @alexshepard?  I don't think we need to worry too much here about keeping things up to date or locally generated obs. The main issue is when obs or updates to local obs are coming from the server. Does focusing on update s from the server make this any easier? 
This only happens with reactors that have a really big height...(This statement is wrong) so yeah only if assembled or the controller has information of it being assembled?

9.4.0.0 sorry i didn't even think to put that on there. 
The build you've posted seems to restore the ability to place turrets on the ceiling and fire them, as well as dealing damage to players. Thanks so much for working on it!  The turrets don't seem to damage mobs at all, hostile or otherwise and I have yet to be able to try this on another player. (Though it can certainly kill me!) Is there some intended functionality that I'm not seeing in the documentation?  You're totally correct on the rolldoor texturing, I applied a dye and it showed up like magic. My apologies!  The energy turret icon is still missing from my hotbar and NEI, but it doesn't affect the functionality.
I downloaded the play store version a couple days ago, I'd have to reboot my LG to check for sure. Is the link yoiu sent different? I'm not great at github haha

I think this mod has only one version:1.0,so we probably use the same version.We both get it by "import github mod".And,several gamers succeed in joining the game.I don't know their situations. But when I update the game to 98.1,I succeed in joining other's game in the local network instead of Steam network.Does it mean this bug is fixed?I couldn't check if it will be succeed through the Steam network because there isn't anyone playing games with this mod.I will try to check if it will succeed.

it seams to work ok with non gaseous. I will try it with a single block and also a standard BC tank and not the diamond.  
Thanks for the quick & helpful response.  I can change the Berksfile of my cookbooks, so fix (2) should be best-suited for me. I'll push the fix asap.  If I got this right I would change the first three lines in my Berksfile from    Right?  Is it intended that your Berksfiles in hopshadoop's chef repositories (e.g., in apache-hadoop-chef's Berksfile at https://github.com/hopshadoop/apache-hadoop-chef/blob/master/Berksfile) do not implement this fix? 
I have exactly one ad-hoc task and that one is being passed on to the create method.  Recurrent tasks are being "added" to the scheduler using `startTasks(...)`, before I build & start the scheduler. The method `startTasks(...)` is called multiple times: I do a set of if statements to check for profiles which indicate the tasks that should be started.    Could calling startTasks multiple times be an issue? Also having the issue if I have a simple scheduler with an ad-hoc task (so passed in the `create` method). 
@fvgh you work-around works perfectly. I didn't know that flat hierarchies in combination with wildcard isn't supported yet.  Thanks
@jnioche Ok, I have tested and it is fixed. Thanks
No, I don't have any ideas on how to check this.   It might be fine if the exception is just wrapped with another InternalError with a different message though. If the filename of the offending class is included in the message it is trivial to diagnose the problem, that will already help tremendously.  
@pfaucon Nothing special about the header. The "From:" and "To:" lines exist and are properly formatted. Only one line looks conspicuous to me:  `Require-Recipient-Valid-Since: my.mailadress@gmx.net Sat, 06 Oct 2018 07:49:28 -0400`  Missing quotes and brackets, maybe? 
I found out that the issue only arises when I share the PacketDecoder between Channels. Could it be that ReplayingDecoders are not meant to be shared?  Here's the decoder:  @Sharable public class PacketDecoder extends ReplayingDecoder<PacketDecoder.PacketDecoderState> {     public static enum PacketDecoderState {         READ_NOTHING, READ_HEADER;     }    }  Let me know if you still want to see the inboundPacketHandler. 
I just tested it with 2015.11.29-NB1 and it looks fine to me. Good to include on `release` 
I guess this is a new issue. But it sounds familiar, so maybe there is already an open issue, but I did not found it. 
I'm not sure if you wanted additional info sent as an email or added to this issue, but I'll assume the latter.   I've done some additional testing in order to find out what exactly was causing the issue. The resizing issue might be related to some other part of the specific language file, as I encountered it again when I rebuilt the file from scratch, but not in a test file I've been using. Maybe the unusual orthography? Regardless,  I think there may be a fundamental problem with saving files, unless there is simply a major problem with my particular installation.  The last entry added to the parts of speech menu before saving and closing always loses all data except the name. The notes, gloss, etc. are all lost, as well as the definition mandatory setting. However, this only happens when I save and close from the parts of speech menu. If I go to another menu and save from there, when I restart the programme and load the file, everything is preserved.   While testing this, though, I ran into a much larger problem with saving. I went to the lang properties menu to save for the test, where I first checked "Ignore Case" to see if it was related. I immediately saved and closed the programme, and only coincidentally noticed when I came back to that menu that Ignore Case was unchecked. Out of curiosity, I checked it again as well as filled in the first three fields with some random data. Save, restart and reload, and all of that data was gone. While further testing this save issue, I realised that if I switched to another menu, any at all, and THEN saved, it would not lose the data.   I'm seeing more problems now with the parts of speech menu, as related to the same type population error from above (all of this being in my test file, which only has a few plain characters in the phonology, so I no longer thing orthography is related). I'm going to test them a little more and add another comment, for readability's sake.

Unfortunately it's rendering exactly the same in 0.3.10. That version was the first version of your app I tried and where I first spotted the issue but didn't report it. I saw 1.0.0 and hoped this may have fixed the issue, especially with the note about headings, but I saw it was the same and thought it was about time I reported it!  Note that my workflow, when converting these previously text-only files to Markdown is generally just to add headings, i.e. ## in front of lines, and that is when things seem to go wrong.  If you would like a non-redacted version of the .md file, for easier reading, let me know a non-public way I can get it to you.
Yes, exactly - we have something like that.
That's all of it.  I see. Closed -> open ->half_open -> closed -> half_open(the exception) -> closed -> open -> half_open -> closed  You did see my edit where I re-ordered it chronologically? 
Hi, I tried without success to reproduce the error with a MySQL connection (I think that the reason is that i can't simulate a very slow/losing packets network).  Maybe there is some other information that i can provide? 
Might not be an issue. Haven't tried to duplicate it myself.
I reproduced the same thing as above, here is the relevant portion of the server log.    The client is assigned a new ID and treated as any other client, albeit with an empty name field.

The app didn't crash but I see this in the logcat. No modifications. 1 job.  Here's the code: https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/github/shadowsocks/job/AclSyncJob.scala  You might want to tweak it to make it return RESCHEDULE so that you can try it out. 
You mean the Smooth Streaming example "Super speed (PlayReady)", right?  No, that doesn't work either, but with a rather different error message:    Also, it's a first generation Amazon Fire TV box (AFTB, "Bueller"), which does seem to support PlayReady - according to `MediaDrm.isCryptoSchemeSupported(StreamingDrmSessionManager.PLAYREADY_UUID)`. (In contrast, on my LG G2, the above streams fails because of "unsupported DRM scheme"). 
Ah, ok, it is not a bug. I was curious. Thanks for the reply.
I'm talking about the text, not images.  Any UTF-8 character coded on 2 octets (like é) will be displayed as 2 separate characters. This is a quite common issue with UTF-8 and only happens when you assume you're receiving ISO-8859-\* text instead of detecting it.  Will post a screenshot ASAP

Hi @Mavlarn ,  just having controller started itself without any agent running is causing 100% CPU usage. I have agents on physically different machines.  I am not sure if this is just some kind of nGrinder startup process where it can make too much load however it is 100% even after long time since controller was started.

On the solar display, you tap a ship lower right corner and list comes up. You tap a ship to move and it highlights. A second or so later, you lose the highlight and it goes to item at the list bottom(usually...sometimes just a different ship). If that bottom item is idle and open to moving, you get caught often moving that ship instead of your choice. Not sure if the bug is in the order shuffle of moving vs idle ships, or if its in the highlighter code itself. I assume intent is to have list ordered by moving vs idle etc? Basically, I'm having to wait to see if the highlighter moves or not before I actually proceed. Thank you for fixing the mis-spelled Despoit on the ally requests pane. Typos etc...drive me bats. Hold over from my programming days. Another fix, if you could, is the outstanding votes not being scrollable. Cannot finish votes if the boss is not early to vote, and others vote, pushing it off screen. Some alliance tools would be nice for future...sort shortlists of entries by player, or date/time etc...tracking loans vs paid back or yet un-repaid...ticktock on last sign-on to point up players gone inactive. I favor a 2 month deadline to re-log or auto flag for kick. I do screen captures but that stores to me, not in-game. Stuff like this would help in managing and/or proving misconduct. Assigning ranks would be nice for the wishlist too. ☺... One thing some of us were kicking around, was a change to the depth of a sitrep tap to just galaxy view re-center, and not all the way to solar view. Sometimes you want to rename a star etc. Backing up just kicks you to sitrep. Another idea was a re-center options flag at game start so that instead of always opening at Homestar, you could center on your current Workstar. Handy for a galaxy view of the neighborhood. What's your take on shortlisting sitrep combats and new colonies? Might make data handling better if you can cut entries out of the main SitRep....cull all but what a player wants to deal with.  -------- Original message -------- From: Dean Harding notifications@github.com Date: 11/16/2014  15:06  (GMT-06:00) To: codeka/wwmmo wwmmo@noreply.github.com Cc: Hexan1 ebaversjo@hotmail.com Subject: Re: [wwmmo] move select bug (#39)  Can you expand on that a bit?

I personally like that idea - show a loading screen whenever user opens a folder which has been changed in any way and/or shows incomplete data. There are a few issues with this approach though, mainly that the current approach (small loading bar at the tom) lets you interact with files while others are loading, making interaction with the app much faster. If user has to wait for each screen to load updated content, it will damage the user experience.   I really like how MEGA app reacts to data changes. [GitHub](https://github.com/meganz/android/) - It doesnt seem to be running in the background and the updates are immediately synced. I would enjoy this very much on Nextcloud.
Stock rom lollipop 5.0.2  Manufacturer XOLO 
In my case I extended product that has a merchant property as the owner of the product. Merchant has an agent (Adminuser) property. During saving of a product, when processing merchant.agent.activeStatusFlag, it throws this exception. This was working fine with 2.0.1. The thing I'm puzzled is how peekAheadField = entity.getDeclaredField(peekAheadToken); returns null on peekAheadToken = merchant.agent.activeStatusFlag.  Thanks.

> AR's atmosphere's stop whenever it encounters a solid block like a door.  Would it not be possible to simply add +1 range to the check? To include the immediate surrounding blocks? I'm still learning basics of coding so feel free to ignore my suggestion.
We're using 1.8.3. There's no upgrade visible in the plugin manager though. 
  Turns out that there's a ` if (Boolean.getBoolean("org.apache.catalina.startup.EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE"))` check that will decide whether tomcat will throw the exception out. By default, the return value would be false because we haven't set the `org.apache.catalina.startup.EXIT_ON_INIT_FAILURE` value, so it just skipped the throw action.
Yes, it could be a feature propose.  It could be usefull for users who want to whitelist certain apps and have xposed modules who use  arbitrary packages, like the one I'm building.  You can look here for an example:  https://github.com/Firefds/FirefdsKit/blob/pie/app/src/main/java/sb/firefds/pie/firefdskit/XSecSettingsPackage.java Which is called by https://github.com/Firefds/FirefdsKit/blob/pie/app/src/main/java/sb/firefds/pie/firefdskit/Xposed.java  The hooks inside `XSecSettingsPackage` use `com.samsung.android.settings`, and the class is loaded only when the applicationId is `com.android.settings`
Hi, For those fonts I explained above, any string with Japanese characters fails. So I think it is a problem of the metadata of the fonts or something. You can take as an example: 私はたろうです。 As I said, a couple of very heavy fonts such as TakaoPGothic can do the job, but they are big and I am afraid of OutOfMemoryError. Actually at this moment I am programming a kind of music editor and with your framework I can only export the music file to PDF with the music file closed. If it is open, and the editor is showing many visual components, I get the OutOfMemoryError the second or 3rd time I export the file to PDF. 
@yogevbd, 2.0.2620 has the issue as well.
Personally, I'd consider this a P1 or higher, as it turns Bazel's tagline into: "~~Correct~~, ~~reproducible~~, fast builds for everyone", (or, alternatively, "~~fast~~", as incremental builds cannot be used) and this unsafety isn't documented.  However, I don't know how prevalent `includes` usage is.  In our builds, it's used extensively, not only for third-party builds, but to prevent extremely long include paths in our own code. 
I just want to download soundcloud songs by sharing to newpipe. Youtube share works but soundcloud does not work.
Yes that's right. I send them via TS Push Service.

no authentication. I tested this on the website hurl.it and was able to make it work there by just putting the discord URL in the post line and your template from the json compact notification into the body. didn't change anything on the header and no authentication required. 
Sorry. lol. It's the version in the latest 1.7 Direwolf20 pack: (Chisel 2.1.3). I did some searching on the issue tracker and commits, and I don't see any details on this getting fixed, so I thought I'd make a new issue. 
@aguibert   Confirmed that doing `parser.getArray()` or `parser.getObject()` does work correctly in 1.0.5. 1.0.4 was the first version I used. 
Hi Saudet,  Sorry for my incomprehensible question. The problem is when I used typedef like this:    There is an error when I compile: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10292378/9294710/9ca96858-4455-11e5-9755-ac47ac7983e6.png) which tells that javacpp `cannot convert from Vector_p_Double to std::vector<double *,std::allocator<_Ty>> *`. It seems that javacpp does not understand the new type Vector_p_Double defined by the typedef command.  Without using `typedef std::vector<double*>        Vector_p_Double;`, or more exactly using directly `std::vector<double*>` it works fine like in https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/issues/22  So the question is how could I use `typedef std::vector<double*>        Vector_p_Double;`? Hope that you understand my question now.  Thank you for your help. Thanh Liem. 
@garagatyi No proxy. I am running a the hackathon version with all server resources and no external nodes on Debian Linode server. I just had it happen again. This time I tried getting out of then into the workspace and I get a workspace not found error message. However the workspace is still accessible. Might be a new issue entirely. The screen capture below doesn't show the terminal responding(forgot to record) but does show the new error message and IDE not functioning correctly.  ![issue1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20580888/19907718/fa54e6f8-a04d-11e6-93c1-1b5ebe455d61.gif) 
I don't think I can. It needs root access right? My device is pretty niche so I haven't found a way to root it yet and my USB cord's broken. 
I used a simple avro schema and parsed with Avro Parser class. It does throw exception which points out exactly where the mistake is.  Here is my sample avro schema,    As you see the exception message, it clearly shows the error message pointing out line and column.   I haven't yet looked schemaregistry code fully. But I guess in schema registry somewhere original exception got swallowed and different exception alone passed over to the upper layers.  
This may be due to [GRADLE-2836](http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2836), though I think I had downgraded back to v1.6 prior to trying the new plugin. I'll need to retest, though. 
I will fix this in a few hours. The old design wasn't clear. 
Thank you for investigate this!! Can you tell me when you are planning to release the fix if you have any estimation?
the minecraft clear command don't have {amount}  So it break DeluxeMenus shop, 
Nevermind on the % I was wrong again.. I found % referenced but it was for some old Mach2 documentation. The only thing I've found now are ( ) are valid and so is ; but it seems ; is for linuxcnc and a few others but () is accepted across the board for all g code. I even found a sample code or 2 on the git site that had some ; semicolons in it  We have a machine that uses MACH3 and a semicolon is valid as well as the parentheses  ; comments out everything in that line after the semicolon () can be used to enclose comments in the middle of g code or at the end of a line too.  Going forward I will ONLY use () to enclose comments.. Hopefully you can figure out the bug in TgFX. 
I'm using Sony Z3 compact. Android 6.0.1. Specifically a custom build ROM [23.5.A.1.238 SLiMM 2.0](http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/rom-slimm-t3359831) I can reproduce this every time. All other apps are working correctly. I'm willing to load a a test version if you need more details & logs. 
I can't find IT, IT maintenance staff told me not to use this software, which occupied the background resources seriously
Unfortunately I'm not using Allure 2 yet. Once I'll have a time I'll do it. 
I've attached the log here.  It's not a normal crash as the JVM can't connect to the JVMTI agent that was specified on the command-line (since we're not listening for connections).  It would be nice if we could somehow configure our Connector to continue listening, but that doesn't seem to be supported.  [jvmti-crash-log.txt](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-eclipse-tools/files/388717/jvmti-crash-log.txt) 
Hi Stephen, sorry, seems the attachments did not go through as I answered via email. I tried the project again today and funnily enough it worked flawlessly. Has there been any update? I was able to consistently repro it. Anyway... Will also try the insiders version. What version are you guys flighting?
@shabrikaruna yes of course, thank you! The issue is now assigned to you :-) Have you managed to reproduce the issue?

Yeah, both parties did
Please forgive my ignorance but what is the best method to acquire the 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT? I'm currently using the Maven Central Repository via Gradle to acquire my dependencies. Should I build the 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT from source or specify a different repository?  Thanks! :) 
sure. happens with the most basic setup. https://github.com/masc3d/flyway-issue-1180 
@fbricon what's the purpose of source releases if they cannot be built after a few days :/
This is the code in my class@onCreate() which extends Application:   This happens in the emulator which runs Android API P x86. I have not tested it in a real device. 
no, should it be turned on? I haven't ever had it enabled previously and everything worked fine. 
it's default port 29418 
It was with an older version. I will retest with newer nightlies. 
Yeah, it crashes whenever I press the + button.  Installing them from a file manager works fine, though.
It's on the test server. foxguard 0.11.1, SpongeForge 951. 
Thanks guys!

Yes, I'm using Windows 10. I already tried to import fonts. It don't help.
Confirmed, bug is fixed in latest snapshot.
Just import a GPX file with lots of caches (I had 130 from the bug about the Texas challenge GPX file). I let it parse and store all 130 caches and cancelled the map import after 2/130. Nevertheless the map download would continue all the time in the logcat view and after several maps the 403 Forbidden errors by Google occured. I then had to kill the app to stop the download.  Yes, you can see it on an emulator. 
A couple places in the mapping stuff. Don't worry not a result of merge or anything 
@allanneves @wilkinsona Thanks for these two observations  Yes.. Looks like the issue has something to do with Intellij. I went to intellij settings & delegated build actions to gradle & the application works as expected. If I uncheck this box & run the app with intellij, then issue is consistently reproducible
@mehdi-vaadin sorry for no update in that long time. I did not test yet, but if it works I will submit a PR asap and hope that it gets merged : )
Sure, I'm not working atm but will try it out tomorrow and let you know.
@eivantsov i think that it's caused by out of memory... each time i have this error, i clear my memory and everything be ok. thanks eivantsov
@guyca has nothing to do with background. I'm showing the modal when the user is in the app
The other settings (background colors, text color, selected calendars, app to open on tap) are unaffected. As far as i can see, it is just the 24h format. 
Yes, only ic2 dont cause crash
I'll give this a shot when I get home. The build I'm using is: enderio-1.1.0_alpha.59 
We are using Feed the Beast Infinity 1.7 1.0.0

I'm just kinda newbie with GIT repos and all, but I could give it a try... 
Hello,     Thanx for the help.     I had other issues with openjdk on earlier versions of BlossomsManager, so I switched for oracle JDK 8 already.     Also, I am running with command line, sudo java -jar BlossomsPogoManager.jar.     I don't know where went wrong, but I just use alpha1 now since it's pretty good already.     Tried using alpha2 on windows computer, it works fine.  Andrew  On Mon, Aug 22, 2016 at 7:17 AM, Wolfsblvt notifications@github.com wrote:  > Do you run the jar file directly?

logcat? https deamon?
Changed it and it still doesn't work... Even opened it in the debugger and it the UUID is correct there. Maybe an Android issue as you suggested
Hey, I will look into the apks, but next week, I am also on (mini-)holiday :)  Do you have any recommendations on how to debug the apks' .dex code? I plan to decompile the code to smali and maybe step the smali code with debugger using apktool. 
Hi @Mariovc ,  At int rotation = ImageRotator.getRotation(context, selectedImage, isCamera);  **When selecting image in device portrait view  from  gallery** rotation = 90 bm = ImageRotator.rotate(bm, rotation); matrix array as [0.0,-1.0,0.0] [1.0,0.0,0.0][0.0,0.0,1.0] degree 90  capture from camera, in case device is in portrait mode. rotation = 90 but the tempfile does not get generated in cache folder  **where as in landscape mode camera capture** rotation is 0 and the file is saved in cache folder.  ![start](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21154957/17884077/d2d03f20-6933-11e6-96f8-6f8ba1336523.jpg) [verbose.txt](https://github.com/Mariovc/ImagePicker/files/431906/verbose.txt) [warn.txt](https://github.com/Mariovc/ImagePicker/files/431905/warn.txt) [debug.txt](https://github.com/Mariovc/ImagePicker/files/431904/debug.txt) [info.txt](https://github.com/Mariovc/ImagePicker/files/431907/info.txt) 
When going from cache to logging view. The screen just stays black, not even the "waiting prompt" is showing. After some seconds it reports c:geo is crashed. 
No, I didn't. This was as bare-bones a project as I could make (a single placeholder `@RestController`), using the copypasta Tomcat-exclude/Undertow-include, but I couldn't get it to work. Finally gave up and went back to Tomcat.
synchronizing on a single base object will not be enough.  If we consider the approach using synchronization we need to use the static property _ self _ as lock, this property is not visible from xtend code. (And I'm not speaking about the performance slowdown ...) 
Tested on 6.9-snapshot and 7.0-snapshot
Here you go @bbottema. https://github.com/jatcwang/repro-simplejavamail  Reproduced on 4.4.5, 5.0.0 doesn't seem to have this issue. (check git commit history)  I initially pulled in 4.4.5 for my project because v5 was still in beta, but now I can just upgrade and this shouldn't be a problem for me anymore.  Feel free to close this ticket if you're not planning to fix v4 series. Oh and thanks for this library :)
I'll try and come with one but basically any code that's not compilable should do it:    I'll test this soon. 
2.32 
This was tested in single player originally so it doesn't seem to be a desync issue. Just ran a test on our server, which is running the 1.11.2 version, and confirmed the behavior in that environment also.
I downloaded the nighlty versions of UGS few hours ago. I'm running classic because the "Platform" crashes immediately on startup (running on latest Linux Mint).

Thank you for the response.  Both getBean(Class) & getBean(String) methods are showing performance degradations.  We badly need a work around for this issue, as it is taking more than 3 min during initialization.
> I haven't seen this problem in a long time. This means that the part somehow got corrupted. I don't see anything indicating in your logs, so I don't have any clue at the moment what would be causing this. >  > Can you reproduce this problem consistently? If so, can I send you a dev build that outputs additional debug logs in a couple of days to help me debug the issue?  Oddly enough; i've tried multiple times, and cant replicate it in any world. One of the weirdest bugs i've ever experienced. So i'm not sure if it's even fixable on your end. I can break all the blocks and replace and it still happens. I can spawn in the blocks needed and it still happens. But only in this world. It's strange.
We might be able to detect it using `Display.getPixelScaleFactor()`, although I need to check if a flag is necessary (http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Using_High_DPI_Mode).  Another thing we can do is using our own version of LWJGL and LibGDX for now (I compiled a version without those problems) but this is a bit of a pain 
I downloaded and exploded the linked nightly. I started my default docker-machine. I used `bin/che.sh start` UI came up. I attempted to create a project (and workspace) to test this and it is stuck on Creating Workspace. Nothing interesting in `catalina.out`. I restarted che with the same result.  I deleted my default docker-machine and attempted to `bin/che.sh run`. Still stuck on "Creating workspace". If I run `docker ps` or `docker images` I now see nothing. So it appears that the workspace image is not getting pulled. `docker version` correctly provides information about my client and server versions, so I assume my environment is setup correctly. I just ran `docker run hello-world` from the same shell I'm running che commands from and I got the appropriate output.  Aside: It would help to know if there was a less destructive way of resetting things, I might have containers in my default machine I don't want to just wipe out. 
Still experiencing this issue on 5.8.143.000.0. I completely erased the IDEA preferences dir, created a new empty project, opened up a plain text scratch file, assigned the String Manipulation shortcut to "x". When I press the "x" key, the String Manipulation popup appears in search mode with the query "x" filled in. I need to press backspace or esc to see the actual menu. Here is more information about the IDEA and JVM which might be helpful:  IntelliJ IDEA 2018.1 (Ultimate Edition) Build #IU-181.4203.550, built on March 26, 2018 JRE: 1.8.0_152-release-1136-b20 x86_64 JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o macOS 10.13.3
No, I'm restarting the server .. I think the problem with holograms, but I have a plug-in latest version of the update
Oh, sorry.. It's 3.1.2-GA and I've also been able to reproduce that issue on provisioned "Demo Site"  at broadleafcommerce.org.

When you add multiple markers with and, they get added as a reference, from https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder/blob/master/src/main/java/net/logstash/logback/marker/LogstashMarker.java    Which is then added the same way as mdc properties.
Yes that's the scenario.  Answers: 1. Device A has 90 documents. 2. There is a _load docs_ button on the UI to insert 20 documents at a time. The document properties are the same on each button click. The doc ID is not specified so is uniquely generated by the database.  
There are reasons to do this and this actually is an issue on a production server so this is relevant and not just a theoretical case.

I have GSEA running in the eclipse debugger. I'll try to see if I can find the source of the problem on GSEA's end.

Hi Markus, I did a clean install of the 0.10 x64 binary from cryptomator.org on a different machine.  The problem reproduces on the new machine.  Here is the script I used:  dd if=/dev/zero of=xxx.dat bs=1024k count=500 rm -f Z:/yyy.dat cp xxx.dat Z:/yyy.dat rm -f Z:/zzz.dat cp xxx.dat Z:/zzz.dat & sleep 15 # wait for encryption to get started cp Z:/yyy.dat . cmp xxx.dat yyy.dat  The key to reproducing seems to be making sure that the encryption and decryption are happening at the same time.  On the first machine, I reproduced it in WIndows Explorer, pausing the decryption until the encryption showed up in throughput graph, then resume the decryption so they ran concurrently. 
No, i didn't have a look yet.  The vcard (or whatever it is) "inside" the qrcode is correct though: ![432364321742048573](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10261186/28911875-4d9e57c4-7832-11e7-97ba-e21081de1cf2.png)  Are you also experiencing this issue? This could be os/rom related, for all we know. I am running Android 7.1.2, lineageos 14.1, a build from july.
I use MSSQL.We also wondered why query passes without exceptions even if script is incorrect. The problem occured when we tried to create foreign key with wrong data type. Flyway ran patch, foreign key was not added to the table, but patch was marked as executed in schema_version table. Then I tried to use execute batch, because according to the spec  it throws BatchUpdateException (a subclass of SQLException) if one of the commands sent to the database fails to execute properly or attempts to return a result set. Further research showed that execute does not throw exception if first query in the patch ran successfully, as far as I see it happens if foreign key  problem occurs. Did you try to reproduce this bug adding new patch to flyway-samle project? 
I just added     to WekaTestTask and it works, but I guess it is supposed to do something with the values... 
Hi,  I cleaned the project after I imported the 0.8.4 jars, but the error didn't change at all. Same as in my initial description. 
I'm not sure how to check that. However it looks like something went wrong already with the upgrade.  I can try to just do a fresh reinstall if you wish?

Yes `onDestroy()` is getting called and even after calling `imaAdsLoader.release()` still the memory leaks kicks in after closing the app. This memory leaks only occurs after implementing IMA Extension.
I tried : lock.tryLock(1000,1000,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); and lock.tryLock(1000,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); 
Sure, when I get home from work. In the mean time, the turbine would be 6 turbine rotors (12 blades) 3 coils above the Rotational complex. Correctly placed Dispersers. Vents place at and above the dispersers. At 13 high it forms fine, however it will not form if made 14-18 tall. I worked out that if it would form at 17 tall it could be vent/disperser balance (ratios calculated from source code)
Ok, I will provide a PR for this the next days.
Yes on twitch

I set everything in the Paper UI (under Preferences I selected German and under System/Locale I set the locale to de_DE). I tried it again this morning and have some additional information that may help. For the Homematic things the display texts are correct under Things/Configuration: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/616792/20865302/88ca711c-ba0e-11e6-9a3c-af413f6cd271.png)  BTW: as you can see in the screenshot also the name of Yahoo binding and its description is not shown in the correct language.  The Homematic binding does not use the i18n properties files. So it seems that the problem happens only with i18n properties files.
@moberwasserlechner  Authentication seems to work on a web browser. However the webpage does not load (nothing visually pops up) on iOS (untested on Android) and just spams the null windowHandle error in the console.  Below is my configuration:

I'll check that next time it happens but if it isn't a bug with Chromecast discovery then why would a Chromecast have both services one minute and only Dial a minute later? and why would two phones on the same network get different services at the same time? and why would calling stop()/start() on the discovery manager make this happen every time?  
Latest version. Was thrown on an Android 5.1 device.    Could you not check if the wakelock isHeld() before you try to release it?  
At present, graph spectrum needs a tuning panel to retrieve the note from; it can't retrieve one Fingering object from an XML view.    You aren't likely to see this problem with the other tools, because I don't know how to provoke an exception, or an early exit, from any of them.  By rights, Graph spectrum should be greyed out when the XML view is shown, because getSelectedFingering is returning null, but for that to happen, WIDesigner  would have to call StudyView::updateActions(), which is currently protected, when it calls XMLToggleView::toggleView(). 
@ascrutae   This exception occur when  Grpc version 1.7+ , I change  grpc'version 1.6,  trace is correct ,  the demo which used is official example of grpc ，you can try and check  by  use  vesion 1.8 of grpc    
Yes, it could be a development build. I unfortunately only have the jar file named v2.0.0 with no further info. But it contains the UriTemplateResolver class which could be used for reverse matching templates. There seems to have been a cleanup in the newer versions but I can't seem to find how to do the reverse matching in the new version.
Well when I open up the source file and hover over the identifier, I expect to see its doc! 
Yes I did. I use it with ionic 3.

Hi Snickermicker,  I understand the workaround. The problem is with this items configuration: DateTime Date   "Date and Time: [%1$tA, %1$td.%1$tm.%1$tY %1$tT]" { ntp="Europe/Berlin:de_DE", knx="11.001:5/1/2, 10.001:5/1/1" }  The config transmits the time to the knx binding at a set inderval.  This results in formatDateTime(DateTimeType dateType, String dpt) receiving dpt 10.001 with the (line 579) Calendar cal=dateType.getCalendar(); calendar instance fully populated. And from this it is supposed to extract and format a TIMEOFDAY, which according to knx documentation also includes a day of week.  When the code then uses 'if (cal.get(Calendar.MONTH)==2)' to exclude the day of week formatting, it fails in March in my example since March is month 2.  10.001 might not have any date information, but in order to calculate the day of week in formatDateTime for TIMEOFDAY, there needs to be room for a fully populated calendar instance. Hence using the calendar.month for flagging 'no-day' should maybe reconsidered. If the case was that the calendar never had any date information, then (line 584)return dateType.format(Locale.US, "%1$ta, %1$tT"); might as well be removed.  I might be overlooking something here, so please just consider this my observation and correct me if i am wrong  :) 
Bellow is the code. Uncommenting env->ExceptionDescribe()  crashes the app. Without the  line, the exception is properly created and thrown. Works well on Android and JRE.

For what I have read now the updated title is the exact meaning of old devices.  I have discovered that the format string to set the time in the server request was incompatible with that devices, and changing it has solved the problem in my device with 2.3.7. In the format we used 'h' for hours and now I have set 'k' as it's explained here.  http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateFormat.html  I would like to test the solution in more devices, but until late afternoon today I don't think that I would have access to the other device in witch I have discovered the issue.  Maybe is better to wait to that test to make the pull request, although in the 2.3.7 device the problem was present with "PlayStore" version and master of development and now it's OK. 
Sorry, I don't think I follow. What's the issue with having an error for any no-op injection method on components, how would that be a pain in development? 
No, I dont't. But I receive a lot of reports (up to 10/s) and a lot of them with the same cause. Maybe it's timing or threading problem. In my Database i have 4 entries with same stacktrace text, same version_code and version_name but different bug_id (and id). 
I'm using the latest ForgeEssentials beta7 release from curse. 
I clearly did not post enough information and I am sorry for sending you on a wild goose chase.  I do have two rooms configured.  I had the HipChat notifier pointed to my account on the public hipchat.com site and it worked fine. I then  installed the HipChat server locally and tried to get the URL and token right, but I just get Connection Failed.  I found the readme section about debugging and turned that on and the dump is below. Looks like and SSL cert problem, but I do have a valid cert on the locally installed server.  2014-09-16 16:24:54,465 - DEBUG - Set "E:\TeamCityConfig\config\hipchat" as the template path  2014-09-16

Works in VSCode for me.   I was able to isolate this issue: - Made a fresh install of Eclipse 2019-06 - installed only WWD - created a `xx.yaml` file and pasted the following:   After looking around the codebase of WWD I noticed this: https://github.com/eclipse/wildwebdeveloper/blob/master/org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper/src/org/eclipse/wildwebdeveloper/yaml/YAMLLanguageServer.java#L55 Might be related, as it seems like the `validate` field is always set to true. Instead WWD should check if the file opened has a schema registered.  Also the _Kubernetes_ schema is registered for all `.yaml` files? Shouldn't it only apply to kubernetes config files (though I'm not sure if they are identifiable?).
Yes. As long as the working directory is set correctly in the local debug configuration it loads the include file and I can continue debugging.

Thanks @damienmg.  I'm running Debian Jessie with bazel 0.3.1 installed from [bazel_0.3.1-linux-x86_64.deb](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.3.1/bazel_0.3.1-linux-x86_64.deb).    Any other information I can provide to be helpful? 
 
If I can do something for ffurther details, give me a hint.
@copygirl I agree with you, however, bluestone is sooooooo bugged right now that I could write another 10 bug reports and might even find more. My gues is that they are aware that its bugged beyond usable and therefor close it with the comment: "Its being rewritten" 
@nkzawa  i am using socket.io-client-0.1.1.jar, engine.io-client-0.2.1.jar and Java-WebSocket-1.3.0.jar and its on local network, internet should not be the problem.

Your comment gave me an idea.  It may be that HBase prescribes this behavior.  From [HBase's Client.proto (line 144)](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/543c64d2e9d2fc608ef65cafd485a910d4b8d480/hbase-protocol/src/main/protobuf/Client.proto#L144):    This seems like it should be interpreted as "delete row R."  Does that make sense?  Maybe asynchbase needs to internally realize the no-op nature of the request and simply not send it?  (Or just a warning in the comments of the `DeleteRequest` constructors that present a `byte[][] qualifiers` parameter.) 
Same code is still there on master branch. (https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/matching/EqualToXmlPattern.java)
Thanks for the hint! I just had it regenerated, it works wonderfully! Have a great day :)
This one's my fault. I had a Docker build of Confluent Platform running that was blotting out my build from source. Sorry for the noise >_<
Maybe I should not use the words "Hot Deployment". The application is a Swing GUI application and not a Web project.  We are frequently using the "Apply Code Changes" feature in NetBeans to load classes into a running application. This saves time because it takes a long time to start the application and to load needed data.   So I was wondering if this is possible (maybe I am missing something) or if this feature is planned for the future. 
Was totally paying attention with my earlier reply...  Fixed Screenshot with portals in actual different directions this time... All broken ![2016-10-13_22 36 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21979276/19367952/84d51392-9195-11e6-9360-0f36a10110ba.png) 
I've created a minimal demo project that reproduces this issue:  https://github.com/sudr/restdocs-demo  It's configured for the html backend and works as expected. You can switch it to the pdf backend on line 33 in the pom.xml and validate that the request and response snippets aren't rendered in the generated PDF.
@PaulTDD-MC Thanks for the reply! The part with the players pet named {Player}'s Pet instead of {Player} Pet worked, but the item (nether star) is still in the 4th (or 5th, can't remember. The default one) slot in the hotbar, and i want it in slot 9th, which would be slot 8 in config, since coding "usually" works that way. And, MySQL does not work either (I did set it to the correct information.) over my Bungee Network. I might have set MySQL up wrong, since i am not familiar with MySQL, i set it up for the purpose of having this plugin on all servers. Thank you again, your help and time is much appreciated.  - Nomiis
About the booleans... this was my mistake. I'm casting the list. It was a long Friday :smile:. Let me know if you need more info from me for #296. 
Is there any way to test this without building a new release of DialogOS? If I just do "gradlew run", there is no German recognizer model, right?

Correct, not using the GZIP option as of now.  Might be worth pointing out that we also set the dispatch interval to 0 as per the customers request (via tracker.setDispatchInterval()).  We saw this on a Pixel (1st generation) with 8.1.0 and a Nexus 6P with 8.1.0 but did not actively test the scenario on other devices at the time.  Currently we don't have a minimal example available, if I find the time to create one I'll add it here.

Hi @cweitkamp ,  Yes, and it gives the same 400 Error.  Note that I am using Chrome for testing, and it is working with other filters such as a single item.
Sorry for the misleading title :) 
The conversion to a URL was part of PR #85, which is the PR that started pulling proxy information from settings.xml. The reason it was likely converted to a URL was due to me incorrectly naming the proxy host configuration parameter as proxy url. The naming issue has been fixed and thanks to Erik, the proxy host is now correctly used.

Hi mister78, I'm using the transformation below to get the raw values and a rule to interpret it. It is not perfect, especially as I can't reach the additional values for values < 300 lux. If you have a better solution, it would be nice if you could share it.  
Sorry but I never really used gnome, cinammon or xfce... I guess it is KDE related.  
It looks to me like it's only making a call to the connection: https://syndesis.192.168.64.28.nip.io/api/v1/connections/5/actions/sql-stored-connector  I think it needs to call the integration endpoint: https://syndesis.192.168.64.28.nip.io/api/v1/integrations/<id>  and you're right that the 'procedureName' property is coming back encoded.     Looking into that.
Confirmed, that using `--expunge` option fixed it. I also created a simple reproducer repository with one single source file only: https://github.com/davido/bazel_printy:  
@kevinushey, I was running an example that I found online.  I don't actually need to read `stdin` in general.  The issue is that when I ran `readLines(file("stdin"))` I could not do anything in the Rstudio console.  I had to restart the R session.  The issue that I'd like to have fixed is that the command above should not block the console.  Could `stdin` handling be updated so that `readLines(file("stdin"))` just returns `character(0)` like Rgui does?
thanks for your answer. i find the problem.  its a environment problem. if `getBytes()` has no any params, it will use system default encode. reference: [https://docs.azure.cn/zh-cn/articles/azure-operations-guide/app-service-web/aog-app-service-web-java-qa-solve-messy-code-during-sending-chinese-characters-to-third-party-services](url)

Forge/ForgeEssentials. There's no error in the console from what I see but I'll search the logs properly in just a moment.  The database was new over the weekend. I can get a copy if you think it might help? It's the only one on there so it's not like there's something else trying to use MySQL or anything. 
In 3.0.0.Alpha10 problem with "[" and "]" has been fixed, but with "{" or "}" :-1:    
@Frank-en-stein the types don't matter. Take a look at [this code](https://github.com/BasisHub/components/blob/master/src/main/java/com/basiscomponents/db/util/ResultSetJsonMapper.java#L284-L304)  When dates are parsed, the `Z` is dropped and when times are parsed the date part is dropped. passing these incomplete ISO 8601 date-times  to the browser will make the browser thinks that these are local date-times and not UTC zoned date-times  Even [this part of the code](https://github.com/BasisHub/components/blob/master/src/main/java/com/basiscomponents/db/util/ResultSetJsonMapper.java#L244) is wrong which assumes the date-times must be zoned according to the default JRE timezone. @StephanWald This is something that needs to be configured in a global config object along with other stuff. The ExGrid should also be able to access this information so we can customize renderers in a way that honors a specific language, timezone. mask ...
@games647 Yes.

@joakime I've seen it happen a number of times, but I can't make it happen again now. I've tried throwing a RuntimeException in a servlet.init(), in a listener constructor and in a ServletContainerInitializer.onStartup() method and none of them provoke the problem. I'll have a deeper look tomorrow to try to get a repro test case. In the meanwhile, perhaps @mrossi975  can provide a better example?
Hi Jexp,  I use neo4j 2.0.0 community edition. Yes, i got an index on :USER(email)  It's the only node where we found this bug, and it's really difficult to share this graph. To much email in this graph. 
I do have two other mods that spawn deer, Twilight Forest and Familiar Fauna. I have just slaughtered about 20 deer in a barebones pack (only BAP, LootTweaker and CraftTweaker), and not gotten a single drop aside from EXP.  Actually, I just loaded into a new world with ONLY Better Animals Plus installed, killed 10 deer, and still received no drops.
Thanks for the explanation. I was wondering if `distance_error_pct` applied at search time, but I was not completely sure from the docs. Re-reading the geo_shape query documentation, I can see how the `distance_error_pct` configured in the mapping will be applied at search time as well.  > The geo_shape query uses the same grid square representation as the geo_shape mapping to find documents that have a shape that intersects with the query shape. It will also use the same PrefixTree configuration as defined for the field mapping.  Regarding the difference between using the `geohash` and `quadtree` tree implementation, I have a more specific example. If I use the default settings, I don't get the false positive with the following mapping:  I understand that this is a pretty outlandish case, but it was surprising to me that one tree implementation returns a false positive with the default precision settings while the other does not.  It seems like the behavior is indeed expected, and if I really need more accuracy for these huge MultiPoints, I can tune the parameters as you mentioned. Thanks again for the clarification.

I'm unsure how to upload the font as the file type isn't supported here, however I took pictures demonstrating the problem. The first is the order of the keybinds and the characters they're associated to, the second how the same order appears in the alphabetical order section (for some reason that includes overlapping letters), and the third an example of mismatched letters that I've found. Some characters are even connected to keys that aren't supposed to be used at all.  ![example notepad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36904084/36820897-a72d34fc-1cc6-11e8-81a5-3c22357fd386.png) ![example polyglot 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36904084/36820898-a7487d2a-1cc6-11e8-928d-989c6554edcc.png) ![example polyglot 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36904084/36820899-a782e802-1cc6-11e8-995e-4c9438343182.png) 
The PWD should in fact replace the old logic with STRING type and suffix "_PWD". But for compatibility reasons both ways would be possible for now to define passwords. I do not say any reason to treat the PWD parameter types differently on UI. So they should be editable, if the technology manager specifies them as configurable. 
@anshooarora : I checked with the SparkReporter.

Hey.  So, I don't know the project well to state facts, so here are my guesses: You could take away `@EnableRabbit` from `@RabbitListenerTest`, so `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration` is not loaded in. In order to get other beans from `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration`, the `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration` could be split up or you could redefine all beans in `RabbitListenerTestBootstrap`, so `RabbitListenerTestBootstrap` would be a full replacement for `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration`.  In that case user can use spring profiles (i.e test vs not test) to choose what bean configurations they choose.  The goal would be making the @RabbitListenerTest work with the spring boot default config spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=false.  Does that make any sense?
The URL to file (testempty.txt) is mentioned in the second post.

I found the problem was not in the test project itself. There was another project in my workspace which was causing this problem. (It took me awhile to figure out which one) As soon as I closed this project Eclemma ran flawlessly.  What is peculiar about this offending project it is a plugin project with no output directory defined in build.properties. I guess this causes the error above.  Thank you. 
@merlimat this the config for the ledger directories 
Very well what has been done suits me perfectly. Just a small detail :  https://sandbox.fr/images/uploads/original/1509398193.png  He adds one more line as soon as there are 8 or 9 slots in the first line that are occupied.
Natively.  The steps are: 1. Open a workspace.  Maybe do some work. 2. In the dashboard, close the workspace.  Often, it will not close, and you have to forcibly stop Che -- the CLI will show something like:   1. Restart Che if needed, and re-open workspace. 2. Sometimes, the issue will occur.  If not, stop the workspace again and restart it.  The issue can usually be reproduced consistently.  After I successfully reproduce the issue, simply stopping the workspace again and restarting it will fix it. 
Forge 1.9.4-12.17.0.1962 as listed in the log, but for some reason DiscordChat 1.2.1 loads fine (and isn't on Curse yet). 
It's not present anywhere in the classpath in my IDE (which is IntelliJ). To look for it just requires CMD o, and the class name. When I do that for Cookie and search down in the list, I get the com.squareup.okhttp3 jar. When I do that for JavaNetCookieJar, there's no match. It's also not anywhere in the Gradle 5.5.1 uber-jar.
  I'm also setting the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Thank you for giving me a chance to explain this more clearly, I'm genuinely bad at communicating with people.  What I was really trying to say is: I strongly believe Flyway should never ever touch the session state, _nor should migrations_, nor should other application code. Session state should be considered all set up and read-only once the application obtains some JDBC Connection instance from a DataSource.   I actually don't want Flyway to compensate for any problems caused by altered session state, `current_schema` just being a subset of that state.  If I'm not mistaken, Flyway setting `current_schema` was introduced for #1108. I disagree with its author about the part where Flyway should be responsible for reversing a session state change it didn't make.  If some migration really needs to temporarily alter session state because there's no equivalent to Postgres' `set local`, it should do so in a try...finally block.  Those documentation "ideas" otoh are probably just me trying to make the other option (=Flyway taking responsibility for session state) look bad. Sorry about that.
It had the permission for storage but not for location. It works fine now! Thanks!
I created a PR #52 for this

We're on openfire so this is obviously similar to #521... 
Hello,  I have android 9 on a Samsung A8.   I cannot open the file from normal file manager because I dont have stock android Files Manager on my Samsung.  I can copy file locally. It is when i want to open the file in streaming from the app that there is a bug.
Looks better when (almost) in sync, yes.
Boot 1.5 doesn't appear to be affected. For example, [this test](https://build.spring.io/browse/BOOT-PUB7-JOB1-1417/test/case/217332935) takes less than 1 second. That may be due to the tests being different in 1.5, I'm not sure.
Ok, that was actually hard to replicate that issue. I was able to reproduce it by having a hidden column followed by a combobox column, followed by a non-editable column. The issue seems to be that the combobox column is in "disabledColumns", but I wasn't able to figure out why it is there.  Here's a patch to the demo replicating the issue 
Apologies, that's what reporting bugs at 2am gets me.  Still have a few issues with it in 0.1.715 with Rolling Machine and Centrifuge not updating Power bar till I relog with singleplayer 
If you do a beta/preview through [releases](../releases) I can test that but I don't want to download apks from wherever.
I ended up disabling EE3 integration in ThermalExpansion /ThermalFoundation configs to get it to work. I've been running a uber-ForgeCraft-like server for over a year now (over 330 mods), so I'm not sure if you want to see the logs, it can be quite lengthy. But if you still want it I can provide it in a zip file over dropbox. Oh and thanks for the reply Pahimar! I've been watching your tutorials on modding, good stuff brother! 
Yes.  I will release a beta once it's more polished. 
I'm sorry, it was not because of the world change.  As you can see in my logs http://pastebin.com/eT2dgqkL I use "" in my title-message for _Adventuremap "The Dropper"_. It seems like that's the reason for my exception.
If it helps I've push my code to: https://bitbucket.org/karianna/betterrev - it's a Git repo so you should be able to grab a copy (let me know if not).  The code should be similar to your example except that I've used a model class called Tag (in app/models package) - the rest of the code is just std Play/code we have for our project. 
I have test it by myself,and I found the reason.When I use Spring Boot with Tomcat in my previous project,this plugin just work well. However, my current project is using Spring Boot with Undertow,It throws this exception.
Accepting files via notification works in the web UI, but the Activity pane doesn't have clickable links for the file.

No luck, `npm install` is ok but then running `node_modules\.bin\webpack.cmd --mode=development` gives  
There are no chunkloaders anywhere in the world where this happened. I have tried to produce it with just Botania, but as I mentioned, this happens very rarely.  (ATG volcano is the reason I'm that high up)

Aggregate correctly updates it's datashape now, verified.
It would straight up crash the app. Once I restarted the app, it wouldn't have saved any changes.  I can reproduce it again, if you want a crash dump.
Updated. MultiMC still displays it as .029.2 despite literally dragging 0.29.3 in. Drill breaks all the bedrock now instead of missing a corner. Still occasionally digs really slow even when spun to full speed, when otherwise it would cut through the rock like butter.
It's the other way around. I have over 4,000 documents that match that query, so I set scroll_size to 4000 so I could update them all in one request. But only 1,000 get updated at a time. I have to run the `_update_by_query` four times to get all documents updated, which is not what I expected. 
Should've probably mentioned, its on TVB, so I don't have a clue, same thing for the other issue. 
Yea sure, I can do it.. 
The shield projector was just placed, no configurations were changed in it
It does! :) 
Thanks for fixing the html("") issue.  The append issue: I was passing null and it is causing a NPE, empty string does not cause a NPE. Sorry for the confusion.  In jQuery sending null does not cause an error, however in Jerry it ends up requiring an extra "if" statement to make sure your string is not null and not cause a NPE. 
Well that's weird then. Both local, and sdn are unable to start up for myself and a few other I think. I'll click play on the script, but it simply crashes without an error on the IDE.

Sure. This my my code for testing purpose. I just realized, this might be about stack i don't know. I'm gonna try without stack.  
This happens on second screen after capturing qr code in super gluu application
It seems the code is using -1 to indicate an invalid id for all tablets with walog disabled.   When the walog is disabled, tablets get a walog id of -1. As long as the walog is disabled, define tablet events should not be written to the walog.  However I think the define tablet events are being written in some situations.

content of ".phabricator-comment" file like this  第5次构建  It means “buildable 5”. 
It opens ok. I think the problem is that there is a timing issue somewhere in that it's looking for the tiled version, tossing the error, and proceeding to tile the file. So everything is working as I would expect, but the extra (misleading) message is put into the chat.

> I thought paging had been implemented in the GL connector. :( But I see that of course you are right and it hasn't. >  > I'll also make both those properties configurable (globally) and default `all_available` to 30. Does that sound like a reasonable default?  min_access_level has precedence over all_available. As I see, the min_access_level = 30 and the all_available = false means the some for admins, but I've not tested all possible combinations.

Thank you dadoonet,  That is correct at the moment I don't have any instances running in the second zone. This is my current setup:  > zone: asia-east1-a has node1 & node2 > zone: us-central1-a doesn't have any active nodes  The problem is that when a second zone is added to the configuration file the communication between the nodes is terminated. I'm using autoscaling so depending on traffic I may need a new node on a different zone or if traffic is low the nodes in a certain zone can be shutdown leaving that zone empty 
Thank you @izeye , can't really provide a minimal project right now. In the meantime, not sure if thats related but I am still on Spring Boot 1.5 instead of 2.1.
I pulled your code in Oct 7, 2016 I think it's the lastest version 
[14:50:47] [Craft Scheduler Thread - 0/INFO]: DEBUG SMTP: need username and password for authentication [14:50:47] [Craft Scheduler Thread - 0/INFO]: DEBUG SMTP: protocolConnect returning false, host=smtp.gmail.com, user=Valik2016, password=<null>  I meant, in the debug, the username of my PC for connection is displayed. Although I specified a completely different name in the configuration. Or does it mean something else?
@oreonengine Here's the output from a run (see file).  The app runs, and you see the water and Sun, with no glitches/studders. If you didn't look at the console, you'd think everything was running fine.  Do note that there are multiple continuous errors being displayed in the log.  I ended up manually closing the app to get the console output to stop rolling along.  I opened this ticket just on the first error outputted to the console, and not for any follow-up errors output.  My OS is Ubuntu Budgie 18.04.1 LTS (64-bit), using Gnome 3.28.2.  Processor is Intel Core i7 CPU 980 @ 3.33GHz x 12, with 24GB RAM.  I'm using a GigaBytte GeForce GTX 1050 OC Edition, with 2GB GDDR5 (PCIe/SSE2).  Its a DirectX 12 ready card, and is six months old.

I didn't use the SSH URL, I use the https way Clone repository, I can do it on the computer like Clone.  ![screenshot_20181019-101109](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38396747/47194036-5d5a1d80-d388-11e8-86f8-e58a6068d64a.png)  ![screenshot_20181019-101116](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38396747/47193936-ee7cc480-d387-11e8-9ad9-686134e18bb9.png)  Even if I don't check "Clone recursively", the same error will occur.
 
I just tried 2.4.6 and it does work.  Thank you for your time 
Yes, I still get bug reports on this one. Look at the stack trace on first post. It is a IllegalStateException. 
Asked him via twitter, can check the spreadsheet, atm I always get servers are busy...  Edit I can log into G-Spreadsheet but can't open the sheet anymore... "Servers are busy" 
Yeah, it's working in my real project. Thank you!
talking with team mate who has 4k monitor:  - the size of the window is ok - the font size is ok, but the text of the song looks blurred. - icon size is ok.
Sure, it was late yesterday.  Here is a minimal example:  This snippet works. But when the cube/monkey is loaded first the program crashes, due to looking for the animations in the previously loaded model's data. When I encountered it yesterday it even successfully loaded the data and produced wrong animations.  With debugging it can be observed starting [here](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/blob/master/jme3-plugins/src/gltf/java/com/jme3/scene/plugins/gltf/GltfLoader.java#L785).  Here are the models: [resources.zip](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/files/2740333/resources.zip) The cube is just a cube. The monkey is Suzanne with 2 times subdivision applied. And the sway animation is a 2 bone armature affecting a cube. The models/animations were created in the latest Blender 2.80 beta version.  Also the error is on the current master branch. I don't know about v3.2.x.
I'm using 6.0.1, Sony stock, no root, bootloader locked. I place a dish, press the home button, then tap on the app's icon in my launcher, and the dish just disappeares (Now I don't get the message about the same cat showing up, it just disappeares).

Yes. I also did that Integrity check in the Config, still not working. 
I never compiled a apk myself, I only tested with openkeychain from f-droid.org. I would have to build a environment about that and read how to do it.

@tolusha what's the latest status? Is there someone who can provide the code review so we can get this merged? 
@jasontedor Thanks for looking into it.   Do you mean that you were able to repro the issue when you dockerized ES 5.0.1, but if you execute the same thing on host (no container), you can't repro?  Following is the dockerfile content that matters for 5.0.1   
So it's the start of a new day and I can see the button on the PR now.   Not sure what I did differently.  The network connectivity is a good thought.  I will investigate and get back to you.   I am getting a 403 error code pop up (see below).   This implies that the 403 is being sent from pasteb.in   or if this plugin is hitting a bitbucket API and bitbucket is returning that.   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/723989/23463547/27caddf4-fe4f-11e6-86cb-3fde75f1256c.png)  I can't find anything of interest in the developer tab within chrome.  
I can use the gui to move around in different directories, if that's what you mean. But no files ever appear available for selection. I just checked now if this were some difficulty with Windows' bizarre access-control lists, but it seems not.  But this is only for "Open". I was able to use "Compare" to compare two disk images.

I just tried creating a new game with the same modules active (all that potions is dependent on) and i was unable to reproduce it as well. I think it is safe to close this issue since it was most likely a local issue with that specific save. I'll keep an eye out for it occurring again when i use the game later tonight.

I created the patch on the sources from the 1.5.4 src package, don't know which commit/branch this exactly relates to. 
I'm uploading the video recording. I'll post it in a few moments. 
/res {name} /town {name} Both in the name of a city and in the list of residents When you walk in a user's plot with _ /plot perm  I imagine that in the menus of nations it also happens but I don't use nations.

Unfortunately the same thing happens with versions 1.1  and 1.2 of JavaCV and JavaCpp .Is working correctly on version 1.0 and Windows 7 . In the rest of cases is not finding at runtime the proper class. 
Hi Team,  There some issue in my local repository and we have resolved issue, now ti's working fine   -Thanks & Regards Satling 
Yes, that sounds good. Do you want to send a PR?

Great! I have just been using the .jar to add this to my app. Any chance you could put a private drop up on dropbox and pass along the link? 
I'm pretty sure it's 1.3.0.RC1 because other bugs from the previous milestone are gone and the Spring Boot badge on startup displays 1.3.0.RC1 :)  Have you already committed any changes related to this issue? As soon as you have I'll test. 
Hi No, you missunderstood my version statement. I have tested different versions of the OSM-DROID library to find out when the bug has been introduced. The NPE has nothing to do with the IDE version, since it is caused by dereferencing an null variable inside MapView.  I have not tested with different API levels, but I can not imagine that this is the reason. 
ES - 0.90.10 and Jira River 1.41 According to the Docs: This should work, but it does not. Your example above has no underscores.  "http://elastictoad:9200/_river/jira_river_opi/_mgm_jr/state" 
Currently working with a dev build. I am accessing the Url without  proxying. (If I am proxying there is no problem with the API).  I think Callback is never through proxy right?  My Java Version is 1.8
My game actually started up just fine. I crash upon entering my world. I will try your suggestion and report back  Edit: Did not work, I deleted the config and map files and even started a new test world 
@tdurieux   I have added the library, which provides the the class `com.lmax.disruptor.dsl.Disrupter` to the classpath.   Actually, I have resolved this issue by providing the source code of library `com.lmax.disruptor.dsl.Disrupter` instead of the jar file.  Although I do not know what's the differences, it resolves this issue for now :-)  Thanks very much!
yes
I see, I will try. For my curiosity what are the benefit of this change? Is that something I should do for my app as well?
Its most likely some kind of firewall, however I wouldnt know what plugin would cause it. I've gone trough the plugin list and asked to disable all the ones that I tought might change something about placing blocks but didnt come up with annything.
Same :    `project_branches` table is still empty of PR branches. Only the master branch is present. I tried to delete and make a full analysis but it still failed.
None so far.

This is my mysql version Roco mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.22-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2
@AlexejK I don't know what you mean exactly with refresh, but if I synchronize the project, the problem remains 
I tested it too, the problem still exists.
I do, but it's completely empty. No text whatsoever. 
Yes, I assume issue #26 in your Gradle plugin has the same root cause as issue #16 in your Maven plugin since they are both caused by a javax.naming.NoInitialContextException with the same exception reason. I may be wrong though. In any case issue #16 is still relevant for your Maven plugin.

My fault totally. I didn't read the instructions of how to use the plugin. It turned out that I didn't have Java installed on my computer. After installing Java everything seem to work great!

> > Not sure, but it looks like the FileUtil is not getting the pull path and only the sensor >  > Yep, `LinuxSensors.java` line 66 does `FileUtil.getIntFromFile(f.getName())` but it needs to be the full path/name of the file on that line. Can you test this fix and possibly submit a PR?  I can verify (with unit tests) that changing the check `&& FileUtil.getIntFromFile(f.getName()) > 0;` at line 66 to `&& FileUtil.getIntFromFile(f.getAbsolutePath()) > 0;`  fixes the issue.   I changed to unit test SensorsTest to verify the value is greater then 0 in stead of >=: `assertTrue(s.getCpuTemperature() > 0d && s.getCpuTemperature() <= 100d);`

Appreciate the quick review and response
Doomgull— in case you haven’t already checked, I’ll check myself now.
I just did, it throws the same error. In DynamoDB table they look like integers to me (simply 123 and 456), but I'm not sure how to check the actual type. By looking at the table it only says "Number" as type. Example: `nested_number Number: 456`
I've got it capturing now.  Sadly it wasn't in debug mode when that happened, but I did turn it on before I did the force stop, so once it recurs I'll post it here.
@debuc see https://github.com/nextcloud/android/commit/da060314fa63a5e2d05a5dd5f7ad621b75308f25 which provides the fix (sorry for fixing it myself), issue was that the if-block never turned true for svg files since svg is stores in the drawable variable
Using latest build 172. Like with 156, the LEVEROFF (and other block changing executors) doesn't work when fired from a named trigger. I can 100% confirm there is a lever there, I have discovered the error is other. The code inside the try gets to the end and fails in the last statement, the BlockState.update(true);   #### Code inside try-catch    It looks like the plugin is trying to change the world asynchronously and obviously bukkit api dones't allow that. It's weird this happens in a named trigger but dones't in a temp trigger.
I have created a PR
I tested with device and simulator, iOS 9 and iOS 10, Xcode beta and stable and it's always the same wrong line numbers.  My class looks as simple as this:    I'm using the latest stable IntelliJ IDEA plugin. I created an iOS device run configuration.  I really can't explain why it works for you @florianf, while it fails for me. I'm not using retro lambda for this project (I just created the default project with the wizard in idea).  @florianf Do you maybe have some local uncomitted changes that prevent the problem from happening?

Usually the TPS is 17-20. The /ta toggle debug command will log information to a file, right?
Yes, here's the situation, I have a timeline, which has multiple songs and with empty gaps between them, these gaps can be at the start and end as well. for that, I use ConcatenatingMediaSoruce with ClippingMediaSource for songs and SilenceMediaSource for gaps. Here's a representation of a simple timeline:  **-song-song-song-** **-**: SilenceMediaSource **song**: ClippingMediaSource with ProgressiveMediaSource  The issue is when readData happens, the byteRemaining is a negative value which shouldn't be the case, here's a debug screenshot up until the hightlighted line that produces the error: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10184170/61947147-bc4a6400-afa4-11e9-84f8-b4ef567cf3d5.png)  This issue is that everytime I recreate the ConcatenatingMediaSoruce, even with the same values, with the same SilenceMediaSource durations and start positions for SilenceMediaSource and ClippingMediaSource. I sometimes get the error and sometime not. I tested with fixed constant values and recreated the ConcatenatingMediaSoruce again and again, it's like a hit and miss, works a couple of times, then error, then works again, then error again...  I'm sorry as it's hard to explain because I ran a couple of tests already and I can't seem to track down the exact source of the issue.   
> Can you please provide something more complete than a heavily clipped screenshot? That doesn't look like a stack overflow to me. It looks like some number of recursive calls to `read`, which exit fine into `RandomAccessFile`.  start from RandomAccessFile, and then many number of recursive calls to read.

Release early, release often ;) - I found a workaround,  so it is not that critical. But feel free to push a release when you see fit containing the fix 
Because I wanted to move it.

Sure! 
No, it did not resolve the issue. I'll contact Slack support see what they have to say. Maybe they have a test account you can use. 
Yes, in this case it definitely was that action which seemed to trigger this.
@ptrthomas Thanks! it is working fine 👍
> Either baritone or impact should be installed as a forge mod, not both. When you say "both crash" does that mean that they crash when both are installed, or each one individually crashes? Also please include your version of forge.  I tested out both seperately, i never launched forge with both of them in my mods folder. I use 1.12.2-forge1.12.2-14.23.5.2768
I copied the style and changed `<item name="legendVisible">false</item>` to true. Now the graph is taking up the whole view, but it's clipping the edges off, and the legend isn't being rendered.  Screenshot was taken on a Samsung S7 Edge.,
I mean, provided the following two statements: - A: there exists a polygon's vertex which is inside the view frustum - B: the polygon is visible  then the following holds: A -> B while the reverse _is not!_ true: B -> A  (this is a _false_ implication)  Or in other words: A polygon can still be visible _even if no vertex is inside the frustum_, because the frustum cuts one or more faces of the polygon, while at the same time not containing a vertex of it! 
Hi Alex  I just updated to the latest version (7.99.17), but I still get the same behaviour of the quarry.  Attached is a screenshot about a "crazy" quarry.

I don't quite understand the parsing code and it seems to fail not even in the docker code. So I guess the first question would be if the reply from the daemon is ok or not and why the parser does not like that. In a JSON validator I did not get an error. I assume one should be able to reproduce this by changing https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java/blob/master/src/test/resources/samples/1.22/info/1.json. Looks like one might be able to just add the "some.host-name" part from above. 
+1 for the clean interface.  No, I don't think there are plans for to have redirects in JSON dumps. In these dumps redirects seem to be resolved in statements serializations so there are no need to have them if you just work on one dump. 
I have the same ones in the quick start except 1 line in on destroy to mute some ringtone I am still not able to get the crash report though :/  @Override protected  void onResume() {     super.onResume();     /*      * If the local video track was removed when the app was put in the background, add it back.      */     if (localMedia != null && localVideoTrack == null) {         localVideoTrack = localMedia.addVideoTrack(true, cameraCapturer);         localVideoTrack.addRenderer(localVideoView);     } }  @Override protected void onPause() {     /*      * Remove the local video track before going in the background. This ensures that the      * camera can be used by other applications while this app is in the background.      *      * If this local video track is being shared in a Room, participants will be notified      * that the track has been removed.      */     if (localMedia != null && localVideoTrack != null) {         localMedia.removeVideoTrack(localVideoTrack);         localVideoTrack = null;     }     super.onPause(); }  @Override protected void onDestroy() {     /*      * Always disconnect from the room before leaving the Activity to      * ensure any memory allocated to the Room resource is freed.      */     if (room != null && room.getState() != RoomState.DISCONNECTED) {         room.disconnect();         disconnectedFromOnDestroy = true;     }      /*      * Release the local media ensuring any memory allocated to audio or video is freed.      */     if (localMedia != null) {         localMedia.release();         localMedia = null;     }     mPlayer.stop();     super.onDestroy(); }   On Wed, Feb 22, 2017 at 4:09 PM, Aaron Alaniz <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Thanks for clarifying the scenario.

Everything works perfectly in single player. I figured, well mcpc+ has updated a few times, there had been no mention of any enderio related fixes but, let's try it out anyways.  I placed a long run of cable (fifteen or more blocks), attached everything exactly as I had in my original picture and sure enough, it is working.   I am now using version 0.5.0.98 of EnderIO with version 4.2.1 of Buildcraft on mcpc+ version 160.   Here's a picture of it up and running: http://i.imgur.com/8BkxLnW.png  Thank you for getting back to me, I'm sorry I can't give you anything more concrete then "poof, it's working now". I've gotten used to things breaking and, subsequently fixing. It comes with the territory, running one hundred and sixty four mods together. MCPC+ of course, has always been a bit wonky.  
It only happens when you Shift Click and Drag the mouse, and it's 100% Reliable. Lemme grab those logs for you.
I don't have any error on google-drive-ftp-adapter console. It appears only in mc. ![screenshot from 2018-11-02 23-43-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17502570/47939711-4f180f80-def9-11e8-9444-11139b13e0ff.png) 
OK, here is a screnshot. I will upload my active PQs later this day. What I noticed when I made the screenshot is that this only happen on the livemap! When I open the livemap the half of the caches will not be shown beginning from a special zoom level. When I open a list and open the map over the menu all caches will be displayd, even when it are more than on the livemap.   ![screenshot_2013-08-29-11-11-39](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2893036/1048631/d7fa544a-108f-11e3-86f0-e8328039bf98.png) 
I didn't Force Close them, and neither app has a specific "exit" function, so both apps are probably "running" in some way in the background, but I'm not interacting with them at all. I assume the apps run until/unless the phone is running low on available resources (which isn't likely to happen on the Note9).
So I would login, then fetch the cookie (so that on subsequent WebDriver instances) I can reload the Cookie and skip authentication.  ChromeDriver & FireFox driver seemed to take the cookie below fine however for JBrowserDriver I had to send only `name` and `value`. Small discrepancy but just making an issue for any disparity I find while I use the library (which btw I'm very glad exists). If its not a big deal or correct to the spec feel free to close.   
Exactly !  I have about 5 minutes  and I see that all containers are started.  I get two messages the first is **502 Bad Gateway**  and the second is  **Cannot GET /(.*)**

@aguatno   We have about 10 modules in our solution (it is quite large), but the dependencies of concern I think are below. Thanks!  
How can we change to older OpenCV version?  EDIT: I switch to javacv ver 0.8 and it still crashes. 
Hello :)  I didn't solve the issue, but figured out the problem was also occuring with the Java examples. I tried on another PC, and looks like the combo: latest Java version + latest IntelliJ version with Quarkus 1.1.1.Final leads to tests failing in IntelliJ (but not in Maven).  Since it's apparently not related to Kotlin, I thought I'd close the issue to avoid misleading report.
Ah, I see. Does it really look that asymmetrical to have it on the top left? I guess we can leave it for the time being, and change in the future if users complain. Maybe it is just me who always accidentally rotates maps. :)
No, because of the rules I just added above.  
The version of Rstudio is the one from the main desktop download section linked here:  https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/opensuse15/x86_64/rstudio-1.2.5001-x86_64.rpm   I believe it is 1.2.5001;  The error on executing   What's particularly wild is, if at the error prompt, if I choose to ignore dependencies and install anyways, RStudio launches and seems to work - the main problem any time I subsequently do a `zypper dup` command, it flags RStudio as broken and wants to remove it.    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56571941/66978164-fee08180-f065-11e9-98e1-9b0a99318bcc.png)  >  Does this happen on the latest RStudio preview? Yes, preview has the exact same issue.   
Short answer: yes.  Here is an abridged version of the template.  I probably should have mentioned that we have disabled _source for this index, also.   
It breaks so easily for me... how can you not reproduce this? Maybe it's windows LR stuff Anyways, I will provide you the exact steps: 1. Go to Collider.wurst in the StandardLib with folding imports enabled. Should look like this:   1. Add another newline after `import Fx` by pressing enter 2. Add a newline after after `import LinkedList` by pressing Enter at the end of it 3. Fold the imports - **the newline we added in the previous step is being folded, even though it should not**. 4. Place the cursor in front of the 9th line `constant real DEFAULT_COLLISION_SIZE` and press Enter, creating a newline between the imports and the constant 5. Remove the 2 empty lines between `import Fx` and `import TimedLoop` 6. Fold the imports. **It will automatically unfold again and you will be presented with something similar to the screenshot**  ![](http://i.imgur.com/Kqh7KSB.png)  As mentioned before, this is just one way to make this happen. Sometimes blank lines are being eaten, and suddenly re-appear. The 2-dot boxes appear at wrong places and multiple times. 
@ddementieva :  I didnt do any changes ,it automatically get started 
For example, I want to watch a part of video that is 8 minutes long. The problem is I don't want to watch the full video, but I would like to start watching from 5 minutes in. In 1080 mode I am able to scroll through the video and start watching 5 minutes into it. With 4k mode, I am unable to do that. It only allows me to watch the video from the location (time) that I am currently at which means I am forced to watch the full 8 minutes of that video. 
Just tested the EA version and it works flawlessly now (using the JDBC driver provided by DBeaver). Thank you for the fast support. 
Thanks @jimczi. I was confused, nothing to see here. :)
Works now!  Perfect thanks!

> Which permission plugin are you using?  Aquatic Perms 1.0  It's a permissions plugin that allows the user to give permissions to any player. I only use this server as a private server to play with my friends. Previously I had no permissions plugin but I added this one since I started having this problem.   Commands: /perm add <User|*> <Node> -- Add a permission to a user or everyone (*) /perm remove <User|*> <Node> -- Remove a permission from a user or everyone (*) /perm test <User|*> <Node> -- Test if someone has a permission /perm list <User|*> -- List someone's permissions  I don't know what the "permission nodes" for MarrigaeMaster are. 
my k8s runs on baremetal in our lab. loadbalancer is metallb with externalDNS automate the dns entry creation.  I used the helm installed it.
No we can not do that (at least not so easy). But cant we catch illegal characters ? 
Yes, other symptom of the same root cause. 
I'm using the modern RStudio theme, the Ubuntu Mono font, and the Vibrant Ink editor theme. For code editing and display, I have the soft-wrap enabled, a line margin at 80 characters shown, indent guides shown, and no scrolling past the end of the document. I'm not sure what other config option could be set. Is there a way to export my configuration and send it to you?
Yes it does! I just tested it with a new Server: _Minecraft: 1.8.9 SpongeAPI: 4.2.0-SNAPSHOT-79f9c8e SpongeVanilla: 1.8.9-4.2.0-BETA-348_  Should i close it here then and create a new issue it in the Common Repo?

hey @edmundoa, I sent you the dump over email. Looking forward for a fix, upgrading production is on hold because of this. Thank you!
@ozlerhakan thanks for your quickly answer! Really. I can't test right now. I will try Monday and I come back to give you a feedback. Thanks again.
The Error continues after running the following fsck command `tsdb fsck --fix '1d-ago' avg os.disk.fs.space_free --zkquorum=ny-devtsdb01`. The output of that command, and full error are provided below.  "What tool did you use to get that data?" Q&D Script I wrote: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/opentsdb/pEGdApyJbPE   
I was thinking the same thing. I can get a list tomorrow, but I have a feeling the only one that might be causing issues would be 'pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket'. I will try disabling it and see if I can get the triggers working.  I am mainly using that plugin until I get the PR Triggers working and I can filter PR Triggers on to/from branches. :P  Thanks for all the help!
It still crashes after clicking play.  Log: https://gist.github.com/kentrockman/d02afb311b14c387f7c5 
Here is the video of it working, it seems like it is an issue that only crops up just after install. Now (as you can see in the video it DOES update itself on the apt-get-update-periodic task.  https://erayan.com/shared/2016-02-08_17-53-33.mp4  So it seems something is off with the timing on time of install.

Hi,  My use case is this:  1. start request 2. get db connection 3. do some work 4. log something to db on an auxiliary thread, with it's own connection 5. close db connection from 2 6. finish request & log that an auxiliary thread is still running & the db connection from 4 is not closed  The issue is that the db connection will, eventually, get closed when the auxiliary thread ends . My proposed solution is to simply not track connections from auxiliary threads. An option to completely disable db connection leaks would also be fine
  That is the code that registers the custom data. It persists fine even after a restart. It's just not rolled back from the block snapshot.  It appears to me that the problem is not on my code, but on the code that does the snapshot rollback.
My controller: (if "test2" method will be removed, data model for for "test1" is absent)   
I'll look for the logs tomorrow. Not sure if still available or if I have to wait for it to happen again.  Unfortunately I don't have a way to force it to happen. It's just from time when log amount is raised unexpectedly.
Thanks. We are not migrating to `not`, we are migrating to Elasticsearch 2.3.5 and the `not` filter is already used in a legacy application. Sure, it will be necessary to replace the `not` filter eventually, but we would prefer to not have to do it now when we are still on version 1.7.5. 
Oh sh*t -_-. I'm sorry ...  So, why does the logs show a default persistence unit: `Building JPA container EntityManagerFactory for persistence unit 'default'`  Why don't we have `ordersDs` or `customerDs` depending on the EntityManager we are working with ?
i just found out you can bypass the problem by adding commandline to bazel: >--python_path="c:/bazel/Python3/python.exe"  so apparently the default (>where python) doesnt work
  The problem is when no form-data was sent.   But that's the case my use-case, the form-data is optional.
@zmk4: the configurations were: OnePlus 3 <-> Samsung Galaxy J7, OnePlus 3 <-> Asus R556, Arch Linux @DatBewar here you are [linphone.txt.gz](https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-android/files/774188/linphone.txt.gz) 
Sorry 👍 
I didnt' find much either. Here's a start: https://developer.sony.com/?s=com.sony.mobile.permission.SYSTEM_UI_VISIBILITY_EX My experience with Sony is that they have no developer support whatsoever, no documentation, nothing. Sorry can't be of much help here. My guess is it has something to do with the window features (as in activity.requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE) etc.). 
I'll have to get back to you on the screenshot, but the repo I use is https://github.com/apereo/cas 
In my case, the item does not exist before the transaction. 
The shift-rightclick issue only seems to be happening with the Copper, Iron and Silver variant. Gold, Diamond and Obsidian works for me.  The items not dropping was a mistake of mine. They drop just fine. Sorry.

Good, I just tried on the 1.1.1 version of bootfaces and it also happens. In effect it is a label that primefaces uses to display the text in responsive mode of the table column, when using a <p: commandButton ... with title, that title is the one that primefaces uses as text from the header of the Column, in case it can help. Thank you very much
@ketan the following is what would be nice to have if we enable debug logs  1. Start and end time messages for the backup 2. Start and end time for different parts (config,DB etc.) 3. If there could be a bit more granular logging that would be great. 
Sigh.. please lol. Im not joking.
If excluded, all worked fine. It’s problem in asm, because this library has restriction  UTF8 length like 65535 
@wenweihu86  ok   i will provide a pull request later
When I run the test buttons everything is fine btw. 
I have version 1.8 and it appears my ROM is headered as its at 4097 even tough its fresh out of the RAR folder and japanese. Should I go get another one or can I just patch it to be unheadered with something like LunarIPS Edit I'm off to find a new one, sorry I'm not great with understanding how technology works. I'll have to draw you something for taking this much of your time as an apology. 
There seems to be the same problem in all other bin\*.bat scripts too:   
hello ! i find that the problem was in the system Windows 10 ! i put the same program in Ubuntu and it's run well :)  
Thanks for your help. Maybe bug https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/issues/258 prevents me from getting a stack trace. Confirmed if I use Guava 21.0, then this problem disappears.
Sure, here are some screenshots of a minimal setup I created in a single player world.  The mechanical user is set to Redstone On, Activate Block With Item, Right Click, Upper Left Slot Only.

BetterBeginnings config file? (I never touched it) Here: [betterbeginnings.cfg.txt](https://github.com/einsteinsci/betterbeginnings/files/42257/betterbeginnings.cfg.txt)  It is working fine if I use the 1.7.10 version with MC 1.7.10. 
This is so I can use meld rather than the default diff tool when using perforce. Here is the full excerpt from my .bashrc. I was missing some single quotes in the command I sent through.   
Thanks for your reply. I found the linux-arm.properties in the javacpp but not in the javacpp-present.  
No, I need to delete this folder by hand regularly once or twice a year so that my phone don't stop working because of full storage. The folder gets so large every time again and contains much data of caches I deleted long time before. Last time I did this was at the 17.8.2016.  I know that the folder is not empty with much caches in database but it should be with an empty database. For people who plan a lot of tours outside their homezone its getting bigger and bigger in the moment. 
Through the configuration I believe.   https://github.com/belathus/Wanderlust-Renewed/blob/master/config/evilcraft.cfg  <blockquote><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3826783?s=400&v=4" width="48" align="right"><div><img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/favicon.ico" height="14"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href="https://github.com/belathus/Wanderlust-Renewed">belathus/Wanderlust-Renewed</a></strong></div><div>Wanderlust-Renewed - Minecraft 1.12.2 Modpack focused on exploration</div></blockquote>
I just did.. What should I elaborate? 
I'm not aware of any app, I thought this was out of the box? 
First: http://s1308.hizliresim.com/1d/4/r43fx.png I put them. every thing seems normal: http://o1308.hizliresim.com/1d/4/r43h7.png I flip the lever. And it put water in the tank. water inside of tank dissapeard and TD started hitting tank with bucket Sometimes it doesnt start hitting immediately after placing tank. Sometimes after flipping lever couple more times or after replacing the tank. : http://s1308.hizliresim.com/1d/4/r43gm.png Here opening gui: http://s1308.hizliresim.com/1d/4/r43mq.png   Sometimes it puts water and water disappears in tank  More interesting thing after breaking tank, it seems its not here but you cant pass through. and It is so weird. : http://s1308.hizliresim.com/1d/4/r43v6.png  It is acting weird I tested maybe 10 times but I couldnt find a solid reason about what causing this. 
Just confirmed this to still persist in ID 1.12.2-1.0.16.

Only other mod I have at this time that may cause an issue is ExtraUtilities2. I agree with your diagnosis on Psymatics' thread:  > Seems to be some sort of race condition where Minecraft starts to empty the tank before it finished filling it. Not sure there is anything we can do as there is no place in the code to catch this crash, the stack is never null on the line its crashing.   As far as I'm aware all my mods are up to date. I'm just going with a different setup using multiple Smeltery Drains each with its own output table. This seems to solve the issue as they're drawing directly from the Smeltery and not an external reservoir. 
1.First use, Mono-Directional Connector works fine ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35490649/75598116-758d9100-5ad4-11ea-9b2d-dc95756a73aa.png) 2.When I uninstalled and installed the Mono-Directional Connector, it didn't work properly. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35490649/75598227-2005b400-5ad5-11ea-9362-81c1f1c0ff80.png)  In my understanding, as long as two Mono-Directional Connectors are facing each other, it should work.
Sorry for the delay. [kp2a-logcat.txt](https://github.com/PhilippC/keepass2android/files/1377221/kp2a-logcat.txt)  If you need further info, let me know and I'll grab you a tombstone. Just didn't want to hand you one without request because I'd need to go in and clear out any personal info from it.

We upgraded to oxalis 4.1.0. We first tried with oxalis-as4 4.1.0 as that was what we had used earlier this month when testing, but after that failed we tried upgrading to oxalis-as4 4.1.1 but with no luck.

Hi Nick, I get this with any dataset we've tried; different base layer, different POI data, even no POI data present at all but a couple of forms/points already surveyed. But for example, try https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx3_hrMYdNwLY3VGaXZrOVRwUDQ 
nice ! 
I have checked, this change resolves this issue.

Another possibility might be to permanently show a "notes-pane" on the right side of the screen (as seen in e.g. ToDoList application). On this side pane the notes of the currently selected item would be displayed.  But as a quick solution a WRAPLENGHT of maybe 80 characters would do the job nicely, if the wrap would occur between words and not characters.

The last time The area didnt show any thing but the selected area ( don't know how about the unloaded area its far away from my base ) but if you add a area on the PC it creates a standard area like x1=1 y1=1 z1=1 and x2=2 y2=2 z2=2 And suddenly my drones teleported into a cave to going attack mobs 
Sorry for not responding sooner, the bug seems to have been fixed in the latest release. 
It fixes it. And yes there was a trailing line.  Thank you very much !  Out of curiosity, how did you get that:  
Greenify tells you what app has launched or woken Facebook from sleep if you have the pro version> its dead on accurate as well. I can force close Facebook, verify it is not running. Open the chive, and Greenify tells me that the chive has opened Facebook in the Greenify hibernation manager.

I'm using the [apt plugin](https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-apt-plugin) to do annotation processing in Gradle, and it automatically sets it up in the imported Eclipse project. I use Buildship to import the Gradle project as an Eclipse project.  So the short answer is, yes, I'm doing annotation processing in Eclipse.  Here are the relevant gradle config files.  #### Root `build.gradle`:

Can't reproduce it now either.

Hi,  Thanks for the answer.  it's MySQL 5.1  More information :     Table: oc_ocsms_smsdatas    sms_date  -->  bigint(20)  EDIT : I have try to change the value of one row: replace '2147483647' by '21474836479999' and the update works correctly. 
Ah okay.

I used vaddin-chart-1.1.9 and vaddin version is 7.6.5.You  also can reproduce in newest version. you should create a chart and use  containerDataSeries set visible false.

Yup: 
It looks as if the problem comes from a missing port in the defaultZone configuration. This was my configuration :     I have a repro project here : https://github.com/snussbaumer/spring-cloud-netflix-issue-840  Without the port, the url is changed to http://172.17.0.2:-1/eureka, and later in `ApacheHttpClient4Handler.getHost` : request.getURI().getHost() returns null, it looks as if there is some parsing error somewhere, because the URI host is null, but the authority is OK and contains "172.17.0.2:-1"  I have a workaround, so I'm allright now, but I think if would be nice if this was corrected or documented somewhere. 
Hello,  I am using latest version, v1.2. When I use the commands it works fine and I get connected, I tried an over the air deployment and it succeeded. But once I disconnect and I am connected via USB again, if I click on your plugin button I get the very same exception 
> Found a fix. I'm leaving the link for anyone with the same issue: [#5854](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/5854)  Yes. Sorry! I should have left it here so that other people can see.
I have tried to debug the using 'mvn wisdom:run -Ddebug=5005'. And in fact in some cases, the resource given to ok() is null. That's why in consequence getMimeTypeForFile() receives null. Perhaps this could be protected. 
> Can you elaborate a bit more on how you're using pods there?  Oh,emmm I  think this is a network problem .Tried for many times and success installed。
i thought i pasted pastebin link here.. wait lol
I debugged the code. No matter if I write `write*` or `write+`, the state machines are the same and match the pattern `write+` and not `write*`, see output below 
@rentalhost It was happening in *all* my code yesterday. But today.... I tried lots of files and I did not came across the error again. So: not sure what happend yesterday (I did restart my IDE but that had no effect).  Ah well let's blame Windows :)  Thanks for this amazing plugin and I will update this if I see the error again.
If the jar file is smaller, it probably doesn't contain the compiled Java code for DNA, only the pre-compiled libraries that are packaged along with DNA, like jdom etc.  The `--release` argument was introduced in JDK 9. Is it possible to specify (install?) `openjdk-9-jdk`, `openjdk-10-jdk`, or `openjdk-11-jdk`? They are all backward-compatible and can compile Java 8 code.  We need Java 8: On the one hand, if we compile with JDK 7, some code will not work because we use language features that were introduced with Java 8. On the other hand, if we don't provide compatibility with Java 8 and instead let it compile with a higher version, many users will not be able to use DNA because they have Java 8 installed. So the ideal solution would be to get JDK 9, 10, or 11 to work on Travis.
It was placed on its own, you have right it effects all parts, terminals, fiber etc. 
Sorry, I forgot. Yes, that is with all commands. After restarting, I can run both commands again. Although he should still have cooldown.  command-cooldowns:   skull: 604800   signup: 604800

Hi,  The three ways of executing the script: - `sh gama-headless.sh samples/predatorPrey.xml samples/predatorPrey` - `bash gama-headless.sh samples/predatorPrey.xml samples/predatorPrey` - `./gama-headless.sh samples/predatorPrey.xml samples/predatorPrey` (with a `chmod u+x gama-headless.sh` previously)   provide the same error:    I can notice that this is perfectly normal, given the organization of files that is different in release and in the Git code source.  Given that, I think that in fact, this is not an issue as I have the feeling that this file is not expected to be executed in Git source code version of GAMA...
I raised it with @luigidellaquila but I haven't got any update on it unfortunately.  @luigidellaquila, do we have a timeline for it?

Yes...possible. But need to do the automation.
@machi1990  I tried to create a simple reproducer app, but I am unable to. My project is a multi module project, with one module containing service classes, and the other contains the quarkus plugin.  I am however able to reproduce this error locally (on Windows 10) with the same app. I am running "mvn clean install -X"  
No, but deleted one group of tasks and it works now, after restart.
Now every flow starts and looks as new integration - probably intended change. If so, we can close this one.
Well, I know the module [Data::Printer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Printer), that might can be useful for this purpose, like it is shown in [this article](https://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2011/11/use-dataprinter-to-debug-data-structures/)
just copy-paste the following code to the ide   
Many thanks for fixing it! Currently I have a work around in place so a new release is not urgent at all. 
Thanks for your quick reply. I'm far behind with my project and can't take the time for installing and reinstalling. Can this be installed additional to the normal IDE or do I need to replace it? 
I must not have gotten the full mod pack because irises are non-existent in my game 
One node crashed on 2/21 at ~11am, we had to restart it as you can se in the free memory increase at that time. I checked the logs of that node.. as you can see at 10:17am the node stops, some minutes later i restarted it by hand (10:22)   Unfortunately we do not have any more recent logs with OOM exceptions in it. 
It is fixed, thanks :-)
Thanks for looking into this. The build command for tools even fails for me when I built the whole project before.   I run Maven 3.3.9, installed via apt on Ubuntu 16.04. I tried this on multiple machines with the same setup, it fails on all machines.
Yes, Thanks for reminding.
Friendly ping. Is any initial diagnosis available?
I am not explicitly using a GString anywhere. Apparently in newer versions of Gradle, when referencing a property you get a GString instead of a String. The `${something.version}` property is a regular property defined in my `gradle.properties` file.
Sure. But ill come back with the timings in few days. I'm moving at the moment.  []'s

Almost fixed. I think we got the Core version tweaks done and may have rebuilt enough to fix TTA, although the last stable release binary will still be broken. If I can get the remaining modules built today and a binary confirmed as good I can do a quick checkpoint stable then close this :-) 
It also happens at 100% zoom in my Chrome/Win7. The 23px height fix in coref.css works for single underscores – maybe we should try to find some solution to automatically set table height by max number of nested underscores, or change the markup strategy completely?

I cannot authenticate without first injecting my own constructed `Authentication` header that matches what I usually use with curl. 
Yes thay have. 
The stack is fine (at least it appears to be fine), but the sample application `aspnet-web-simple` doesn't pull in any code and the project type is blank instead of C#. I've added a screenshot and updated the issue description to try and be more clear.    
I've sent them to the RoboVM email. Thanks. 
This one works ok. Thanks for the help. So `pod-annotations` is wrong 
I have both; it's not sorted by the current saturation or the old saturation, it's straight up alphabetical. I'm guessing that's a fail-over mode?

@jelovirt well, it seems the client package is built WITHOUT XEP support anyway.  There's something wrong here in both cases: either the doc should mention you can't use XEP with the default client distribution, and redirect to how to build the dita-ot from source for XEP, which actually does not exist, or ship a pre-bundled fo.jar with XEP classes within the client distribution.  In any case, let me know if I can write something up about that. 
@TylerJewell This was the first time I run the Eclipse Che installer. I do have Docker Toolbox 1.10 previously installed. For that reason also tried to use a brand new Win 8.1 VM and the result was similar. 1. What is the value of %userprofile%?    R1: echo %userprofile% - C:\Users\duartda 2. What is in the %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Eclipse Che\ directory?    R2: C:\Users\duartda\AppData\Local\Eclipse Che\    @eivantsov The versions are the ones provided by the windows installer. Che was launched using the .bat file in the bin directory.  **Workstation 1** Docker: Docker version 1.10.0, build 590d5108  VirtualBox: Version 5.0.14 r105127  **Workstation 2** Docker: Docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5 VirtualBox: Version 5.0.12 r104815  Workstation 1 is running on the European Commission network, that has a seriously restricted proxy policy, don't know if the problem could be from that. But I also tested on Workstation 2 a home PC with nothing but the OS installed with similar results.   Thanks for your replies. Let me know what is the best course of action. 
I see - this makes sense of course. I just was concerned, something referring the code was not correct. Using the ON/OFF buttons of the initial typical's node-screen would result in a recent change of sliders position after changing to the'manual screen'.  Your suggestion above concerning the state feedback sounds very interesting. If it's not to much work it would be nice. 
> I cannot reproduce this. The `TRACE` config works as expected in my tests. Do you have a link to a simplified project that reproduces the problem?  i got a simplifed project to display this function,i set level to trace,but on console panel i can not got trace log, this confused me。meanwhile，i set level to info or higher ,then i got what i what log
When I read the spec I was reading that paragraph as applying to the previously specified parameters (access_token, token_type, expires_in, refresh_token, scope).  It also goes on to say that the "the client MUST ignore unrecognized values names in the response", which again suggests we should be a little more forgiving in how we deal with unexpected value names.  If nothing else it would have been helpful if this was easier to code around as this took me a little while to debug (I came across this upgrading from Spring 5 to Spring 5.1, Spring 5 was forgiving of extra values I think).

Issue started after i updated to consulo version  #1271. i think i was on #1268 before update but i don' t remember the c# version. Also never seen the issue before version #1268. example class bellow. http://prntscr.com/9orx3b Then when i try to call from other class it shows http://prntscr.com/9orzog Enums nothing special. Example public enum TimeOfDay{Day,Night}; Unity compiles ok but consulo says error. 
i haven't tested yet, i don't use base64 on iOS.
@mstachniuk, thanks a lot for verifying the issue! Indeed it is fixed (blushing :).  >There should be shipkit-bootstrap instead of shipkit, I think it comes from:  Those are essentially dummy values, only used to make the first build pass. We probably want to revisit because they are kind of confusing.  >I think in "shipkit-bootstrap" project a file shipkit.gradle should be pre-defined  Great idea! Please review: https://github.com/mockito/shipkit-bootstrap/pull/2  >What do you think about a feature with remove access_token and try GitHub API call without it, if it's wrong (and log this to the console as Warning)?  What's the use case?
I took some logs with the inbuilt logger. For Alice, who creates the group, i got:  problem is directly occuring after Alice removes the group. I'll get a logcat tomorrow.
Thank you for your reply!  On both the client and server there are these versions installed: EnderIO-1.10.2-3.1.180 EnderCore-1.10.2-0.4.1.65-beta openmodularturrets-1.10.2-3.0.0-102 forge-1.10.2-12.18.3.2281  Also only on server there is spongeforge installed: spongeforge-1.10.2-2281-5.2.0-BETA-2274  I am also including a logfile link which I attached to the issue I posted on the EnderIO issues section:  https://gist.github.com/Liiw/502ce4ea79da3c1815b90b60c325aaf9
Yes, the current master works on my env now with Spring Boot 1.4 + ES 2.4 (embedded). Thank you! 
But the problem is related with discovering the config server. If there is no config server how the discovery of this service is going to work?

Yeah, that looks like a solid start. I don't know if I should break this into a new issue or not, but here's something I've been considering: do we want to make a subclass of Activity that we use as the base for most (or all) of our activities? It seems like a lot of functionality, mainly showing these warning and the navigation drawer, will have to be duplicated in a lot of places.  If we had this "super" Activity, we could avoid a lot of redundant boilerplate code. That hinted at my next point, which is that I think these warnings should be displayed at the activity level. a) we avoid a lot of boilerplate, and b) they would remain still when scrolling between tabs. When launching the activity, we could check the internet connection and display this if there is none. If we want to get really fancy, we could register to receive updates on network status and hide the warning and trigger a refresh of all fragments (once all of them incorporate the refresh framework).  I think I answered my own question: we need a new issue :P 
Excuse me for the lack of information! So i am using javacv 1.1 with android studio 2.0. I used gradle to import and compile javacv from maven central and i put all the .so files in a directory called jniLib in my app directory because i had unsatisfied link error. Everything i use from the javacv library (Mat, normalize function etc) works fine, but when i use anything from the opencv_face it gives the error i have put on the title. I use:  gradle 2.0  sdk tools 25.1.1  sdk platform tools 23.1 sdk build tools 23.0.3  Thanks for your response and for your help!

@zymap thank you, for checking this out. I don't remember doing anything with cluster, but today I've reinstalled it from ground and the error doesn't come up, so I'm closing the ticket.
Instead of `mvn -rf che-plugin-maven-server install`  I should have used `mvn -rf org.eclipse.che.plugin:che-plugin-maven-server install`

This is strange because for me LagGoogle add the Color automatically and everithing work fine for me....  What version of Java are you using? I use personnally 1.8.0_201 64 bit, and start my modpack with MultiMC... After that I really can't help you because I never get any issue with that mod...  Somes mods can have problem with really old version of java, but, that you possibly know, because you are java developper...
> Sorry, this is a known bug & we haven't reached an agreement on the solution. It may be that we completely disable the creation of API keys when authenticationed with another API key, because it is difficult to determine what the right semantics ought to be for this.  @tvernum In the meantime, I would strongly urge you to document that you can't create API keys with other API keys to prevent anyone else from also wasting a day debugging this!  > Can you explain your intended use case for this? That will help us work out what direction we want to take.  ## My use case  We have many environments all writing to a centralized cluster. Production sites feed into a production index, staging sites feed into a staging index, etc. Originally, the script I wrote to manage this used one machine user that is accessed via an API key to create API keys `run_as` other users that have the set of permissions that we want each API key to have. After I ran into issues with that, I started to generate API keys for each of the intermediary users directly (rather than with requests `run_as` those users) so that they could then generate API keys with the necessary roles.  So for example, if a staging site needs API credentials to be able to write to the index, then the `indexer-staging` user that has the necessary privileges will create an API key that can be given to the staging site.  I prefer the method of accessing everything with API keys because it allows for easy and frequent rotation of API keys. In fact, the base machine user is _only_ accessible via API key, because it is created with a `password_hash` that's purposely corrupted (i.e. taking a hash like `$2y$04$c6XLQlGgRUi/o8if98urVOEvBLmursKQOYsml9coXc7s.W9N8/f8y` and replacing a bunch of characters with zeros like `$2y$04$c6XLQlGgRUi/o8if0000000000000000OYsml9coXc7s.W9N8/f8y`) to essentially disable password login for that user.  However, in my particular use case, the base machine user and the intermediary users are only ever used from the server that's running Elasticsearch itself, so I can just switch those to use passwords in the meantime.  ## My ideal solution  I have two thoughts about how API keys should be implemented.  ### Machine users  The first is that there should be a type of user specifically for system/machine users. I initially use the `elastic` account to create the `machine_user_owner` account (with the corrupted password hash to make direct login impossible), and then I use the `elastic` credentials to run as the machine user to generate an API key. **It would be nice if I could create a user that didn't have the option for password login at all**, and that the only way to use that user is to access it via API generated by another user running as that machine user.  ### Permissions model  The second is that an API key should be _continually_ associated with a user. That is, rather than an API key having a point-in-time snapshot of the authenticated user's permissions, each API key should have the permissions that are the intersection of the authenticated user's permissions and any `role_descriptors`.  Let's say I create three roles:    This API key would be limited to the intersection of the user's privileges and the `role_descriptors`, so it would only have index privileges, because it was specified as having no cluster privileges:  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/542937/74367082-40c4ce80-4d9f-11ea-8dee-b9cc21888c01.png)   Then, if I remove the `index_manager` and `cluster_manager` roles from `test_user_2` at a point in the future, the `index-privileges-key` should also lose its ability to write to indices, resulting in the permissions of:  ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/542937/74367320-a5802900-4d9f-11ea-9267-6dca6e9efce1.png)  #### Keys created with keys  And of course, we can't forget about the original issue of keys created with keys. In this case, I think that the permissions of keys created with keys should reflect the intersection of - creator's privileges at any given time - `role_descriptors` defined when creating the first key - `role_descriptors` defined when creating the second key  Thus, even if the creator is the superadmin, if the first key is created with _no_ cluster permissions aside from `manage_own_api_key`, then no child API key will ever be able to have cluster permissions.
I just tested a little bit and I think I found out what exactly is causing the problem. I think, it's combining `LineDataSets` with at least one `LineDataSet` that does not have any entries... As soon as I add a `LineDataSet` that does not have any entry, the graph throws an exception...  Please tell me if this info let's you recreate the problem, otherwise I will offer a complete example...

Thanks a lot,I will synchronize this PR later. 
It works with 3.1.0.xx-201809160114-e48, thank you! 👍 
i removed viabackwards and it works fine and does not kick people. 
Tested on `392df98bfeedfe8615657448f62439c888649444` and confirmed that this issue has been resolved. I tried these steps on latest develop (`0533baf76be6fa9c9b0d3c6fa18855f5ed4d0083`), but there seems to be a regression of the block merge crash, so I could not perform these steps there.

Yes, adding device to `codecNeedsDummySurfaceWorkaround` is sufficient. I will update PR
I backed up the config folder, deleted the instance, and rebuilt the pack from scratch with a fresh install of minecraft and forge, then added a few mods at a time till all the original mods were all running concurrently. And the crash didn't happen again, so either a problem with minecraft/forge install, or i had a corrupted jar file somehow [a mod that maybe didn't fully-download properly?], or something else entirely. But its fine now i suppose
That seems like a reasonable solution. Should I reopen the issue for now then? 
@acanive if you mean the white highlight around the logo in the header, I removed that because it was permanently enabled instead of on hover. Thanks for the fixes :)
Yes, I included references and it does return agencies, routes, and stops.  The sample URL you can use is: http://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/api/where/schedule-for-stop/1_75403.xml?key=TEST Not that for each scheduleStopTime there is a tripId but no trips in references. 
Well, I don't know what the solution is. I noticed, that the cron expression I had did not work for July 2017. I searched for the error in the debugger. When I changed the code (replaced 5 with 6) then my expression worked. I don't know if this breaks anything else though. 
I've noticed that this only happens with certain items now. One of those items is Mithril ore. Tested it multiple times with it and it always throws this exception 
Did a quick data dump from Navicat of one of the tables I was testing the issue with yesterday.

yes they do appear,  but making the rectangle smaller just cuts off the widgets contents. but not does shrink/resize them. Thats exactly what can be seen in screenshots
I would actually tend to suggest using the stripped version for output and all database lookups as it is unambiguous. Otherwise, the same variant can occur with different numbers of prefix letters (and different positions), leading to further database lookup errors. 
Sorry, was writing from phone and forgot to add the info. Edited first post to include it. Unfortunately I cannot provide you with a debug log as I already removed the new version from phone as it already maxed out my data plan for this month. But it should be easy to reproduce.
Yes, I have set up as what you have instructions  "adapterWrapper.setLimitOfAds(3); adapterWrapper.setNoOfDataBetweenAds(10); adapterWrapper.setFirstAdIndex(2);"  And i use the latest version. 
if entered manually yes, from the button no.  http://localhost:8081/geonetwork/doc/api/index.html

Hello!  I Will send it later, when I will have access to PC
The point values are also calculated differently I believe.  Maybe we could change things to A.S/B.F. ?  
OK
i add that param and restart. 10 minutes http://217.23.11.150/red5_AVCVideo_trace.log 
I am sorry, but I needed to take a little pause from MC. Let's go for details.  I originally had FE build 1146, where it worked. But then I updated for later builds and it stopped working. I had my spawn position in other dimension than basic overworld, but first it took the coords where I setted it up and then teleported me to overworld on those coords, totally ignoring that I was setting it up in another dimension. Dunno if I updated or so after that, but it did not worked with more versions, I tried those ones: 1187, 1234, 1256, 1265.  For checks if it is not just by messing in perms, I also deleted it all and recreated, but nothing worked, only reverting back to (quite a lot) old version.  Still I might have messed something really badly, but I don't know what would be a thing that would overwrite FE's spawn thingie for good until downgrade.  PS: I actually in that bad times did some amateur video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jv9yod5zz8fbdmy/2016-08-29-1901-49.flv I had suspicions for that I messed dimensions, but then I deleted all FE datas and it was still there, even when I tried only FE command and even when I tried it just in overworld few blocks away..., that was really bad time heh. 
I've not written any dialogue code, I've just used the built in tutorial island plugin together with the dialogue plugin to test tutorial island. The npc head of the runescape guide wasn't moving in the  dialogue.

Tested this. Removing the style xml file makes the map visible again - so it is the map style files which are not working.  To test this I changed the style file name so that it did not match the Openandromaps .map file name. The map became visible. I changed the name so that it did match the .map file name. The map vanished. I changed the name again, and added a new different style file with a filename which matched the .map file name. The map vanished. I changed the name of the map style file and the map reappeared. During this process I did a full exit of Geopaparazzi often.   These are map style files (.xml) which I use currently in Oruxmaps. I tested them again today and they are working in Oruxmaps. I believe that previously they were working in Geopaparazzi too, but I didn't use Geopaparazzi properly yet so I may be mistaken.  
Hi Serge,  from our DB I cannot say precisely if the table I used to find this bug is a IOT table or not... If I execute the following query:    the values for IOT_NAME and IOT_TYPE are both null, so I suppose the table is an ordinary table.  Additionally, the reported issue happens with all the tables of our test DB, but does not happen with the development DB, so maybe this could be related to some Oracle instance settings. 
My crash-reports folder is empty and I don't get any errors in the console. It only says that the server stopped.
Thanks.  Just testing it out now.  
I have verified that this issue has been resolved. 
MCPC+ v251, I didn't know whether it was a troubled script. It happened occassionally, I have no clue. Does github have PMs? Then I can write private message to you with all my sxripts. 
Yes, i did try that, same problem
Thanks ill mention this to the admin, and no i cannot provide any further infromation beyond what i have. I have no access to any server files, and Admin recently disabled /plugins command.  But thanks for the replies, i'll let him know about this profile reset. which in my mind sounds like the most logic thing to work on. prior to what i described above, i had lots of items duplicating when placing and removing them.. items disappearing when i die, and duplicated into other items.  Like one example my sword got turned into Steak (food) when i was first hitting with the sword.. then ran low on health, switched to food rightbefore i died, holding down rightclick to eat.. The sword was then gone, and instead of having that 1 stack of Steak, i now had two Stacks with the same quantity. This happen whilst fighting "bosses" that was created from the plugin BossElite, or something.. ( atleast a boss plugin)  Later i had placed redstone on the ground, and was going to remove that redstone piece.. and place a piston when i placed the piston the piston disappeard.. then when i right clicked the ground where that piston was, it placed redstone whilst i had nothing in my hand, due to Berserker triggering even if i was holding an item in my hand.. Then when i rightclicked on the ground redstone appears  from "thin air" i could still tap the redstone again creating a new entity duplicating redstone dust. But the piston was forever gone. These things happening and also getting loads of these lagspikes after teleport i do not know exactly whats causing it.. I'm now digging through Bukkit forums to find more solutions. 
Samsung Galaxy S3 mini (GT-I8190)  ... still working and useful but not exactly top gear. 
Ok, thanks.  We are running Tomcat 9.0.30 on Linux/Centos v.8 on our inbound server. Outbound we are running Windows Server 2019  Hm... the strange thing is that the error disappears when downgrading to 4.1.6.  This is also independent of Oxalis version.

Nothing in console, what is suppose to happen (like it use to in Tekkit Classic) is /f access restricts a territory to the person you assign it too, like it would lock chests, breaking blocks etc UNLESS you were the faction leader and officer. But my faction members can break blocks and open my chests even though it says they have restricted access in that territory. You would do /f access f "Dangerline" (my faction) and /f access p enterprise12 (me) which would normally restrict it so only I can do anything within that territory.  Feel free to send somebody in to see what i mean. 24.46.189.96:25565 - Tekkit Lite Website: www.nucleartekkit.enjin.com  Uptime: 2-10pm Eastern Time Zone (today i should be on around 5-6 to 10pm) 
It seems that the option "deleted" still isn't working, but "moved to app folder" is. Also the moved files are shown in gallery now.
@kayler-renslow Tried with the latest TFAR build and spits out the same errors. I included a bunch of screenshots. The color values are never filled in as the colors in all my files are as stated above, the correct format.    Above syntax is correct; your color picker however wrongly converts them to comma's. https://prnt.sc/g8xvwt 
We are using PrimeFaces.     Can please explain:   > Have you turned off class loader delegation? 
It was fine in 6.1 (and possibly later). 
@scholzj your commit fixes the issue, thank you
Due to how the issue appears, it is rather hard to replicate at this point, compared to when it afflicted me on 1.7.10.  I wonder, if by any chance if multicraft could somehow cause this though, as I am currently generating the same seed on my own PC, and plan to send it over to a multicraft-based server once its finished.
I sent two. I accidentally forgot to describe the first one. Did you get it? I've never used the report button before.

Okey, after fully restarted phone, only than it started work in English. Probably I don't really know, how to terminate and restart app without restarting Androi (thought I know how to do it :) ) 
I am using the default keyboard delivered with the stock firmware which is SwiftKey. I'm using SwiftKey with the default settings. So the size is set to "middle".
Sorry I thought Docker didn't store logs to disk @sergiosagu The docker build-in log, you mentioned above, will show the certain amount of recent logs according to the parameter, `max-size` and `max-file`, you configure, and stores the log to `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container-id>`.  But the old log will be deleted once the log size reach the capacity.  According to Log Rotation, we should move the old log to somewhere else. Like the problem people mentioned here https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8911  @igorstoyanov I referred to the document @sergiosagu mentioned above https://github.com/vmware/admiral/wiki/Configuration-guide#prerequisites. I notice this in OVA with VIC, this is our command to start Admiral Container   Besides, I think it makes more sense to search for log file that is under `/var/admiral` rather than under directory of docker. Thats why I suggest using mount `/var/admiral` 
Currently I don't have a code sample. The problem occurs in our code which has too many dependencies to easily create a code example.   Anyway, I think the following problem happens:   * We get an event and determine, that the queue is full * We call subscripiton.unsubscribe() https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L176 * The closed "event" was already enqeued in the queue * The queue processes the close "event", sets the atomic boolean and returns (closing the queue processing thread: https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L250 * The queue is now empty (i.e. not full anymore) * The atomic boolean guarding the queue is not set to false * Now, a new event appears on the volatile queue. (Why this happens is the interesting part. It might be that the unsubscribe() call has not completed, yet, or that the volatile subscription has a similar issues that a close does not prevent events from being delivered. ) * The queue is empty, so the event can be added.  * The processing queue is restarted by line https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L180  I think the last line might be the underlying cause of the bug. Why is it there in the first place? Processing should already have been started on line https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L215 So line 180 seems redundant to me. Maybe there is a border case I cannot see right now which requires this line?   Tell me, if you can agree with this reasoning. 
it's working now, thanks for your quick response, it is definitely an awesome lib.
i am using 2.0.1 
Yes. Checked and it's fixed. Thank you. 
> Would v2 sync clients work for you?  We could spawn threads and use sync clients. A bit less efficient but would be OK.  > I think this exception would get retried and should succeed in the next attempt, is it not the case for you?  What we see is that with retries enabled this bug is less common but still appears quite often (e.g. every 250 files instead of every 100).  Even if retries did work we can't use them though. Our use case is to create a zip file containing all the data from all of these photos in a streaming way without holding it all in RAM  so retries aren't an option for us; they'd cause a corrupt file because the zip archive would contain part of the file (the part that failed part way through) and then on retry that part of the file would be repeated.
I puzzled out the likely reason for the log submitting fail: He carries currently 43 trackables and sets them to visit. For such log c:geo runs into timeout for him while logging, while the log has ben successfully posted by c:geo. As soon as he leaves them on ""no action" the log process in c:geo runs smoothly  I asked for HTML capture of the logging page (will sent via cgeo-dev mailing list). What else could be helpful?

I can get a bit further with 4.7.2, but that can't deal with "auto" I've also 4.9.1, but this requires a newer libc. When that's in the LD path the Sun JDK malfunctions, deadlocking on a futex. the build then doesn't get any further than the exec() out to "java -verson". Wrappering that out then leads to the lib abi compatibility  problem resurfacing when the java code tries to dlopen whatever naive code dso the Bazel build has made.   I've also the intel compilers, but you'll see that's not without it own set of issues. 
@ywelsch this is still unclear, the first trace was 08:34:20,553 and the last one was a StackOverflow at 09:48:19,128 :     Note that It's happening again right now with two other nodes elastic1021 and elastic1036 (still master).  Unfortunately keeping the logs is difficult (disk full). 
Hello @mzelzoghbi  I am already on version 9.0.3 as you can see on the issue  thats where its crashing   its is not crashing in version 8.7.2 though

Thanks for the test version and sorry for the delay. I had a stress-filled week. My wife and me have now tested the MultiUserFix.apk and with it both phones get all the values. So far, so good. :)  Here is how we tested:  - We uninstalled the regular versions and installed your openScale-1.5.2-MultiUserFix.apk.zip on both phones. - Then we created two users on both phones and activated the smart assignment function. - Now we took out and reset the scales batteries. - The first sync (on both phones) didn't load ANY values. - The second sync (on both phones) loaded ALL stored values to the selected user a. - Then we manually deleted all wrong assigned values on both phones (very time-consuming by the way) - The third sync (again on both phones) loaded the beforehand deleted values to user b.  After that both phones were constantly able to receive new measurements for both users. So yeah, it works! Please put your changes into the official version! Thanks for that!  I also detected some minor glitches in my tests and I have some ideas for improvements but I'll open new issues for that.
Yea, the more I think about it the worse the idea I had for implementing it is but I still think it would be a great touch.
Done :)
1.5 TB.... Its tens of thousands of files.  Does the mobile app do all the scraping itself???  Josh Harris On Apr 10, 2013 3:20 AM, "David A.

I have raised PR #362 already, would appreciate if someone can review and merge it.
Yes, I used the latest version which was released about hour ago.  I tried to add 3 different apps, and any of them makes app crash.  
hello Ryan, I've created this [project](https://github.com/adrianbrad/cloud-gateway-websockets-ping-message-bug) for reproducing the problem. Looking forward to your feedback.
Eric, thanks for checking this. My environment is Firefox 62 on Ubuntu 16.04.  The steps to reproduce: 1. Install and run an instance locally, following the instructions from here: https://www.apicur.io/download/ 2. Open https://localhost:8443/studio/, create an API, open it (https://localhost:8443/studio/apis/1/editor) and create some paths 3. Open the Source tab, make some change that should be visible in the Design view without switching the views, open the Design tab. ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22968420/46124288-ba900280-c212-11e8-9e21-1f5ee8de678c.png) 4. Observe that the change was not applied. ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22968420/46124289-bb289900-c212-11e8-89f4-eca68eb1981c.png) 5. Switch the view to another element (e.g. to some method), then return back to the initial view. Observe the change applied. ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22968420/46124290-bb289900-c212-11e8-8cc1-7f80380ae04f.png)     
The versions i've tryed are 5.3.2, 5.3.1, 5.3 I've not tryed older builds  Error log? How to find it? 
Nexus 6P - Stock 7.1.2 I just tried again and realised it only seems to happen on really big image files, so maybe it was just because the pictures hadn't been completely loaded in!
I meant adding an option so users could turn it on/off at will. I'm working on it just to see if I can pull it off. Folks with bigger screens might want it. 
It only occurs with AR installed. Pams Harvestcraft doesn't crash. I tried with only AR and got a similar crash.  I just noticed that the exception was lost. It was a NullPointerException.  I'll find the full log. 
I get it on every screen, like in a folder view, in settings, etc. Independent of whether I enable PIN or Fingerprint in settings or not. Installed via F-Droid, no device settings tweaked that I know of.

I _believe_ I only had one driver running. That's why there's only one command-line with --driver=embedded in the report; that causes that particular instance of the tool to start up a driver as well. The default is to not start a driver. 
> could you pls provide a project that reproduces the issue? That's it................................ I debugged it using official examples. https://github.com/alibaba/spring-cloud-alibaba/blob/v2.1.0.RELEASE/spring-cloud-alibaba-examples/spring-cloud-alibaba-dubbo-examples/spring-cloud-dubbo-consumer-sample/src/main/java/com/alibaba/cloud/dubbo/bootstrap/DubboSpringCloudConsumerBootstrap.java
I could solve it reinstalling Docker for Mac. It seems that something was broken because an update or who knows what :-(   Anyway, thank you for your answer. 
I found the issue and yes its not a bug from the addon. I used `UI.getCurrent().navigate(...)` in my login view to navigate to the main ui after login. Inspecting Google Chromes network tab showed, that the styles of the addon are loaded after the DOM loading is already done. I could fix that behaviour by using `UI.getCurrent().getPage().setLocation(...)` but I'm not sure if that is the desired usage of Vaadin's navigation. Thank you for the quick reply!
ZAP is 2.5.0 Selenium is 5 
The item pick does not have a filter, but if i add one to blacklist the chisel mod it works to stop the drone picking the items up. Version is >PneumaticCraft 1.1.4f<, running on the Crash Landing modpack in FTB. Probably just and old version bug, I'll install the newest version and see if it happens again.  I couldn't see anything related to this in your changelog, so I shared it here. 
Only happened once so far just after startup.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/279528/44438782-0fcd6880-a604-11e8-9f3b-5de8a48329a1.png)  Unfortunately I don't have a reproducible app, I assume it's a concurrency issue on initialization.
Yeah, I know, but the api give us all that information. Thanks for all.

Once the CircuitBreakingException comes, the heap usage doesn't reduce. Suppose heap used is 5 GB at that time, it remains close to that. May I know why?
Mouse clicks take something lika half a second to register. Scrolling through game record is equally slow. Im using Iced Tea and maven. Interesting that you havent noticed anything! 
Thanks jest sent it hope it gets to you if not please resend request ( the email I sent was to large I went over the limit for the email )  
No worries :-)  Nope, same stacktrace. Stepping through code in debug mode it looks like ContextManager.getCurrentContext() in gestalt-asset-core ends up with a null context. Somehow in this scenario it isn't getting a hold of a LegacyMusic module reference? Probably I just don't know that part well enough and it may not matter.  That then gets passed into AssetManager.getAsset (still in Gestalt) where it provides an empty ("") moduleContext to the resolve method. Seems to handle it OK.  Eventually we indeed get caught in a finally block under EventSystemImpl$ByteCodeEventHandlerInfo.invoke then pass through the exception handler  ... and then the game doesn't crash. It just gracefully continues after throwing the stacktrace. Try again without debug mode leaving the game window inactive and it again didn't crash. Huh. Then try two more times, one leaving the window active while the crash happened and another while I had the window up with the menu active while working in another window and it still crashed.  Confusing.  Bigger copy paste with a full crash:    Ran it through debug again but with an immediate resume after my breakpoint came up and it crashed again. Race condition of some sort maybe?  Pinging @flo if interested in maybe checking it out (if the Context stuff looks right?)  Can probably reproduce it faster if hacking all the music prefabs to fail rather than wait on SpatialWinds 
Yes, on Finchley.RC1 works OOTB. I think it's designed to work with Iterables (judging from mentioned method).

@tux-mind search for target A exploit, edit it to use a certain IP Search for target B the target A IP stays in B. It will be better if we have a condition, when you edit the options the IP address of the target is automatically set in RHOST, like armitage does 
I cannot check that because the download link in README now returns 404. 
@domdomegg I'm using version 2.9.0-debug-master~340b0812 and yes, it was built from Android Studio.
I tried with the latest snapshot and the problem is still there.  HOWEVER, the latest snapshot listed is orientdb-community-2.1-20150610.173559-189-distribution.zip  So I'll try again when the next update shows up for today's date or better.

It's actually a weird mixture of Plains, Forest, and Forest Hills... even some of the hilly areas are Plains. 
I am not sure what you are asking. Annotations have been implemented for all the Repositories. It is part of the Repository interface. It is supposed to show the 'blame' data on the file page. The problem seems to be somewhere in the generation of the web page, I cannot figure out where this is handled in the .jsp files. The very first time the Annotate link is poked generates the call to the individual Repository interface to get the data. Subsequent selections do nothing more that hide/show (via html class addition/removal).
Hi Rob, thanks for the quick response. I've added the `@JoinColumn` annotations, the stack trace stays the same though:    Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help debug this. 
Android 4.1.2. Thanks! 
Verified. 
Inside the CreateStatefulContract, there is a         TransactionReceipt contractReceipt = contractTxId.getReceipt(client); in line 80. That call generates an uncaught error. Same process happens inside the Get Record, since the (waitForConsensus(client, null);)  includes a getReceipt that fails.  
Yes, folder % is correct and devices % is wrong.  I have 3 folders for that device, and devices presently stuck Syncing at 67%  I also opened 0.5.4 on another device in the same cluster. 1 folder only, and devices display is stuck at 77%.  
It's in Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts. I don't see it listed on the Keyboard Shortrcuts Quick Reference, though.

See the build logs on Travis for master:  https://travis-ci.org/CorfuDB/CorfuDB/branches  It doesn't seem consistent, but usually somewhere inside SMRMapTest. On my local machine addNodeIT consistently fails due to a file error. I've verified that tests pass locally after reverting to HEAD~1 on master.

I just right clicked the terminal with the glasses to link it and it doesn't show up in the hosts in the glasses gui but when i relog on the server it shows up. It works fine when i right click with no helmet witch links the terminal it and equips it.
@tobihagemann synchrozitation with Google Drive is up-to-date. 
I took JED out to see if it was causing problems, even in a standard overworld I was not getting any ore decoration.  But I found the issue, I MUST call `addBlockToReplace()` as part of my decoration setup, even though the docs say this is defaulted to stone.  Perhaps the default isn't correct or some other mod is messing with stone, but adding : `dec.addBlockToReplace("minecraft:stone")`  to each ore-gen decoration fixed the issue.
Like I said, it's hard to reproduce. It tends to happen in groups, but I can't quite figure out exactly what triggers it. When I did get the above error, I had ProtocolLib `debug: true`. I didn't have Minecraft `debug=true`, but I'll have to try that and see if I get anything more interesting.

@llorllale Thanks for the fix. @0crat Thanks for the invitation to join but I prefer to work for you for free.
I think it happens because you use the link text over the actual URL in the link to retrieve the card information. Same thing also happens with "Return (card)", and I'm sure a few others.
@sijie #3118 is another change, and it is not intention to do the fix for this issue. If we want to do the fix in 2.2 or earlier, we may need another PR.  And in the 2.2.1 code:  
Restarting the server does not work everytime + the elytra wings and effect stay after removing it with the ritual 
No, not really a problem. Just wanted to have this registered in case it was still an issue in 2.0. So I guess you can close this one. 
It actually happens during any code, even when using $h to home the machine. I'll make a video and write in my settings if that helps.

> > Could this be explained by additional heat sinks being added automatically? Vehicles have to be able to sink all heat from energy weapons, so the tonnage could be accounting for the heat sinks. >  > Example, if you add an IS ER Large Laser to a blank vehicle, which generates 12 heat and weighs 5 tons (12t + 5t = 17t), tonnage goes up from 4.5t to 22t (+17.5t). This checks out since without a fusion engine, 0.5 tons of power amplifiers need to be added.  But if I have a Clan XL Engine on a 50t vehical, at 1/2 speed, granting 45 tons of room, with 20 heat sinks, an ER PPC which generates 15 heat, shouldn't weigh 11 tons.

Hi @steven-sheehy, yes importer it's running and database is up to date, or at least we do have transactions on the database and are being created in real-time.  Please see the logs [hedera_mirrornode_api_5551.log](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/files/4124601/hedera_mirrornode_api_5551.log) 
It doesn't save the class chest coordinates. I'm reloading the config with the "/ma config reload" command. I haven't been using the "/reload" command.
`labels(srcs` returns the list of strings that make all the sources, so I thought `labels(includes` should do the same.  I want it to build my project config for my IDE (QtCreator). 
I dont' think I have anything special in my configuration, but you are correct that SSL is enabled. If the Jetty 8 sample application is working, I suspect its because both Jetty 8 and 9 are on the classpath, but that's not an option for my system.

What is the output of `.libPaths()` and `find.package("knitr")` in your R session where `knitr` is available?  I do have a startup script that modifies the library paths, but `find.package("knitr")` returns the first path (+ `/knitr`) from `.libPaths()`.

Hi @skabashnyuk, this was an enhancement that we had requested in the past and it was implemented in https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/13634
Until now I used osmdroid 4.1, which also had some of these problems, but could be solved with a workaround. I didn't switch to a newer osmdroid version due to these problems since the old workaround does not work anymore.  I was able to fix all the mentioned problems but zoom via pinch near borders. If I`m able to fix this as well, I will create a PR. Ps.: I also found that, despite my previous message, `mTargetZoomLevel` is correctly set. 
Hi Lars,  >Can you explain in more detail, what failure happens? >Does your browser open to present the login page of oc.de?  OK, I’ve just upgraded to today’s NB, and the errors are the same.  In Browser, I’m logged into OC. I’m starting c:geo, and the status line shows that GC is logged in, but OC.DE is “Login failed”.  I go to ⋮ → Settings → Services → Opencaching.de → Authorise c:geo again then hit the “Start authorisation” button, then there’s a popup saying “Waiting for opencaching.de…” (I think, it goes away very quickly) and a… I think it’s called toast… saying “c:geo failed to initialise autho‐ risation process”.

I still have the same issue 
Fixed by #1802.
I've found out that `app:recyclerView="@+id/recyclerView"` attribute in `com.turingtechnologies.materialscrollbar.DragScrollBar` is the cause of the error. It might work well in an Activity of only 1 RecyclerView with id `recyclerView`. However, in an Activity with multiple fragments of which each fragment contains RecyclerView with the same ids, `DragScrollBar` could not determine which RecyclerView to bind.  My immediate solution is to give unique id to the particular RecyclerView with `DragScrollBar`. 
I fixed the link in the original post. The pop-up I am getting is this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31726022/51766359-a550b500-20da-11e9-843d-5c47f6ce3f76.png) It happens with just Forge and Antique Atlas.

@Paris it won't freeze up, but it also won't show any notice saying it couldn't connect (which may make people post on the forums asking for help, saying their scripts don't show). If it cannot connect, maybe pop up a message dialog saying powerbot could not be reached?

Thanks for the prompt reply.  > What stops you from using a non static function and override it?  I want to construct a Class instance from within a Module. That is, what I really want is to be able to write `new thistype(42)` within a Module. Unfortunately, this doesn't currently work. Instead, I tried to use `abstract static protected function _construct(int i) returns thistype` as a work-around but got bitten by bad code gen.  > I think abstract static is not intended to work, this is a missing compilation error.  I had a feeling this was the case. Admittedly, `abstract static` is somewhat special-purpose. It seems to be a [debated issue in other languages](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14600) as well.
That's a solid idea, definitely worth pursuing. Wouldn't solve the issue I'm facing specifically, but it's a very fringe case and not likely to be an issue for anyone else (hence the super low priority). The duplicate calls in my scenario are technically across multiple systems, rather than just multiple sites.   I could add all of the conventional channels into the same system in the config, but I'm not sure how it would behave since the individual sites know nothing of each other.   E.g. if you had two calls start simultaneously on different channels/sites that weren't actually patched, but both had a TGID of '0001'.  It's a tough problem to solve, and I wouldn't want you to get bogged down solving a problem that likely only affects me, so I'd say absolutely go with the more logical solution to duplicate calls. Would be a quicker win and would improve the app for a lot more people.

Here is an example:  
Sorry my code is on an internal network and I cannot post it. All I can say is I followed the instructions posted here for swagger-springmvc-0.8.4. I am completely XML-based with no custom config files. Too much out-of-scope work to migrate to java-config-based so I'm kinda stuck. From the README.MD, my config now includes:  `<mvc:annotation-driven>`    `<mvc:message-converters>`        `<bean class="my.MessageConverter"/>`     `</mvc:message-converters/>` `</mvc:annotation-driven/>`  `<bean class="com.mangofactory.swagger.configuration.SpringSwaggerConfig"/>` `<mvc:resources mappings="*.html" location="/"/>` `<mvc:default-servlet-handler/>`  So it seems to me that I'm confined to using your provided config class and annotations. I think my troubles are confined to the @Api annotation on my controller. It seems the description is ignored and, from a reply from Ron on swagger-swaggersocket@googlegroups.com, so is the basePath. My annotation is set to:  @Api(value="roles", description="Operations on roles", basePath="myContextRoot")`  Displayed in swagger-ui is:  **roles : roles** **...** **Try it out!**  So the second "roles" above should be the description and the "Try it out" request URL used is missing the context root.  From Ron: "As for the context root, that sounds like your basePath is misconfigured and does not include the context root of your application."  Any help appreciated! 
No, I didn't! I haven't worked with jni before and wasn't aware I had to recompile it manually.   Anyway, I recompiled and now it seems to be working, thanks! 
Oh, I didn't notice you could have the scale factor be fractions, I thought it could only have whole numbers like the size arguments. Thanks!
Oh, yeah, I forgot to write it. Tried. Nothing has changed.
@tobiasKaminsky, I don't know how to answer you. I just installed nextcloud as it is. How do you see that ? And how could I change it ?
This fixes the problem . Thanks a lot
Hey Benjamin,  >What version of the HockeySDK are you using?  We're using HockeyApp SDK v5.1.0  >who's sending and receiving the intent   Intent is created in a fragment.

Now the beds work properly, thanks! 👍 
Yep, works fine now. Thanks for the quick response.
Where can I find that version ?   See also https://github.com/bartoszprzybylski/owncloud-android/issues/21 .

I have the latest code. Even with `setShouldUpdateDetailLevelWhileZooming` set to false I have issues with tiles not rendering and tiles being display at the wrong zoom level. So #252 doesn't seem to be fixed. 
I can confirm that version 0.5-1 fixes this issue. 
> I think a extra flag --esm is also needed in order to avoid stuff like you're doing (renaming all files) so this way we assume that modules are always in ESM format.  Yeah, I don't think the solution is to rename files, because sourcemaps would break too, unless you went in and replaced that part too, and that is honestly to much of a hassle to support ESM. Using a flag would make this more trivial.  > Could you create a simple example project that shows this issue so I can play around and see if I can see a way to figure out how to resolve the relative paths if possible?  Yep, when I get home from work today, I'll push the exact example I had, which is still very simple, based on the example you have in this project.

This is a problem... Just download furniturelib and dicefurniture and test it yourself to find the bug
I use ubuntu 16.04 and 14 both x64, as to the CHE_variables i use:  ## OS:   Ubuntu  ## OS versions:    16.04 and 14, both x64.  ## Che environment variables:  CHE_CONF_FOLDER=/home/user/che/conf or i try to mount my own configuration file but to no effect; I set CHE_HOST_IP=${IP}, i set my host machine IP, the same one i use when i run che locally as a server.  Heres an image, i connected through bash to the che-server container. ![screenshot from 2016-08-15 14 23 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6517180/17672707/1216823e-62f4-11e6-8dde-6af5632de791.png) 
Just checked, the clickable area stays where it should be around the model. Only the overlay moves.  Also just tried with NPC Indicators plugin, same issue. (expected ofc but thought I should test it)  ![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5851433/52891237-c47db800-3157-11e9-92ea-dc50d4bdbabf.png) 
Cannot reproduce under 3.8.0.
@jmakeig and @clockworked247, thanks for the comments.  If I've worked long and hard to create a mapping definition in QuickStart, that definition's representation in the UI should not break if a user deletes/updates/adds documents in Staging.  I like the idea of highlighting properties that the UI can no longer find. (And that can happen currently if a user adds or deletes documents in Staging.) I also think the user should also see the type and value information that was there before. The UI can't show this information with the current data model when the property is gone.  
Yes. The videos do show and play in the YouTube app and on the website itself. The videos, in particular, I had issues with are [`The Nightmare Before Christmas - This is Halloween - Acapella Cover (Lyric Video)`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN-W3kqwUlo) from Triforcefilms and [`Opia`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftv6EaBD1UE) from Shirobon - Topic
Here's a diff against 1.0.7. All it does is make sure HttpResponses get closed. This was enough to ensure that connections in the pool can get reused efficiently. We saw after upgrading some services to Jetty 9.3. that the analytics library would just lock up because it was holding onto connections too long and timing out. This fixes that.

@tedsharpe I'm going to nominate @TedBrookings to do a first-pass review to check the system calls, as based on my conversation with him the other day I think he might be a good person to review. I'll do a review pass as well to have a look at the CRC stuff, etc.
@jimczi Thanks, it works! However it is still a bug and I guess this is only a workaround. I wonder why this was not an issue on 6.2 version previously?  Thank you very much! It was a real headache. :smiley: 
Thanks @joshiste,  with that change the build is successful. I am not seeing the errors any more. But the images files are not copied in to dist directory. The .png files are showing as [2]  in the dist directory and in the third-part directory.  In think need to tune the query part of the loader    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24617792/21401358/b037473e-c779-11e6-883f-79ab9496f10a.png)  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24617792/21401371/c68b7a46-c779-11e6-8e69-3886872c456f.png)  
1. clone the `example` . 2. update project by wurstsetup 2. F1 ->  wurst:build
Yes, at first I thought it was because my client side config was not the same. I copied the server config to my client and although the tooltip shows that absorption is at 100%, when i tested it out by letting some blazes hit me, my DS equips' durability still dropped. 
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  It was actually Aroma1997's mining world that first led me to suggest it.  I had a type 4 panel and noticed that if was raining or dark in the main world the panel would not gather RF.  But, if I traveled back to the main world and slept, the panel would be charging when I checked it next.  Now my mining world is an all sunlight world like a Mystcraft dimension or the Biomes of Plenty dimension.  Could be I just need to update Aroma1997's mod.  Thanks for making a really cool mod and taking the time out of your holidays to look into this.

Hrmpf. That’s not the only keyword that ES5 reserved… here’s the full list (from the link in the original description): - unconditionally:   - [x] `class`   - [x] `const`   - [x] `enum`   - [x] `export`   - [ ] `extends`   - [ ] `import`   - [ ] `super` - in strict mode:   - [x] `implements`   - [ ] `interface`   - [ ] `let`   - [ ] `package`   - [x] `private`   - [x] `protected`   - [x] `public`   - [x] `static`   - [ ] `yield`  The remaining unchecked keywords under “unconditionally” can still be used to reproduce this bug. Please add them too.  It gets uglier with the ones that are only reserved in strict mode. Ideally, we want to support running in strict mode (#2733). For that, we should escape these names too. However, that will be a change to binary compatibility, and unlike the case for `class`, this will break compatibility with code (albeit code with weird names) that currently works. So we shouldn’t make this change right now, I think… but it does mean we know for sure that we’ll break binary compatibility at least one more time, unless we’re happy with never ever supporting strict mode. 
If I were to guess I think the problem is in [this line](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/blob/master/processor/src/main/resources/org.mapstruct.ap.model.MapMappingMethod.ftl#L22).  
Thank you for your quick response. Yes I understand, Plex is optional, but it is good option 😄  Every time happening for me. Just play a video from your SD car (external storage). When it is playing try to push back button. Not working for me. After 2-3 seconds try to push again (just 1 time), not working again. 3rd time, push to back button. Carstream will crash. If you want, I can try to send a video to you.
@simonbasle it was an error on our side. After upgrading from M1 we needed to change some parts of our pipeline.
the only way we could balance the preassure was to run lines of redstone dust all about, and even then it seemed that the pressure guage tube addon seems to cap out at 15 redstone power when it hits 8 psi ....which when you need ideally 15 for chargers its better to have it just vent lol To the mod author, please re-think easter eggs that cause performance hits as bad as this, your mod is awsome but i spent nearly 2 hours last night trying to find what mod was causing the error with yours. I mean no offense by this....and im kicking myself i didnt think to look through the code for easter eggs 
@dennishendriksen see issue report, i have no further details available to make it more specific 
no - this would make somehow no sence as it would be out of XPrivacys capabilities ;)  i just open up the normal phone app (using cm10.2) and dial a number and establish a call 
I just used your https://github.com/xoppa/blog/blob/master/tutorials/src/com/xoppa/blog/libgdx/g3d/frustumculling/step1/FrustumCullingTest.java   and step4 code too.  Today I have played with this:  when I removed   if (currentShader != renderable.shader)  line in ModelBatch.java (flush() method at line 208), then tests seems to work.  Hopefully this helps find the actual problem. 
yes we can do that by using some code which determines OS
@vegegoku Agree if they are called in these cases and could be overriden. Currently they are final and can't be overriden.

I use windows normal shell. I always use this. I think the reason might be indirect to this test cases. 
I have tested with epfl mpeg 4 sp. Orcc is complaining if this transformation is active. I have null pointer errors in xronos because the fsm is missing states... 
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3d5c87d0fa03e6ca7487261f1f785e00  Wasnt really sure how to use this ... I turned it on and used ender chests in member group. 
Metadata obiuvsly is in the module not in the app that is using library :   
That's fine by me. The snippet from Sponge is MIT-licensed, so you can use it wherever you want (as long as you attribute it to Sponge)
Sure! Just please don't close the issue too fast, because I may not find time for that in the upcoming holidays, I'll try to do it asap.
Well, I am still using API6 but I might consider switching to API7 if you don't plan to support older versions of sponge.  I can also change my code with 4.10
Yup. 
This exception was actually not from the TestFX unit tests, but from another application. I am about to migrate this application to JavaFX 8.0 and I will check if everything works. 
It does not fail anymore in our tests :/
Works for me.
Add `--cpu=x64_windows_msvc --host_cpu=x64_windows_msvc` when building Bazel, you'll then get an error like this: `ERROR: missing input file '@local_jdk//:bin/jar'.`  It can be fixed by applying the following change. Then build a bazel with this change, use that bazel to run `bazel build src:bazel --cpu=x64_windows_msvc --host_cpu=x64_windows_msvc` again.   
I am using default rebar configuration. .app and .beam files are put into the flat ebin folder. I.e.    Sample project http://www.filedropper.com/test_50 
I did try the new version. Still did not work.
Apologies for delay.  @joschi  This is a completely fresh install of Graylog, on a newly created server. This morning I have updated to 2.2.1+4829190, but the problem occurred both before and after this.  The steps I am taking to view the error: -Login as admin user -Go to System -> Authentication -Go to "3. LDAP Active Directory" -Click the "mapping LDAP groups to Graylog roles" link, the majority of the way down the page. -Receive the error "Plugin component missing for authenticator legacy-ldap-groups, this is an error".  I've attached an image of the warnings from the browser debugger when progressing through the steps above.  I've also attached the server.log file, which contains all logs between graylog startup and the problem occurring.

@tavalin Thanks for your comment. Shall I post in https://github.com/tavalin/openhab2-addons/tree/hyperion?  My use case is:  - Hyperion and openhab are running on the same pi - Control is only done with openhab (not thru e.g. hyperion-app) - Hyperion has a memory leak triggered every time the binding refreshes the current state - Mitigating is to set refresh to a very high value (or zero)  (We've already talked about this in https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/pull/2319#issuecomment-355041978)
FWIW setting the default protocol to null works in my tests (i.e. HTTP 1.1 is used) 
Yes, I'll try it ~~tomorrow~~ _as soon as there will be a nightly downloadable_ and report back here...
I had to delete the content in the data repository (otherwise, the Neo4j server silently crashes again, and the logs tell me that it is complaining about missing transaction logs), but yes, increasing the limit to 524288 (according to your source) does help !
im sorry but i dont understand what your asking
Sure.  I tried with hikari on Oracle. Code fails with oracle's too many values exception, caused by inner sql select for user having too many field which can be fixed by specifying attribute, but connection is not returning to pool and it become exausted in no time.     We also had connection leaks on network connection losses. Requery is super cool, but with connection leaks like that it is hard to use in production... 
is it technically possible to also maintain the rng on events like particles? it would be a massive upgrade to not loose rng when sprinting etc @Earthcomputer

Sorry for the delay in response, but yeah seems like it is with all mega evolved pokemobs going by the values under "scale" and seeing them visually grow bigger. The values keep increasing every time they are returned to their pokecube and haven't been reverted back to non-mega forms first. 
not sure if it's #1 trying to piss me off due to knowing I'm sitting here ready to F2, or #2 because i realized that I had set green and blue as outputs while green was actually the input with blue and black being outs, with yellow as pass through.   when i had green as output, items would enter, but after that particular sorter, the items labeled with a green would be tossed in random directions with other sorters even when they didn't have the itemex having only Granite on a blue would also let bone or arrows into the chest         From: AlexIIL <notifications@github.com>  To: BuildCraft/BuildCraft <BuildCraft@noreply.github.com>  Cc: Raghalin <jmtvcks@yahoo.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com>  Sent: Monday, June 12, 2017 12:40 PM  Subject: Re: [BuildCraft/BuildCraft] 7.99.4 diamond pipes (#3667)     Can you screenshot your diamond pipe GUI and in-world and put them here?

It is 12.5.0. 
Sorry about not specifying the version. Just updated the post The random ` at the end is a mistake after using markdown - also removed.
Switched from 0.30.31 to 0.30.32 as of today and see these errors since that time.
Operator error indeed - I was in the mindset of returning view names, not paths, hence my missing "/", good catch.  With this it returns the 403 as expected, I tweaked the controller to return a `ResponseEntity` in the case of REST requests, and the page gets the message it expects.  Thanks for the help. 
@javanna Makes sense to me.
@shivam-tripathi  regarding this issue i think [this](#96) solves the problem and i can confirm that the re-downloaded files are exported successfully. Regarding the file tampering issue that you described above a new issue could be filled so that we could get a detail discussion regarding how to solve that. @yanokwa  @rclakmal @lognaturel what do you think?
I meant P2, sorry.  But definitely a bug. 
If you mean the option "Autosave local libraries" in Options - File, then no, this was not checked.  However, I just noticed that there is a setting that may have made this a bit less frustrating: under "Library properties" there is the option "Refuse to save the library before external changes have been reviewed" which appears to have been set by default. Unsetting this will at least let me simply save the library even when JabRef incorrectly thinks for some reason it has been modified on the disk.
I agree, but sometimes is does not for some reason (prefix broken, bad user manipulation, etc...). In this case, we should handle it properly so that the user can at least delete or repair the prefix
Thanks for the quick fix!   @meteorcloudy very cool! Having it standalone like that will be much easier for me to experiment with the toolchain -- thanks for doing it!
I downloaded it from the official Site https://cryptomator.org/. And i checked the sha256 Hashcodes, its all correct. 
Marc  Thank you for the reply.  Let me check with my collaborator, as it is his data and I don't want to be sending it out without his consent.    It is worth mentioning that the system we are exporting from is running only one instance of PeptideShaker, and the one we are trying to open it on is two time zones away and trying to open it in the only running instance of PeptideShaker.  I have also tried doing this all in our lab, copying the exported file from one system in our lab to another and I get the same error.  Is there a different method I should use if I start a PeptideShaker project on one PC and want to open it on another?  This particular project took ~36 hours to open the SearchGUI results (on a system with 12 cores and 60GB of ram) so I'm a bit scared to close PeptideShaker on it until I know I have a project that can be opened on another system. 
@Rpearson94 I've just tested something and it seems to work fine if you type it in regular chat first, and then in PMs after. It doesn't work the first time in PMs. (note that in the picture I sent _!kc bandos_ in PMs, then regular chat, then PMs again) ![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1979467/43049983-7e43fa10-8e01-11e8-8869-20ad8fe322d8.png) 
Hi guys!  I think we are facing another time zone issue.  My time zone is `GMT -02:00 Brasilia Summer Time` and the issue can be reproduced using the sample files.  I changed my device to a non negative time zone (I used `GMT +00:00 Greenwich Mean Time`) and like you the problem could NOT be spotted. 
Every deck I've tried resulted in the same error.  Here is one that I tried importing [ur-unblockable-aggro-2.zip](https://github.com/magefree/mage/files/1822823/ur-unblockable-aggro-2.zip)

I haven't actually configured anything using CasC yet.  I did the configuration manually in the GUI to get a baseline.

It is very desirable to allow multiple loads to support components that must consume messages from multiple schemas. (That is why we are using OTF decoder in that case--so we don't need to deploy multiple sets of generated code.) It would seem that header would always have to be the same for OTF to work. In summary, I think it is okay to only store one header, but just don't leak when the same header definition is loaded from multiple files.

Setting the properties is not the problem I think. It is more like once `spring.cloud.task.batch.failOnJobFailure: true ` is set, jobs will be autostarted, even when `spring.batch.job.enabled: false` is set. Maybe there should be a way to get the monitoring of the jobs without automatically starting them.

I can't reproduce this any more. I had the problem with the Maven plugin 3.2.1 on a complex schema. I've since changed the schema to avoid this. I haven't been able to generate a test case that does it.  I'll close this and if I managed to reproduce it, I'll re-open it. Thanks. 
Sorry, I specified wrong version in description. Actually the issue can be reproduced in version 7.1-SNAPSHOT.   Probably the problem is related with changes made in #2572.
I'm not deodexed, what can I do? And I can't find it on internet either. Is it necessary for the clock alignment issue? @wasdennnoch

It is indeed nice that merges will go and fill up disk space for us, provoking nasty disk-full bugs that otherwise wouldn't be found, but it would be best if our tests could properly simulate random disk full situations, using the mock filesystems from Lucene.  Maybe, we shouldn't fix this until we have better disk-full testing in place? 
So I took another look at it this evening, and I'm fairly sure it was an issue with the drive having its permissions changed somehow. The /data directory had been changed to be owned by root. I've no idea how, but changing it back fixed the issue. 
@smolinari - Fortunately, your suggestion that the documentation on OrientDB-SQL is not to be taken seriously is at least in this case (i.e. in the case of http://orientdb.com/docs/2.1/SQL-Create-Function.html) simply refuted by the output of the console "help" command, which includes the line:   
Yes the message comes from BTree and not from the PumpData thing. The version that works is 1.0.6 and the one that does not is a pull from yesterday 
I like that idea.   - Deprecate `artofillusion.procedural.Module` This will provide a shortstop for any code that tries to use the FQPN, pushing us to use the new name. - Commit to a version where we _will_ remove the old code? (4.0, which would give us some time to work out the implications?)  I might consider `artofillusion.procedural.PModule` or `artofillusion.procedural.ProcModule` if we wanted to continue to use the word `module`. Otherwise, I might go with `artofillusion.procedural.Block` for both "block of functionality" and "building block" from the visual editor standpoint.  I don't think it will be too hard. My test build only fussed about 20ish uses in the core code (though, I don't doubt there are probably a few more)
My apologies.  The stone golems no longer take the items from a chest and transfer them to another chest. Tallow golems assigned with a bucket will refill a crucible, but will no longer refill the bucket with water from a designated source. Tallow golems if assigned to an alembic, will pull the essence from the alembic but not go anywhere. Clay golems no longer move items to barrels.  All colors are assigned correctly.  Also, I haven't seen anything odd in the console. 
This problem does not seem to persist between region changes.
 
I mark the songs in 1 of 2 ways. 1. From within Ultrasonic Main Menu, I click on Albums/Recently Added. 2. From within Ultrasonic Main Menu, I click on Songs/Starred.  The syncing begins without a problem.  Everything will be alright, but every once in awhile (sometimes after exiting the app, sometimes out of the blue), I'll continue playing the songs in the playlist and then the music stops.  I look at the playlist and see the playlist is still full, but the down arrow showing each file that was synced is no longer there.    I verify the files are there by using Root Explorer and browsing to the file storage location.
OrientDB 2.0.14. 
It`s just spam logs. I will try the newer version later. Thanks!
If you run the application with `./gradlew bootRun` you will see that it cannot be started.
@sleshchenko #8675 solved the bug of websocket in dashboard. But the terminal is a websocket in ide. ![20180608105157](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39881038/41136896-fa1713bc-6b0a-11e8-99ad-3ac5367211b7.png) 
Thanks for explaining.  From your comment and a little bit of back and forth in chat, it now sounds like we should do the following in Titan:  Vertex features: - supportsNumericIds=true - supportsUserSuppliedIds=[value of graph.set-vertex-id in the underlying config] - all other vertex feature support methods, including supportsCustomIds=false  Edge features: - supportsCustomIds=true (because edges are identified by a specific non-numeric, non-UUID, non-String relation ID type) - all other edge feature support methods=false 
That's right. In other words the Date Added order in the file system does not much the order in the Recently Added playlist, like it used to.   I actually had to go back to 1.6.7 because v2.0.1 wasn't 100% right, either. An album that I downloaded a week ago was shown over the new album that I had just downloaded
@andrijapanic thanks, workaround helped
I sync the latest the master branch(2.2.11-SNAPSHOT) and build it by myself. But it might have no improvement for the long latency issue. Is this issue caused by netty or is it possible that we have missed some configurations about netty? 
http://prntscr.com/i0nfhp  In the config of course
@fgreg Thanks. The problem has been solved, however, I still can't start web service on my computer.   2017-04-14 10:48:00,782 ERROR executor.Executor (Logging.scala:logError(91)) - Exception in task 0.0 in stage

This is my API usage pattern https://github.com/nikolayspb/lettucedemo though I cannot reproduce it locally. I use setex, get, Lua script, pubsub and ping.  In production I use sentinel configuration, btw. https://github.com/nikolayspb/lettucedemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lettuce/demo/SomeValueRedisRepo.java https://github.com/nikolayspb/lettucedemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lettuce/demo/SimulationRunner.java  I see you made some commits, can I try as snapshot?
just need to do an ObjectMapper.deserialize; I think we should probably JsonIgnore the setter. 
On startup the che version is 6.18.0.  This is a fresh install using docker.
Hmm.. I'm not sure, as I've got assigned a new work item.. steps to reproduce where 1. start redis instance 2. log in to the application 3. kill redis instance 4. reload web-page    -> session-cookie is valid, but session is not found in redis, instead of deleting the cookie, it redirects to login page, which instead of deleting the old cookie again redirects and so on..  
**Testing was successful:**  Internal SoapUI test runs successfully.  Internal Selenium tests confirm that fix solves the reported problem.  All tests will be made available soon: https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/wiki/Tests-for-TEAM-Engine
I guess its the same with 1207. But I'll try your debug build
Mmh....just an hour ago I found a cache. Didn't take a system log but however I do see the posting on Twitter. So could be only a temporary glitch on Twitter as I dit not again authorize after the last try.

Hello,   We suggest to rely on the client version that can be defined in the Service class. Then we change the methods in TypeUtils (toEdm, toEdmDateTime) to pass the version as parameter, and finally introduce some logic to choose the date format based on the version (with the adding of the new format)  If you're fine with this solution we can submit it, we just wanted to check with you first as we're new to this framework, we wanted to be sure we got it right.   Cheers Antoine

I did not change any settings in "Restrict to certain wifi networks". I'm connected to the same network. I tried to reproduce this error again, but I'm no longer able to. Maybe if I wipe the app data but I currently don't want to do that.  Edit: I tried to reproduce error multiple times with no success, but right now I was able to do it again. This is very odd. 
I ran `bazel coverage --test_output=streamed path/to:testTarget`  I'm not sure how to describe the project.  It has several maven jar dependencies. It uses [rules_protobuf](https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf) to implement a gRPC server.   The test is mocking a few things and testing certain http calls would have happened. 
+1 for a simple size limit.  I think Solr (example solrconfig.xml) "defaults" to 512... 
@vmi ... thank you for looking into this! I tweaked the same test and increased the timeout for the popup...  [www-select-parent-window-1.zip](https://github.com/vmi/selenese-runner-java/files/300574/www-select-parent-window-1.zip) I have also included a screenshot of the IDE test output for your reference. Please let me know if this serves the purpose.

Ok, I've whitelisted N-ify in MinMinGuard, System UI was already whitelisted.   Before doing that though I had tried again and it seems the icon is updating without having to hide and show the shade again, but it seems to be very erratic. Sometimes it takes a while to do it (up to 6 seconds or more) and sometimes it does it almost instantly. The behavior is the same if I turn toggle mobile data from the quick tile (collapsed or expanded), or from settings. There's a delay in the icon update wither way.  
Hey Scott,  Yeah I guess a fix was the wrong word to use.  I can't provide the exception until I get to work tomorrow.  But what I can say is that getThreadLocalInstance() is never called.  I noticed that method was there, but I wasn't sure if we were supposed to call that directly or not.  As all we do is repeatedly call writeImage when we are writing out our billboards.  I'll provide the stack trace tomorrow.  -Jon  On Mon, Jun 24, 2013 at 5:15 PM, Scott Hunter notifications@github.comwrote:  > Your fix may just be hiding a bigger threading problem.

Ranger was in a lvl 5 guard tower, knight was based in a lvl 5 barracks/lvl 4 barracks tower.
On 4.1.153 it is working fine. 
It's not easy, because my current projects are not open source :-( But I've found the one, which can be used to reproduce this problem. 1. I'm using the latest Eclipse STS 3.6.4 based on Luna 4.4.2 (just FYI, don't think it's so important). 2. Clone git: https://github.com/nippur72/Dart.RayTracerDemo.git 3. Import project to Eclipse (you can safely edit 2.6.1 to 2.7.0 in pom.xml) 4. GWT Compile. 5. Right click on javaraytracerdemo -> Debug As -> Web Application (any choice Dev or Superdev) 6. Error: Could not find any host pages in project javaraytracerdemo.  To workaround the problem: 7. Debug Configuration -> Web Application (right click) -> New 8. Main class is substituted as com.google.gwt.dev.GWTShell, fix it as com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode 9. Also manually add to debug configuration -> Arguments the following: -startupUrl gwt_raytracerdemo.html Also it could be needed to fix -war parameter there, for me it's c:\user\Documents\myworkspace\Dart.RayTracerDemo\JavaGWT.RayTracerDemo\target\javaraytracerdemo-1.0-SNAPSHOT\WEB-INF\classes   Now you are able to run this project. 
Fixed in 5.2
Yes it is a combined grammar that should generate a lexer.   It has been relatively easy to create this target. Dart e Java have a close semantic and syntax. Yes I'm simply manually translating from Java. The idea is to make the translate version work and then cleanup/dartfy the code. Now I'm working on various grammar tests. 
I'll try start of next week, but Kotlin annotation seems to require kotlin-reflect in all cases so even if they were retained they would still require the kotlinfactory.

Try using app with a Russian IP. It would then become "Тренды", even though the Android locale is English.
I'm running Win7 64bits, and using JUnit to run a test (surefire maven plugin).  Tests are exactly in the same environment, i only have to change `JAVA_HOME` environnent variable from `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_45` to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51` and run `mvn test` for the problem to occur.  Maybe it's a performance issue of the JVM, totally unrelated to MapDB ?  Test is an integration test from a closed-source project, using multiple MapDB at the same time with custom serializers. it's measuring performance for about 1 000 000 records and 1000-sized transaction chuncks.  I'll try to write an external unit test showing the performance issue with a unique database ... 
I don't have it fixed locally just bypassed the bug in my code, but I can make a PR for it, and with the other issues that I have found.

hi @maggiolo00,        It's work now after follow your suggestion. Thanks you. I have another 2 questions. 1. I saw from some document that WB need jdk 6 and later, but I found that WB 2.1.6 need jdk 8 because some of jdk api that it used is a jdk 8 version. So, can you confirmed about the jdk version for WB?    1. When I tried to stop WB with stop-workbence.bat, it show "Error: null" and the server didn't stop(I already attached the screen). So, I need to press ctrl-c on the server command prompt. Any suggestion?  regrads, Anurak  ![stop_orientdb_wb_log](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16556054/12132836/463474aa-b452-11e5-80dd-7182635067f9.jpg) 
I just tested the apk you did here: https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/114#issuecomment-498031034  The app doesn't crashes and I'm able to end the wizard. Looks good!  You need more logs? Else, when do you think it'll be available in F-Droid?
Hi, sure. I'm running a MI Box S, and I've tried mkv and mp4 files. Thanks.
I am also using 2.0.2 version but still facing the issue. 
Thanks for your reply.  opentsdb.conf   HBase version is 2.0.2.  
Thanks for the response @uslss  My eclipse version is Neon.3 Release (4.6.3).
Please excuse the delayed response. To answer your questions... I have actually attempted many different versions in an attempt to fix this issue but I am positive that I have tried the top three hybrid modems and can confirm that I have restarted the device each time. I have even attempted to manually switch the radio to every option related to my device in terms of what band to use through the "info" screen.   To recap - this problem only happens when I have WiFi and the Cell Radio on at the same time. If I place it in airplane mode and/or turn off WiFi I don't have any issues. Further more... When both radios are turned on and any of the top 3 hybrid modems are used my wifi signal will typically show 4 bars and my LTE signal will have 0-2 bars. I am in an area where I have a week LTE signal from one tower and a strong signal from a non-LTE tower.  In any case - I definitely believe there is some type of key issue which specifically show how does not tell my device to use my WiFi radio as the primary when it has a strong connection resulting in every request from any app which uses the internet having a long delay before (and sometimes times out) it completes its requests.  Please advise if there is any way for you to look into this for a fix or if you know of some app which would allow me to force specific applications to use WiFi if its available.  Thanks in advance,  Chris H.

has no effect, I've made it blasting III and nothing is happening 
@y20k Ok that is so weird. The stream has been taken down between when I posted it and now.   I got it from here: http://stream.xrm.fm/  There were 6 active stations when I posted it but now there's 3.   Anyway, I've just found an alternate link since this bug is so reproducible.   http://ai-radio.org:8000/320.opus has the same behavior as the one I originally posted.   There's something about Opus streams with title - artist info  that doesn't agree with Transistor.   I got both these streams using this directory http://dir.xiph.org/by_format/Opus which I found in order to stress-test Transistor with this new audio format. The ones that display title and artist on other apps and desktop players don't show it on Transistor. 
Just use the flexiblelogin-0.17.3
The chart was filled with data, I do not remember which one it was though. It happened a couple of times also when pinch zooming, so it seems to be indeed an MPAndroidChart bug. 
After you install 0.3.2, click on Android Studio -> check for updates. And yes it is 2.2 ![screen shot 2014-01-22 at 6 52 22 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/943594/1980344/11f98514-83c0-11e3-8901-60f831e2b9f1.png) 
I will check if some of my bundles are in waiting state later today. 
We are using 4.1.0-RC10, together with Oxalis 4.0.4.  We may try the released 4.1.0 of the plugin if you think that will make a difference.  We have so far not noticed anything in the log, apart from the aforementioned log statements from DummyImpl and AssertionBuilderRegistryImpl. What we suspect, though, is that it might be necessary to have had traffic on both AS2 and AS4 for the problem to appear.
Hi elharo, to answer your questions:  1. Were you using Maven or an Eclipse native project? Eclipse native project - like this: a. Click the Google Cloud Platform icon - Create New Project - Google App Engine Standard  b. Enter Project name, Java package (nothing else) - click Finish c. Deploy the generated HelloAppEngine  - works fine d. Modify the generated HelloAppEngine as shown in my original post - with a reference to Query.Filter e. Deploy again - it fails  2. Did you try deploying this app with gcloud from the command line? Yes, I tried like this - but it still throws the error:  3. What other imports did you need? No other imports - just the standard template project - and added the imports for Query: `import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query;` I attached my java class.  [HelloAppEngine.java.txt](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-eclipse/files/1844431/HelloAppEngine.java.txt)  Thanks!

@amihaiemil in those projects it will try to pick you, since you don't have tasks there.
I'm fairly certain that I did yes, though I will try again to verify when I have some time and report back. 
  I assume this is happening because of the "==" I added at the end of the encoded string which comes from a jwt token because I had other decoding failures without it (https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/codenameone-discussions&showsearch=true&showpopout=true&hl=en&parenturl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codenameone.com%2Fdiscussion-forum.html#!searchin/codenameone-discussions/base64/codenameone-discussions/eTJgAQG1Sxg/7U76c8BzAAAJ) Anyway, like I said, I end up using https://gist.github.com/EmilHernvall/953733 that has a much more robust decoding algorithm (it is also insensitive at the presence of the "==" at the end of the base64 encoded string or not)

no, sorry, I cant make a video unfortunately. I'm using IDE 1.6.3 for Windows XP32.  about moving a marked block: when I drag the mouse with pushed-down left btn, I can mark. But when I then put the mouse pointer on the marked area, the marked area dissapears.so I can't move it. With MS Word it works.  About the jerking: Put the mouse pointer on the 2nd line from above => the lines jerk down. On the bottom it's vice versa, it jerks up. If you keep your mouse btn pressed, you'll get a huge marked block incredible quickly automatically scrolling up or down.

I used the same content for the logback.dev.xml as in the default logback.xml  Just wanted to reproduce it on an empty project, but it looks like it doesn't have to do with the logback.xml file, rather than the jetty-maven-plugin. When I bump the jetty-maven-plugin to the latest stable version (9.1.3.v20140225). I get debug messages from netty. Shouldn't the logback config set this to info?

This is a full display console.   Then I looked at the GRIB file and saw that there was another byte between "7777" and the next "GRIB". I tried to make in the code so that this byte was omitted, then everything seemed normal. But there are files with 6 extra bytes between "7777" and "GRIB".

I would prefer that font and size were separate. I may not want a monospaced font in the chat, as I would definitely want a monospace for the macro editor.  Same goes for the sizes. I realize that it may not be practical at this point in the process, in which case I would be able to accept that the font size was shared for now. 
@snicoll outside of Docker everything works fine. @eddumelendez using 1.5.7.RELEASE I'm getting the same result.
Getting the lines that conform to your filterstring sound more like a bugfix than a story to me

What I don’t understand in this is that it runs perfectly well in Boot 1.0.2.RELEASE. It also runs on Boot 1.1.1.RELEASE but only if I manually override the version of the spring-boot-maven-plugin to 1.0.2.RELEASE.  When I compare the two jar files, I only notice a difference in the loader classes (org.springframework.boot.loader). The rest of the jars is identical. 
I don't have a unit test yet. I will try to make one to provide to you.  In the mean time I can provide the code for one of the methods were this error has happened.    Here I "solved" the problem by replacing getChildren() with the get() method supplying a selector string "#polygon" but that work around is not working in other places. 
Yes, I think that would be the safest option. It's a backward incompatible change at client level (if one uses the cookie value), so we should still support unencoded values based on a setting.

I had been using prestisssimo, but i clicked the new setting and switched it to sonic.  the most current episode, episode 4.5, would not play.  I also tried 4.3 and 4.4 just now and both have the same problem.  I can open these files without a problem on  vlc on my phone.

It's obfuscated when the client is built. You can't find it here because it's not open-sourced @Kyle628 
Probably i see where problem is: in JSON request body field `@odata.type` is missing, but actually i set it by `FileAttachment().oDataType = "microsoft.graph.fileAttachment"` (or with `#` at the begging) so the request body looks like:  when i send it by raw JSON with `@odata.type` it is created correctly - why setting `oDataType` to `FileAttachment` won't add `@odata.type` in request body?
Sorry @leticiarossi, I didn't specify everything in the first post.  By the way to help you speed up the analyzing process I've created a sample project with the reproducible behaviour using 1.1.0-beta02. Moreover, I've changed the bug-triggering code a bit https://github.com/matpag/material-textinputtest  If you need anything else just ask.  PS: If you figure out the problem and be able to point me in the right direction I can work on the fix
I get the same behavior running the module from the CLI.  Here is a [dump of the log](https://gist.github.com/fwgreen/d66178246d72e108d90564b841403684).  Hopefully it helps.

Thanks @sford,@gsylvie for your reply.  Actuallly, I don't have multiple matching lines in commit message. An eclipse IDE forces the commit pattern and every time it appends the log to the commit message which makes it very huge (>2585).  If Java is the cause behind the push error, Could you please share an substitution to my regex pattern : (ATA-[0-9]+)(.|\n)*  please advise  
This seems to occur 100% of time when I launch GAMA and choose to create a new workspace.  But I never faced it in other cases (no problem with workspace with or without user models and even no issue when I choose a workspace than made GAMA freezed in the previous launch). 
Now it seems to be able to keep sending messages after reconnecting, but there's some things to notice with the new reconnection process:  * The retry policies apply to BOTH operations, reconnection and messages sending, it would be more sensible to either separate both into two different retry policies (so we can set NoRetry for messages and a different one for reconnection) or just apply the retry policies to messages and keep the reconnection operations running indefinitely as I'm sure it would fit more "real world" use cases.  * The reconnection process seems to stop after "OperationTimeout" (default to 4 minutes), so unless we set it to Long.MAX_VALUE, we cannot have a permanent reconnection logic. I'm not sure if this applies also to other operations that are not reconnect, same reasoning as above could be applied.

i'm so sorry to be late reply  because i was in vacation by yesterday.  i didn't any answer from my client about sample content. but i guess sample i was provided was not encrytped.  just that used url redirection. if this sample was encrypted,  before playing this , i must need customdata or somthing else.    and 3rd party player can easily play sample with subtitle.   but this is just only my opinion. if i get the another information from my client. i will notify you.   thank for  a lot of your effort.

Hi, The validate() API throws an IOException, so we are forced to catch it (or rethrow). But the problem is when a response different than XML is obtained, we get XML parsing exception which is of type org.xml.sax.SAXParseException, so our catch block will fail when this exception occurs (unless we are catching Exception which mostly is not the case)  Ideally, the API should wrap every exception to IOException itself with proper cause, detail, explanation and reason set so that the API can be used with confidence without having any side effects. The ValidationResponse may include methods to provide such additional information.  Also on a side note the main page for jacabi-w3c should mention all the dependencies (only minimal set) to run this validation service properly. The minimal set of jars: aspectjrt-1.8.4.jar httpmime-4.3.jar jcabi-log-0.15.1.jar jcabi-xml-0.13.jar slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar hamcrest-core-1.3.jar jcabi-aspects-0.20.1.jar jcabi-manifests-1.1.jar jersey-client-1.18.1.jar slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7.jar hamcrest-library-1.3.jar jcabi-http-1.9.2.jar jcabi-matchers-1.3.jar jersey-core-1.18.1.jar validation-api-1.1.0.Final.jar httpcore-4.3.jar jcabi-immutable-1.3.jar jcabi-w3c-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar log4j-1.2.17.jar

I normally change the type by right-clicking on the entry. Just to be clear, the entry does change types, but I am normally unable to use the entry editor again until I restart Jabref. The issue does not appear to be strictly tied to the entry type - sometimes just changing a random field will also cause the entry editor to fail. Sometimes it is the act of saving the record. Sometimes it is setting the quality indicator. I will attach the bib file (renamed to txt) [Mitrephanes.txt](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/1733657/Mitrephanes.txt)  I am trying to clean up - perhaps it is something in the file itself (the file was generated from Google Scholar) Also, I will attach the event log the next time it crashes - it should not take long because this morning it has been crashing on every entry. Thanks for your attention.  
Sorry for the late reply!  I'm using the latest version (1.4.0) and I'm sure that the process is associated with LSML. It appears in the task manager list as soon as the program starts, and usually disappears when it closes, but not always. I'm not sure what causes it to stay, but it seems to happen more often when I've had LSML open for a longer time. 
My language is Greek, but I, too, suspected that it might be a problem with the language so I turned my phone to English (UK), rebooted, cleared all CM3G data, and unfortunately the problem persists.

This was found when trying to get dependencies updated in a project with an urgent release.  I just haven't had time yet, please re-open.
@stevehu  I think implementing all 3 options is a good idea to keep it generic and satisfying various security/refresh flow requirements of different customers. Perhaps implementation option should be configurable via some sort of factory & pluggable implementation.  I suggest to have defined an interface for "a refresh flow plugin" and provide all 3 implementations "out of the box". Therefore users of the framework can select desired implementation and in some cases even provide its own implementation for the interface that satisfies their unique custom logic (in case its required)  Also regarding 3-rd solution to modify light-oauth2 service behaviour....this might open up some concerns for some of the customers IT security who don't want deviations from oauth2 standard flow rule - "refresh token can be used only once"
Is there a convenient place in PhpStorm to find this info? I'm new to PhpStorm, and have Googled around and poked around and could only find some info on the `Help > About` screen, but annoyingly that modal closes as soon as you click something else, even outside of the app... If the below isn't sufficient, then please let me know how/where I can find what you need.

@dcbriccetti Sorry for that poor description! It's not exactly about "words". Look at the part of form:         <data id="a26280000014QdjAAE">                     <start />                     <end />                     <today />                     <deviceid />                     <simid />                     <phonenumber />                     <phonenumber>                         <text />                     </phonenumber>                     <closemessage />        </data>  As you can see, the questions are inside group with name `phonenumber` so the path is like `/data/phonenumber/text` where the path to automatically added, hidden question at the beginning of a form is `/data/phonenumber`. The same problem occurs if we use one of other existed name: `start`, `end` etc.  This case should be caught by form builder/creator but someone might edit a form manually so my fix is only to avoid the crash.
@stefanomorson Try to click on _**Configuration**_ and/or _**Asset**_ tab before continuously pressing _**enter**_ button. This way the error described above pops-up. 
Hi,  It’s the console. So the scenario is this:  1) have my model correctly type checked etc. if running in the console, all works fine 2) I now want to debug a feature and I set a BP before debugging; start console again. 3) type in some print statement that will trigger the BP. I do step in/over/out etc. 4) while the focus is on the editor window where the BP was at first, I add/remove a BP elsewhere in the same file 5) overture crashes.  It did happen on this model (on the semantics of a security language), but also on the models I use for students (on games).

Hi, @vpavic thanks for looking into this issue.   I can't reproduce the issue on spring-security-core 5.0.12, however the 5.0.x release does not contain a CSRF-filter for Webflux; therefore only one saveDelta call is executed.

By "banned" I mean my SSH account gets suspended for a certain time like if there were to many connection attempts with wrong credentials. I cannot even ssh the server in a terminal and my present ssh connections get killed.  With the previous version of DBeaver (6.3.1 something), this hapenned only the first time I tested the tunnel configuration, I had no more possibilities to connect to that machine using SSH for a while which was the time to ask the sysadmin what was wrong with that machine ("nope, everything is fine"), when I got back to my desktop the SSH came back and I could use the SSH tunnel. I use exactly the same configuration that it was with DBeaver 6.3.1, I just updgraded to 6.3.2 and since then there is no way to connect via SSH tunnel.

Hi @vzhukovskii, sure! I would like to invoke a web service in order to store it server side. That log file will contains the workspace (I guess that I can fetch it from AppContext) and the path + file name of the created file.
Yes, it is a query where I don't care too much about the performance. But I thought you guys might want to investigate a bit further since the performance does not make sense to me. So my personal guess is that this is an error/problem.  I know that Regexes are pretty expensive. But I don't see the reason why the query planner yield such highly different results. In the end a "has(attr) and attr =~ $regex" should not be much different from "attr! =~ $regex", since both should not evaluate the regex if has or ! evaluate to false. Or do I miss something again here?  Cached results are:    ~8-9s  The result was always 1 node, that has 2 two short attributes. So networking was not an issue. Results are varying due to other programs running (there are still plenty of cores unused). I cannot produce any "real measurement" for the next days. 
Further testing, issue happens only when assigning (mech) techs to protomechs (not Battlemechs, or Aero Techs to Aerospace, BA Techs to Battle Armor or Mechanics to Tanks) in the Hanger tab.
> Assuming this is user error (per @KGoodale13's comment), #5327 would fix this.

Inwinder,  what does `window.devicePixelRatio` echoed in Javascript give on your affected device(s)? 
It looks like the behavior on Red Hat is the same, and the dev version of `shinytest` took care of that (so that's a duplicate). But it didn't fix it on the Ubuntu instance. Javier and I took a look, we debugged `sd_initialize` in `shinytest`, the error that triggered was `private$web$go(private$getShinyUrl())`.  Then we tried debugging and somehow using the public URL was fixing the problem, as in:    It suddenly once or twice and then went back to failing. It might be a timing issue.  (Using screensharing, @javierluraschi wrote half of this, and I wrote the other.)

We're still seeing some serious sluggishness in the interface and in pipeline starts, but it turns out it's probably not related to the shallow clone, because it's still happening even though we turned it off for all pipelines to see if that helped.   I'll close this issue and once I have better logs and reproducibility for the slowness issue I'll create a new ticket.  Thx 
I do not see the file in my phone's collection.media; it appears to be working on desktop, however, I do not seen the file in my desktop's collection.media either and both collection.media's have the same amount of files (8106) so I'm guessing are identical; the smallest file in desktop's collection.media isn't silent.  What do you think is going on here? Please help.
Yes of course, I will do so as soon as I am able to get to it. As I have discovered some more issues possibly relating.  It might take me a couple of days to do so however.

I have no problem in using the ubuntu14.04, have not succeeded in win7 above 
The only non-DL modification is to change the forge version to ~~the latest~~ 1.12.2-14.23.5.2838 (it was on 2836, and another mod was complaining).  Upon further experimentation, the number of missed ticks is definitely dramatically reduced in this version - it's a little annoying, but manageable, averaging about a second's-worth of ticks per minute. It's mostly the 'conflicting with a previous registration' spam that's  a bit alarming.  The issue is reproducible to the extent that restarting the server does not fix it. I'm not quite sure where to go beyond that; will try moving power inputs around and replacing them.
im using sdk version 22 
Yeap, The jenkinsfile complains because it is expecting to find a boolean and it is getting a string, the thing is we can mitigate by casting but if we need to cast then it ain't transparent when using the plugin, do not get me wrong, you've done a hell of a job here developing it, it is just that after we updated our jenkins server to the latest LTS the use case when we use your plugin is failing with github specifically, we've tested it in bitbucket and things work as a charm, so I am unsure why this is failing, my feeling is that if you do not cast to a string things should work.  The GUI, is just boilerplate for the real impact we are seeing  :)
It's a Clojure project, using Pedestal (a web library).  The source is [here](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/master/service/bench/io/pedestal/niotooling/service.clj).  It seems like the NPE is being triggered at the first logging call (within Pedestal or JBoss itself), since the given application doesn't explicitly log at all.  The project file (pom) looks like this:    `immutant` above is JBoss (packaged up with a Clojure API). 
I want to wrap the call to the `operation::` in a common include as we'd like to put some markup around the snippets.    Not sure there's a nicer way of doing that but hoped that it would work. 
No, only in those cases where 1000G_ALL exists, if there is not any frequencies then it is unknown 
I've tried to run the test case 0001A (it can be run in PROD) in: - Cerberus QA -> VCItemMgt QA, UAT and PROD - Cerberus PROD -> VCItemMgt QA, UAT and PROD   The behaviour is exactly the same; cannot run the test case; still critical 
Applying a redstone signal to anything other than the base has no effect.  Applying a redstone signal to the StargateBase closes the iris immediately.  Calling `openIris()` while the redstone signal is applied causes the iris to open then close again. 
sorry for getting back late. Thanks for the 1.5.5 update. The issue has been resolved (partially). On pressing the finish button (in the last fragment), a blank screen appears before starting the next activity. The blank screen with white background doesn't belong to the activity that holds the custom fragments.  I tried changing the background color of the activity to match the background color of the last custom fragment. The blank screen with white background doesn't seem to go away. Hence this issue seem to have been resolved only partially  Thanks again

Thank you @xinyuan-liu  The problem was related to Java. Actually, I had installed java; nonetheless, I had not set JAVA_HOME. I think it makes sense to note that users should set JAVA_HOME before using the tool.
I know how to with ddms, but im without a pc anytime soon. Ill be looking into a console emulator to do that. Ill get back to you once i have it. 
No it doesn't.
Yes, the CA cert and the .p12 private key for me. It auto-filled the password. 
That might be the case then. It's probably only the blocks that have the tags.  I'll check later to be sure.
![Screenshot_20200111-142044](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1694705/72209554-aca0d800-347d-11ea-9475-12db24cd891e.png)  I've already listed the steps to reproduce. It should be quite straightforward.
@findepi: It is the same for unpartitioned table.   There is no `ConnectorTableLayout#getNodePartitioning` so I'm a bit confused. `ActualProperties#getNodePartitioning` is not empty, and `ConnectorTableLayout#getTablePartitioning` is not empty either. Hope I'm looking at the right method.  Looks like the remote exchange is added here: https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/7dfbe1be3c61455047827335c5dadd94125e0c48/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/sql/planner/optimizations/AddExchanges.java#L309-L311  , after we checked `isStreamPartitionedOn`. Yet in `visitAggregation()` https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/7dfbe1be3c61455047827335c5dadd94125e0c48/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/sql/planner/optimizations/AddExchanges.java#L232, I do see that we also checked `isNodePartitionedOn()` in addition to `isStreamPartitionOn()`.  For window function, if `PARTITION BY` columns include columns the node is partitioned on, I think a local exchange should suffice? 
A lot of players can not join the server, the players are using 1.8 of the client. According to my own test, I found that even if only the installation of forge without mods, can not join the server.

In the Jenkins UI for a multibranch pipelines, I have 2 options for defining the build logic in the "Pipeline" section:  * 1. "Pipeline script" * 2. "Pipeline Script from SCM"  With "custom script" I meant the first option, keeping the build logic in the jenkins job configuration, and not taking it from the SCM.  In our case notifications to gitlab work when the script is taken from SCM, but do not work when the script is kept in Jenkins. I assume it has something to do with gitlab properties/variables being set up when the jenkinsfile is fetched from SCM, whereas those properties variables are not valid when not doing so.  But how can I debug that? 
I just opened the chest. Couldn't do anything else.
Right, I were just about to suggest something like that but I see you already have a fix for it, nice :+1:

Hi @mkulesh, thank you for your quick response and for pointing me to the new firmware. Actually, I'm not using the latest firmware and I wasn't even aware that it has been released.  My current firmware is: 2120-3000-0000-0010 Latest firmware released in Nov. 2019: 2140-5000-0000-0011  However, there might be some very serious bugs in the new firmware, see: [http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-272-6905.html](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-272-6905.html)  - Post No. 8 states that Onkyo has confirmed the issue. - Post  No. 9 indicates that R-N855 is probably also affected even if the initial post refers to another Onkyo product)  I will have an eye on that issue and once they fixed the bugs in their latest release, I will upgrade my receiver  accordingly. After that, I will share my experiences here. In the meantime, I downgrade your app to 1.2 as I really don't want to brake my R-N855 and App version 1.2 was already quite good - close to perfect :)! 
Sure. Here it is, with a pointer to the unwanted line: 
> why would I want to delete this module?  Possibly when implementing beacons v2 and removing beacons v1. The real concern here is the underlying issue that prevents removing certain system packages. Modifying system data is something we do regularly between releases.

@codeanticode we were aware of this earlier, but the question remains why `wait_for_state_change` doesn't work on Mac, and Mac only ... I think it's better if people could just call `jump` at any time - cause they will try to do so in any way ;)

Hmm, I just tried it in single player, since I don't want to restart the server right now, but it doesn't seem to show the error in the log. All I can offer is a screenshot: http://tcp.st/t01zy.png  Here's what I did: Made a creative computer case, placed it and fitted it with all sorts of thing. I used this to install OpenOS on a hard drive. Then put another creative case in an assembler and started assembling a robot. It has all the recommended parts and I also included an inventory upgrade. I then assembled the robot, gave it a pickaxe and put a block in front of it. I booted up the robot, executed `lua` to open a Lua REPL and tried to do `robot.swing()`. Normally, this should destroy the block in front, but it doesn't. Instead you get a cryptic error message in-game.  On the server, I also got the aforementioned `NoSuchMethodError` on the console, though it might not have been every time.  You mentioned SpongeForge. I honestly have no idea what that is - I don't think I am using that. I simply downloaded the zip file for the modpack and gave it to MultiMC to work its magic.  If you need me to try it on the server to get the actual error message, I can do that tomorrow.
It is 255.255.255.0, so should be fine. Anyway, the dropdown in PaperUI lists 192.168.10/24, so if the netmask would have been different, the selection in PaperUI would have been wrong.
Hi Marvin-We, Thanks for replying and providing working code snippet. I think problem with comment body text. I able to reply with simple comment boy text like "welcome".  But failing if comment text is bit longer. for instance it's failing for below text. "Can you find who is engineer and doctor based on below statements. sounds like really great work you're doing with this.Can you find who is engineer and doctor based on below statements."
I can confirm it is still happening in latest build (2.15.0.1): http://prntscr.com/j3iptz
Thanks, Will test it as soon as I can... 
I have Windows 10. No, I don't use remote terminal, it's locally. Before open properties tab, you must resize DBeaver to small window and then open properties with columns to see bug. 
Hello ilayaperumalg,  thanks for your fast response. The last step that had the status UNKNOWN actually completed successfully. I was also just wondering why the second step still hat the status STARTED and the last step already has the exist status EXECUTING.   Let me know if you need any further information to fix that issue. 
I have built from source on the 'develop' branch and can confirm it is now fixed. 
@eivantsov  I have to keep my keycloak-data pv because I want to keep the keycloak user information even if I delete it. You know, if I lose my keycloak user information, I can't log in to che. In my use case, I have installed Che as helm in AWS EKS. I am using it in conjunction with AWS RDS (Postgresql) for postgres-data. So, in the case of postgres-data, helm delete does not delete it. The way I currently maintain keycloak-data is using Amazon EBS(storage) as pv and connecting pvc. As long as ebs is not deleted, keycloak data information can be maintained. What I'm wondering is there is a way that eclipse che can suggest other than this. Thank you for your help.  
The tests were done with a already-pulled Eclipse Che nightly image in DockerHub.  The following was ran with ``docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /c/tmp:/data eclipse/che start``   Then I pulled from che repo, compiled dashboard with gulp as per instructed in README, some errors shown up (mostly doesn't exist in the current context errors, etc.) using ``gulp serve``  with server arg.  no local binaries were mounted to test dashboard changes.
As it happens for me on multiple devices and with many different firmwares and Android versions, I didn't mention it.  FWIW, right now I caused it to happen on a Nexus 7 tilapia and a Galaxy Nexus maguro. Both are running ParanoidAndroid 3+ with Android 4.2.2. On the N7, I've got the build dated 2013-02-14 and on the GNex the build from 2013-02-15.  This is _NOT_ a ParanoidAndroid issue. I also had it with other firmwares, like with cm10.1 or aokp on the N7.  As it does not depend on the ROM or the device, I don't think it's worthwhile to spend time digging in this direction.

Yes it does. Also, with DS installed, rain droplets appear under trees in the savanna biome when it should be raining. Is there some override for the savanna's weather in the code or in one of the json files perhaps?
@fbiville yeah, i think it makes sense now. 
I find it quite nice to work with actually. Except for the bug I have now, of course. I have an implementation of ALS using the PactRecord model and now I ported it to the Array model to see whether this makes a difference in performance in this case. 
yes when i start a game, and when its over its saying start.sh does not exist! and then it crash the server. So what are the problem, so i can fix it? 
> @mschm05 thanks for the report. Could you please report the java exception/stacktrace and also which client/server version you are using? Thanks heart  the java exception/stacktrace was displayed direct after the crash on the android smartphone. I clicked on report bug, but how to retrive it? where to find the log?? Maybe the error report was sent to the developer of "Dateimanager+" ... I keep on searching ... Nextcloud server version 14.0.4.2
it also crashes with 20190312 with the same stacktrace
When `shouldUseDummySurface` is returning false the ANR doesn't occur.
I'd need a hand to keep consistent with the ReactFX stuff (I've never used ReactFX).  The problem seems to lie in this snippet:    It seems that *before* (meaning before something broke the Demo), the `Optional` wouldn't be "present" if the `BoundsPopup` was *outside* of the `area`'s bounds. That's no longer true.  `caretBounds` comes from `org.fxmisc.richtext.TextEditingArea#getCaretBounds` and its documentation *says*  > Gets the bounds of the caret in the Screen's coordinate system or `Optional#empty()` if caret is not visible in the viewport.  But that doesn't *seem* to hold true any more. Am I missing something?   [VirtualizedScrollPane Exception]: https://gist.github.com/TurekBot/51187a9bdfde85374cf6f8b2ebccf57e
I am using OSx launch configuration. It is quite weird as I am encountering this issue quite rarely but it still exists.

I tried several csv files. it happens only when there are empty values in a file, although I market to set them as null.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29042801/45166033-c0d82380-b1fe-11e8-9a83-ffb08d68230b.png) 
There were 15 indices on the node. Of those 15 indices, 9 indices had issues with their shards and ES status was red.  Issue curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards command, listed 52 shards UNASSIGNED and 4 shards in INITIALIZING status.  I issued reroute command (localhost:9200/_cluster/reroute) to move UNASSIGNED to force shard allocation.   However, the shards that were in INITIALIZING status stay there. The CPU usage was 100% (8-cores busy) for more than 4 hours, before I gave up and started deleting all indices that were causing the problem. Data was about 50GB and 6 Million records.  Even issuing systemctl stop elasticsearch.service took forever.  Is this what you were looking for, if not let me know what you are looking for and I will reply ASAP

I believe the results were exported in https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/807. @gadenbuie, is this true? Until I can access the local version of the job launcher, I cannot test this out myself. (I am having trouble compiling the IDE preview of 1.2.1335 because the Ubuntu 18 tarball appears to not have a `CMakeLists.txt` file).
We should, unfortunately I am on Android N where instant upload is (completely broken), so I am not able to test/debug this matter :cry: Apart from this, yes fixing it right away would be the way to go.  Since it is related to #25 which hasn't been merged (yet) we can postpone it since I just postponed that one too, due to the fact that I can't test anything related to instant upload at the moment.  So to "re-enable" me we should prioritize getting instant upload working again for Android N. I already started with the build process part, but there are still some quirks I need to fix. 
I don't remember such details. Sorry. I don't drive this road regularly. But I know that OsmAnd is the only (OSM based) routing service that has this issue.
Hi moyster , sorry but i'm really noob what program i can use to make a logcat ? 
Hi there:  A (big) bunch of mods installed, but i'm using Optifine_1.7.10_HD_B4 too. Will downgrade to HD_B1 and comment.  Cheers!

I have asked my friend for more details. Will get back to you, when I got them.  If I remember correctly, this started around the time, #894 appeared.  https://github.com/kontalk/androidclient/issues/894  The thing is that the person that hadn't accepted us then, doesn't experience crashes now. The other two FP2s, who had accepted everyone, have crashes and I with my FP1 don't have crashes.   --  This message was sent from my Fairphone 1 with K-9 Mail.  Am 20.

No problem. My new pi arrived on wednesday. I hope I can work on it next monday 
ah sorry didnt update yet, custom modpack 
Tried it again and I unfortunately don't see any change in the behavior.
I stopped all apps that might force close this app. I have similar apps on my Galaxy Note 5, S4 and Tab S but heads up still does not pop up.  I have to keep on tapping the Test button on the app (which does appear) to make sure I know the app works. But it stops appearing (not the test pop up) after a while.

I also figured out that everything > 1.8 does not work. It works fine with OpenJDK 8.   However the version check and the statement in the README is misleading.  The version check in start.sh say "Mycontroller.org server required java version 1.7 or later". The [README](https://github.com/mycontroller-org/mycontroller/blob/development/README.adoc) says "Java : 1.8 or later". And it seems like the actual requirement is Java 1.8 and nothing else works.  My OS is Manjaro, but that's probably irrelevant.

Sorry for the late reply—other projects intervened.  ;-)  @renyuneyun: In the "Additional Info" section above, I compared my problem to issue #154 and described in some detail my attempts to find an applicable permission to grant as described in the comment you linked to.  Did I miss something? Is there anywhere else I should look for such a permission, beyond what I have already listed?
When you did the test, your global thru account host had the direct  access to the destination host, so you cannot tell if you get there via  global thru or not. You should try to connect to the host, that cannot  be accessed via global thru account.  Best regards, Frolov G.V.  On 10/16/2012 03:38 PM, Andrey Hitrin wrote:  > Cannot reproduce.

Um, try CoFHCore-[1.7.10]3.0.0B9-120.jar or CoFHCore-[1.7.10]3.0.0B9-116.jar. I went from 109 to 116 and didn’t test any inbetween.  It happens on boot, right after you make your core edits 
Previously I did not get the dialog asking to copy or link the file. I just tried with your last commit and seems to work perfectly. Thanks.
Thanks @safris   I tested `opentracing-specialagent-1.5.3-20191209.144139-17.jar`; similar behavior. I tried a relative path (a.log) and an absolute one (/tmp/a.log). Log file is still empty. So the log file will be created, but without any content  would you say this is different in static attachment?   
I have tried the dev branch, it still doesn't work. I am sending the message as string from SF server.
Below are all the script changes made that are relevant to TechReborn's machines:    Not included are normal crafting recipes added/removed.  Note: The removal of Bronze Dust from the centrifuge was because you have a dupe. You get more dusts back from centrifuging than is used to craft the dust. The same goes for IC2 lapis plates being made from any dye.

@hbf  I have sent you a mail on  kf@iaeth.ch dated October 29, 2013 with a sample file which was giving me segmentation fault. Can you try to run it on your machine and see whether problem replicate on your machine. (though you might need rbox to generate points)

The call to `reduce()` in `Price.getValueNum()` (and `getValueDenom()`) is to avoid having to do [this call](https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/pull/484/files#diff-f09bdcd45d932eeaff0d88b567e44687L231). If we are to store it reduced, I think it's better to just do it automatically.  If you are ok with it, I can fix the unit test. 
@trask thanks for your quick reply.  Here are my libs info   
OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_C1  and I've tried the previous 3 versions of each of the Ultra and Standard editions as well. (Lite edition doesn't work with Forge.) 
Sorry just figured i would report this bug and then create a quick fix. Let me know if you want more detail, but the PR should hopefully explain the issue.

It is the default, to match all.  `Must match all of the 2 configured stream rule(s).`  Testing one message that was wrongly routed in this streams says that "it will not be routed to this stream" and that only the facility rule matches. If it makes any difference, those messages were also routed in another stream based on the source, and this is correct.

OK. I looked a bit into it again. I'll write the workaround at the bottom, so people might notice it better. I'll possibly open a separate feature request issue on the other stuff, since it's clearly not related, so I'll just focus on the bug. But first of all I'd like to apologise for not finding the other issue before, even though I find some of the other ones.  Basically I noticed the same behaviour as someone mentioned on the other issue: when I go to turn on the "Read and write to the AnkiDroid database" permission in the settings, it would turn on, but it wouldn't stay on when checking the menu again. AnkiDroid's setting would work just fine. And as someone said, the other curious thing compared to AnkiDroid is if you try to switch it on and then off, it would say "This app was designed for an older version of Android. Denying permission may cause it to no longer function as intended. [Cancel] [Deny Anyway]", presumably referring to the pre-23 API level.  I tried all kinds of different things, and I can't even manually enable the permission through adb with package manager. However, trying to do that FINALLY gave me something useful in logcat: "PackageManager: Cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app".  So, I'm pretty convinced what's happening is that because AnkiDroid is 23+ API level, it can set the runtime permission just fine. And it's also possible the whole "Cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app" has come as a security feature in a newer/different Android version.  Why does it work sometimes at all then? I assume it's because if you install Aedict first, the whole "com.ichi2.anki.permission.READ_WRITE_DATABASE" doesn't even exist so you can't request it. And with the "legacy apps" (on newer Androids?) you can only change permissions on install time... or possibly revoke and re-grant permissions that were granted on install time, you can even see "install permissions", granted or not, separated from the others when you do "adb shell dumpsys package com.ichi2.anki | grep perm".  In the end I don't think it's an _actual_ bug in Android, since it seems like it's something that was put there on purpose... but obviously the UI should say something about it. I don't think custom permissions between pre-23 and post-23 apps is a common thing. I can't even find anything other than the actual Android sources if I Google for "Cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app".  Unfortunately I think the only proper solution would be to increase API level, but of course that's a huge hassle code-wise.  **Workaround: Make sure you install Aedict AFTER AnkiDroid. If you already have both, uninstall JUST Aedict and reinstall it.**
Resonant Satchel with Holding IV, in the satchel I do have a /dank/null with stuff in it, but I am not using those materials to my knowledge.

I am working on isolating the code that causes it. In the meantime I wonder if the "immutability" is the key to the problem. I am doing the following:  put(key1, value1); put(key1, value2);  where value1 and value2 are two different objects. Does that cause problems?  what if the sequence was like this:  put(key1, value1) remove(key1) put(key1, value2)  would that be correct?

I'm closing this issue since it seems to worked fine now, when I deleted the database and recreated it from scratch

The size of the folder with build `che-theia` (theia + che-theia extensions) is 1.2 gigabytes. Size of build `che-theia` and `theia` is 2.1 gb. To be able to develop `che-theia` with plugins we need at least 3 gigabytes. It's a minimum. In some cases it could be uncomfortable. 
[RosieTest.zip](https://github.com/Karumi/Rosie/files/1943013/RosieTest.zip)  I isolated a base Rosie project and seems to work, so should be a problem with my legacy project... I'll continue to investigate.  Thanks

Even with the change to use `dill._dill` we hit issue https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/272 since we are picking with 0.2.8.2 and depickling with 0.2.7.1 (on the Streaming Analytics service).  Best workaround for Streaming Analytics users is to do: `pip install dill==0.2.7.1`
@xLaMbChOpSx, don't worry. I'm not even sure AIMSICD **needs** to start before radio connection. But as @E3V3A already mentioned, letting it start up on boot and restarting it upon kill would rock. 
I'll try to figure out a minimal reproduction.

EssentialsX-2.15.0.60 It seemed to me that if change-playerlist: false, then this should not interfere with TabList.
My proposal without community input would be as follows: Given we find with further investigation that replacing the current metrics files histograms with histograms with empty bins doesn't negatively effect any known uses of these histograms, I think this would be the best solution and I would implement that option, along with any other changes for histogram sizes that come up with further testing. So far, we have not found an issue with putting in the properly sized histograms.  @nh13 The use case where we ran into this was in the MetricsFileTest. There were previously no tests for getHistogram and upon implementing them, and continuing with its current test format of a function that 'writesThenReadsBack' the metrics file to a file, then reads it back into a new metrics file object and tests to see if these metrics files are equal, it fails on any metrics file containing multiple histograms of different sizes because of the 0s that get filled into the histograms upon writing to a file.

Hi @saudet ,  Can confirm that also happens on JavaCV-1.4.1     Please let me know if you have any other questions or need any further info. Thank you very much in advance for your help. Cheers!
@bhariharan Unfortunately the issue still exists. Exactly same behaviour as described

Hi! Thanks for helping on this.  I think I found the reason. I add connection listener after the very first `hub.fireConnect()` gets called, which causes first update to `map` is skipped since `listenersMap` was empty. Then when I shutdown my redis server, `maps.replace` in `hub.fireDisconnect` doesn't work because the `addr` is still not included in `maps`.  Another question I have is, looks like hub.fireDisconnect() will only be triggered when there is an action requiring a connection to redis server and it's failed? Does it mean if my redisson client only acts as a subscriber in a PUBSUB flow, my connection listener will never get a onDisconnect() callback when redis server is down, unless I send another command to that server? Is it correct?  Thanks! 
Okay, i tested it. Works :+1:    Thank you :) 
Sadly no, it happens in our own project. I will look into it and come back to you.
Yes you are completely right, starting at line 318 (which follows a line containing Unicode characters!) the highligthing is messed up. 
Hi @syvasoft we use it functionality for call a custom form in a window, then when you press the button, the form is launched instead the process. The next step for it is make form dynamically for the "Create From" like "Create From" in Purchase Order or Statement Account.  We are change it in https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere/issues/114 
Everything works as intended despite the logged errors.

I haven't had a chance to try the master code yet but I did scan through the class and it looks like the push() method is now applying the mapping before EACHing the values. Once I get a chance to check I'll confirm 100% but in principal, it should be fixed... 
Thanks @keith -- sorry, was too busy making sure I filled all the fields in and starting `git bisect` to .. fill all the fields in.  
@gavinking Sorry for the late response (I missed the email alert).  You're correct about this not being a problem in Java 8.  I only stumbled on this by accident after changing my default JDK in one Eclipse JDT project and having it magically apply to all projects.

@danieloeh I will pay attention now that I upgraded to 0.9.7.5. 
i find the problem  , my API  call is missing .json   the wrong sequence is  Popup_Person_Biography URL: /yamj3/api/rescan/person/18837 jQuery.js:9666 GET http://jean-luc-pc:8888/yamj3/api/rescan/person/18837?callback=jQuery111009818633103277534_1447881658956&_=1447881658961 500 (Server Error)  the right one : /yamj3/api/rescan/person/18837.json 
I am not sure if this will actually work in our approach due to: 1) Even if the connection is open before sending the batch, the race condition still exists: - connection is not established, I send the command without autoflushing disabled (internally, there's a connection promise), and when it's completed, the command is added to a connection buffer - I wait for the connection to be established, I get the same promise (AsyncConnectionProvider.getConnection(...)). - When promise completes (meaning the connection is established), 2 actions start at the same moment:     1. add command to the command buffer (internally in lettuce)    2. flush commands (externally by my code). - If for any reason `flush commands` action is quicker, the command would not be flushed. 2. In cluster mode connections are stored [by slot](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/blob/master/src/main/java/io/lettuce/core/cluster/PooledClusterConnectionProvider.java#L103), iterating over 16384 connection before flushing would be bad from performance point of view.

I am using Android 6.0.1. I definitely did not use the camera button. But I am not sure if used the gallery button or if I selected files from the gallery and selected share it with Commons app.  PS: The described issue happened again with my last uploads: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Memorial_near_Hallerangeralm_-_3.jpg
@SubhrajyotiSen If I recall correctly, we implemented “Erase from notification” because Android didn’t support app actions.  Furthermore, notifications are supposed to be highly contextual (ie. they should appear after a certain conditions have been met and can easily be dismissed), rather than appearing permanently. So our original use of the notification seems hacky.
@costin  hi, I am sorry that i do not know how this bug is triggered, and the error log is all in the image. There is no more information I can find. the sql is simple: select percentile(total_cost) as total_cost from adserver-2018.11.23 where "@timestamp">'xxx' and "@timestamp" < 'xxx'. But in fact I had been modifing the sql request for debuging, so I am not sure what sql triggered this bug.  
Thanks a lot! :D 
Yes, they destroying arena blocks 
sure, I'll have a look. the fix sounds good. The second bug doesn't need a click outside the image, however: you can just move the shape outside at the top when you hold its bottom.

Hi Stefan,  The /apps/example/tests folder is created with the correct jcr:primaryType - 'cq:ClientLibraryFolder'.  Thanks, Naveen 
@serge-rider   According to [the release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/release-9-2.html), the change happened on 9.2 [E.51.2.6. Monitoring](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/release-9-2.html#AEN123771). Also, CTEs weren't available until 8.4  pg_locks view didn't change, I believe.

Sorry, false alarm, I did not copy the DTD during the DITA OT 1.6.1 integration in our DITA OT. I'll close this one. 
Thanks for the quick reply. Yes, the file is actually there. Is there a workaround to create an .IPA file? I've tried "./gradlew createIPA", which is working well, except that it uses the development code signing identity instead of the distribution code signing identity. Is there a way to change this?

Yes it is set with the server running. Why would a server reset the config back to the previous state after a restart though? Also what would be the point of having the ability to change a setting live in the game with a command if it reverts or the ability to reload the config after changing the setting VIA the config file. 
I added sdk to Settings app. It's a system app in kitkat. We can't compile Settings app use Eclipse or other IDE. We must use: . build/envsetup.sh lunch [your device] make Settings But Android Kitkat use ProGuard, version 4.4. So, compile will failed. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/proguard/+/android-4.4.4_r2/src/proguard/ProGuard.java 
I'm trying to configure Aspire Watchface. And tried with both on and off background js. 
I am *so* sorry I haven't had a chance to check this out. I don't think I can do it on the boxes where I'm using it "in anger", but I will try and at least spin up a nano or something with a similar config and give it a quick whirl.
 Sorry just saw this. I will try to get you some.  
Yes that would be great if you could create it :-) 
@davidjgonzalez  I see that resourceResolver.map() is expected to do encoding.  I don't know how it is implemented and what kind of encoding it supports, but I have no encoded values in transformed values. I wrote some tests, where it can be seen that '&' char is not changed after the mapping See https://github.com/sblano4ka/aem_tests/blob/master/src/test/java/com/sblano4ka/ResourceResolverMapTest.java  ResourceResolverMapTransformerFactory can still decode value but maybe query parameters should be ignored in this case 
Thanks; will do. I'll revert back if the issue continues. 
This issue was reported by automated testing.  I never reproduct it too. Can we try  `expTable[((logTable[a] + logTable[b]) % (modulus - 1) + (modulus - 1)) % (modulus - 1)];` to solve the problem?
We will soon open source the project that triggers this issue, so it can be easily replicated by the Payara team.
I download the game from PlayStore, tab on the icon and it throws that error message: "Happy Can has stopped": https://imgbbb.com/image/LRj62G  Exception class: java.lang.verifyError

The unbreaking enchantment is able to be applied via the enchanting table though - and it is used in the code to reduce power cost by adding a chance to not consume power on usage. If Unbreaking isn't desired for this effect, is it possible to add a new enchantment for powered tools that specifically reduces power draw?
Hi, thanks for the response. I also discussed this in the Processing Android forum. A few others reported same experience. Made the simple example sketch. After installing it's approximately 7mb. Each time you run the sketch the buffer expands. Made some screenshots, see attachments. Total size on the device keeps growing.  I also very much appreciate it when Blepdroid would work again. Updating previous build, or new,  BLE sketches isn't possible any more. Don't see other Buetooth Low Energie possibilities.  Thanks again for all good work.

Hi Tyler,  the docker mount works on the Codenvy Version 5.0.0-M4 environment on my personal account: `docker run --rm -it --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse --name codenvy-mount -v /c/Users/sklose/mount:/mnthost codenvy/che-mount 40.114.82.27 34457`  But we need it on our Bitnami Google Image (which is Che version 4.7.2. Build Time :2016-09-09 10:26:29)  you can check it out if you try to mount my che workspace on ount bitnami google cloud (Standard password)  `docker run --rm -it --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse --name codenvy-mount -v /c/Users/sklose/mount1:/mnthost codenvy/che-mount 146.148.115.101 32774`  In our installation che server and workspace server are on the same google vm which got one external IP Address (146.148.115.101 at the moment). you can logon to the workspace with putty.  I would very much appreciate also an working example with  che mount using the cli directly.  Thanks in advance  Stefan  PS: If I install Che version 4.7.2. on my laptop I can mount the workspace - so it must be something with the bitnami google installation [https://community.bitnami.com/t/eclipse-che-on-google-compute-engine-can-not-be-mounted/44795](https://community.bitnami.com/t/eclipse-che-on-google-compute-engine-can-not-be-mounted/44795) 
@JohnWowUs I am using Picasso 2.5.2 and the ImageView is as follows: `<ImageView                             android:id="@+id/company_logo_image_view"                             android:layout_width="66dp"                             android:layout_height="66dp"/>`  It works with and without `fit()` on RGB images, and it works only without `fit()` on CMYK images.

After work I add the logcat. Also I send a crash report with the issue number. 
I did indeed miss out the `groups-treated-as-primary` but that doesn't seem to be the cause of the error. I also removed the `bind-address` section entirely.    Ticket #172 seems to have to the same sort of conclusion, and as such there are two tickets on the same thing... best if one of them is closed imo. 
Sure - I don't think the logs have rolled since the one I attached above, so this should be the same as that one with today's shinanigans appended.  [idea.log.zip](https://github.com/consulo/consulo/files/963089/idea.log.zip)  Interesting that (on Windows 10) the logs go in "(home dir)/AppData/Local/Consulo" while the plugins directory and other config is in "(home dir)/AppData/Roaming/Consulo".
Thanks for your answer.  Here's the same trace from the Quarkus CI. This one should align with the `vm-19.3.0` tag.  
 The thing being called is a TDI fun which writes a file. It does complete Waiting before exiting does not help  The behavior is seen if the client (doing the dispatch on the node) is TCL, Tree.Tcl, or Node.dispatch().    The behavior is always fine if the dispatching program stays running. 
Found the issue in 2.3.4 with FTB Unstable. Tried 2.3.5 with only neotech and bookshelf 2.3.0 and had the same problem. 
I test with the two available datasets. 
@MGaetan89 Yeah, but it can't support `drawable` resource type when i wana a `selector`.
Delete, move all operations : from or to SD card.. will prompt me need SD card access permissions (dailog box) as soon as I click ok app crashes.. I tryed reinstalling.. clear cache.. not get solution.. plz help
This fixed the problem. Thank you very much! 
Right, I'm saying that the table check isn't enough. Rather than getting the type of the enchantment, and querying that, query the enchant itself.  See the referenced issue for what's happening. I have admittedly handled it on my end, but you should probably take care of it here too. :)
I'll try again, but it blows up trying to install.... ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20825058/63969450-be498c00-ca56-11e9-8992-f0ae693aa836.png)  LOL! scrap that.... I had DBeaver running in another virtual desktop.... HOWEVER, while I am an idiot, your installer should be smart enough to detect that and tell me, "hey, idiot, you have an instance running, shut it down before installing..." {paraphrasing of course}
My phone is a nexus 5 with a 1920x1080 screen on which I changed the DPI setting to 360 dpi, which means the virtual size of the screen 6.12 inches. The real size (though I don't think it matters here) is 4.95 inches.  The tablet is a lenovo a3000 which does not have any fancy setting, it has a resolution of 600x1024 and a size of 7 inches. 
Thx @nmervaillie I'll check and give some feedback.

Hi, @aliaksander-samuseu! It happen directly after installation (setup.py). No errors in setup.log. No additional changes.  oxTrust calls check_ssl in cycle (~5 sec), but check_ssl does not work. 
I'm using `java 1.8.0_112`. Yes, indeed as it's not static class, the first parameter in the constructor became the instance of the parent class.
That's the full error, it occurs in startup when MySQL connection is set and tables are created.  I'm using paper 1.13.2 build 627 and LoginSecurity 3.0.0  I fixed this by changing this command when a I create the database.  `` CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME> CHARACTER SET latin1; ``

@bpauli I have created a new Content Fragment Model through the UI containing a single text field.   Based on that CFM I have created the testfragment: [testfragment-corecomponents.zip](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/files/3865390/testfragment-corecomponents.zip)  
Well, when using the web ui, the Save to Json and Save to CSV buttons no longer work, they pop up in a weird location and nothing happens when you click on them. I'm sorry if that's generic, not sure how to be more specific. 
All servers are specified in connection uri. Once no active error is encountered from passive, it is treated as handshake error and connection establisher doesn't try next in the list.
When you select a range of cells and click on clear content, the contents are not deleted. However, if you close the book and reopen the book, you will find out that the contents of the range you selected are deleted.
sorry for my late reply. You are right, my problem didn't solved. I found it out about a half of hours after i paste the item in vault.  my vault is inside the sd card with this format "Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)". Do i need to change the formate of the card in order to make it works? thanks 
Hi @martijnvg - Sorry! It was just a copy/paste error. I had the right description for that step, but grabbed the wrong JSON block. I've updated my issue - does it make more sense now?
You will find a sample in this repository : https://github.com/dcdh/thorntail-helloworld.git  You need to have an openshift running with a developer namespace having developer defined as password (if using the *openshift-run-developer.sh* script provided).

Hi Eric! I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 using the latest Snap installation of Intellij Ultimate with latest version of the plugin. I haven't used Nape is quite a while, so not sure when this started.  I've got a moderate speed improvement by using code completion from the compiler. It also seems to help if I try and reduce the code context by adding: `haxe3` and `NAPE_RELEASE_BUILD` flags to the project settings. I can see these are used in the Nape source code.  
Java tooling looks OK. The stack trace of :    leads to the correct java file. However, if you call if from ceylon (`Jbug.main(javaStringArray(Array<String>{}));`), the `run.ceylon` line in the stack trace opens the wrong file.

@Ennosigaeon we have to release a new version of the platform ASAP. So we decided to move the current development into the [`tmp-develop`](https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/tree/) branch, fix the most important bugs and release the next version.   Moving on in this branch shouldn't make it more complicated for you to delete the faulty commits in develop, right?
@SherifWaly sure, just look in the specification, for special chars such as '>' or '|-', it's regarding that topic. But this is a rather big task, we might need to have other implementations of Scalar... you can have a look, but I won't assign this task yet, I need to think about it. Of course, if you have any idea, open issues and we can discuss them there :D

Take a look at the code I mentioned; these are hardcoded constants that are not influenced by the configuration.  This is a `@SpringBootApplication` with the `@Import(KatharsisConfigV3.class)` annotation.
I've just tried it on glassfish 2.1.1 and sadly glassfish v2 doesn't like the command in the different order.  So I will keep my fork for glassfish 3. 
I'd like you to give the snapshot a try and tell me if it fixes your issue.  Once I have that, I'll do the release.
Sorry, I should have mentioned that I use DITA-OT 1.7.2, that is the latest one. 
I'm switching to the unified account by tapping on the account icon in the drawer header. If they are "not supposed to be displayed", does that mean that the unified spam folder is a discontinued feature?  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14153182/69827531-032cbc80-1218-11ea-9ac3-739e95832030.png)  Edit: I played a bit around and came to the observation that the folders sometimes show up when k9 fetches new mails.
Yeah, I will try to get some code ready that isolates the issue, but I do have one update - if I remove the jackson parsing from the middle of the stream service -> IterablePublisher the issue does go away.  Maybe if the Iterator that the IterablePublisher reads off of isn't able to keep up with the rate the client can consume the data? 
I installes syncany with Homebrew and then the gui plugin with syncany itself.    How can I update syncany to 0.4.3?

I have created my own tap detector for now but thanks for looking. Re #405 I think that mouseX etc is updated after each draw() cycle so if touches is operating in a separate thread, and mouseX will always be the previous value.
@iloveeclipse yeah although a small fix, it's cool for me to contribute, please help me review the PR https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/807
Hello @lenhard   Sadly both options didn't work for me.  Maybe you can understand my problem better with this gif.  ![2017-10-15_19-58-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2507037/31588001-9a25c0ba-b1e3-11e7-903b-f718559711b7.gif)   
No problem, it's not a critical issue for me - just wanted to make you aware of it.  I have a LG G3 d855 with CM 13 nightly 2016-02-05. Strangely it didn't happen the last 2-3 days, so it looks like even I can't reproduce it reliably any more. Afaik Doze Mode shouldn't even activate when the device is plugged in, so maybe this is an Android/CM/device bug.  I'll experiment the next few days with [Testing your app with Doze](http://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#testing_doze), maybe something comes up. I just tried it for a few minutes - the alarm was ignored when idle (as expected?), but logging resumed once the device came out of idle.  Let me know if I can help you in any other way. 
Hi Hunterness,  I tested with the new neo4j java driver 1.7.2 and the issue hasn't come resurfaced so I'm going to close the issue. Thx
Yes it recovers without any problem.  I was asking if the plugin is open source to see if I could provide a PR, but I can't :).
ok i'll try that ;)

@h6ah4i Thanks for fixing this. I tried the branch and it is working great! 
> Thanks for report. Can you attach a log on at least `DEBUG` level of the failing `INSERT` operation? It looks like `INSERT … ON CONFLICT UPDATE` generates two `CommandComplete` messages.  I can't enable debug level on this host. And I can't reproduce it on localhost. :(
@itzikBraun   That hasn't fixed it. Now the sample app is crashing. All you seem to have done in the commit is not set the typeface and hence cause the Null Pointer Exception.  Is there more code that you meant to push? 
I think you mis understood what I'm saying ;) 
It seems to be intermittent. There doesn't appear to be any pattern, but I have noticed this morning that the count on the notification stated 3 messages, but there were 7 (including 3 in a mailing list thread) that had come in. I'll try a day or so with the threading display off to see if that makes a difference.
Soo.. Thanks for your response. Now I have next exception:  I've try to find root cause of this in my proxy, but so far unsuccessfully.
Hi, Thanks for your replies, with the last version of F-Droid (0.95.1), the download of v0.1.34-alpha-b00  works! 
For the most basic example, I create the drawer. When it slides out all content is clickable but when clicked will click the content area and close the drawer.  `DrawerGrarment mDrawerGarment = new DrawerGarment(this, R.layout.slidingdrawer_contents);` 
Yes, it happens when I log out. If I only close tab and stay logged in I continue to be able to log in remotely.

The app-init can call a method, e.g. `Settings.isInitialized()` which is mostly the same as present. Then it can start the settings-activity. The current method in Settings, which causes the problem, request also this method and returns null, like we have it now.  **edit:** Easier: Make `Setting.isInitialized()` public and call it together with `Setting.getLogin()` in the init-process. `getLogin()` return either login-credentials or null and is not involved in starting the settings-activity. 
no csploit.log file is there. 
Just noticed that NAME: command works with 'Execute SQL Statement' but doesn't work with 'Execute SQL Statement in a new tab'. 
That parses exactly as written, but the label from a list production is still getting declared as a cons list so that rule doesn't work correctly. 
Hm, so that would be the same version that I have    Not sure what would cause this difference, just raising the issue :-) . This isn't all this important to me, as I can build the agent without running the tests, so feel free to skip this issue if it does not bother anyone else. 
As I said in Bug description; just use an command for example that spawns a Panda at your location, ask for the type of the latest spawned entity and print it in a message. It should return something like 'panda', but it just returns nothing. Also when you spawn a cat at your location and ask for the type of latest spawned entity, it should return 'cat' - but it returns 'damageable mob'.   Sorry that I cannot send a code snippet, I am on my mobile. Here's an example but without tabs.   command /test: trigger: spawn a cat at player set {v} to type of latest spawned entity message "%{v}%"   That same thing for a panda and see what it returns. I think, you dont really need "type of" but.. Test it on your own. For me in both ways for panda the message returns just nothing and following code under it isnt gonna to be executed as I found out, and for the cat the message returns 'damageable mob' 
So If I set 10000 I'm getting same error. Looks like default value is too big.
@dizzzz Use the jar installer, then launch eXist via the start menu (using the launcher).  I have no idea if 32 bit is relevant here, but shutting down the machine definitely used to work on this very same machine with eXistdb 2.2. Same Java8, same setup. 
I will try LavaPlayer tomorrow, thanks for the hint. ;)  Nonetheless I think the built-in player should be free of critical bugs. Even if I decide to use another player I think this bug is worth fixing.  EDIT: Tried LavaPlayer today. Feels very counter-intuitive to me and adds whopping 10 MB to the final jar file.
@davideas Hello, i added sample  [https://github.com/Vladislav-Z/flexiblebug](url)
After speaking with Matt about this, I believe there was an onError function showing custom error output and not outputting line numbers properly so looks like this is probably a non-issue. 
Hi Tyler,   The idea behind this proof of concept is to build a graphic editor completely agnostic about languages it is processing (UML, BPMN, ecore, ADL, Jackson notation, flow charts, ...). The piece of software implementing the editor would be the same for every possible language, and language specificities will be encapsulated in the specific object palette and in the language server that would process the diagrams, providing similar services to the ones that current language servers provide to text editors through Language Server Protocol. Current graphic tools already provide some of those services, but they have similar issues to the ones that made possible the inception of LSP, as a tight coupling between editors & languages.   This aim can be achieved in two different ways: 1. Generating a text representation of the graphic diagram and using LSP as it is to process that text representation (the path chosen for the proof of concept) 2. Augment LSP to match requirements to process graphical models (maybe to be able to define a diagram as a list of SVG objects with specific properties, this idea is in a very early stage)  The usage I envision for a tool like this, is inside the "design studio" component that many high level tools (e.g. a telecommunications operator management tool) need to allow users to build their processes. With an approach like this, it would be very easy to add new types of "process" to the tool, just adding an object palette and the language server to process that palette. I feel there is plenty of market for an idea like this, and I also think that Che is the ideal platform for such a component.  The idea of this query was to get some hints about how to use the code available in the provided LanguageServer Editor in Che to build the link between the JavaScript editor and the language server in the simplest and easiest way...

Hi Florian, Yes, it works great in 3.5.0. I just double-checked.

@kalessil I used `?User` as return type just for example. In my current project I have some methods, that incapsulate some db queries and return some AR records (Yii2). In some cases method called few times. First time in validator, that know how to deal with `null` result, and another time in some action method, that running after validation and can be called only after validation passed. In this case, method unable to return `null`.  Also, it's a bit weird to see inspection detecting every nullable variable usage, but not first time access (because after first call it will be NPE or valid object of expected type).

@tinwelint thanks for the response.  I will provide the details you asked for as soon as I get in the office.  A few things though: the bug you're referring to is a later version of this one that I also reported.  I figured they were the same issue, and as far as I can remember, @dmontag experienced the same behavior described in this report - cache type none just made the truncated result set consistent instead of fixed after second run.  Also, I gave Neotechnology access to the server with this data on it (along with some reproduction queries/steps), so you're more than welcome to jump on the box and play around with it.  Lastly, I don't know what your schedule looks like, but we're supposed to have a conference call at 10:30AM EST today (June 18, 2013) regarding this bug, so if you're interested and able to it might be good to jump on it (Mike Linetsky organized/engineer Chris).  Either way, I'll collect and post the data you requested.  Thanks again. 
I havent the savegame anymore but i will try to reach that point again.  Do you mean the corrupted savegame or a savegame before those levels?

@skabashnyuk I had trouble getting Che 6 workspaces to start. Sorry I didn't write down the error message but the workspace complained about having to have at least 1 stdin,stdout,stderr. I think I was using HTTPS so when I get another chance I'll try HTTP.
Thanks for the response to this. At the moment I'm using a parameter type definition defined as {number} that matches both integer and float returning a Double.  This would provide a nice bases to work up a generalized (polymorphic) number matcher that works as suggested.  Time permitting I would like to help with adding this as a new feature.  There are a couple of other ideas based on what our Business experts are putting in features that might also be useful; i.e. lists in step definitions' "And applying adjustments 1, 1.32, 2.67, 3, 3.86, 4.2" 
Hi,  thanks for your prompt reply, yes i would really like to contribute in  some way. I have been an OWASP member for some time but did not  contribute in any way yet. We will see how much i am able to support  you, I think seraphimdroid could be a great aid in the protection of  android users like myself. ;)  In the permission scanner every app shows a Green symbol which i thought  means it is not potentially malicious (maybe i have misinterpreted the  green for OK?)  But on every app update or new installed app (via google play or manual  .apk installation (unknown sources)) it always says "the application you  installed may be malicious".  Best Regards  Max M.

HI @Lyeeedar  I can't upgrade to 6.2.4 because my currently version is 2.2.0 so I need update to version 4.2.0 first. Do you have any solution ?
Hi Herve,   Not to worry, we had a work around using CSV files.   I have downloaded and updated the new version, but I’m at a client site all day behind firewalls, so I will try to have a look at it tomorrow when I’m back in my normal environment at my office.   And thank you so much for your contribution to Archi. You truly make a difference for myself and my clients.  Regards, Thomas   
Hi,  this pre-release fixes the problem. Thanks! 
No swords involved on my side, neither on crafting any block nor equipped. Will post crash log to woot, too. 
I downloaded the launcher form terasology.org, and from the launcher installed the latest stable build which is labeled "#76 alpha...," so I'm not certain where the alpha version is listed ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19863828/45935074-d70b1100-bf6c-11e8-8fb4-9b267997f684.png)
build 108 for 1.10.2 . I see there is a new build out this morning I will give that a try.

yes. 30 minutes is set, notifications are enabled. disable marking as read... is disabled and enable notifiaction sound is enabled.
Good question.  We could trigger a download of all assets known by the campaign file but not already cached but that might actually take longer than the GM wants to deal with at that time.  A warning when logging in as a remote GM that only used/viewed assets will be transferred? 
Filename pattern: {table}_${timestamp} -> {table}_{timestamp}  With our without the $ sign, the file name is always the same. I try to export a json file. See this: ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6271057/36643999-d689c1ae-1a53-11e8-946a-5167ccf3b425.png)  Without the $ sign, I get a json file on my desktop which is just fine and contains my data as expected.
Hey @luigidellaquila   I am not sure how to help you reproduce it.  Each time I try to query a batch of elements that are in a range, I get this exception.

Off course. It is just a simple project with spring-boot-starter-velocity who use Tomcat as servlet container and is executable jar. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9PUSyNx7RbFLTNJR19sV085RTg/view?usp=sharing  Edit: Just a little change in `application.properties`:  `spring.velocity.toolbox.config.location=toolbox.xml` (remove this) `spring.velocity.toolbox-config-location=toolbox.xml` (add this)  Sorry for inconvenience. 
It's the faithful 32 texture pack.  When I edited the font pack out to use the default font, the bug is fixed but the background color still looks weird 
Can we extend the functionality of RuleRegistry with method requestUniqueID() ? 
Unfortunately, I reinstalled the server and deleted all logs without taking a screenshot. I will replicate the bug again and will post as soon as I get my hands on Test Env
The main account is :  - manually set by the user if he defined a key manager - automatically set as soon as a key manager has be referenced (first account in the key manager) - null if no key manager has been referenced in ethdroid or there is an empty one.   This logic allows the user to do lot of things with few configurations.

@eivantsov Yes, but the setting doesn't work unless I invoke the content assist with ctrl+space. I expect it to pop automatically based on the context, for example, it would be better if the content assist automatically show when typing “.” to get available methods. Currently any content assist must start with ctrl+space or "Content Assist" from the menu.
I tried building in Android Studio, but it fails with what looks like Java 9 dependencies.  I just switched to IntelliJ and that seems to be working.  My end goal is experimenting to make some changes to be used in an Android app.  Am I missing something from that page?

Yeah, it should. I'm currently testing building a simple app for the Xcode 6 simulator and device (my iOS 7.1 iPhone 5). I will close this once I verified that things still work. So you may want to wait until I close this issue. 
At project level:     dependencies {         classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.3'         classpath "io.realm:realm-gradle-plugin:5.3.0"     } At app level: apply plugin: 'realm-android'  This is building fine. When I change 5.3.0 to 5.4.0, the build error comes about.
I know OkHttp 4 has been rewritten in Kotlin, so not sure what to suggest here.  Personally, I would like OkHttp classes that are APIs, such as `Headers`, to explicitly not have Kotlin classes in method signatures, class inheritance, type parameters, etc. That would ensure maximum usability from Java 11 + JPMS, as the only dependencies an application would need to require in `module-info.java` would be Java-only ones.  I don't think it's a Kotlin issue as they need to remain Java 6 compatible and such, so for Kotlin JPMS modules are far far away.  However, removing `implements Iterable<kotlin.Pair>` may be an incompatible change, so I raised this issue just as a heads-up, as there is an easy workaround to iterate over `Headers`.  Trying to iterate over `Headers` using `Iterable` would not even compile with Java 11 + JPMS, so it's a hard error, but as I said easily workaroundable with a small code change. I only found this example in my usage of OkHttp, but it may be possible that there are other cases where there is no work around.
Yeah.  Version is 0.2.5 (latest) and using Android platform.  For now I've changed my local copy so line 121 always assigns 'BillingProductType.INAPP' since I'm not using subscriptions.  The same issue occurs on line 158 too.  It looks like it's taking in a string from the 'product' json response and assigning it to BillingProduct's 'type' field ( 'BillingProductType' enum) without conversion.  The compiler isn't complaining because .fromIterable treats the input as dynamic so it doesn't know 'product' is a list of strings.  I'm not sure the best way to convert String to enum in dart, but this seems to work: `BillingProductType.values.firstWhere((e) => e.toString == product['type'])`
It also happens on trunk from the git repository, which was what I developed my patch off of.  To reproduce it? Windows 10, JDK8, IntelliJ... and try to debug a JUnit5 unit test. I'd have to set up a minimal case for you otherwise. I'll work on that in a bit.
I was using version 0.8.4, I update to 0.8.5 and retried, but still it honors the @ApiModelProperty annotation on the public getter bug ignores the one specified in the private field 
My operating system is Ubuntu 16.04, 64 bit. I can't find the version, but I know it's the one I got with Ubuntu's `sudo apt install arduino`. I've found something on it that says 1.0.5, but I don't know if that's what it is.  Also, rereading my bug report, I'm realizing I don't like how I described the issue. Let me try again:  This code:  has a problem.

Thanks for the feedback. My main concern is when we release a new version and we update the metadata to point to the new version. This potential window where we'd show the old version is the critical aspect of it. And quite frustrating since the metadata is immutable the rest of the time really. If that's the only option we need to figure how an acceptable windows for the upgrade use case.
 After I opened Eclipse,I'm not able to reproduce the empty main screen. I restarted the computer , started ZAP however I still get the 'unsupported option message' 
I am using java 8 , including janusgraph 0.2.0 as dependency and 3 node cassandra cluster for backend storage. Please let me know If anything specific you want to know.
Spring 4.2.4. I am afraid we are not using spring-osgi. I tried to add some dependency for spring-osgi but that led to some compilation errors within our code which should not happen of course.
A window pops up saying that the files couldn't be found. So my guess would be that the path lines in the first 4 lines of the script had some issue. And since the window went away after trying I needed to add a read statement to be actually able to read what the problem was.

Running OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 KDE Plasma 5 Intel graphics Java 8  I think it was running with the JavaFX software pipeline: -Dprism.order=sw Unsure if gtk3 was enabled or not with -Djdk.gtk.version=3. I have to check when I'm back at work on Monday. Perhaps try with/without either of these settings. Until then I will try running the test application at my home computer tomorrow, where I am running the same Linux distribution, but it has better NVIDIA graphics. I will also try running it with Java 10.   Should the needle be at the center(top) position if the value is outside of minValue/maxValue? I see that the needle is at bottom left side if value is lower than minValue and bottom right side if value is higher than maxValue. When the needle goes from one side to the next it is disappeared.
It is `filesystem` location
I don't think it's a matter of 2D vs 3D. If you have a game where you control the player or something else  with the mouse (e.g. MOBA or Strategy Game controls) not clamping the mouse can often-times result in unwanted behavior, especially in full-screen mode. I agree though, that maybe this shouldn't be the default.
I started from the Spring skeleton, platform 14.0.10
Hello @surli   I am using this maven repository core  With PACKAGE_SEPERATOR '.' before as shown above. Which is creating the compilation issue.  I hope I was able to explain my requirement. Your insights would help in understanding if I am missing something here.  Regards Sourabh
I have tried it based on the wiki that you created in **_[this link](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/wiki/Compatibility-of-Android-O-Service)_** regarding foreground services, and the references that I use to bring up notifications on **_[this link](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/demo/NotificationSampleActivity.java)_**. I matched this code with the one in the reference I used, but the notification didn't appear but the download process continued.  It looks like something is wrong with your library, especially on the **NotificationManager**. I tried to use the **NotificationManager** without this library and the notification appeared. My advice, try adding it also for the use of foreground, I've tried it this way    and succeed.
Just checked. Onclick does fire on the device, but not on the simulator. Ontrigger is exactly the other way around: it works on the simulator but not on the device. I'm using them both now as a workaround. 
I can't see a version number for the add on, but I'm using ZAP 2.5.0, and no available updates are showing on the Manage Add-Ons screen. 
Hi Coda,  I saw you have already made a fix for this so maybe this comes a bit late.  Anyway the way the problem manifests itself is simply that data does not appear in graphite. I couldn't find any errors in graphite logs so it just silently fails.  Thanks for the fix and thanks for a great library.

I am using MCPC+ and asynchronous chunkloading is enabled.  This was not an issue before now.  I can try with the async chunkoading turned off if it would help however this error seems to come and go from time to time...even if I remain stationary keeping the nearby chunks consistently loaded. 
Sorry @saudet . I will check this out.

We are using this API to implement a web feature for voice.mozilla.org.  Full story: our website downloads audio clips with some important metadata in response headers. This API, createObjectURL, allows us to pass the audio data from an XMLHttpRequest object to an audio element src, which means we still have access to the response headers. If we were instead to just set the audio src (without using XMLHTTPRequest), we don't have access to reponse headers.There are workarounds for this (multiple requests for one), but this method is extremely convenient for this use case.
It was a simple Search query with params as query.

Hello, I've quickly tested java relay server today and haven't seen any connection to stack up. I was unable to test rust implementation because I couldn't build it.  Thanks.
No, for example during echange but it works even with this error. 
Can't reproduce anymore on stable-develop, closing for now. 
Thank you for your quick fix @lbroudoux! I just pulled the latest Docker image, and was able to import and test our use-case further.  For Keycloak, I don't seem to have any errors with the functionality, it just jumped out at me as something potentially related to the reported issue. The configuration I'm using is the default docker-compose file found in the Microcks repository. Happy to help troubleshoot further, but this doesn't appear to be impacting me for testing Microcks locally.
Yes. Both, file and folder with the same name within the same parent directory. And yes, I'm familiar with vaults and can assure the problem is definitly related to file structure. Moreover, there are a lot of other files and folders (beside the corrupted ones) in the same parent directory which are absolutely clean. 
Huh!  Actually, I had already changed my key mapping in main/settings.ini.  It turns out this was the problem.  I used a lower-case 'x' instead of an upper-case 'X' for keyShoot2.  Well, chalk this one up to user error.  Sorry about that.

Hmm, the phone and Pebble Classic were both just laying on my desk (20-40cm apart from each other) while I was sleeping, so no moving, no (active nor passive/missed) phone call or anything in between. Also no missed call in the morning. Could just be that I got some e-mails, but this also never had any influence on the connection behaviour of Gadgetbridge (while wearing it or just over night laying on my desk).  Last time was also "randomly" without phone call before (but I was driving my car 2 weeks ago). If I am doing phone calls they get announced on the Pebble, but afterwards Pebble stays initialized in Gadgetbridge. So doing phone calls or getting phone calls have never made issues/problems.  And yep, I am on latest 2.9.1 firmware.  Maybe there is a "alive" package from phone or Gadgetbridge missing while bluetooth connection is active and therefore Pebble closes the connection? I mean I was able by tapping on Pebble (in Gadgetbridge) one or two times to get connection initialized again. Therefore I assume that bluetooth was still working and Pebble is recognized as Pebble and not as Mi-Band or anything else like versions before. What could be, I also had the problem, that if coming home while taking phone with me and Pebble stays at home, that I had to switch bluetooth on and off to connect to Pebble again.  (But I do not remember if I first tested just tapping on Pebble in Gadgetbridge or not, but automatically reconnecting was also not working. But from this behaviour I also missed to save a log. I will check in the afternoon after coming home again how/if phone will connect to Pebble and will paste the logs.) 
Hi，,@DaveCTurner Thank you for your reply! I think you are right, I enabled write caching on the disk. And I hope I can detect the error by elasticsearch-shard. while I insert data by bulk api, kill the elasticsearch. I delete the bottom line and some bytes in translog-2.tlog, then running the elasticsearch-shard:  And this is my data_path file.

The question is how "rootPath" is defined as a LSP term in Che?  Moreover, how should I deal with it:   > Thus, because of the lack of information for LS about when modules will be resolved, I have to define such kind of Che's behavior as non-deterministic.  I expect that Che will send the root path (e.g. /projects/milti-module) also when all sub-modules are resolved.
Ah yes I see what you mean. I misunderstood the message. I tried 1.4.1 and the message seemed basically identical, at least for this case. Thx. 
Hello,  thanks for the quick reply!  Sure, below is a unit test that does reproduce the error. Details about the Environment are   - java 8 - spring-boot-starter-parent: 2.1.7.RELEASE - amqp-client: 5.4.3 - and using junit 5  I did try it on another project though with following specs, which actually works:   - java 11 - spring-boot-starter-parent: 2.1.9.RELEASE - amqp-client: 5.4.3 - and also using junit 5   
I cant give you the key but I will try and find out how it got made 
I have tested several android devices (3 of my own, 2 friends) both using wifi and mobile network, but the user account doesn't seem to matter, as none of them can get to the login screen.

Ah I see.   Yeah, that would work. And there wouldn't need to be any validation since that's already been done at an earlier stage. 
I am using the latest version from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/javacardopenpgp/), i.e. revision 13.  I also tried the [ykneo-opengpg applet](https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp), which resulted in the same problem. As you can see [here](https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp/blob/master/applet/src/openpgpcard/OpenPGPApplet.java#L631), an object called "cipher" is used to compute the signature. This object is initialized [here](https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp/blob/master/applet/src/openpgpcard/OpenPGPApplet.java#L203), using the [Cipher](https://jcardsim.org/jcardsim/javacardx/crypto/Cipher.html) class (which in my case is implemented by jCardSim).  My guess is, that this Cipher class behaves differently (concerning the PKCS1 padding) in jCardSim than in the original Java card. 
@deathbeam Nope. I'm pretty sure you just need to add the item id next to the SOTD.
I am happily going back and forth between the nether and the overworld. Going _to_ the end works just as fine, as well, only coming back is causing this issue.  Using mystcraft linking books has been safe so far, as well. (I have not tried custom ages, though. I installed mystcraft because of this problem.)

I found the root of this error, of course, is not the library error. library depends on " compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:24.2.1' ", but my Android studio2.2 did not download it.  And Gradle gave me an unrelated error。And when I download the library's demo run only when prompted this error. 
Yes, we have different self-parameterized classes, but also java's Enum can be listed as a cause of stack overflow, as Enum is in fact Enum&lt;E extends Enum&lt;E&gt;&gt;.  We have tried to use custom serializers for those unbounded generic classes (like Abc<T>), but it seems that gwt-jackson first analyzes the class hierarchy, before starting to generate the mappers and using custom serializers.  I have put some System.out.println into JTypeName.java, to log the visited classes, to trace what is happening. And as said, just the fact that some problematic class is on the classpath, and never used for the serialization, causes stack overflow, when matching Object or <?> fields. This means that if I have some java bean, with some Abc<?> field, every known class will be processed as a possible candidate for "?".  Because I saw many GWT UI classes, like ListBox etc, which are never serialized, not even referenced by the serialization classes, but were listed in the console.  I must mention, that this happens with GWT unit tests. Currently we cannot try this in the normal hosted mode in the browser. 
I emailed the link to both @ojw28 and then the dev.exoplayer@gmail.com address. The issue should be reproducible with that link. 
@dgarijo  Thanks for checking it out. I tried again. I downloaded the jar from https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/releases/download/v1.4.1/widoco-1.4.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar Still I dont get the provenance and time documentation.

workaround is user has to change the content of `components/api-mediation/bin/start.sh`  I don't know what triggers this, apparently, this problem was not spotted on marist and in rocket environment. We ran into this on broadocm system and when I was building docker images for 1.6.0

Ah, it seems like it doesn't crash with the sample URL. However with `bna show-url` it does:  
Here is my code snippet :                 PDDocument document = new PDDocument();               PDPage page = new PDPage();                PDPageContentStream contentStream;                contentStream = new PDPageContentStream(document, page);                InputStream alpha = new FileInputStream(new File(mainpath + File.separator +                  allFiles[i].getName()));                Bitmap alphaImage = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(alpha);                PDImageXObject ximage = JPEGFactory.createFromImage(document, alphaImage);                page.setMediaBox(new PDRectangle(ximage.getWidth(), ximage.getHeight()));                contentStream.drawImage(ximage, 0,0);                contentStream.fill();                contentStream.close();                document.addPage(page);                document.save(output);                document.close();
What I'm thinking now is to check network connection and retry pulling data multiple times (it will take some time, but it's better than fail) 
@andrewlewis I sent you the stream I used to reproduce the problem by e-mail

_Turns out it wasn't the Motion photos but photos I took in the Portrait mode of the camera, which allow you to set a custom background blur (it saves the blurred version but also an original). But this doesn't change the problem with the folders._  Looking more closely, I noticed there are a couple of things going on here:  **Original app** With the original NC app (with sync on for the `camera` folder): 1. I take a portrait photo 2. the app tells me there is a new media folder. This is the type mentioned above, named after the photo (so `camera/photoname/photoname.jpg`) 3. I ignore the notification and don't enable auto upload for this new folder 4. As the subfolder is part of a folder with auto upload on (the `camera` folder) the NC app uploads the new photos anyway but puts them straight into the `camera` folder.   **QA app** Then I disabled auto upload in the NC app, installed the QA version of the NC app, and enabled the auto upload function of the `camera` folder in there:  1. I take a portrait photo 2. The app silently creates a new folder inside the remote `camera` folder and uploads the images to this new folder.  In both cases the thumbnails on the `auto upload` overview in the NC app are NOT updated to show the new images (doesn't show anything in subfolders).    The result of the QA app makes sense: you get a folder with the new files, which is also the structure used on your mobile device. One (potentially huge) drawback of this new folder on the server is that it is... a folder. This means you can't easily browse your `camera` directory anymore, as you'll have to enter multiple subfolders to see their contents (which sometimes is just a single photo).  The gallery app on your phone gets around this problem by not treating them as folders; it presents you with a single image on the gallery overview, and when tapped it will use the other images in the folder in specific ways (original/edited versions, etc.) Of course the NC app could do something similar, but that would be way too specific behaviour for a project like NC.  **Final thoughts** I'm not sure what the best option would be. Any thoughts on this?  1. keep the old behaviour where the content of subfolders ends up in the parent folder.      Pro: easy to browse gallery pages on the server     Con: different structure from what is on the phone, images are not linked/related anymore (though you can use the name for custom scripts). 2. use the new method where subfolders are uploaded as subfolders     Pro: mirrors folder structure of phone 3. something else?     Con: makes it harder to browse images on server

@neozwu I tried running with 0.22.0 but forcing the version of auth to 0.7.1, and was unable to reproduce the error that way.  I also tried forcing 0.8.0 and wasn't able to reproduce the problem that way either.  So either I'm building it wrong or it's not the auth library.  From running `gradle dependencies` it looks like the force is working though.    
Strange... Basically this app is a WAR deployed into Tomcat instance, and the only relevant jars under WEB_INF/lib are: org.restlet.ext.simple-2.3.1.jar,org.restlet-2.3.1.jar,simple-5.1.6.jar  Can you direct me to possible points in the code where the response headers are set as Parameter? I'll try to debug and determine what may went wrong.. 
This bug caused two failures in the tests that monitor the REST APIs:  1. Because of the (incorrect) aggregation based on the of the duplicate transaction-IDs,  the resultant response of the /transactions API has less than 1000 entries. The pagination logic breaks as well. This caused the test that checks for 1000 entry response to fail.  2. There is a test that makes 2 queries - one without any timestamp constraint and the second with a timestamp < {timestamp of first entry returned by the first query}.  And it expects that the responses for these two API calls are offset by 1 transaction.   If the test is run between the successful and duplicate transactions, this test will  fail as well.  The screenshot attached showed that the transaction-id didn't match (Problem#2 above).  Subsequent testing observed that the check for 1000 entries fails as well.

Setting the ProxyTimeout indeed helps the download to complete. However it seems the download happens at the js level so I only get "save as" dialog widow of the browser when the file as been effectively downloaded locally.

As per my understanding, both remote system and server machine, are sending/receiving some packets but still, the remote machine unable to launch Che instance using the external IP address of the server.  **Remote machine** ![machine1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32622151/47954528-4c510500-df61-11e8-8529-a81177684ce8.png)  But on remote machine, unable to launch Che ![machine3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32622151/47954536-6559b600-df61-11e8-9694-d1ff223bde0b.png)  **Server Machine** ![server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32622151/47954541-74d8ff00-df61-11e8-952f-f35e2b181771.png)  ![server2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32622151/47954542-7c000d00-df61-11e8-94fa-88ae5e306967.png)  The application is up and running on server ![server3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32622151/47954545-828e8480-df61-11e8-9cf1-d4d6c5a3574a.png)  Not sure, what is going wrong over here where the application is up and runing on server in multi-user mode but still remote machine cannot launch the Che instance (even being on the same inetrnal network). Also trying to understand, if Che running on server machine logs or check the network packets.  I would appreciate your help in understanding this gap over here.  
The file has 1.5Mb.... it is the checkstyle report. 
I deleted data for Lawnchair, but the issue persisted.
Only thing that comes to mind is a verbosity config as it's just a warning and not an error specifically. 
Hi joakime, thank for your help so far.  We do not use .war files for deployment. Our apps are dropped into the webapps folder manually as entire folders. e.g. `${jetty.base}/webapps/exampleWebapp/`  Jetty notices the new folder and starts up the webapp as we are used to happening. With Jetty 7, removing the `exampleWebapp` folder would stop the app as in your video.  > Do you have a `${jetty.base}/webapps/myapp.xml` perhaps?  No, we do have something similar like: `${jetty.base}/webapps/exampleWebapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`. Is this the same?  > Have you customized the the default descriptor in any way?  I'm not sure what that is, sorry.  > Did you deploy myapp.war manually (not via the Deployment Manager) as well perhaps?  We deploy manually by untarring an app into webapps as a folder and not a .war package.  We do have one war file always deployed called root.war, which is just a small app to redirect htpp requests to the various webapps we currently have deployed depending on requested hostname.
It is ok now, Thank you :) 
Sure, will try it today.
1. I've not tried without -t parameter yet. I  passed -t parameter because i used changes for me in helm charts (i added some variables in the ConfigMap) 2. It was released version 
Same error 
I found the Ports and Firewall sections in the docs https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/networking. I don't understand what action to take from the Ports section, so I stopped my CentOS 7 firewall completely using #service firewalld stop.  Then I did another Create Workspace, this time I got   Error when starting agent. Unable to start workspace agent. Error when trying to start the workspace agent: Start of environment nodejs_app7 failed. Error: Error response from docker API, status: 500, message: Failed to Setup IP tables: Unable to enable SKIP DNAT rule: (iptables failed: iptables --wait -t nat -I DOCKER -i br-85cec8738ea8 -j RETURN: iptables: No chain/target/match by that name.

Yep. Sounds good. Just wanted to have discussion and noted plan. 
This test, when added to *UsingWithHttpClientTest.java*, will demonstrate the problem:  
I will try to explain my thoughts.  In the picture above there is 4 screenshots, lets call them 1,2,3,4 from left.  Picture 1 is the waiting state. Nothing happens. Green icon, alles OK. Picture 2 is the call state (call is made), AIMSICD gives warnings. The phone changes cell for the phone call from LTE to HSPA & PSC shows up.  Picture 3 is after the call has ended  & the phone connects back to its normal LTE cell number. PSC is still there & phone states it's on LTE cell & the cell number is the LTE cell.   Picture 4 is the phone after 5 minutes in waiting state & the PSC is still there on LTE Cell  & Yellow Icon, AIMSICD does not return to picture 1, as I would expect  it to do.  So picture 1 & 4 should (could) be the same after the call has ended.(without PSC & Yellow icon). That's why I called it refresh/reset after call connection has ended.(return to picture 1). AIMSICD stays with picture 4. Yellow Icon + PSC.  That means that everybody who is normally connected to LTE Network will see pic 4 all the time if they have made or received a phone call. Yellow Icon + PSC.  This will affect all in my country since everybody is normally on LTE. The solution could be to manually lock the phone to HSPA, but I don't know anybody who would. If you restart AIMSICD everything is OK, until next call is made I/O.  I think I heard somewhere that Phone Network are set up to do this automatic,  downgrade phone calls from LTE to HSPA do to small amount of data needs(for calls).  Hope this is of any help. I can upload logs if wanted. 
no, nothing. 
@jiazhai I've opened a PR to bump the netty version - #6424, but I am not sure how to go about testing it. Do you think the existing integration tests cover it?
@dkoszewnik you're totally right, with one snapshot version history-ui worked very well.
...no?  Why would we do that? It should be made to work properly.

Yes that's correct for both cases when source branch and target branch are updated.  For the case when the target branch is updated, 2 RESCOPED_TO events are sent with different values for ${PULL_REQUEST_FROM_HASH}: 1. One value will be the latest commit on the source branch 2. One value will be the previous commit/hash on the target branch.

Great, thanks to Noor, I hadn't time to put the latest jar online, but we have more plans for v1.2.  at least we now know how to get a working version.  
@msand unfortunately since I cannot reproduce locally, I'm not very keen on deploying a non stable version of this lib to them to validate the fix. I'm downgrading to `6.5.2` for now. Hopefully we'll find a way to reproduce with the version 7
Hi! I checked this in production mode (mvn clean package -Pproduction, deploy war on Tomcat)  and everything was fine (aplication runs and works ok). Probably because dev-webpack is not used ;) But when I returned to dev mode the problem is still there. No matter if I generate war (mvn clean package) and deploy it on Tomcat or add project in eclipse to Tomcat server.   Please notice (in my 14.1.2.log) **that this is executed twice**: `com.vaadin.flow.server.startup.DevModeInitializer - Starting dev-mode updaters` so frontend is compiled twice. For the first time frontend is compiled successfully but at the end dev-updater and dev-webpack are executed second time and frontend compilation fails.
I already migrated everything including index metadata to 1.0 so I can't confirm with 100% certainty it was working in 0.90 but if you recall you and I were working on exactly the same issue a while ago and I believe it was fixed.

I haven't tested it in iOS.  I haven't got a reproducible repository, but it is straightforward to test: 1. Share a local image (`url: ...`) with `Share.open` 2. Use the `Save image` option in the modal window. 3. Don't allow access to the permission when requested. Instead of raising an error (so the `.catch` callback), the library behaves as if the share was successful (with the `.then` callback).

From GTFS:  "The block_id field identifies the block to which the trip belongs. A block consists of two or more sequential trips made using the same vehicle, where a passenger can transfer from one trip to the next just by staying in the vehicle. The block_id must be referenced by two or more trips in trips.txt."    Maybe it's not technically wrong according to the GTFS spec, depending on how you read "sequential trips".   I'd be pretty conservative with that and say "sequential trips" are where the trips share the same physical end/begin point.  If there's a gap between those points, and some dwell time along with them being different physical points, then there's an assumed dead-head trip between the two points, and thus they are not sequential.   
My Java version is java 10.0.2 2018-07-17 Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13, mixed mode)  I don't know if could be it, but maybe the region? I'm from Brazil.  I tried to use a custom provider too, and got the same problem.

How do you add it to the class path? I'm using eclipse. The file name is correct and it is located in the jar file I'm using. I also moved a copy to the source folder, but its still not working.
I see. Waiting for the fix. 
I just realized that you are setting minSdk 16, so I don't think people will run into actual issues. But just to be sure, I have created a pull request that makes use of the support DialogFragment and getSupportFragmentManager. See #67  
Theoretical should work but do not work. If I select Refresh from Eclipse context menu by right click on folder of project all ok. 
The latest, version 1.1.2 
Oh, sorry.  I ended up working around this by adjusting the url path on the nextcloud server to better match the one on the proxy server.  THEN: nextcloud.mydomain.com redirecting to nextcloud.local.machine/nextcloud NOW:  nextcloud.mydomain.com redirecting to nextcloud.local.machine  This made the overwritehost and overwritewebroot directives on the server unnecessary, and the android app was much happier.
@monsieurtanuki Not able to test #849 right now, but the scroll bug occured to me already some time back on several occasions, just now was able to finally track it down. Latest use of snapshot a few days ago. Above happens without scroll limits set and as far as I can see on any zoom level (though it's rare, you get to the 3x3 grid border on high zoom levels at all). Basically it means that you are always imprisoned in this 3x3 map grid illustrated above with only the center/middle map working as expected. As soon as you zoom and have been in an edge map, you get to the center/middle map again.
Perfect! This solves the problem. Thank you for the quick reply! 
Right, I have no one counter entries... After adding counters the error has disappeared. I think we need zero-check and do warnings when trying to get read/write information.
In reading docs yesterday I understand better the intent of this field and still want to centralize management of the datasource configurations.  But, this kind of feels like getting into the association/aggregation feature which is coming in a future milestone.  What is the use case for when separate datasources will be needed to access data within a single entity?  With correct permissions, everything could be accessed in a single datasource.  If it spans databases I would argue it's a separate entity, joins would be handled at software layer, so that should be part of association.  My recommendation is remove the per statement `datasource` property and allow a single datasource per entity, unless a clear use case for keeping it is identified. 
ok, thank you for the help 
Sir i have a question also about how can i convert audio file to text in android i can find any sample in the sdk only microphone sir need help
I was unable to receive messages on my pop3 accounts, while the imap account worked fine. To try to reproduce this problem, I deleted all the accounts, turned on debugging, then re-imported the same settings that I had used previously. This time it did work. The only error I had was related to my IMAP account, which doesn't use SSL (had to change the configuration to make it work). I've attached the log file for review, but I doubt it will be helpful. I'd be willing to uninstall K9 / reinstall if you think that might make a difference. I have several devices at my disposal, if you would like me to do a factory reset. The device I'm using as my primary is a Nexus 6p running Android 6.0.1. Please let me know if/how I can be of assistance.

I think this doesn't work when calling the search endpoint. I will try.  By the way, I found a workaround to solve my problem, using the fetchObject method, with JsonObject.class as type: `final JsonObject fetchObject = client.fetchObject("/search", JsonObject.class, Parameter.with("q", "paolo"), Parameter.with("type", "page"),                 Parameter.with("fields", "id,name,link,likes"));`  If you need some other informations just ask, otherwise feel free to close this issue.

I tested it with other video podcasts, same problem with aspect ratio.  
@eivantsov I use the java debugger, jdk1.8.0_91 (container and host) and eclipse-che-4.3.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT.  
I haven't worked on open source projects and since the issue is not that difficult to fix, I'd prefer the existing team to fix it. Regarding the spec, it is "JSR 311: JAX-RS: The JavaTM API for RESTful Web Services" (http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311), particularly sections: "3.2 Fields and Bean Properties" and "3.3.2 Parameters". The constructor tried first (as it is now) seems to be the right approach, as this case is listed above the static methods in the section 3.2: 1. Primitive types. 2. Types that have a constructor that accepts a single String argument. 3. Types that have a static method named valueOf or fromString with a single String argument    that return an instance of the type. If both methods are present then valueOf MUST be used unless    the type is an enum in which case fromString MUST be used. 4. List<T>, Set<T>, or SortedSet<T>, where T satisfies 2 or 3 above.  The sections also specify the way exceptions thrown by the "factory methods" should be handled. Probably, corretness of implementation of this aspect should be verified as well. 
@davivel   Thanks, this ended up being my DNS configuration, I assume. Using the full IP address and port worked, although I had to clear out the apps memory to be able to change the server address.  I still see nothing logged in my access_log, even now that it is working, so that must be a misconfiguration on my part.  Thank you for the prompt reply, I'll close this issue.

Yes, image loads but with that error log. I could ignore it, but I think isn't normal.  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7372650/CZ.png  ![cz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7516541/7346877/10e829a6-ecb9-11e4-87da-c84b42e2ad10.png) 
Indeed. I'm not sure if the size with "Use Hi-Res Cover" off is correct or not, but with "Use Hi-Res Cover" on there is definitely extra padding. 
The one that closes the simulation. The cross mark. 
I do not think it is related to Buycraft per se, as I seem to get it with other scheduling mods and plugins - Pixelmon seems to suffer similarly. Here's the log from one of these crashes. [2018-07-12-1.log](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/files/2191499/2018-07-12-1.log) 
Okey, I see we should've avoided the cycle in the first place.  Are there any preferable way of deferring the registration? As a first draft I'm doing a "lazy-lookup" from the ApplicationContext on the first call on FooRepository from FooMapStore, but it feels a bit awkward :-)

Hi Dan, thanks for the quick acknowledgement. No crash dialog or prompt to submit a report. Seeing this on an Honor 10 and on a Mediapad M5 8.4. It only occurs if I try to check a box without first tapping elsewhere to bring up the keyboard. If I bring up the keyboard, dismiss it, then try to check the checkbox it works as expected. Not sure if it'll help but I can try watching adb logcat while it and see if anything useful appears.
@sunix I would distinct two issues here: 1. Che Server token must not be sent to plugin/devfile registries. 2. Add an ability to configure plugin/devfile registries as secure (should we use keycloak token for that or another one - it's implementation details). It may seem easy to solve but if we take into account that users may want to use different registries (some maybe not secured by the same Keycloak as is used for Che Server) and Che Server should be able to access all of them(maybe it should be reworked and client should provide everything downloaded) then it does not seem so easy to solve and IMHO it should be solved separately, if we need it.
The user was on the relesse version, but I can reproduce it with NB. Can't you ? 
No, the preview line width only affects the preview in eclipse settings. My line width is set to 140 in `eclipseformat.xml`

I can confirm that this new version works for me.  JabRef 5.0-dev--snapshot--2019-05-03--master--99d99cf02 Mac OS X 10.14.4 x86_64  Java 1.8.0_212

I'm still try to reproduce like a integration test, but without success. But at our test cluster, this bug also manually reproduced, and looks like this:  2 nodes 1.4.2 with centos and Oracle JVM 8, first node contains shards 1/4/5/7, second contains 0/2/3/6 (8 total, 0 replicas) query:    I have this error only if query  executed at second node. If first, all is OK. With search shards api, looks like 3016 route to 7th shard. Second node does not contain 7th, but first does.  Any ideas? 
Sorry for the confusion. What I tried to do is: Extend product entity to add a new field A, and then extend OrderItemFieldServiceImpl to add a field with name product.A. When admin app starts up, an exception of "Unable to find the field declared in FieldData (product.A) on the target class (org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.domain.OrderItemImpl), or any registered entity class that derives from it." is thrown.   After some tracing, this seems to be resulted in method getField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName) of FieldManager line 95, where entities[0] is used for matching instead of matchedClasses, in my case the matched entity is entities[1] so field can't not be found in entities[0] which is ProductBundle.  Hope this clarifies the confusion. Thanks. 
@funivan run that code with and without `$v = 0;`
Apparently it was my phone.....chrome gave a similar error when I tried to download the debug build so I did a hard reset and now it works >_>`  So, for now I'm closing this bug, awesome response time though, and I like what I see of the new changes 
he did tried that AFAIK, can't be sure
It is a multiplayer server.  Had this issue on my server with a plugin that when removed, placed a binding block and only did this with mekanism mechanics.  However, i am on someone elses server and help him when i can.            You cannot place on the block, but can place next to it.    I have not tried to move it with a piston but would assume I would not be able to move it.   Ill try and let u know in a few moments
@TWiStErRob I don't think it is a case of wrong url as everything works fine without okhttp, but I've tried to trim it and result is the same.  @sjudd Here is the full stack trace http://pastebin.com/YfCS0NRL  You can find image url in exception if you'd like to test it :) 
It is postgres.  Even the following simple test will trigger the error. If I only execute the select line, it works. But if I execute all (via `Alt-X` or via `Ctrl-Enter`), it triggers the error.  `﻿-- comment` `select * from test;`
Hmm, my crates are not in the same chunk as refinedStorage mod, but they are in the chunk next to it(diagonally), and i have moved the enderio tanks wich wera in the same chunk but i still get the problem.  But i moved into the dungeon far away from home (there is some crates here too, 1 small and  1medium) and it seems not bugging.  The one upstairs in the house in another chunk seems not bugging too, but this one is in the same chunk as enderio and refinedStorage stuff, its just higher than them 
In the case of Searchly, all administrative features of ElasticSearch are restricted from the API, according to their documentation. That doesn't leave us with a lot of room, does it? I'm sure that Searchly have their reasons to do so, but that is one case out of millions of users, and many of them are not developing in shared environments with special restrictions.  I still believe that the right endpoint to call by default should be `/_cat/health` which could be overridden via configuration properties.  Instead of having `management.health.elasticsearch.indices=` we could have `management.health.elasticsearch.endpoint=/_cat/health`  
After I did "Sync Project", all the errors went away... thank you!! Perhaps a sync should be triggered automatically, each time external files are found? 
@rohanKanojia:  I run in OpenShift mode and build images in an three-node OpenShift cluster. I don't require a local docker daemon to run `fabric8:build`, so neither does  `fabric8:watch`? Will try `4.0.0-M2` later. Thanks for your help.
Good morning,  I'm using a Samsung S7 Android 6.0.1 stock Rom. I will try that, good guess. 
The job is scheduled on a different task executor so only that thread will get blocked and vertx event loop should be running.
Sure, I had submitted pr #38. 
@ronblum I'm seeing the same thing you are, previously run & not cleared chunks can be queued, while not previously run chunks & run but cleared can't be queued.
That is possible, We reproduce it using one of our feeds and it is one of those things that just happens randomly sometimes one hour into the playback but once it happens there is not way to play any asset again. And it only seems to happen on the Samsung Galaxy S6 , and S6 Edge +.   I will try to close the session once the error occurs and also try to reproduce it using the demo app.   Thanks for the quick response.  
Sorry, been busy. Without Optifine, the signals seem to work as intended. It was an older version: OptiFine_1.10.2_HD_U_D6.
Sorry for late response. What I noticed was that the property lenient was read from configuration but never applied in the ISitemapResolver.  The property is read in the StandardSitemapResolverFactory. https://github.com/Norconex/collector-http/blob/master/norconex-collector-http/src/main/java/com/norconex/collector/http/sitemap/impl/StandardSitemapResolverFactory.java    But the parameter is never passed to the created ISitemapResolver. Or am I missing something here? 
@trustin can you explain me what the problem was or point to the issue ? I think not expand it should be fine as we should just keep on trying to write until isEmpty() is true or size() == 0

Yes. Closing for now
I did try the latest branch. It's not working for me. 
Here's a link for example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33350489/double-checked-locking-with-regular-hashmap  If you look at the code for HashMap, you'll see that a put does a lot of unprotected accesses to internal structures that are in no way atomic. If one thread is in the opportunistic non-synched code while another thread is in the synched code trying to add a new value, the first thread will be trying to read the internal structures while the second thread is manipulating them.

In that case, `allow-external-publish` is working in some cases—including with the steps above—but not in others.  With `allow-external-publish=0`, the RPbus is correctly removed as an option for - the Plots pane (so the reprex above is not a bug) - the upper-right button on the Source pane (but see below) - a running Shiny app  However, RPubs still remains as an option for - an external HTML viewer for knitted Rmd - the Viewer pane - the upper-right button on the Source pane for a file that was previously published using RPubs    - such as an Rmd that was first published before external publishing was turned off, or the document was published using the external HTML viewer    - although I think the document getting published is empty in this case

Interestingly, bazel project itself is not affected, and:   just works. However, all projects that have `.bazelversion` stopped working after d3f8efc.  So the workaround for now is to remove `.bazelversion` file from the tree.  Also, I would have expected, that higher version number semantic is still preserved. If `.bazelversion` file has "1.0.0" version, and I have installed bazel version 3.2.1, then it should just work. And not telling me that the `.bazelversion` has version 1.0.0, but currently higher version 3.2.1 is installed. The only reason to refuse running bazel, if the installed version is lower than the one referenced in `.bazelversion` file.
Indeed. Thanks. 
I still observe it with the version on the play store as of 20190701.  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56189/60441598-e597fe80-9c49-11e9-84bd-54b3d295f85e.jpg" width=200>  I noticed that after a while (I took a photo of the screenshot, cropped and shared it with my laptop), the device was locked and when unlocked, the 0 ETH ether card appears. Maybe it takes a while to appear?
Maybe yes
The above logs are from GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 4.0 with Java 7u141.  This is currently from our testing environment. Seems to be happening somewhat regularly. I'm seeing endTransaction 00000000000000000000000000000000 with 0.3% of requests.  Seems to also happen on another server with Payara 4.1.1.161 and Java 8u162 but not as often (only 0.02% of requests).  I don't think there's anything special in settings: 
You can use a very simple Setup.  Just start an Eureka Server.  Create a simple spring-boot Application with `@EnableEurekaClient` and add a dependency to spring-starter-jdbc with a h2 db.    Everything works as expected. 
Hi @csnyulas, unfortunately that is not the case, I don't see the class if I scroll.
@Fleshgrinder you are correct in this case. But if we use short ternary we can get error on undefined variable. But with constructions like `isset`, `empty`, `??` we should never get error on undefined variable.   P.S I saw @rentalhost report issue related to empty, isset and ?? oprator

Now reading your comment I checked again. Seems I did not kill the app after switching to white theme but just "restarted". This seems to bring up an inconsitent situation between the layouts. Now it indeed looks normal and after switching back to black theme and not killing the app the white border was missing. So forget about this issue...sorry.

It's not in final App.css, if I change to for example   .jewel.textfield .input {...}  it appears.

Thanks  [1] https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
I don't know. Just executing them, I guess? 😉   The problem with these tests for sure is that they actually are integration tests, not only testing the binding, but indirectly also the complete ESH framework. That's why the are hit by asynchronous behavior, automated magic like autoupdate if item states, auto linking and all that. If some of these things change in a slight aspect (e.g. timing, implemented in a different way), then these tests also suffer.  I think if you want to really get rid of this stuff, then it would make sense to reduce the test scope to the binding itself, just making sure it uses the ESH APIs correctly. I.e. if you want to test if a certain action leads to an item update, just take the standalone ThingHandler, feed it with a mocked ThingHandlerCallback and ensure it's calling `stateUpdated(...)`. Don't care what happens afterwards.   The new [testing documentation](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/blob/master/docs/documentation/development/testing.md#mockito) gives a pretty good example of how this can be done using plain Java 8 (hooray) with Mockito. For the majority of binding tests, this suffices and there is hardly any need for OSGiTests.

Sorry for late response, There is some code where this problem appears:    In this case I get the following suggestion, see image.  ![nullfalsepositive](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10072693/25938652/3e7224e0-3630-11e7-8874-7cbe90a7fea0.png)  I cant use this suggestion `null !==` because this variable is never set before.  Disabling this reporting is not good at all, because it reported mostly the correct problem. Only in cases when the variable is never initilized before it will be wrong.  I have the latest PHPStorm (2017.1.3, because of EAP), but it also works wrong on open released versions (2017.1.2). Work on Windows and have the latest plugin.

Only a few where showing though there should have been more. There were some edge errors in log, so I'm pretty sure there was some corruption and something got stuck in a loop over it. I ended up rebuilding my DB so I don't have access to that data anymore.  I'll try these queries again on non-corrupt data and see if I still have problems. 
Thanks, new release works on 4.5  But it works only for projects with separate $GOPATH (with src, pkg, bin in project tree).  I have some projects with the shared $GOPATH (inside $GOPATH/src), but I can't debug and even run them via Run menu due to error: Process path is empty.

@philwebb `ManagementWebSecurityAutoConfiguration` behaves as expected. This issue arises with a Reactive configuration. However, I looked a bit deeper into this and it appears `ReactiveManagementWebSecurityAutoConfiguration` is not the issue.  I believe the main issue is with `ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration` as it **does not** register a default `@Bean` of `SecurityWebFilterChain`.  If you look at `OAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration` on the Servlet side of things, you will see that it (indirectly) registers the default security configuration via `OAuth2WebSecurityConfiguration.OAuth2WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, which makes `ManagementWebSecurityAutoConfiguration` back off.  I believe the only fix required here is to add the following code to `ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration`:     What are your thoughts?

Hi Ritchie,  Here is something... Not quite a unit test, but close enough... This is  the test code I used myself, and the simple FITS output it produces.  I hope this helps...  I'm a little snowed in with work until late September, at least, so I  cannot offer much help -- not it the short term, at least... But, if it  turns out to be hairy to fix without breaking other things, I can  probably help out a bit starting in October...  If you or someone else can fix it before, all the better!!!  Thanks,  -- A.

I'm not so sure if I understand the structure.   The problem is, if one POI already exists in one category, like the example above, it's not possible to find it in the other category. Both categories are defined in poi-mapping.xml, and one would suspect that if a POI fits a category, it would be contained, but only one category you can select in the UI ("restaurant" OR "alpine_hut") gets the POI as result.  One could work around by moving tags which are often combined in child categories, but this works only in a few cases.

I think there can be used <code>getResourceAsStream()</code> of ClassLoader after adding of embedded jar by way described in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5602367/how-to-load-a-resource-from-an-embedded-jar-file but it doesn't seem good idea. I don't know how it should work. It's very strange that <code>getResourceAsStream</code> doesn't work in windows if path starts with backslash, it looks like a bug of java. For example <code>resolveName()</code> method of java.lang.Class uses "/" instead of File.separator inside. I think <code>.replaceAll("\\", "/")</code> may be used as workaround in this case. 
Yeah, I meant packets. But I came up with an easier way (Did not test it though): You could just check player.isSneaking() instead of Keyboard.isDown, since the sneaking state should be synched automaticly.  For the right server configuration, create a new Run Configuration: Project: Minecraft Forge, Main class:cpw.mods.fml.relauncher.ServerLaunchWrapper, vm-arguments: -Dfml.ignoreInvalidMinecraftCertificates=true -Dfml.coreMods.load=de.teamlapen.vampirism.coremod.VampirismFMLLoadingPlugin. Then add the vampirism project to the user entries under classpath. But the server doesnt work atm anyway, I still have to fix it, see issue #7 . 
@kkarra This works on fields that do not contain commas and semi-colons, so I believe we are handling the delimiters incorrectly. I will fix!

Our use case is mapping from a DTO payload (`A`, `B`, `C`) to our JPA DB Entities (`APrime`, `CPrime`).  When a payload comes in to update an entity, we first find the existing JPA Entities (`APrime`, `CPrime`).  We need to pass these JPA Entities in as a `@MappingTarget` so that an update happens on the existing objects.    If we don't pass `@MappingTarget`:  this would create a new CPrime JPA Entity (and generate a new ID), instead of using the existing entity.  We would also lose any existing fields that were set in CPrime, if this was a partial update.
I'm developing for Linux, using libcurl. This is effectively my exact situation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6302282/how-do-i-link-libcurl-to-my-c-program-in-linux  I was able to work around the issue by creating a "dummy library" with no files, but the linker flags I need in `exported_linker_flags`, then making the dummy library as a buck dependency for the binary. This resulted in `-lcurl` coming after the object files and a successful compilation/execution.   While this works fine, it seems like a very improper solution. It's also possible that I am misunderstanding some part of the process and would appreciate any input :)

No - I've just pulled/reinstalled and its still segfaulting. Will try to narrow it down a bit more. 
IMHO it is necessary to fix all layers of this. If a service requires more than the Meta Type service provides, then it is the responsibility of the service to validate. But this is not about "on top" validation.  However if Kura provides an API then the consumer of this API should be able trust the contract of it. I don't think that consumers should be required to enforce those contracts.  Of course a good start is to this the UI layer and sync it with the current behavior of single item fields.

Hi @stuartwdouglas,  Unfortunately. Option `-DnoDeps` did not fix it.  Just to make things easier I created a very minimal example and uploaded it into a new project https://github.com/sarxos/quarkus-issue-2809. The names of directories and modules are exactly the same as in my original project (I was too lazy to change them all) but all of my code is removed and only very basic reproducer classes are added instead.  These reproducer classes are:  The class from `abberwoult` module (this module is a runtime part of Quarkus extension):    **EDIT:** Just FYI, the `abberwoult-example` is not a module. It's a separate project. I already excluded multimodularity to be a root cause of this issue.

@talevy sorry, I'm not following what you say. Also for my surprise ` %{\d+:field}` didn't seem to work, with no failure messages either. 
@shorea   The resetRequestInputStream method is this:     So somehow my InputStream is getting past the check of shouldRetry rather than just exiting early. 
okay, it's not a problem with `RemoteSpringApplication` itself, but if you have `spring-cloud-starter-config` on the classpath and configure `spring.cloud.config.failFast=true` in `bootstrap.yml` then autoreconfiguration of some other spring boot projects (in my case `spring-boot-starter-actuator` or `spring-boot-starter-ws`) will try to connect to the config server somewhere and crash the `RemoteSpringApplication` because of failFast=true

Hi Mark, I can't test it within KNIME as we can only integrate releases of maven libs at the moment (everything else involves manipulating the eclipse cache which I try to avoid). Anyway, I had a look at your code and it make sense, as you set the `RandomAccess` to the plane position before you iterate over the image. You could have also just set the offset of the `Cursor` with a proper `jump` to the plane position (using `IntervalIndexer` or so to go from `dimension` to index). Anyway, if your test passes now, we can fix this later (=make it more efficient).   As soon as you released a new version of `SCIFIO` I will double-check within KNIME.  Thanks @hinerm

Hi there,  Working perfectly, thanks! 
Best way to reproduce is to upload an image with the app, Then move it on commons, and then view it in the app after the move is complete. 
 It seems to be there - maybe the issue is related to the whitespace in the path which somehow is incompatible with the way how Bytebuddy looks up the Java binary? Another thing I noticed is that all these files are owned by admin, which makes sense since it is within `/Applications`, maybe this is causing issues when running an app within IntelliJ (permissions are not correctly escalated, thus Bytebuddy is unable to find the binary)  **UPDATE**  I did some experiment:  I've copied the jdk in /tmp and changed the permissions to ******/admin pointed the project there and it works. Then I `cp -a` the jdk with a space, pointed to it and get the error again. It seems to be related to the whitespace indeed. 
No, this error only in android app. 
I am tracking this down, it is maybe related to a strange class hierarchy in the Lua4J runtime. Give me some time for this, I will try to file an example 
Hm... I don't know but I just tried "[Music-Player](https://github.com/MaxFour/Music-Player)", another fork of Phonograph, at that does not have the same problem. So it's somewhere in Vinyl, I guess. If you can't pin it down, nevermind. I can stick with Music-Player, although I don't like its folder-icons too much...
Currently you need to rebuild the observable if this happens. We would welcome a PR to rebuild the filter in Web3j so users don't have to worry about this.
Yeah, it does seem like Aedict reader is the faulty one, it didn't occur to me there was an almost identical verb to 没す  Though on the example tab for ぼっする, it still only shows 1 of the examples even though Tatoeba examples has 3 instances (technically 4 but one is a duplicate)  ![screenshot_20180704-173320](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40373139/42296674-e9400192-7fb5-11e8-9a75-cc37e6af3639.jpg) ![screenshot_20180704-173328](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40373139/42296685-fb73cdb2-7fb5-11e8-86f2-d6f247a9f06f.jpg)  My guess is the remaining sentences don't show up because they're not exactly ぼっする but would appear if there was an entry for ぼっす   If possible, maybe examples for verbs like 愛す/愛する should show identical example tabs, since they are the same verb (assuming they have the same reading, I do think you're right that もっす shouldn't display examples of ぼっす(る)) After all, the Tatoeba search does allow for exact matches so if somebody wants specifically あいする instead of あいす、あいした or the like, they could use that  Thanks for your time and your efforts in developing this great app!

a) No idea honestly. Sorry, I'm pretty much a plug-and-play guy when it comes to networking. My router/modem thing does show both an IPv4 and IPv6 address in the LAN settings. Let me know if you need a screenshot. b) Not directly from the email problems, no. Another app that could use a default exception is Audible (doesn't show ads, but the Audible Store throws an error on every page if it's not blacklisted in DNS66). But maybe this should just be mentioned prominently at the first start of DNS66 (not sure if is right now); for me it was pretty much the last thing I thought of. Otherwise you're just adding and adding more apps to the default list. c) Yes, receiving emails works fine now.   Thanks for working on this.

Hi @deruelle ,  You are welcome.  I already sign CLA before. 
Sorry no. After upgrading the OS and Xcode the build stopped being that slow. We can close this issue and I’ll reopen if I see it again. I hope I never have to deal with a build so slow it overflows an integer though. :-)
Fix verified in 3.2.12b and 3.2.13a. 
  Hoan also suggested putting the executable in the top-level directory and building, but that resulted in the same error.  Also Hoan rebuilt his project for the first time in "a while" and also had this error.
This failure consistently occurs 
I wish I could - however it is an **intermittent** problem - so much so that re-running the command **without any changes** usually succeeds (which indicates some non-deterministic order...). Furthermore, it happens relative rarely (especially since we added `-Djava.util.Array.legacySort=true`) so I could try it 100 times and **maybe** have it fail once. And even if it does not fail, it does not mean that bug is fixed - it may just be harder to time it correctly...  I have not had enough time to really dwell into the comparison logic, but it seems quite complex. Perhaps one should first brainstorm from scratch (as if writing it for the 1st time), decide on the **exact** list of the comparison "tie-breakers" and then implement them - e.g.:  * Ranked comes before/after un-ranked - if both ranked, then rank decides order * Versioned before non-versioned - if both versioned then version decides order * Repeatable before/after whatever other, etc. * State X comes before state Y (if state is an _enum_ than **exact** order of **all** states) * Finally, if both of same type then description decides order
Don't need to disable it (was just disabling everything that's not needed and noticed the crash)

Yes, with no problem on the other device...
So I had an idea as a workaround, but I haven't been able to get it to work. I've had two different results. So in one test, I created another VideoView, used the VideoCapturer class with the create local video track method to get the camera. The VideoView was hard coded at 640x480. I created another localVideoTrack using ViewCapturer to get the view from the VideoView and put that in the primaryVideoView. In that test, it was black. I'm not sure if it's an issue with creating multiple localvideotracks, or if it's an issue trying to capture a dynamic child in an element. The other test was using the same VideoView and same LocalVideoTrack. I built the first localvideotrack and captured the camera on the primaryvideoview. Then I created another localvideotrack over the old videotrack without stopping it and added the renderer to the primaryvideoview. This caused the view to flash/strobe. When connecting to a room with another participant, it would flash/strobe between your camera and the participants camera without instantiating the thumbnail view. Do you think that somewhere in the ViewCapturer method is a possibility of sharing the camera with the constraints? And maybe I'm just not doing something right?
I could not imagine where. At least we don't do this in our code.
It looks like it is the lightwell. Going from a Seared Gauge->Portable tank with the same settings and 288mb of fluid worked as expected.

I would help if you could tell me what I need to do. My device is not routed and as far as I understood all kind of logcat apps doesn't work with Android 4.4.2 anymore. Any idea how I could get access to the "important" log files?  **BTW:** After the successful test with demo.owncloud.org, I decided to test it with a newly created ownCloud account on my server. I was able to show all files within a second. This leads me to the assumption that the described problem might be caused by the fact that I'm not using local storage but external WebDAV file systems with my account.

@om26er This is not old version. I just download it today and replace my old library with updated one then getting this issue once re-connection happen.

Hi @ronblum I see the same thing re moving to a space following. Most of the time one would not have a whitespace following a bracket more likely end of line.  Thanks for letting me know @kevinushey.
Indeed. Putting an explicit reference to 2.9.6 solved the issue. Thanks for your help.
Yes I'm pretty sure the server does not start and I have nothing already running on port 8080. I'm not entirely sure why the helpful error message is not getting printed. I think it's something to do with the extra eval causing an error and the bash script terminating before the call to error_exit.  To test this I added extra debug echo statements to che.sh as below:    The echo line just before the if statement isn't printed, execution stops at the line with the eval statement. So the error message isn't printed. I'm not sure exactly what's the fix to get the error message to print.  The script exits with exit code 127 
Sorry I have the french version installed, but the following screenshot should help  ![bugreport](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1290876/19920506/63c21008-a0d9-11e6-96d1-5a588aaf55cf.png) Is it clearer with it ?   Let me know if you need more informations.  Cheers :-) 
Good morning, of course, thanks a lot. [exo_mobile_2bis-media.zip](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/files/1063315/exo_mobile_2bis-media.zip)    
[2016-11-13 13-16-41.zip](https://github.com/SIMRacingApps/SIMRacingApps/files/587953/2016-11-13.13-16-41.zip) I tried both the one from the Broadcaster,Spotter-CAMERA app and the individual CarSelector-CAMERA widget. Each time, the console did register the command to change car, but the sim did not respond to it.  I also tried moving the logging up to FINEST, but there were no additional messages printed at the time.  EDIT: Actually, I have a correction to this now. It isn't that the widget isn't working at all, it's that it isn't working correctly. I did additional testing and did a screen capture of what I was seeing. [Uploading 2016-11-13 13-16-41.zip…]()  Based on the log messages and what the screen recording is showing, it appears the code is confusing Car Number (the number on the car and on the app) with the car's actual sim-based ID. From the attached video, for example, I click to change to Car Number 13, but it instead switches me to Car Number 26. It does this for a few other examples as well, which are included in the video. There are also several cases where attempting to switch to a higher numbered car simply does not do anything.  My guess is that the code has essentially transposed CarxID with Car Number in the camera code. The Reference Car updates correctly when using Broadcaster,Spotter-CAMERA, for example. 
it happend when i was fighting the enderdragon and got it down to about 50% and going for a another shot and then crash
I didn't check. Just running through the test plan. Also, it seems that you can normally close the details view. So it must be happening only in a special situation (if an installation is running or something like that).
For sure <expected as much, replicating an ME with a few millions of items ain't a 5 minutes work>, i'll have to upload it to my google drive though coz' it's pretty big for github, you'll find my compact machine base at x:-64 y:228 z:201 overworld. Entering that CM will drop you right into my ME Interface room. (access to the entire AE2 network). I should mention that there's no Quantum links or anything alike. I have 1 backbone network running my p2p's. No subnets. So, what's visible on the terminals is pretty much all the stuff that exists. There's one auxiliar network i used just for the purpose of creating singularities <ae2> since import/export buses are somewhat faster than other item transport methods, that network is standalone.  Possibly some memory leak. That or the gadget is trying to do something funny with all the items in that ME. Since i haven't had a look at the code for that binding and what's it doing can't really say anything more.  PS: The ME being in a different dimension is not the cause of the issue, tested that already :) Also sorry for the late response.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=10ZpwRPWHa_jLJ4Lr4N__NAsM42vOnLiQ
@wu-sheng good idea, i'll prepare to find the AOP code to filter enhanced method
2.0.9 does not work either @lvca  
So it's not possible to do it ingame only by using in console.

@saudet  Tried to run `ffmpeg -i rtsp://192.168.1.1 -r 15 example.mp4` from my mac while connected to that camera, also nogo.  What do you think are the possible issues here? Can any ffmpeg flag fix this problem? Or it's something more complicated?
I am using 2.4.3 but it was present in 2.4.2 also (reporting now as i assumed it may be fixed in .3) Having a Context with the Host included. Then right click active scan on the root of the site. Using default policy or any custom one (which have the SQL Injection enabled) 
@igarashitm  So - there's definitely an issue with custom field actions - could be the example is just out of whack. Look at these two files:  https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/atlasmap-maven-plugin/src/test/java/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActions.java https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/atlasmap-maven-plugin/src/test/java/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActionsModel.java  They are built automatically - mine are in:  /home/pleacu/git-clone/atlasmap/atlasmap-maven-plugin/target/test-classes/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActions.class  /home/pleacu/git-clone/atlasmap/atlasmap-maven-plugin/target/test-classes/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActionsModel.class  I can copy them to a local empty directory and simply: ` jar cvf ../PaulsFieldActions.jar * ` I can successfully import them and enable them (io.atlasmap.service.my.PaulsFieldActions).  My custom transform appears in the 'Add Transformations' pulldown but I get this when I use it: ` Couldn't find a metadata for transformation 'Expression' ` which is weird.   The good news is that I can build/ import/ enable/ use Bicycle.jar  https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/atlasmap-maven-plugin/src/test/java/io/atlasmap/maven/test/Bicycle.java   If you can take a look at the PaulsFieldAction java files to see if they're wrong that would be great. :)
It would be simple and yes I knew about the redstone torch. All but an enhancement :D 
Of course these indexes can be created manually. But having @Index and supporting it for raw types and not for collections is not really fair. As the secondary index performance issue is there for both collection and raw types. I can do it manually. But I was relying on Achilles generated DDL for validating my schema integrity. And in case there is a need for explicitly making the developer choose. There could be a configuration parameter where indexes for collections can be enabled (disabled by default) along side indexes for raw types.

Hi,  sample streams below, with HD streams this issue is more noticeable, in our case the delay is not a big issue, is almost the same as with Mediaplayer, and it think is related to GOP in multicast video streams, but we need to find a solution how to make the next video start immediately and do the caching while keeping the last videos frame.   > Stream #0:0[0x3f3]: Video: h264 (Main) ([27][0][0][0] / 0x001B), yuv420p(tv, bt709), 1920x1080 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 25 fps, 50 tbr, 90k tbn, 50 tbc >     Stream #0:1[0x3f4](eng): Audio: mp2 ([4][0][0][0] / 0x0004), 48000 Hz, stereo, s16p, 128 kb/s >     Stream #0:2[0x3f7](alb): Subtitle: dvb_subtitle ([6][0][0][0] / 0x0006) >     Stream #0:3[0x3f8](eng): Subtitle: dvb_subtitle ([6][0][0][0] / 0x0006)   or:  > Stream #0:0[0x3fd]: Video: h264 (Main) ([27][0][0][0] / 0x001B), yuv420p(tv, bt470bg), 704x576 [SAR 16:11 DAR 16:9], 25 fps, 50 tbr, 90k tbn, 50 tbc >     Stream #0:1[0x3ff](alb): Audio: mp2 ([3][0][0][0] / 0x0003), 48000 Hz, stereo, s16p, 128 kb/s >     Stream #0:2[0x3fe](sqi): Audio: mp2 ([3][0][0][0] / 0x0003), 48000 Hz, mono, s16p, 128 kb/s  thnx

@gsmet I triggered more than 10 livereload and no issue with 0.21.2. Sorry for the duplicate this is a bug I wanted to open since a few weeks and I didn't saw anything about it when I quickly looks at the list of bugfixes for 0.21.2.
Fixed! thanks, after you release, I will change to 1.1.1, now I am still using my proguard
Will test tomorrow

I don't have a simple standalone reproducer. Creating that requires me finding the cause... ;-)  But if you don't mind downloading half the universe then it should actually be very easy for you to reproduce if you d the following (I hope I'm not forgetting any steps, but try and shout if NOK):  It will need to grab loads of stuff from https://nexus.opendaylight.org, so [as documented here](http://docs.opendaylight.org/en/latest/developer-guide/developing-apps-on-the-opendaylight-controller.html), do:      cp -n ~/.m2/settings.xml{,.orig} ; wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendaylight/odlparent/master/settings.xml > ~/.m2/settings.xml  And now doing this should hit it:      git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/netvirt     cd netvirt/aclservice/impl     git checkout cbe43c366abf098554a230c975e7750ed1ffa707     mvn -Pq clean package  The `git checkout` is to get the rev where this happened, before [we worked around it here](https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/72573/).  > give us some insights on the state when hitting the StackOverflowError? You could add remote debugging options, set an exception breakpoint for StackOverflowError and attach to the debugged VM then.  OK I'll try that and report back if I find anything... but don't let that stop you from trying to repro is as above! ;)  BTW: I suspect that his is caused by some recent code change on our side which added a new library or introduced a new generics thing (but it's nearly impossible to pinpoint; this is in a huge community with lots of spinning parts changing all the time). What could help as well to at least pinpoint what is causing this, if not solving it, would be to catch the `StackOverflowError` and provide context on which type it happened?

 Surely!  Please view the attached. I included screen shots of what I'm seeing, as well  as showing it's the most recent. I believe it might be important to note that this is running Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) (which I dearly LOVE about this program, it's cross-platform awesomeness), but I think I saw the code that might be the issue in github.  I haven't taken the time to confirm, though. Seriously love this program.  Keep up the good work! Which reminds me...is there a place I can donate to support this great app? Thanks!

Hi Michael,  Still seeing other dependency issues with 0.20.1-beta when trying to mix with other latest Google API components:  google-cloud-core-http is using an older version of google-api-client:   Might be worth providing a Maven BOM with consistent dependencies to ease development across the various Google Java API clients.
> 6.2.0  I don't even know where I found the 4.3.2 version, but I also could not find the 6.2.0 version on the Firebase website. I have gone ahead and updated it. So far, the issue has not come up again. Thank you!
hi @macdonst  thanks for your reply well...the code just like the example code    but I am using PGB (build.phonegap.com) Cli 5.1.1 with all official core plugin from NPM 
Yep, looks like adding `mHandler.getThread().setUncaughtExceptionHandler(null);` into `stopImmediately` fixes the issue.
@ylecollen The country is **India +91** and I created my account with my email ID and after creation also I tried to add my mobile number and I didn't get the verification token there too. 
Cool, this looks  little bit easier than the `CustomResourceDefinitionBuilder`, but it doesn't support the OpenAPIV3Schema at all, so I guess it's less expressive than before. And the `CustomResourceDefinitionBuilder` is gone in the newest version.. does that mean that you are not going to support the open api v3 schemas at all or am I missing something?   > Could you please elaborate on your use case?   sure, I want to create CRDs that have the OpenAPI Schema inside and make the validation for CRs working (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#validation). The issue is (or at least with the previous version, where `CustomResourceDefinitionBuilder` was still there) that when using `CustomResourceDefinitionBuilder.withNewOpenAPIV3SchemaLike(JSONSchemaProps item)`, from some strange reason it didn't copied the `item` correctly to the `crdDef.spec.validation.schema`. If the original `JSONSchemaProps item` had the `item.dependencies` set to null, then after calling:    this works, but it doesn't seem right.
here is my skype ckgan2004@hotmail.com. what time you about want to do dis discussion? 
<tfc:metal/ingot/steel:32767> The item seems to receive a massive increase in metadata in the GregTech blast furnace... That's very abnormal. I'll do some testing with BetterWithMods one was created with this metadata too <tfc:metal/ingot/steel:32767>. My first guess was it was trying to take the metadata of GregTech's steel ingots but that's not the same; <gregtech:meta_item_1:10184>. I couldn't get Advanced Tooltips to work. I also noticed that debug mode was enabled by default in the configs, since version 1.12.2-0.23.8.70, could still be enabled in 1.12.2-0.23.8.75.

Michael,  I have an index on :Document(document_ID). That is my only "entry point" to the data.  Unfortunately, I can't run anything on my end any more in 2.3.1. For my project I had to revert to 2.2.7 and so I created two Neo4j CE installations (2.2.7 and 2.3.1) and two databases of the corresponding versions. For some reason the 2.3.1 installation gives me trouble now, when I have two versions of software installed on the same machine. This was not the case when 2.3.1 was installed alone. Below are some screenshots of what's going on. I don't see any error messages in messages.log.  ![neo4j_browser_err_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9038701/11811547/2556ee16-a304-11e5-8135-0b072d87a8d6.PNG) ![neo4j_browser_err_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9038701/11811554/2c574300-a304-11e5-8840-50e3e57e14e6.PNG) ![neo4j_browser_err_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9038701/11811563/33ed6cde-a304-11e5-95df-0fdeffbe70e3.PNG)  Here's the ZIP of the test database that I'm working with. Hope you can identify the problem with the provided query on your end. (I had to append the .txt extension because the ZIP was not being uploaded) [remora.graph_2.3.1_test.zip.txt](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/files/62496/remora.graph_2.3.1_test.zip.txt)  In general, out of dozens of queries that I have as a part of my application, there are four that just halt (I initially provided one of them) and one that is borderline acceptable (running for 30 seconds now), but the rest are not really OK either. Putting these five aside, migrating from 2.2 to 2.3 made things slower for me 2-3 times across the board. I did not do any tuning and did not use any hints. This is just out of the box.  Thanks! Gene. 
The problem persists even after updating to 2.4.1 via f-droid. I also tried to reset the application data via android settings, but that did not help either. The result is the same with "begins with" and "ends with" as well. If I tick "invert selection", the meta list contains every task, even the matching ones.

Thanks for the reply. No stack trace that I can see. I've copied/pasted a few lines around the "corrupted" reference, if you need more I can upload the entire thing.  [idealog.txt](https://github.com/groboclown/p4ic4idea/files/309379/idealog.txt)  There are a couple of stack traces in the full file - I think there's the whole history of the western hemisphere since the flood in there - but not related to this. 
I will provide an example soon, and I forget to say, the file handle leaks is really related to the bootstrap because when the client disconnect, the frontend channel (client to proxy) channelUnregistered() and channelInactive() functions have been called, and the backend channel (proxy to server) channelUnregistered() and channelInactive() have also been called. So even when these 4 fonctions was called, some file handle, related to the bootstrap was still open, I checked using lsof -p PID on linux. 
Hi @wborn, thanks for looking into it. Currently I have quite limited access to my installation. But I managed to get hold of the `hs_err_pid*.log` you mentioned. See:  [hs_err_pid519.log](https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/files/1845479/hs_err_pid519.log) [hs_err_pid510.log](https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/files/1845480/hs_err_pid510.log)  If some more information is required, just let me know. Appologies upfront for some delayed response since I'm on travel now. I promise to reply immediately after my return. ;-) 
Actually not, I only observed the issue once from Firebase Crashlytics
The 1.0.2 version have fixed the issue.  Thanks!

@deathbeam Yes, vanilla discord on the stable build. I would have included it in the screenshot if possible, but yes show running game is enabled and the screenshot shows that it is enabled on runelite as well.
It took more than 20 minutes but never completed. 
No, I did not change the `hellosceneform` sample. The phone is a Samsung S8 SM-950F running Android 8.0.0
This issue is from @rdayal I just copied it over here.  My first guess is that this has nothing to do with us, and just happened to occur at the same time due to other things in a new Eclipse install.
step: 1. use default setting, format wrong 2. change the delimiter, format ok now it's ok maybe my workspace is create too early; 
I checked the console and most times it's when a player dies and other times when a player joins. I went ahead and checked all configs and `/config/armorplus/entities.cfg` had:  Changed that to True and it seems ERROR msg in console has dissapeared.  (false by default and it's when error spams console).
I just changed this line:      # If true the orbital laser will actually mine blocks on the planet below     B:laserDrillPlanet=true It works fine for overworld btw. [advancedRocketry.zip](https://github.com/zmaster587/AdvancedRocketry/files/3776231/advancedRocketry.zip)

Apologies for the poor description.  The random chevrons engage and light up when you remove all stored glyphs on the gate. 
Sorry for the vague description, but my pull request should solve the problem. If the done vector is static, the synchronization on the public methods should not work. 
Sorry for the brief report and thanks for the quick answer!   I will try again after the next release and supply some more information if the error still occurs.

@maxanier   The models are now rendering properly, but the nametags are still crazy long. xd I didn't convert the pig in the photo. My world had corrupted so I had to become a vampire all over again and found a pig naturally spawned (or perhaps converted by another vampire?) in the Vampire Forest.  
ANE does not show all leaderboards. It is show only ANEs that listed by IDs. If I use method LeaderBoards.showAll() - nothing happened. I checked android log and it says that there is no leaderboards ids to display. Something like "No extra achievememnt ids..." 
Hello again!    Sorry for bringing poor information about the bug, I was a little busy. Today I have been 2 entire hours making a deep investigation on this bug on a new empty server, and I figure it out a lot of things.   The first thing I have to noticed, is that the bug doesn't actually comes entirely from Essentials, and now I'm confused about considering this a bug or not, maybe it is likely more a conflict problem that was actually fixed by Essentials, but not fully fixed (you will understand it after reading the How to reproduce the bug)  **How to reproduce the bug, step-by-step** - You will need the following 6 plugins (Vault, EssentialsX, EssentialsXChat, ChatInyector and its dependencies: PlaceHolderAPI and ProtocolLib) *Forget about LuckPerms, I used it for letting "Test" shout a message to demostrate you that the format [Shout] is already fixed. ![2020-03-05_11 17 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43190931/75990759-1e246200-5ed4-11ea-8910-ed90d028469b.png) - After having the 6 plugins downloaded, you must download Player expansion for PlaceHolderAPI with _/papi ecloud download Player_. Then, the only thing you need to change on the config.yml of Essentials is on the EssentialsChat section. You must enable the radius chat, changing it from 0 to any number higher than it (in my case: 100 blocks). - On the "format:" you must change it from "<{DISPLAYNAME}> {MESSAGE}" to "<{player_name}> {MESSAGE}" and here it comes the big question, "Why would you change the displayname variable with player_name?" Well, first of all, remember this is the fastest way to reproduce the bug, but on my detailed server I use it for avoiding players who used to be Vip group with their nickname changed, to show their realname whenever their Vip group would expire, or also to obligate players with staff groups inherited, to always show their real name, even if before becoming staff they had a custom nickname defined. There are a lot more reasons about this, but I won't be splashing much more on this, as it's not the topic. - You can now restart the server. And after you do, you will need to join the server with two differrent accounts for obviously reasons. One of them will need to have OP so that way you can "Spy" the messages sent by the other account when it is out of the chat-radius.  **So, after following those steps, you will notice this results:** ![2020-03-05_11 17 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43190931/75992507-d6eba080-5ed6-11ea-9719-070f65bdb94c.png)  The name I used for the one that is OP and will spy the messages is "Tomi010817", and for the one that will send the messages, is "Test".   As you can see, when "Test" sent a raw message as Local, and "Tomi010817" was out of his chat-radius, "Tomi010817" didn't have other alternative of spying the local message, so you can clearly see that the placeholder on the Spy Local format "[L][SPY]" gets bugged, showing the name of the one who spies it (in this case Tomi010817). This also happens with other placeholders intended to show stuff owned by "Test" instead of "Tomi010817" (for example his Rank, I will attach an extra example image of the bug including group ranks also, at the end of the reply)  I think that this should be fixed by Essentials and not by other plugin author, because Essentials has already fixed this problem with the Local format "[L]" and with the Shout format "[Shout]" (you can see on the image above that the bug doesn't occur with those chat formats) So I will guess that Essentials only forgot to also fix this problem with the [L][Spy] chat format.    Below this, I will also bring you the same example but also using group ranks. ![2020-03-05_11 09 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43190931/75994040-23d07680-5ed9-11ea-922f-b60e2d35df90.png)   The last message sent by "Test" on both example images, is the same message but "Tomi010817" is inside the chat-radius of "Test", so "Tomi010817" doesn't have any need to spy the message, and you can see that that format is fixed.   In short words, Essentials maybe forgot to also fix the compatibility with ChatInyector, on the Local Spy "[L][Spy]" chat format.  Hope you can read this, and if you could, thank you very much for taking the time of reading this long text. 💜 if you want more detailed info about the problem, or even join the server and see the bug with me, you can add me on discord: Tomi010817#8699      
Looks like there's two problems:  On one machine, it's a JVM memory issue error code 137. One another machine, it's the git clone on the host that has unknown userid/group.    Going to git clone inside the container ( correct userid/group is set ) and rebuild from there.
I don't think so. The two layers that get mixed up are both of type 'span'.
Works beautifully! Thank you so much!
Medium is pre-selected from the last scan in my case.. if i do not change it, it shows low in the scan.. (so it picks the first one it finds?) if reselecting medium before the scan everything is fine. Can give you a more detailed instruction tomorrow if required. 
The versiin was the latest at the time of the post, and the map.xml is the one on maps.oc.tc. 
Yes I am using Gradle - version 6.1.1. Android Gradle Plugin version 3.5.3. Is there any easy way to see which files does Proguard take into account? 🤔(similar to _Merged Manifest_ view in Android Studio)  In the meantime I'll try to prepare simple repro repository. 
I tested and the issue still persists on my side. There is a lot of lines `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` on the file opened with sublime text.  https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/875#issuecomment-486396726

Sure, where can i find this snapshot ?
Ahh I see, you are correct. As a sanity check I confirmed that the 0.8.9 artifact in maven was indeed targeted to 1.8.   I agree this is an issue with the standard library.   Doing some digging this is the path that I see- 1. Cast to Buffer in all appropriate places 2. It looks like they added --release for this very issue. http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/247   so `--release 8` would need to be specified in addition to sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility in gradle.  This will cause a compiler error for all places where the cast is needed (making it detectable at compile time instead of at runtime)  I would be happy to look into this further and submit a PR if you think this is the correct path to go down.

Hi @laa  yes , i recover my data with `insert into from select .....`  command now , thanks for help . i have no any more log data but if you want to reproduce this event i recommend you run a stress test with the following steps :  1- set test environment to  : Linux , 4 Core Cpu , 8GB Ram . 2- create two class with 1000 record per class . 3- call update on first class with 2kb data with 100 itreation or more per second  . 4 - during the call update a client send insert command to second class .  5 - after some hours the database must be hang and cpu goes to 100% usage .  6- terminate the orientdb process with kill -9 signal  7- run the ODB and check the record count .   Thanks  Saeed Tabrizi

It's standard Spring Boot configuration without any custom metrics. The only difference against standard is that we are adding tags and using dot configuration  
The issue I have seems to be something totally different from what I initially thought--but there were still errors coming from this skript bizarrely.  The issues I'm having all have to do with using "offline player" and join and leave events. Here is the message I am receiving that crashes skript: "An error happened when trying to enably resolving offline players, so the feature has been turned off." 
No, I used the old format (i.e., the current default format). Anyway, there is no reason that all my  changes get lost just because I save the editor.

Hi Lars,  The test also works with postgresql but it fails if the comment contains only one single quote e.g: using `-- it's a comment`  instead of `-- and 'exciting' comment`. This is the exception I'm getting; it doesn't look like it's from the JDBC driver:   
I've tested out 362fafe, here are the results: Booted up the emulator, with shaders enabled, and started up the game, tested loading game save from main menu with "Continue" as well as all other options such as "Start Game" and the gallery, music player, etc. Did not run into the freeze issue. Shut down the emulator and then restarted it (game doesn't seem to run anymore if I simply use the emulator's reset), loaded the game and repeated the process 4 times, still did not run into the freeze issue again. :+1:   Title logo animations issue remains. Also while I was in the gallery, I tested out playing a cutscene animation unlocked during gameplay, the same issue with the green sheen remains. There is also a noticeably delay between choosing to start the playback and when the graphical content of the animation actually shows on screen, even though the audio of the animation starts playing right away. Just to clarify, I say "cutscene animation", but it's not 3D generated within the game, instead being a prerecorded 2D animation, likely a video file.  Also even though the green sheen is the most noticeable issue during playback of the animation, it's not the only issue. While the audio of the animation plays at a smooth rate, the actual graphical content barely displays at all. Only the occasional image is visible throughout the entire video.

I was using the Modern Warfare and Simple Parts packs, version 4.9.0 of each. As for Forge, I think at the time of this report I was using 1291 (sorry I forgot to include it in the OP), but now I'm on 1343.  I've been assembling an update and had moved up to Forge 1352 (latest that doesn't change the Fluid registry stuff and crash some mods), and updated to Flan's 4.10.0 to see if it'd still give me the error at some point, and it did. It's the exact same crash but I'm dumb and didn't bother to look at the full log to see the erroring entity ID, though I was able to once again log into the world after disabling Flan's, so that tells me it's still something to do with Flan's. I would try the absolute latest Forge builds but it doesn't work with a number of the mods that I have, at least not until they update.  I dunno though, it just seems to happen when something spawns, could it be a strange mod interaction messing with entity ID registry? I'm unsure of how entity stuff works in Minecraft's code so I probably don't know what I'm talking about here. 
Also next log may be related to the error message 
I'm totally with you. I've also like the more flexible. I would thing just of a simple map with key --> value, e.g.    The screenshot is misleading. I just wanted a way to add dynamic information below a spec check, maybe about the environment, used grid node, browser .... 
It only happens when I have sentinel added to its traits.
Well as far as I can tell, the current behavior is exactly backwards. 
Very sorry, I have no idea. It seems to crop up more often in my current project / configuration.  This might be because I  - copy-paste a vast amount - use shift a lot to select - use opt+shift to change selection word-by-word.  This might be helpful.
Registered items included saddle, armors and chest. Try to shift click a stack of diamond while opening the GUI

I created a new mod today that solves that issue of the button with bwm's harder steel recipe enabled. It adds a much easier top make some button.

I have solved using almost the same workflow as in the tutorial.  The issue seems due to the different tasks that I was considering for the DAG generation (org.ietr.preesm.experiment.pimm2srdag.StaticPiMM2SrDAGTask) and for the scheduling (org.ietr.preesm.plugin.mapper.listschedulingfromdag).   Thank you very much for the availability 
It's fixed, thanks! :D
Ah, forgot, sorry. Was "A Will Eternal" on Wuxiaworld - though you might not be able to reproduce it now with the Karma system in place :/. Sorry if the report is too late to help.
i figured it out i tihnk  BROADCASTER_QUEUE_CHANGE is triggering it.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3333956/23445465/3cd7bff8-fe01-11e6-8b95-a569022f34d0.png) 
Hi, I've tried to get some logs in my browser but it seems that there are no client side exceptions.  Unfortunately it is not possible to share my application because it's a real project and I dont have a test application for this specific issue.
I've tried with the latest version 11.0.1, this issue is still there! And yes, it's responding on the fill area even if it has fill="none"!
> Im interested in understanding issue more. How are you overriding the base path? Are you using an API gateway?  Nothing fancy really, just the Spring property server.servlet.contextPath=/data All 3 tests were done with the same code base and configuration, just switching the Springfox version. 
Thanks for your time. I tried to get more information by passing `-Dconsole.log=verbose` through various means (Capsule and log4j parameters, exe command line) without more success. The whole message I get is:    Actually it seems like command line parameters are ignored, or not passed to Capsule.  How could I get more details? Do you want me to share the whole project?  Regards. 
My mistake I meant #1173. I've updated the original post to say so. #1169 works fine, it's my current fallback, stability wise. 
Confirming this fix, wohoo! Thanks for the quick response. 
"Any errors in console? have you another plugins? What minecraft version do you have? What bedwars version do you have?

Thanks A lot this is fixed 
I have solved this problem.The reason is config file `spring-datasource.xml` missing config  `xsi:schemaLocation="                         http://shardingsphere.io/schema/shardingsphere/sharding                         http://shardingsphere.io/schema/shardingsphere/sharding/sharding.xsd"`  But the official website documents  are also wrong. Here is the document.  http://shardingsphere.io/document/current/cn/manual/sharding-jdbc/configuration/config-spring-namespace/ and http://shardingsphere.io/document/current/cn/manual/sharding-jdbc/usage/sharding/  in `基于Spring命名空间的规则配置` snippet
> When you fork a JVM, did you also measure the total memory footprint by both those JVMs?   It is living for only a few seconds, what I see from the system explorer - additional 300 MBs. So short term (during the first several modules build) it will consume more memory, but the average memory consumption and the peek one will be definitely less with the fork.
The WebIDE doesn't have a performance section anymore like in the screenshots, but the connected console view does. I'm assuming it just moved (I'm using Nightly on desktop). I took a profile though it never ended when I pressed the end button. Still I was able to save it. Attached JSON file. (zipped because Github won't let you paste in JSON files).  I can confirm that disabling all audio greatly reduces the initial slowdown.    [profile.json.zip](https://github.com/MozillaReality/FirefoxReality/files/2700800/profile.json.zip) 
Unfortunately I don't know. It did not happen in the version that was installed before, but don't ask me, what version that was :D  I think adding     to App.onCreate() fixed the issue though 
I made a collection of examples in the main folder, with a bunch of files from `guava` 
  No TLS. Thanks for the hint about the Jetty server dump, I'll revisit the issue as soon I can reproduce this.
@cm0x4D I can but the explosions are infinite like I said. so when I load the world again the console is spammed VERY rapidly with that message I showed in pastebin. When I toggle explosions in the config file I am still spammed in the console.

It was started using docker and port _8080_ as described in the "Development Setup" section (`docker run -e SEED=/tmp/inout.yml --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/src/test/resources/example,target=/tmp -p 8080:8080 nivio:latest`) and then opening the page from another machine.  I also just noticed that not only _localhost_ but also port _8080_ is hardcoded. I found out by chaning the port using `-p 8099:8080` for example. This is still true for the latest commit (https://github.com/bonndan/nivio/commit/87ed465df042d5bfd6dccf6406c8964294570cbc)!  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32487587/67037856-a28d6880-f11e-11e9-8ea3-93edffa535ee.png)

No I did nothing to the Manifest.MF and I believe I downloaded it from curse

I tryed that, but it dosnt seem to improve things.
Thx for the quick reply!  I'm using Telekom's MagentaCloud software to sync my encrypted data to the cloud. MagentaCloud is essentially a WebDAV client/server system.  Oviously the ``.DAV`` folders containing the ``.dir`` and ``.pag`` files are created by the MagentaCloud software. A little reasearch on the web suggests that these files contain information related to WebDAV. I'm not sure wether these files can be deleted safely. IMHO you're quite right: The upgrade routine should ignore all files and directories not associated to the vault.
An empty coordinate array would be the obvious equivalent representation, and what I initially expected I'd get. I dug through the GeoJsonWriter code and realized it was a deliberate choice that, to quote a comment in the test class, "empty atomic geometries are not supported in GeoJSON", so my suggestion for using a  null-value was based on that (and the spec's somewhat vague "implementation _may_ interpret...").  Personally, I'd prefer an empty coordinate array, to maintain the type as you say, but I don't know if that has, say, some interop issues.
Nope, sorry, nothing at all. It was one of the first things I've tried but I forgot to mention it.  I still blame the native packager, though. Since I can reproduce the issue at any time I'd be happy to look into it, but I don't know a thing about native packaging nor JavaFX. Any keywords you might suggest I look into? 
I'm using "Tomcat for java" vscode extension to launch on debug my war file. I can debug the main source folder with it but not the dependencies.
The latest version
Usually it would happen if I just started my computer, opened Eclipse, and immediately chose to open my app's map editor. I'll give you more information about exactly what was going on when it happens next time.  Yeah, 17 seconds is a bit much and I usually end up force closing the app when it takes longer than about 7 seconds. Once I try it again, it only takes on average 1 second or so.  How did you get that profiling view that shows how long each process takes? Is that part of Eclipse? 
1.I use Sharding-Proxy 4.0.0-RC2, which is downloaded from [https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/downloads/](shardingsphere.apache.org)  2.The config-sharding.yaml file is as follows: [config-sharding.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/files/3759821/config-sharding.txt)  3.The SQL is `select COLUMNS_V2.* from COLUMNS_V2 left join SDS ON SDS.CD_ID = COLUMNS_V2.CD_ID left join TBLS ON TBLS.TBL_ID = SDS.SD_ID`  4.The running log is as follows: [log.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-shardingsphere/files/3759827/log.txt)  
Uh, yes, I can always reproduce it. I use the latest the riot version from the playstore with android 6. To my knowledge I have all relevant power saving features disabled.  When I get a mention or a highlight on matrix. My phone vibrates and the LED starts blinking. When I now open Riot in the browser and read the message the phone continues to blink. Now when I pick up my phone and open riot-android. I can see the notifications for a split second and then the client apparently gets all informations from the server and marks everything read and deletes the notifications. 
/enchant -o and -u is the only one that comes to mind.
> @lucaa i guess the issue is only appear during dev mode (with instant run).  @herau Actually, it seems not. @stephanegigandet just managed to reproduce on his phone, and he never installed this application in dev mode. He had an old version from the playstore (which was crashing when loading a product), then he upgraded to the newest version from the playstore and the issue was still  reproducing. Then, he cleaned the application cache and application data (as I described above), relaunched the application and everything worked fine.
Well, in 2.x map loading was done within a blink of an eye (<1s), but in 3.x it takes at least 10s. The thing is we don't want to lazy-load maps, in fact, our sw is build upon the feature that maps are loaded with all the data once and for all, at a given time. Is it possible to bring back that feature, and provide some kind of map loading policy configuration, to be able to choose whether I want lazy-loading or not?  Thanks. 
The audio also freezes. It completely stops everything, except the app itself. I can go back. Usually I do a combination of selecting a point forward in the video/pausing/going back. I am afraid it happens with every video. Playing them locally after download works as expected.
Sorry, I forgot the most important thing and confused DD with DW yesterday. This is the example i wanted to show you:    miau in `PUSH miau` should be replaced by a 32-bit address, right? but jasmin complains that the operand is too short ("error: operand must be at least two bytes large")!  If I insert a DWORD before miau, like `PUSH DWORD miau`, it works. Shouldn't it also work without the DWORD thing? 
The problem is that the chosen-sprite.png is used in the css file to define multiple background (that I wrapped by the literal function, otherwise it doesn't work):

This week hopefully. Next week at latest I think
Hi Goran,  With the latest v0.0.51 and v0.0.52 it finished building, but still the console shows the same error message. Running the game seems to work, but doesn't show a 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL'.  Thanks,  Here's the message:   
0.5.4 of Advanced Rocketry + 0.7.17.1109 of TechReborn + 1.1.0.15 of RebornCore 
@Siedlerchr Thank you very much for fixing this.  Ctrl+S works now, if the star appears and the star is away. However the star does not appear, after changing groups, or edit existing entries. But appears, when creating a new article entry. Should I create a new ticket for this?  
I just wrote a test like this

It seems it's my world file?  I have now found out it is due to the region file in the world file which always calls the error!! what can block in there the time is money?   In another case I saw was a shulker box guilty so the plugin didn't work: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/shop-a-simple-intuitive-shop-plugin-paid.79064/page-110  but here I see at Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: nothing   Here it says only **Caused by: java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size: 0**
not yet
It was on launch.  Also I tested a bit more, you're right. It works fine with just asielib and computronics.  Problem arises when you add Gregtech to the mix.   gregtech_1.7.10-5.06.04.jar industrialcraft-2-2.2.653-experimental

I'm afraid I cannot be equal to this task. I'm not familiar with the internal mechanism of Vert.x.  :D
There was a log for just one day on one of the phones.  Just to be clear, there are logs both before and after that three day period. For example, there were logs for yesterday. Only the logs for those three days are missing. The phones were not restarted during this whole period as they were on charging. Also, all three phones are password and fingerprint protected.
I think I've accounted for the cold start, but I made only about a 100 requests in sequence. I might have hit it on a particularly 'cold' day, though, will try again. Also Google's definition of an active store probably has a lot more 0s on the requests/second count.  I measured by turning on the HTTP logger that's included in the Ruby example and looking at the output for sequential runs - definitely not a well thought out benchmark, but enough to show what's going on.  
Hi @jgrandja ,  thanks for the pointer. It just works as you have described. But it is not what I have been looking for...  Background: I have many rolebased annotations with should be used in our code base. I want to simplify usage in test cases, so the name of the annotation itself describes the role very good and I don´t want that other developers have to handle annotation parameters...  Using the annotation itself I have to write N WithSecurityContextFactories with the same implementation, but with different annotations as parameter.  @TestWithRoleXY - createSecurityContext(TestWithRoleXY customUserLikeAnnotation) { @TestWithRoleYZ- createSecurityContext(TestWithRoleYZ customUserLikeAnnotation) {  The implementation is the same because I am using Reflection to read the annotation parameters and the annotation parameters are the same for all annotations...  This leads to more code (easy code) and I only want to say that it was easier before... This ticket can be closed if the previous behaviour will not be reverted...  I saw some changes by @rwinch in the classes which processes the WithSecurityContextFactories, so maybe you know more, Rob?  Thanks, Jens 
Sure, will do
I am sure  only create one SQLiteOpenHelper,  and i use 3.12.2,      it happen at the first time i run my app.   my error is happen at sqlite_open_v2 in android_database_SQLiteConnection.cpp nativeopen function . it can open database but can't  create db.   Could you send me a demo , show how to use you lib by source integration ? my email is  8394420@qq.com  or  hyy8394420@gmail.com     
@jeffbrown, yeah, I originally thought it's related to `@MicronautTest` but then I was looking at the `HttpClientIntroductionAdvice#getClient()` and apparently, it's a micronaut-core feature/bug as you're "caching" the client in the map and the key is determined by clientId and path at `computeClientKey()` cc @jameskleeh 
I just don't want players to be able to demolish or place anything in the wilderness that's all I ask, otherwise it's just a top plugin!

Hi Karl, we have decided to merge files into one (it is better anyway). It is not a problem for us anymore. May be it is simpler to allow to choose only one file when uploading WSDL ?  I cannot provide the real file, but it contains the following definition: <wsdl:import namespace="http://URL" location="part.wsdl"/> 
The example is not graphic but I can give you instructions on how to recreate:  Bug #1: 1. Create event in icalendaragenda with a weekly reccurence 2. Edit a reccurence of the created event (descriptive or time) and select "this event only" when prompted. 3. Select the editted reccurence and press delete (nothing should happen, no prompt for options either, log says successful delete)  Bug #2: Not sure if this is a bug or a feature but the option to edit "this event only" on an instance of an event reccuring daily, monthly or yearly is not given. 1. Create event that reccures daily 2. Select a reccurence/edit a reccurence 3. Prompt will only show "all events,", and,"this and future".  And I will send a test case of proccessCancel (that seems to be the location of the problem) of the first bug when I get the chance. Hope this help, Sorry about poor communication I'm in highschool so I haven't really learned the technical edicate side of the industry.

From what I've seen it appears to happen on entity fields every time.  Also I'm not sure if it's really a false positive since it is indeed overriding the parent class field name. I still want this inspection in most cases, just not this particular instance.
Hi @crnjan ,  When I looked at the heatpump for running hours (could only find one menu item (7.1)), that should be running hours since installation, it showed -18701 (a negative value...)  Attaching log as well. [rego.log](https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/files/3633380/rego.log) 
There are two cycles shown there - starting from `com.impossibl.postgres.system.procs.AutoConvertingTextDecoder.convertOutput(BaseDecoders.java:247)`  This is happening before any queries, after we initialize the C3P0 connection pool.  We've seen another intermittent error on startup that caused a `java.lang.IllegalStateException: type has no supported parameter format: timestamp(1114)` exception to be thrown when trying to run a query early in our app startup that involves a timestamp object. Our best guess is an issue with the shared registry. I mention this as we are wondering if some kind of race-condition-on-startup is the culprit for both.  One other complication to note is that we are using a C3P0 pool for the majority of our connections, but create a single direct connection in order to attach a PGNotificationListener. Again, I'm wondering if there is some kind of registry conflict happening.

Hey @shawnmaten , We are uploading the image file from SD card which can be nearly 5 MB utmost. ` (e.g.: /storage/emulated/0/ProjectName/IMG_20171221_161402228.jpg)`  Currently we have two File Stack API key. One for production (client supplied api key) and one for development (we registered with free account for this api key) **We are able to upload the files successfully with the development API key.** **But for production API key it fails.** Development API key is linked with the free account where all the files are uploaded to default storage of File Stack. Production API key is linked with the premium account where while uploading the files we set the default storage of File Stack. But in case of production, client have S3 bucket which must have been linked with the File Stack. We think this must be causing issue. Please check.  -- Thanks, Abhijit

Thanks @pejovica, I confirm that the proposed patch fixes it.
I was using 6.1 which aborted parsing. I upgraded to 6.2 which tolerates such a statement, but it seems to just skip until closing brace:  
  as we see above,there is no constructor with no parameters in the KeystoneAuth class. this may cause some problems when using jackson to handle  it 
Version v1.10.R1 
no, I added it just in my code, never thought about having to add a library more than just once
No need to apologize ;) I'll provide a PR as soon as possible!  David. 
I did some digging, and realised it's not actually `native.cc_library`; it's a reference to a tool in `native.genrule`. Apologies for confusion. Details below.  In a `BUILD`:    `bazel build --cpu='x64_windows_msvc' <tool>` works fine. `bazel build --cpu='x64_windows_msvc' schema_cc`, however, tries to re-compile `<tool>` with `C:/tools/msys64/usr/bin/gcc`.  Context: Bazel 0.3.0. 
Installed it two days ago. Not sure what version it is on. How do I check the version it is running, so I can add it to the issue next time? 
maybe - let me see if i can get it to hang outside of jenkins and i can hit it w/ `jstack` 
I guess the owner of one of the downstream projects would have to decide that they wanted the fix, and then request it, at which point we could think about helping them. ;) 
thank you! :)

It looks like the right side only does that on larger screen sizes, if I shrink my window size, jei moves back to the correct position.  Favorites side of jei does seem to be working.  As to why the curios button isn't there, I'm not sure why. It's in the top right corner, but invisible. I can still click on it too.

@ShawnieBoy I think you are on the right track, it is to do with how MCTS randomizes the hidden information during simulation. The opponent has creature card in hand, and could activate Volrath's ability, but when it went into the simulation the hidden cards (opponent's hand) is randomized and there is no longer any creature card.  @lodici what is the connection to build 1497? I do not see the link between the crash in that build and this issue. 
Just updated the latest build and it does appear to be working. Sorry, should have checked that first.

When both sliders are set to minimum, the height is a couple hundred feet, and the width is like 3.5 miles. 
Reproduce steps: 1. Do packet capture with `wireshark` or `tcpdump`; 2. Client connect to web socket server implemented by vertx; 3. On client web socket side, call `close` which would trigger a `CLOSE` type frame to server. 4. Stop packet capture 5. From packet capture, vertx server didn't echo `CLOSE` type frame back to client as expected. It just finished the tcp connection.  From code side, change Line 699 to the following debug code.      Hope this would help. 
Thanks. It might be a problem on my side.  On Thu, Sep 25, 2014 at 12:18 PM, Fleur Kelpin notifications@github.com wrote:  > Looks like this one occurs exclusively in the VM.

As far as I found out the reason seems to be a bit of a design flaw. A `Handle` creates a ThreadLocal for its config in its constructor.  Now, if a `LazyHandleSupplier` is used, in its `initHandle()` method the `LazyHandleSupplier` overwrites this ThreadLocal of a `Handle` via a package private setter. This setter is only used there and its only reason seems to be to support the `LazyHandleSupplier`. Thing is: The `LazyHandleSupplier` also handles the clean-up of the ThreadLocals that itself has set to the `Handle` by this setter.  Seems good. It handles the things it created. But if the `Handle` is not managed by a `LazyHandleSupplier` (as is the case when using jdbi.withHandle() method), the ThreadLocal, created by the `Handles` constructor, is never destroyed in the `Handles` `close()` method. Problem is: As soon as the `Handle` will destroy its own ThreadLocals created in its constructor, it also would destroy the ThreadLocals that are set by the `LazyHandleSupplier` and therefor `Handle` would possibly affect `LazyHandleSuppliers` internal state. That's the flaw I was talking about.  Hope I'm on the right track and this helps to fix the issue. Please let me know.

Same mistake
Because the newest version of Computronics depends on a newer Buildcraft than the one bundled with the version of TPPI2 that I'm running, and upgrading single mods willy-nilly has bitten me in the past; I'll wait for the TPPI2 team.  As for why I wanted to compile it, there's a particular bug I'm trying to fix, but I wanted to figure out exactly what is happening (extra logging!) before submitting a pull request. And, you know, making sure my patch compiles.  I'll show you the crash report, though: http://www.pastebin.ca/3033473  It appears to happen when moving away from lamps, although only some of the time; it affects players with poor internet connections more than ones with fast connections. My current wild-ass guess is a race condition between unloading the chunk and stopping tile updates, since the air block is ID 0. 
What would be the best way to change the log level?
I just reprod on emulator w/ Android 7.0.  Plan a trip from University Area Transit Center to Marion Transit Center at 2:00pm, make sure real-time info is shown in the trip times (i.e., some times crossed out), and then hit the home button to background the app and wait around 10-15 seconds.  Key seems to be finding trip with real-time info, then hitting home to background app.  Seems that once you reproduce this once, as well, it keeps crashing - at least that's the behavior on the device I've seen.
Sorry this is all I have. Its a crash picked up from Fabric and we have a few issues getting it to correctly de-obfuscated the stack trace from time to time. Before the version upgrade from 1.x -> 2.x we never had this problem
Thank you for the reply!   I could not reproduce the error in a stand alone example. So it  seems my suggestion was wrong.   Here is the full JS Stacktrace. Can you suggest anything  why this could happen? (I guess I am doing something wrong then.)   Are there any logs I can enable to see more information? The only thing I can understand here is "onreadystatechange is variable $0 undefined"    Thank you very much! 
Yes we did. In the ISWC paper we (i) defined the notion of matching triples for a given triple pattern and (ii) formalized triple pattern selectors in terms of this notion. By these definitions, a triple (ex:Bob,foaf:knows,ex:Alice) is _not_ a matching triple for the triple pattern (?x,foaf:knows,?x) and, thus, this triple must not be included in the data of the TPF of that triple pattern.  BTW, what we did not capture formally is the possibility of omitting elements of a triple pattern in a request.  @RubenVerborgh  
I wholeheartedly agree that using using Oracle databases (at least from Java) is best avoided.  However, I've run my tests with JDBI from HEAD against an Oracle database and everything looks good!
Here is the logs of my-cluster-kafka-0 pod.  You are right, I made a mistake, it is 0.16.2/examples/kafka/kafka-ephemeral-single.yaml. But I firstly used the "persistent" one (1 zookeeper replica) and it failed. Then I choose to switch to "ephemeral" (1 zookeeper replica) with the same results.

Actually the engine-tests bit was originally split out from (also) IntelliJ not handling it too well either, something about the mixture of source and test compilation dependencies and getting the order right :-(  Will have to look at it more closely when an opportunity presents itself - thanks for the intel :-) 
v0.2.1.35.

I don't know if this would work for everything, but since most types of config files use a ":" to seperate the keys from the values, you could check if there's at least one colon in a line and in case there is, exclude everything before the first colon from the renamer.
@pq I am running a multi module project right now, and it does not run. I have encountered the plugin running flutter packages instead of pub, but I believe that it was a while ago and a single module project (so it may have changed).  
I am always selecting trackables over inventory of a cache like this one: - Search for GC1EK7E - Open the cache data - Tap on Inventory - Select "I want to find the...." (TB3W6GY) - Select again - No logs shown  Same happens if i directly search and open the TB. Version: 2.26 RC3

WPA standards specifies that you have to have a password length of >= 8. I was in the middle of implementing a fix for this and will finish it today. I was a bit naive in how I did in in `2.5.3` so I will address it by end of day.  For the latest stable release, install @2.5.0

Yes, first time i have configured it have saved all signed blobs. But not the new one yet.
Yes, this is on Windows.  It looks like the path translation is invalid.     The MD has:      - [My Stuff](FileB.md)  But the plugin appears to be converting that to an invalid path.  
@rsudev map activity most of the time. I think once it was cache description but then I had no crash (as @Lineflyer wrote, can be really the same as #7300) No I cannot because sometimes (maybe when there was not enough time and app was still "active") it works, but often I'm getting crash.  Master from couple.of days ago + su.
Seems to be fixed, thank you
no its not working :(  after the last item is removed, it still shows the item on the side, no number above, and pulling "fake-stacks" out 
de. But same results with en. Maybe something with my config. I will test it further when I get the time after new year
@maggiolo00  Typically this happens after the database was opened, and records were inserted to some classes, by which Lucene indexes got updated. When I do a 'gracefull' shutdown then, the above error appears nearly always in the logfile.

Same issue.  Sorry, I had also tested that, should have included in comment as well.  I have a test-project setup, just not sure where to upload it? I can great a public github repo if it helps? Is pretty straight forward though.
@sibelius the stack trace of the out of memory?     While if the remote debugger is on, it all works without any issue.
Hello Claudio This would be a nice-to-have - however, the device details screen is super critical for us - we are starting to depend on consistency in this screen for in-field issues.

Thanks for the fast response. Turning off the word wrap indeed seems to mitigate the issue a lot (auto-format was already off), goes from hangs forever to hangs for ~10s. This still seems quite long to me, but I can live with that. Does this behaviour seem normal to you ? I can't really concieve how accessing data already fetched could consume 10s of full cpu, or how computing a few thousands linebreaks would takes half an hour... Smells like something off in the Value tab formating ^^ I'm sorry I'm not allowed to disclose the actual content of the json. It is a list of ~600 json objects, each of depth 2, for a total just over 80k chars. Let me now if I can provide more data on the issue, else I'll just make do with the short freezes...
@codemanyak Hi Kay,  easiest way to see what I mean: 1. open structorizer - it shows progamname "???" 2. insert a parallel element 3. select program frame and give the program a new name - now you can see, that the Line "??? is not a valid..." didn't disapear. Try it again without a parallel element and the Line "??? is not..." will be cleard. - You can save the programm - now with a valid program name - start structorizer again and open the program again. The line "??? is not ..." still remains.  HTH Rolf 
It can run react 5 without any problems on the same server, it currently have 4GB of ram to play with. It crashes every time it run any /re command
The issue is when I use the javacpp maven plugin, I got a failure just because I use maven 3.0.3 to build my wrapper.  Basically I would have to rebuild javacpp and upload it to our internal nexus to bypass the requirement. (Will work as we don't use nexus-staging-maven-plugin 1.6.6) But I would prefer to use directly the official version. 
Yes, this crash also happens when I create a new folder named "test" in "/" and switch to grid view. The app also crashes when I restart it, delete the folder and recreate it. It then crashes immediately, I don't even have to switch to grid view.  When I clear the `currentLog.txt` file and then immediately create the folder "test" (the app crashing in the process) no log file is created at all.  Immediately before the exception is thrown, there is this entry in Logcat:  
After updating I did not notice the bug again, though my network has been connected to a battery since then. I'll try to reconstruct the original situation in a creative world when I have time,
Same problem with 2.0.11-beta (in fact, I started with that version, and then decremented one by one till the problem was gone). 
More importantly, error is about "Table does not exist" vs "Schema does not exist". I've updated description.
I will upgrade and let you know
Pls fix this now 
Hmm, just gone off on a bit of an adventure by delving into EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelector and you're right that it wouldn't make a difference as it only exludes the classes specifically registered with spring.factories and not their inner @Configuration classes. This means the auto-configuration classes are a bit of an all-or-nothing but I guess that's not too much of a problem cos they can be just reimplemented by whatever code is using them as a dependency.  Anyway, the exception is:    because AbstractDialect no longer has a no-args constructor in version 3 - so probably not really fixable. 
Sorry, my bad. I meant HttpRequest, not HttpClient.  This is the StringBuilder use in question:  https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/blob/master/modules/org.restlet/src/org/restlet/engine/adapter/HttpRequest.java#L158 
I isolated the problem to the Crusher. No other machine has problems with accepting inputs from Logisitical Transporters, occasionally I'll have clumps drop out of the machine. Not sure if it's an oversend issue or if the Crusher isn't processing inputs properly. 
yes I do 
I updated Golang to the latest 1.8.1 give it a try and build still fails. Might it be something related to this [issue](https://github.com/yudai/gotty/issues/18) for gotty? 
Hi Marc, Thank you for the quick response. I'm using the GUI PeptideShaker version 1.13.4 in ArchLinux. I was also experiencing a similar issue in Windows 7 with GUI version 1.13.1. I was able to save the PeptideShaker project and put it in this DropBox folder along with other potentially useful files: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/av7t6yz7zk3n9hu/AADenc80E02rdhVRp_Zyeoi1a?dl=0 
Thank you for reply.
