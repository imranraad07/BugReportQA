When launching Gama, the platform launch and the models (included) are correctly displayed.But when opening any of those models, the experiment button is never (or sometimes, after like 10 minutes) "green" : it displays "Waiting...", for a very long time.When trying to launch the experiment by unfolding the model file, it also fails : the experiment GUI is opened,  but seems to stop loading its content : there is no "launch" button, and nothing can be done :  !When launching Gama from  terminal, no usefull crash/bug is logged, only some little useless graphical glitches.1.7+on Ubuntu, so, there must be a way to have it work, but right now, with the informations described in the Wiki (troubleshooting included), it's not working.if/how this can be solved, but it would for sure be usefull to have some recent versions of Gama working on Ubuntu, especially considering all the errors that have been corrected since 1.6  Any hint/idea/test/report would be highly appreciated :)

When I am reading through the MCforums , replying and helping people, I often see them making bug reports or adding new features, so I though why not put them all in hereBoomerang - Weapon flies out and back to you instantly destroying all enemies it hits, but you can't shoot it again until it returns and it travels fairly slow.First, it still has all the old costs, even though in game, they only cost half.Third, the bombs still say they destroy gemmed walls, even though they now destroy cracked walls.When you level up the collectors, it didn't seem to do anything, and I can only assume that means it increases carrying capacity.Honestly, I would rather have it increase range of suckability, even if carrying capacity stays the same.Still, if you COULD clear it up, that would be awesome.When I was downloading the latest build, I wasn't sure WHAT I was downloading.A big, bold permalink on the front page would be very nice, not only for me, but for casual gamers who just want to download the game and play, rather than navigate Jenkins for half an hour (I exaggerate, of course).Also, if I'm just annoying rather than helpful (which is my intent... to be helpful, I mean) then tell me.

Environment variables are ignored when running as rootIf Syncthing runs as root, the su binary does not pass the enviroment variables to the Syncthing binary.all are skipped.To overcome that issue, su provides the option '--preserve-environment'.Adding this to the ProcessBuilder in SyncthingRunnable.java should fix this problem.However, I cannot test that fix, because the su binary on my Fairphone 2 goes crazy.It deletes custom variables and resets some of them, e.g., HOME.Even with '--preserve-environment' the custom variables are deleted.I do not know if it's suitable as a generic solution to that problem.

The "Never" option for "Rebuild open Merge Requests" does not prevent a build   ## IssueWhen setting up the Build Triggers for our Jenkins jobs, we use: Build when a change is pushed to GitLabThe behavior with gitlab-plugin v1.1.32 was that when an open and previously failed merge request had a subsequent push, the build did NOT get triggered.When we upgraded to 1.4.5The documentation on the home page does not describe expected behavior for this configuration, but intuitively this seems broken to me.: Test if the new gitlab-plugin fixes the problem with "Never" rebuild…2) Create a merge request and verify the build fails and merge request remains open.(i.e. fix broken build).) Expect it to never rebuild, but a new build is triggered immediately/automatically.

ContextMenu in AppBar causes errorNow I noticed, that if the `ContextMenu` is open, the `Button` still gets the click-events and tryes to open the `ContextMenu`, which results in an error.I wanted to reproduce this bug to create an Issue in the `ContexMenu` repository, but I was not able to reproduce the error without using the `AppLayout`.When I am placing a `Button` inside a `VerticalLayout` (for example) and create the `ContextMenu`, the `Button` does not get the click events (or hover effects), as long as the `ContextMenu` is open.If the `Button` is placed in the `AppBar` of the `AppLayout` instead, it will get click events and the hover affect is applied, like if it is above the `ContextMenuOverlay`.If you use this code, the `Button` does not have any hover effects and won't get the click event.Note, that in Vaadin 12, there was no error, but still the `Button` got the hover effect

The problem occurs when an XSLT stylesheet that has been stored in eXist-db imports an XML document via the `doc()` function, and tries to process its nodes.This simple stylesheet (`style.xsl`) illustrates the problem:This is clearly a bug, and seems to suggest that nodes are processed in wrong order when they have been imported in an XSLT stylesheet with the doc() function.I have tried to find workarounds for this annoying bug, and discovered that the problem does not happen when: - the same `$test` XML structure is constructed as an XSLT variable and next processed (see style2.xsl) - the same `$test` variable is imported with the doc() function, but first copied indirectly via an identity transform with &lt;xsl:apply-templates/> before further processing (`style3.xsl`)  For convenient testing, I have attached a backup of the test collection containing these documents, including a test xquery (test.xq) which executes all 3 versions of the XSLT stylesheet and reports errors where they occur.While the problem is related to XSLT processing with Saxon, I think this is an eXist issue: the problem only occurs when the XSLT stylesheet is executed with transform:transform() from within the database.When the collection is stored and run from the file system, all goes well.Also, when run with pure Saxon (without eXist), no errors occur with the transformation.

It's checking the permissions for every human entity on the server, regardless if you specify a permission or not in broadcast().But that's not why it's getting worse over time.I dug into how the PermissionSubscriptions are populated and it seems that they're added whenever permissions are recalculated, and only removed when a player disconnects or if it's explicitly called.I don't see any of these methods being used when I search for them in Citizens Github.Every time you spawn an NPC, it adds it to PermissionSubscriptions list and checks its permissions when broadcast() is run.But since it's never removed from this list (since NPCs can't "disconnect"), it keeps building up.

The exception throw might because the plain column's value is from MySQL but not method parameters, and encrypt jdbc can not get the cipher column value in core.It may cause this exception.In my opinion, encrypt jdbc can just omit this cipher column, but not throws an exception,  or It is maybe exist a better way to handle with it.

I found a bug in JedisSentinelPool.At the first switching, it works ok, but in onMessage method, it invokes initPool and pool's destroy method, then it shutdowns the MasterListener.when the next switching happens, there aren't any listener to switch the master and pool, error occurs when  connecting to the failed host.
After a successful connection it runs for a while (less than 2 hours) and without a visible reason the client disconnects (see exception below), status callback is called with DISCONNECTED_RETRYINGbut it never reconnects againBesides that, after updating to 1.13.2 the log has been flooded with the following (even after the connection drops which shouldn't be saying "Successfully send all queued messages" as new messages are queued but they're never sent as the client has disconnected)
When using cache name or alias as a prefix in key, @ReadThroughMultiCache does not work properly.When cache name/alias prefix enabled, @ReadThroughMultiCache does not work properly.I think when ReadThroughMultiCacheAdvice checks missing cached objects, it does not make proper cache keys which do not include cache name/alias prefix.

Energy and CO2 emissions stay constant even if GDP increases   If you let a country exist on its own without Kyoto, monitoring etc.its GDP will increase, but energy output and CO2 output stay the same.I think this is wrong - increased GDP implies industry growth, and so energy output and CO2 should increase too.

On my production server normal players get left behind when they cruise, they will usually cruise with the ship for a bit, maybe 5-6 cruise hops, then suddenly they are pulled back.We thought it was anti cheat, but they were not getting flagged, I also disabled the anticheat to see if it had anything else causing it (AAC) but stayed the same.What is very weird, is as OP I can cruise fine on my production server, but as soon as I de-op myself and move myself down to the lowest rank, I have the same issues cruising!

request canceling if Non-IOException occurred in interceptor   Based on this [issue](https://github.com/gildor/kotlin-coroutines-retrofit/issues/34).If we're throwing exceptions inside interceptor, they should inherit IOException to be properly handled without crashing the app.But there's some situations in which you don't want to inherit IOException.One of this cases: we are handling errors of API.API returns some templated entities with status-code which can be checked to detect some errors like invalid parameters that was passed.And one of error handling solutions is to create interceptor that checks all of requests' responses and throwing domain exceptions if status code indicates error.Builder that will allow us to disable canceling requests if some Non-IOException was thrown inside interceptor.

### Actual behaviour -  I reinstall the app and it creates auto upload folder connections to Instant Upload despite the fact that I have deleted Instant Upload folder and have reinstalled the app so that I could start with fresh auto upload folder connectionsIt asked me if I wanted to auto upload to a folder called "Instant Upload"and when I tried adding things to the Instant Upload folder through the Web UI, I didn't see the changes reflected on my phone.I deleted the Instant Upload folder from my browser web ui 6.but I can see no way to delete them.In the process of taking screenshots on my phone in order to explain the issue it actually kickstarted the system and made it recreate the Instant Upload folder.I however, still can't delete those connections, and as you can see from the screenshots, it means that I have duplicates of the auto upload folder connections junking stuff up.If there's a way to get rid of these excess connections

Tokens with expandable views get cut off if last itemInstead I have made it so that if you click a token it will create a "close button" on the right which the user can then press to close.When the button is revealed it pushes all tokens on its right over slightly to accommodate for its width.If the token is deselected then the button becomes hidden again.Through much hacking and fighting with issues caused by nested clickable buttons (TokenImageSpan.onClick() does not play nice)The only issue I've found is if the user has entered enough tokens to trigger horizontal scrolling (using singleLine), then they aren't able to click the last token's button.The Button is created but pushed off the widget, and there's no space added to scroll over more to see it.I can see the left edge of it if I enable the debug layout boundaries view, but still can't scroll to it.but nothing seems to work.Not sure if this bug is with the library or the android widget you extended.If you have any suggestions on implementing a clean version of this I'd be all ears as well.
Currently if you build an iOS target that has resources (storyboards or asset catalogs in my testing) bazel will end up caching a file for the null shaWith remote caches this results in failed builds if you accept this file in your cache.I see a few other references to `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855` in other bazel issues, but none specifically talking about whether or not it is a problem.I can't find the exact rule that causes this with `aquery`, but I'd love to know if this is considered an issue, or if we should work around this in our remote cache.I migrated this issue from here https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/issues/228

For example, the device advertises these two components supporting avc, one without and one with tunneling support:  omx.oem.avc.decoder and omx.oem.avc.decoder.tunneled  ExoPlayer isn't able to select the tunneled version of the decoder but can only detect the non-tunneled version.When more than one decoder supporting the given mime-type is returned in the media codec list, ExoPlayer needs to iterate through the list and pick the one with the tunneling feature enabled.I guess another problem with the existing implementation is that there doesn't seem to be a way to tell ExoPlayer that the app prefers a tunneling decoder if the platform supports it.
As GCVote does not support EC-caches we should not request ratings for EC-caches.
I'll share my findings later in a more appropriate place but yah, had to be said ;)At first I suspected something wrong in JEI, but when I checked out their issue overview I noticed a closed issue dealing with the same thing where they pointed at a plugin going wrong.I didn't go as far as to check the situation with only the RebornCore, but my assumption was that the library is pretty passive and therefore this test wouldn't do much.

Better failure model when PVC fails during workspace creationWhen starting a new workspace, if the PVC fails on the underlying infrastructure (OpenShift), for whatever reason, there is no immediate feedback to the user.The workspace loader spins, the mount is retried and re-fails, until the operation times out (60s), and returns a generic error message ("Workspace failed to start".There are "Failed to mountPV" errors reports in the OpenShift pod events for the workspace, but this information does not seem to propagate back up to Che.I believe that we should be able to detect that a PVC failed when creating the workspace, and then inform the user that there was a problem allocating storage for the workspace.

Hello,  I run a Minecraft Server for a few friends and recently we have been experiencing crashes every few hours.Next time the server crashed, I had [this output](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ictrobot/611e30a8d92cf1003a55/raw/gistfile1.txt), which suggests Buildcraft's MapManager thread is causing the issue.This suggests that the MapManager thread is causing modification to the EntityTracker while updateTrackedEntities() is running in the main thread, therefore causing the ConcurrentModificationException.The actual crash report is [available here](https://gist.github.com/ictrobot/f3b0b71aeba451fd0347), however note it says forge build 1500 because that is the custom value I set it to.

If I create a URL containing ASCII codes besides letters, digits and hyphens in the authority/host I get a failure.e.g.    Previous behavior was to encode the host: e.g. "host\u0001" -> "host%01"  Ideally from a "least likely to break apps" PoV we would keep the old behavior.The new behavior seems likely to have an impact because it involves throwing a runtime exception.I could see us throwing an UnknownHostException insteadbut I'd need to check the implications.(For automatic following of redirects I can see us refusing to follow the redirect if the Location is found to be incorrect).https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-parsing suggests the OkHttp implementation is correct, but https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-syntax suggests codes like 0x01 are not valid.The whatwg spec also suggests that an encoded value (like %01) would break the host-parsing rules, but probably not the host-syntax.

Hi there OnlyNoobDied, Sorry to bother you, but I am having an issue with the morphing part of the plugin.The problem is that when I try to click on a morph in the GUI, it gives me the item, E.g. a bone for skeleton morph, and I can stick it in my inventory.I don't even have a morph, because upon clicking the remove morphs block, it says that I don't currently have a morph.I found a bug with the TNT fountain, as the TNT does not fountain and it causes damage.so my hub has tons of useless pets that show when owner joins but don't follow.

Empty Sack of Holding glitchTHOUGH, we are seeing and hearing about this from servers running the pack using Sponge.
In step mode, the player buttons as well as the call stack button aren't properly handled:  - The call stack button stays disabled though it should turn active after a step is done.- Once the call stack button is active (after having started with the play button and then paused via pause button or breakpoint) is not set disabled during subsequent step execution (obvious with noticeable delay).- Step and Play buttons remain active during step execution (this is verifiable with extreme delay).Pause button remains inactive (well, this is redundant because the execution will be paused after the step, anayway).And though it might be nice to enable it during step execution in order to avoid user panic on huge delay, this is not recommended due to the toggling effect of the pause button - pressing it during step execution would induce the opposite effect: the step mode would turn into a run mode.

When you crawl using "all representatives"
If I create new bout, anybody who was added to this bout is able to remove me from this bout.
Specifically, when I input a character with fewer than ten strokes, the stroke number is counted correctly on the KanjiPad itself (bottom half of the screen), but the list of candidate characters on the top half of the screen begins one short of the correct count.The user is then forced to scroll down (sometimes for quite a while) before finding the candidates with the correct number of strokes. !When a character with 10+ strokes is inputted, the candidate list begins in the correct position. !
One upon a time, there used to be a `/jobs boost all [rate]` command.But "all" no longer works.It just says `The job you selected do not exist!

NullPointerException in Component.newComponentConfiguration when multiple component instances are bound to the same service and have the same target propertyBut when TargetService configuration becomes available, a NullPointerException occurs.I think the problem is in how Reference.update method works.The second call to this method (with ccid = "Component._1") has no effect:  listener.checkTargetChanged return false, because target hasn't changed since the previous call ((number=1)), and useNoId is false, so neither branch there is taken and ccid "Component._1" is lost.

TechReborn crashing with IC2   Using those versions: TechReborn-1.12.2-12.5.501-universalSo i was updating a few mods for the pack i am currently working on and got a crash with an ic2 recipe.
As a preface, I've heard of Not Enough ID's mod, but I was told by other mod devs to use it with caution or to avoid it entirely as it can compromise a pack.Anyways, I just updated your mod to the latest version and ended getting several crashes upon start with my modpack and saw that the mod was now using a whopping 357 block ID's via Caliper.If you don't want to undo your work, that's understandable, I can find workarounds, but figured I'd ask first.On a separate note, this update kinda caught me off guard and scrambled a testing world and a server world after hitting the Block ID limit, and having to delete/remove/shuffle mods around trying to figure out what happened, causing Block ID's shuffles as well, normally a buffer of 160 ID's is more than enough.
reload does not keep the seed valueWhen you fix a seed value in experiment, and also have a parameter value: First load of model is not a problem.But when you change the parameter value and hit reload, the seed value gets changed.I would prefer the seed value to remain unchanged, because some agents are initialised based on seed value for replication.

When I enable the Bluetooth sensor on the setting, the app shows the information about my phone Bluetooth status, discoverable devices, and paired devices, if the bluetooth is on.When I turn off the Bluetooth of the device, but the Bluetooth sensor of the sensorium is still enabled, the app keeps performing Bluetooth discovery (I can see the "restart bluetooth scanning" on the logCat every 10 seconds, which is the scan interval for Bluetooth sensor).I believe that the application should stop scanning for Bluetooth connections when the user turns of the Bluetooth on the device.My suggestion to fix the problem:, you stop scanning for Bluetooth connections only when the bluetooth sensor is disabled: `protected void _disable() { 		... 		handler.removeCallbacks(scanTask); 		... }in the "OnReceive" method of this broadcast receiver, check if the Bluetooth is off or turning off.

ItemStack tooltip instantiation causes crash with BlockData serialisation with 10+ mods installed   Forge:Random Patches*, plus the top 10 or so mods on Twitch, causes the above crash, implying [that your serializer is getting null at some point on this line](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/master/src/main/java/com/direwolf20/buildinggadgets/common/building/BlockData.java#L154).Regardless of either of the versions of Techemistry or Random Patches, however, it might be wise to program defensively in this case and check for multiple nulls, potentially serializing nothing, especially as this only seems to occur when a specific combination of mods trigger (or trigger classloading) first, and only during the searchtree creation on the client, which I believe is specifically limited to the creative tab.Thus, it would presumably not affect actual exchanging gadgets.

When in this state, it can't even scan for devices, not using the RxBleClient.After encountering this problem I created a test page in the app which would utilize the old-fashioned way of manually handling Android BLE (based on code from the official samples https://developer.android.com/samples/index.html which I used before finding RxAndroidBle).Now this problem happened again and I was surprised to find this old method was still able to scan/connect to devices, when the RxBleClienct could not.Restarting the app does solve the problem however.Strangely enough, I don't get the impression that the RxBleClient is even trying to to perform bluetooth operations when in this state, as the log shows no messages from the native Android Ble stack at all.The amount of days varies, most recently it was about 2.5, but it has occurred in shorter time, or not at all with the app running for a week.

Blocks are being replaced after broken (not server lag)After breaking blocks (any) they are being replaced repeatedly.If you switch to another block to break the issue is goneWe do not know how to reproduce.I think I have found the issue!If you are mining a block then quickly switch to mining another block the bug will happen 50% of the time.I then found out that if you set "direction:     active:false" then it seems to have fixed the issue.If you then set this variable toit fixes the issue immediately.
Looks like the image file gets locked and git cannot manage it properly.In another scenario merging from a branch that contains another version of the same `.gif` file causes merge conflicts.` in rendered view would be better than having a locked file...Not a critical issue and it happens to deal with big `.gif` too often, but figuring the issue out took a plenty of time.There is a workaround: just close an `.md` file that refers to a `.gif` before any git operation, but should one neglect the rule extra efforts will be required to put things back in order.

With this strategy, other beans may already have their RestTemplate dependency injected when the instrumentation occurs -Although I was "against" in [gh822](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth/issues/822), I recon using a `BeanPostProcessor` in this case is probably a better solution: RestTemplates would be fully instrumented at the time they are injected into @Autowired fields...

A network partition can cause in flight documents to be lostThis ticket is meant to capture an issue which was discovered as part of the work done in #7493 , which contains a [failing reproduction test](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/blob/596a4a073584c4262d574828c9caea35b5ed1de5/src/test/java/org/elasticsearch/discovery/DiscoveryWithServiceDisruptions.java#L375) with @awaitFix.If a network partition separates a node from the master, there is some window of time before the node detects it.This window is extremely small if a socket is broken.More adversarial partitions, for example, silently dropping requests without breaking the socket can take longer (up to 3x30s using current defaults).If the node hosts a _primary_ shard at the moment of partition, and ends up being isolated from the cluster (which could have resulted in Split Brain before), some documents that are being indexed into the primary _may_ be lost if they fail to reach one of the allocated replicas  (due to the partition) and that replica is later promoted to primary by the master.

Unfortunately, we haven't been able to reproduce the crashTherefore, this bug report certainly lacks some information, but maybe you might have an idea (or somebody might have encountered a similar problem) anyway.### Reproduction steps From the logs, we know that the crash occurs after stopping a stream (using `SimpleExoPlayer.stop()`).It seems to happen only for DRM protected streams and it does not happen every time a stream is stopped.However, the crash occurs not only when swiping left/right, but also when the user is stopping the stream in another way (e.g. by sending the app to the background).### Version of ExoPlayer being used 2.8.1 - we will update to 2.8.2 soon, but from the release notes, I don't think that this will fix our problem.This is the stack trace of the Crashlytics Crashes: `Fatal Exception: java.lang.

My issue lies within the certain cases that cause jmxtrans to stop writing to Graphite.For example:   1) issues connecting to graphite server   2) deleting a config file (even if I specify a different config file in the "start" command)In these cases, the log file shows that an exception was thrown.However, jmxtrans itself is still running, and I have to manually stop/restart it in order for data to start writing to Graphite again.A simple shell script could solve the issue of failing to connect to graphite, but I'm not sure if there is an established approach to take when running into the issue of an exception being thrown.
"if (b) {int x = some(expression(with(possible(side(effects))))); }   Sometimes, as an intermediate, we get kinds of weird stuff such as `if (b) {int i;}`or or just plain unconditional block `{int f =E;}`, or a block within an iterative `while(b){int i= E;}`, and it may even occur in plain and enhanced `for` loops.When can we kill the **blockThings get even more hairy when you talk about plain `for` loops, and even enhanced `for` loops ain't completely trivial.while` loops also need to be addressed somehow.the decision should be pretty clear, if you want to preserve semantics.

App freezes when I enter "live map" and leave it again   ##### Detailed steps causing the problem: - Debug app in Android Studio - Press "live map", the maps tiles builds up - Go backwards   ##### Actual behavior after performing these steps: No button presses will result in anything   ##### Expected behavior after performing these steps: Buttons should work as normal   ##### Version of c:geo used:
Whenever a player runs baltop (guessing bal as well, but haven't tried it) for a currency that doesn't exist, the server will kick everyone out and not let anyone in (timeouts).### Console errors    ### Steps to reproduce Not sure which is the cause, but this is how it's set up on my server:(though call it a pokebond when talking about it outside of commands).Running baltop [currency] for a currency that exists runs properly, running baltop <currency> for a currency that does not exist also runs (though returns the default currency)...Running baltop  <currency> for a currency that does not exist kicks everyone from the server and does not let anyone rejoin.

For example, if you control a 1/1 Imp and Flamestrike a board of 7 Boom Bots, several of the Boom Bots will probably hit the 1/1 Imp.We can probably fix this by also changing the Boom Bot spell to 'MissilesSpell' as we did with Knife Juggler - however, somehow this feels like a work-around to me instead of a proper fix.We are just exploiting that MissilesSpell does not target dead minions.

### The issue  `KafkaProperties` aren't loaded at the time spring tries to initialize the `KafkaSender` causing the application to fail to start.Recently a user from spring-cloud-sleuth and [grpc-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/yidongnan/grpc-spring-boot-starter/) reported an [issue](https://github.com/yidongnan/grpc-spring-boot-starter/issues/167) to us, that if he uses your library in combination with ours, he cannot use the kafka binder anymore.this issue is hard to find, but easy to fix (Simply add `@EnableConfigurationProperties(KafkaProperties.class)` to their `@Configuration` classes).Without our library it seems to work fine, so I assume that I'm doing something wrong here, but I cannot image what, because I don't use/reference kafka at all.That should fix the ordering issues, but I haven't tested that yet.

but it appears this applies to most (if not all) versions.We've been dealing with an issue with config server returning environment data that does not reflect what is actually in git.We finally figured out that one of our chef jobs was deleting files and folders on the servers with the same name as each microservice as part of a cleanup each time chef runs.Many files within the local git repo used by config server were getting deleted, which causes the repo to become 'dirty'.If there is a good use case for this that I am simply not aware of or not thinking of, feel free to close this issue.

I have encountered this issue several times and it took a long time to finally find where the code was going wrong.The issue arises when the effect exit integer sections is used inside of a nested loop.When the loop comes around to get executed again it will start from where it was exited rather than from the beginning and will completely ignore its new parameters (if they have changed).If the first player it looped simply had an inventory full of stone it would continue looping that first players inventory and find stone each time and message that stone was found in every players inventory.The only way around this glitch is to allow the loop to complete which requires setting up a way to ignore all iterations after you want to exit or find away to escape sections without using the exit effect.

When Riot client isn't connected but is running, user isn't notified   Due to another bugI need to investigate, my Riot client is running on my Android phone, but fail to establish a connection when I'm on my home wifi.That's especially visible with the perpetual loading bar at the top of the interface, or by failing messages on the login view if I disconnect myself of the application.The problem is that when that happen, nothing tells to the user he's actually disconnected: no notification, and the bar in the notification tray is still displaying "Listening for events", which lead to the wong belief that application is still running perfectly normally.By the way, when speaking about that bar in the notification tray, I would suggest to change the wording.While "Listening for events" can be understand by someone with network and programming notions, this is probably very hard to understand what does that mean for "normal users".

Gradle plugin does not support parallel buildsAs gradle does not support provided scope in its DSL, the internal distribution jars may be being brought in.By using `String[]` arrays instead of `List<String>` it does not opt into Groovy's collection features.This is resolved with the _bad_ practice of using `flywayMigrate.dependsOn.remove(testClasses)` to break the circular tasks.My concern is that internally it may evolve to make assumptions that others will have to break, which will cause it to not function properly.

Smeltery output exceeds input when daisy-chaining casting tables and basins   !When daisy-chaining casting tables, a player obtains more material than input into the smelter originally.What appears to be happening is when the ingot is pulled out of the casting table by the hopper, it updates the drain, which is powered by the redstone block.Since the ingot has already been pulled from the table, but the casting begins before the value has been updated, it duplicates the ingot.When using an ingot cast in one table, and a nugget cast below, a player will receive an extra nugget.I believe the issue should be able to be fixed without affecting the way the drains update, which has been useful for automating the smelter using vanilla mechanics.

Push replication skipped 20 documents   Scenario:When the user logs out from Device A, it stops the replications and deletes the database.While the user is logged out from Device A, 20 documents are added on each device (no active replications at this point).When the user logs back in Device A, all devices should have the same document count but it can sometimes happen that a device will be 20 documents behind in the total count.The replications are active again but this device will never receive the 20 documents that were skipped because the replicator has moved to tracking the last sequence number.

Recently I've really been trying to get it sorted though as it is having an impact on my new players.I was originally using Sqlite for my data storage, and noticed every time someone tried to make a town it would spam the console with database locks issues.The town would be created but under the name SERVER ADMINS, and the resident wouldn't own the town.However, I logged the TPS for a while and it stayed at a flat 20, until someone did a town command where the DB would lock and the TPS would fall to around 12 for a few minutes, then return to normal.After more discussion on IRC, I was told that switching to MySQL would solve the issue.I attempted to convert my database but couldn't get it working (Not very good with DB stuff), so ended up just creating an entirely new MySQL and recreating towns.This didn't fix my issue at all - newbies who try and make town still often get the same issue.Been trying to ask on IRC for a few days but haven't got a reply.I deleted most of the SERVER ADMINS towns just left that as an example.)

https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct/issues/3297 but using a far simpler setup.Restone allows me to partially automate this part, but only so far as me pushing a button each time to begin casting.At this point, the game crashes repeatedly until I delete the Tank.Crash also occurs using the same mechanics, if I run out of Blood to fully cast the Blood butthe tables have some remaining on them.As soon as I attempt to refill the Tank that feeds the tables, the game crashes.the Windows/Tanks/Gauges cannot handle being filled and drained simultaneously, though I'm sure I've seen and used the mechanic before.I think another mod as well but don't recall.Game now crashes consistently even trying to fill the tank, as the faucets (which I have replaced, along with the tables and Tank) immediately attempt to cast into the tables below.

Wrapping in the discourse visualizer fails when line ends in non-maximally underscored elementCurrently however, it almost always looks bad:Whenever a line ends in a non-highlighted element, the next line begins at the width of the the last highlighted element in the line above.This doesn't happen if the line ended with an element with the maximum amount of underscores (often one) that the line had.However this behavior is not extenisble to an arbitrary number of underlines, and looks bad if the height is bigger, since lines are spaced far and the underlined tokens 'jiggle', since their height inside the table is boosted by the underlines.

I love the mod, it is an integral part of my gameplay, however there seems to be an issue with EnderIO power conduits.The turret bases do not accept power from EIO conduits.(IE, Mekanism etc) work fine and it even works when I put a "buffer" cable from another mod between the EIO conduit and OMT turret base.I also noticed that when placing/breaking a powered conduit next to the base, the base's RF meter would increase by 12000 RF each time.

I have tested the same things on other servers... and theres no problems.But no this is no client side problem i assure you.This is a short description of what i have encounterd: When ever i teleport using /home /warp /spawn or /tpa I will have a delay for anything between 10-60 seconds  after the teleport... where i cannot open chests, the chat does not update, i cannot run commandsAnd when i test this against other servers there is nothing that indicates the same problem at all.And its very strange how it only affects me and my brother and noone else.But everytime i do another teleport, i get the same 10-60 delay.Now i've had the admin help me try locate the problem..how and why it only affects me and my brotherBut we both are using pretty hardcore systems that runs just about any game on max settings.Yet this problem persists.Or if someone have a topic they know of which is related i'd be happy to visit that one.
although the last one obviously depends on my potatophone as well ...

History entries blocking view on comment text field   ## Vespucci Version Vespucci 10.1.0  ## Download source Google Play StoreWhen clicking on the comment text field a list with the recently submitted comments and the keyboard are shown on the screen.I can not make a screenshot because then the history is not shown any longer (i guess because the focus is lost when the power menu is shown).The history is even shown when i type/delete something.But as soon as i start typing again or clicking into the comment text field it opens again and blocks the view on the comment text field.What i can observe sometimes: When the keyboard comes up from the bottom the upload dialog is moved up a bit.But the history list seems to be not moved up accordingly.When the comment text field is selected i can always see it, at least when typing.so the history is long enough to block the view.no, it does not crash  ##I observe this issue since some (not many) versions.

FR: Retry failed camera uploadsA user review on GooglePlayStore requested a feature:  "Image upload still does not work reliably, not in 2.6 and is actually my most important feature.Now I've had the problem for a long time that the photo upload to the InstantUpload directory always fails, especially because then simply ceases to upload the images, which is very unreliable.As if the trigger is lost in the systemIt would be OK if a second attempt would be made later to upload the picture again, but here this breaks completely away, so
However, after hitting refresh, it then causes a ton of wakelocks, and quickly drains the battery.If I do that, I have to force close the app, and the issue resolves.Interestingly, if you restart the app but don't try to refresh anything, the instant upload feature works fine and doesn't cause this issue.
For e.g. if requests R1 and R2 are running concurrently in two threads and share the same `HTTPClient`, R2 gets the response of R1 and R1When we inspected the logs from the server, it showed that the server sent both the responses correctly.If you are interested I can send a pull request from my fork (https://github.com/rkaippully/http-kit) as soon as I complete testing.That issue seem to be affecting the server, this issue is for the client.

Reason being, HttpContext.receiveResponse considers all 3XX series response codes as redirects, whereas the underlying HttpClientImpl default handler only handles redirects for 301, 302, 303 and 307.Suggest that either 308 is handled properly, or an error is thrown rather than hanging.
Mapping UI shows "undefined" when you change the source document   1.Go to the dashboard and clear the staging database, which deletes the JSON document loaded in step 1. 4.The problem is, because we're defining the property mapping using just a property name reference, and then trying to look for the property details via the loaded source document, the system errors when it can't find that property (defined from the first document) in the (new) second document.

IndexOutOfBoundsException after update from 6.2 to 6.4   Hi,  I asked the following question at your discussion forum and it turned out that this might be an issue, so I was advised to open an issue here.Recently I updated the Elasticsearch version from 6.2 to 6.4 and when this query is executed using the official PHP package, I am getting an error message in my log file which it looks like this:  [full_stack_trace.txt](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/files/2487606/full_stack_trace.txt)I have 4 queries in my multi search query, from which only 2 of them are failingThe error is logged every time when the "option group" / "option" top hits aggregation need to be done.It is important to mention that this is not the case when I try to execute this query via Kibana.When executed through Kibana I receive correct results.If I remove them, I receive correct results.I had 1 node and 2 shards on my local machine when the problem actually appeared.When I increased the number of shards to 3 or 5, the problem disappeared.I have a workaround for this problem with increasing the number of shards.But it's strange to allocate 5 shards because of two indexes with 28 and 112 documents stored in them in order to make those aggregations working.

When using an embedded Jetty server, configured for HTTP/2This has the consequence, as I understand it and observe from testing, that when negotiating with a client that does not support ALPN, it will default to using the HTTP/2 protocol.In my experience, clients that do not support ALPN are unlikely to support HTTP/2, at least the clients that I have tested with.

Segment merges should try to avoid exhausting all free disk space   When a Lucene segment merge runs, it needs sizable free temporary disk space to do its work.If it runs out of disk spacepart way through, the OS rejects the `write` call, and we'll hit a "tragic" exception that will fail that shard.This behavior is particularly evil because on filling up the disk, the merge will then go and remove all temp files, thus freeing up (sizable) disk space and provoking issues like #15420 where "at first it failed and now it succeeded" leads to corruption.I think we need some simple "reservation" API where the merge can claim how much space it expects to use, and fail at that point if there isn't enough space.This wrapper should then throw the "disk full"Lucene's default `TieredMergePolicy` already estimates the size of the merged segment to enforce its `maxMergedSegmentMB`...

The utility does indeed allow me to connect to the T-Mobile 4G network here in San Diego and when I am at a remote location with 4-5 bars of services I am getting an average speedtest results of 40mb down and 20mb upload which is great.I have noticed a critical connection issue however when I am located in my bedroom at home which gets horrible service (generally see 0-1 bars displayed on my phones display).Basically what I have noticed is that after switching over to the hybrid firmware and enabling LTE support my phone does not seem to properly auto-select the best wireless connection to be used for regular internet access.However, after enabling LTE I have noticed a real issue in the device seemingly not recognizing that a strong wireless connection exists and should be used (especially when the LTE signal is consistently between 0-1 bars).I constantly notice this when I am browsing the web from my device and notice that a link I clicked is taking forever to load or times out... reloading the page a few times eventually brings it back online but(btw - whenever this happens if I manually turn on airplane mode and enable wifiBasically I just want to tell the radio to quit using LTE for internet requests when its Connected to a specific WIFI signal and then switch back to T-Mobile when it loosing that WIFI connection.

There is no `errorText` property to set in the XML, so only having `errorEnabled=true` defined has no means at all if we can only set the error from code with `setError(..)(which automatically enable the error if needed).We should think about if this makes sense at all, starting with a TextInputLayout already showing a red error probably is not very useful.If we don't want to give the above-mentioned possibility, we should deprecate `errorEnabled` styleable property and make it no-op (as it is now in practice, because it only adds the error view to the captionArea without using it).Moreover in the current state I'm encountering a bug with this XML:Calling it again shows the error text too.This breaks the code in `removeIndicator(helperTextView, HELPER_INDEX);` which removes the helperText and leave the TextInput believing there is an error currently showing, but that's not the case.(..)` from TextInputLayout constructor solved the problem.:) If you can take a decision I can proceed with a PR.

Hi there, first of all I would have loved to use the issue tracker and automatic ReportBUT there seams to be an error in the link directing to the automated issue report.When more than one document is attatched I am not able to Switch between documents to retriev annotations.(Dropdown Menue does not work)When more than one document ist attatched I cannot directly delete access files no longer needed via right mouse click delete local entry.In fact the only way I can do that is by deleting the file in the BibTex Key, then saving, then swopping between two entries, then going back to the original one and the access file is gone.Also when using Jabref not in full window the Annotation window for highligts does not allow Scrolling passt a specific window size.and it is a real pain at the current state because I often cannot read the full texts or the scroll bar gets completely locked despite the length of the text in the box.When there is trouble with the annotation area at the same time I am also not able to use the Status bar.However am able to use the varios Buttons and the program is otherwise functional.If there are highlights in the PDF document in the vewer instead of highlighting the text it is completely covered.Cannot parse key binding SHIFT 	at javafx.scene.input.Cannot parse key binding SHIFT 	at javafx.scene.input.

[Ringer Mode (checked) → 'Do not Disturb' → Priority] works as expected, which is easy to verify because the Android system notification for "Do not disturb is turned on" appears, and the DND button in the phone's quick-panel is illuminated.However, when the Profile to switch OFF DND [Ringer Mode (checked) → Normal] kicks in, nothing happens.The "Do not disturb is turned on" notification is still present, and the DND button in the phone's quick-panel is still illuminated.Ringer mode does not change.I expect that a Profile to set 'Ringer mode' to 'Normal' would turn off Do Not Disturb when triggered, thus leaving the phone in normal "Ring" mode.This seems similar to Issue #154, so I tried to follow the fix described by @bughunter2, but I can't find any such "silent mode switcher" permission: *Easer's 'Outline' screen is not showing the warning about some skills not having the required permissions *

Race condition when using pipelining in cluster modeWhen using Lettuce in cluster mode with pipelining (`connection.setAutoFlushCommands(false)`), there seems to be a race condition between adding commands to write buffer, and flushing commands to output.The race condition can be triggered when lettuce client is not yet connected to the node, where the command should be routed.If `connection.flushCommands()` is invoked before the command is added to the buffer, then it will not be send, thus the client future will never complete (unless we invoke `connection.flushCommands()` again)., looks like `MasterSlaveChannelWriter` will have the same issue, though I have not validated this.

If you use `/etc/login.defs` to set a custom home basedir (instead of `/home`), the system breaks when it tries to sync.and when the `useradd` call gets invoked, the home directory is correctly created as `/something/blah/${username}`.But then a later `chown` gets invoked, and that seems to be hard-coded to `/home/${username}`.I don't know if that's a configurable option you want to enable or not.But, regardless of that - the bit where it does the `chown` probably ought to read the users "real" home directory, rather than assuming it can do the hardcoding.

a `NullPointerException` is being thrown during three of the Quarkus extensions integration tests.This helped me determine the services names that are causing the exceptions: `org.wildfly.security.password.impl.I'm still not sure of what's causing this, but there's at least one thing that justifies creating this issue: it would be great if you could display the service name that is causing the NPE throw.If it looks like a bug, I'll try to provide a reproducer.

More importantly, the last button (which resets the pad) does not appear at all when I hold my phone vertically.I have the same problem (though I see more of the buttons) with a small tablet I have.That would also help me draw the kanjis since it's easier to have aedict recognize the kanjis if I can draw it better on a bigger pad.

But, the failure is now occurring during "git clone" step in the form of "Host key verification failed".When it fails, PULL_REQUEST_TO_SSH_CLONE_URL has following value: ssh://git@xxxxxxx:7999/xxxx/And, when it passes, it has ssh://git@xxxxxxx-stash.global.xxxxxx.net:7999/One observation is, every time it fails, it failed from the automatic trigger criteria (OPEN).After seeing the failure, if I go and trigger the build from the BUTTON_TRIGGER, it passes.Did not try to do RE-OPEN after the failure.
Created challenge tasks start with already registered systems   ## Problem  When a user wants to register a system for a challenge, all systems that fit are marked with a checkmark.However, when the user accepts this, the GUI does not store the changes.We first wanted to check all systems that fit to the task but later on we decided to ask the backend for the current registrations.
Right now the method is too simple and does not cover all the cases.

Cannot run chunk by pressing green triangle after an error occurred   <!RStudio v1.2 is currently available as a preview release, from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/. If you are reporting a bug with RStudio v1.1, it would be greatly appreciated if you could check if the issue also reproduces in the preview release before reporting an issue.If you're having trouble with R itself or an R package, see https://www.r-project.org/help.html, and if you want to ask a question rather than report a bug, go to https://community.rstudio.com/.Finally, if you use RStudio Server Pro, get in touch with our Pro support team at support@rstudio.com.3.5.2  ### Steps to reproduce the problem  Have a rather long Rmd file, choose "inline output", and are left with chunk execution hanging if an error occurs in the chunk.Only way to run a chunk again is to restart R at that point.### Describe the problem in detail  With an error condition the chunk execution appears to be left hanging.But this only works once.After that the only way to run chunks again is to restart R. "Run current chunk" or "Run all" produce nothing.But if I change the chunk output from "inline" to "output in console"The problem does not appear to be particular to a specific Rmd file.But it seems to occur only if you have larger files with many chunks.### Describe the behavior you expected  I would expect an error message, but should still be able to re-run the chunk after that.Thank you for taking the time to file an issue!

Cannot iterate on Headers in Java 11 + JPMSa `Headers` instance does not work when using plain Java 11 and JPMS.This works fine in Java 8 (as the Kotlin stdlib ends up in the classpath), but does not work when using Java 11 and proper JPMS modules, because the application class that iterates over the `Headers` would need to JPMS-_read_ `kotlin.Unfortunately the Kotlin stdlib does not support JPMS (no `Automatic-Module-Name` in the manifest, no `module-info.class` in the jar), so that leaves the application relying on automatic modules with unstable module names.FTR, I encountered this problem in [CometD 6](https://github.com/cometd/cometd/tree/6.0.x) which is based on Java 11 and JPMS.

NullPointerException when attempting to debug with JUnit5 on Windows 10 with IntelliJ   Version: JMockit 1.28, JUnit5 5.20, IntelliJ 2018.2, tested JDK 1.8.0.181, 10.0.2, and 11.When attempting to debug a unit test of a Maven project in IntelliJ on Windows, I get a NullPointerException in _createSyntheticFieldsInJREClassToHoldClassLoadingBridges_.`  Upon further investigation, this is happening as IntelliJ does not pass any runtime information, which causes JMockit to execute the agent, which updates the variable _instrumentation_, and then continues execution with it upon the return of the agent.Thus, when the _instrumentation_ variable is updated, it is _not_ updated in the original context, which is under a separate class altogether (although with the exact same prototype/name, but a different ID in the VM and a different memory space).This does not happen:  1.

Secondary weapon fires when secondary fire key is pressed, or worst case only when an enemy is in range and in the firing arc of the weapon (e.g. when a blaster in the primary slot would normally auto-aim).Auto-firing the secondary weapon when there's a secondary trigger key in the controls should also only be enabledActual: Depression and holding of any key (forward, left, right, etc.) causes the secondary weapon to fire continuously, as if the fire button were held down.Observation: Weapons also seem to auto-equip in these ships when navigated to in the inventory screen, as if the fire button were held down.May be a separate issue, but seems to occur in the same circumstancesOnly the blaster can be equipped as the secondary weapon; any other weapon will run out of ammunition in short order, and equipping a secondary weapon only when it should be fired is cumbersome and error prone.

Connection lost with Pebble Classic over night and reconnection failedFirst time was when I was driving with my car (but just got to now it after 2 hours)and I remember I needed a reboot afterwards to get it working (initialized) again (but failed to save log).But this time just tapping one ore two times on Pebble Classic in Gadgetbridge were enough to get connection working again, so there was a little change in between but not complete solving it.But seems that Gadgetbridge is at least now manually able to reconnect after such a "fail" and no reboot needed anymore.

If the module folders are not resolved as maven projects (which is done when open pom.xml), LS initialized with rootPath as "/project/milti-project".But after resolving twice for "/projects/multi-project/module_a" and "/projects/multi-project/module_b".For LS in my case it's ambiguous to be initialized with module root folder when multi-module project root is expected.Thus, because of the lack of information for LS about when modules will be resolved, I have to define such kind of Che's behavior as non-deterministic.

If you configure the `.watches` index to have a certain primary replica configuration, the distributed execution of the watches only happens on one shard copy.The explanation for this requires to understand how watcher decides if a watch should be executed on a replica or on the primary shard.If we now have the same number of copies plus the primary shard than the number of primary shards, we use the same hashing function to find out where a watch should be executed.We cannot tell which shard (primary or replica) will be used for execution (as we use the allocation ids to find out the order), but it is only going to be one in this particular case.In order to remain BWC we could check if all nodes in the clsuter have surpassed a certain version and only then use the new logic.

If a train going at high speed is caught by a locking track it should explode unless slowed down first.This was not an issue before because locking tracks did not go on high-speed tracks, and high-speed trains would explode when going onto locking tracks because they were always a regular track.When a high-speed train goes over a powered high-speed locking track nothing should happen.I'm not sure if this can be classified as a bug or not.

Long non-nullable HISTORY and COMMENT cards break headers   Non-nullable HISTORY and COMMENT cards (really any 'comment-like' cards) whose footprint exceeds the 80-character line limit, are added to the header as is, producing longer than 80-character lines, and thus breaching the header format requirement.The expected behavior is: - Long comment-style cards (e.g. HISTORY, COMMENT) should either throw an appropriate Exception upon creation (for non-nullable cards), or else get truncated at the 80-character limit (for nullable cards), when the long keyword convention is not enabled/used.- When the long keyword convention is enabled, long non-nullable comment-style entries (e.g. HISTORY, COMMENT) should be wrapped using CONTINUE keys, just like regular keywords.

#### Steps to reproduce the problem:  <!Fluid is not transferred into tank until 1000mb has built up in the lightwell (if unlucky, may require a 2nd gem)Fluid begins to flow nearly as fast as it is generated  Note that if you reverse the setup, putting the Fluid Interface on the tank and a fluid importer on the bottom of the lightwell, the fluid will be imported immediately.It might be a mod interaction issue, though, because replacing the Lightwell with a TiC smeltery drain as the "source" makes the network behave identically to the importer.If "Exact Amount" is specified as "false" (as it is by default), the exporter shouldn't wait for the source to build up to that amount.paste contents here directly, but use something like http://pastebin.com/-->

[1.12.2] Cannot Remove Transmutation Recipes
Exoplayer has higher latency when starting Multicast/UDP videos compared to MediaPlayerwhen you change the video streams on exoplayer, because  it keeps static frames for both previous video and new video, so first it freeze the last video frame, keeps it for 1-2 seconds, then shows the first frame of the new video and keeps it for another 1-2 second until it finally starts the video.for the same setup ( same box, same streams, same network, same apk) just changing to Mediaplayer it has a shorter time, because it only keeps the last frame of previous video and starts immediately with the next video, sot it does not show the first frame and then load/buffer, it starts immediately, most probably the android mediaplayer does the buffering during the first stage when it keeps the last frame from previous video.When using exoplayer channel changes happen with two freezed frames (last and first video frames) which is not very good experience.You can only observe this with Multicast Videos, when doing HLS the start times are so fast that you can see that.but you can still see the first frame as static,it would be better to do this loading in the first step while it keeps the last frame video and then start immediately with the second/next video.

This may seem unrelated to BungeeCord but since this only happens on our servers when the client is connected via BungeeCord, I'll post this anyway:When fighting another Pokémon the fight freezes during "wating..." phase.This problem is already known to the Pixelmon community for some time which provides one with many possible solutions but none of these fixed the problem for our server.I then tried out different things ending up resolving the problem with: Not using BungeeCord.Since, as you all know, BungeeCord is somehow a must-have for Minecraft servers we can not use this work-around.Sadly I can not provide any further information about the problem since there're no errors or warnings displayed by bungee/the server or the client.

This game would freeze whenever selecting something like "continue" or "new game".I figured out how to run the game on the other emulator a while back and was halfway through the game when I ran into a issue with the other emulator that stalled my game progress.In comparison, PPSSPP runs the game with less graphical glitches in general, but it does have a specific problem that makes the game stall at a certain part of the game map, when a conversation is triggered.I've made my reports in PPSSPP's issues forum as well, but here I'm just going to focus on the issues present in JPCSP.If anyone is interested in the other thread, for reference they can check it out here:When using OpenGL and the shaders setting is enabled in the video options of JPCSP, the game would sometimes freeze after choosing any option like "new game" or "continue" in the main game menu.I say "sometimes" because 1 out of 10 times, it actually works and the game will NOT freeze when you choose to "continue" to load a save.However, more likely than not, the game will freeze instead when shaders are enabled.As far as I can tell, clearing the texture and vertex cache and restarting JPCSP will sometimes fix the issue.But I cannot consistently start the game when the shaders are enabled.As a comparison, I've tested things with the external software renderer and the game appears to reasonably consistently start without freezing.I've also tested with the shaders enabled but with the "color mask" video option disabled.The results remain fairly similar.It's always the same green glitch, with additional abnormal flashing during the animations when the external software renderer is enabled.  !I've done my best to try to capture all of the log during the process, but JPCSP lags horribly whenever the logger is turn on and the game cannot proceed, so I've had to resort to turning the logger on and off during the process.: Trigger something in the game first, turn the logger on, let it record for a while, turn it back off, let the game move on until I reach the next cruicial step, turn the logger back on again.I hope this has captured useful information, but I can't guarantee it.These screenshots show which settings I used when capturing the logs (with the main difference between the two logs being whether or not the shader setting was enabled) :  !
So I've been occasionally (rare) been getting a crash that appears to happen when the game tries to spawn an entity from Flans.I don't have the full log to show, but just before the crash occurs, there's a line that says "Skipping Entity with ID -118".but it didn't fix itand it fixed the issue.I have no idea what causes this all to happen, and it's probably some weird stuff due to the huge amount of mods I have, but I figured since removing Flans has been fixing it

FindBugs memory leak when same JVM is usedWe have noticed that the static analysis tool is consuming a lot of memory when executed on a multi module build (as the openHAB build :))https://github.com/openhab/static-code-analysis/issues/15) if we should disable the fork option (which spawns a separate Java process for each execution of the FindBugs plugin), but this doesn't seem to be the best option now.The memory seems to be consumed by 100 000 classes that are being loaded (the lower left window).I have customized the build and excluding the FindBugs maven plugin the problem disappears.I have experimented again with a fork set to true and the results are good (non-heap memory usage is stable around 200 MB and 20 000 classes are loaded), the separate process consumes around 300 MB before dying:  !, I think the best option will be to use a separate thread for FindBugs, but this change could directly affect the openHAB build.

[Windows] Packaged (native) app fails to launch when on a non-ISO-8859-1 path(thanks for using my name and not asking me at all, Microsoft), and when I run the app (the `.exe` version) from that path, it fails.If I move it to a path that only contains ISO-8859-1 characters (even non-ASCII ones such as `ü`, `ö` or `ç`)it works just fine, but anything other than that, it fails.The `.jar` version, however, works everywhere regardless of the characters in the path.You should be able to reproduce the issue by using `ığ` or `日本` as the containing folder name.This is probably an error on the packager's end, but I don't know how to debug nor how to fix this.I'd like to, though, so any help would be appreciated.

volume-remove should not fail the build if the volume is not found   ### Description  Docker:volume-remove mapped to maven lifecycle 'clean' fails the build if the volume cannot be found.Since the purpose of 'volume-remove' is to simply remove the given volume, if it's already gone, there's no reason to fail the build.Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any flag or setting that will stop the plugin from failing the build.1. Consider the standard `mvn clean install`, which will fail every time because 'volume-clean' fails when the volume isn't present.
