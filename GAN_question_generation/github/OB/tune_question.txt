Did you try the procedures described here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/761604/eclipse-not-working-in-16-04 ?   
cannot reproduce do you have any logs ?
Where can I get these Primed maps?  
Could you turn them into several issues though? (Or update the existing ones if relevant) Just for readability. 
What do you mean, "the latter two diagrams became unreadable"? Was there an error in the error log? The intention is for the user to be able to name the diagrams whatever they prefer. 
Which autofill service are you using? 
Does it appear all the time?  Thanks,  David 
Could this be reproduced with a single node? 
Maybe you can send me a bug-report from developer-settings of android after reproducing the issue? This could help me to find the reason for this issue. My email is soundmodul@gmx.at
Does this happen with a newly-placed vehicle?  Or are these existing vehicles?
Can you test if something like this works @barthanssens   
Can you explain this a bit more, please? Are you running out of memory when using large images? 
Maybe you just have a wonky su binary?
which of the provided modules)? Can you report the pom with the given dependencies? 
Could you try to pull in the latest and see what it does? Thanks! 
Can you provide code with error?   About different presentation - if file have only one class (and class name equal file name) - file presentation changed to class

What's the full, actual, error message shown in the GUI (same is in the logs, without any debugging on)? 
What should be done for this ? Some friends asked me about this, because they recognized the problem. Opening the picture in an external app for zooming wont help in this case, because the resolution is too bad.  Will you change the image-source to "fix" the gc-bug or just wait ? 
What do you think?
Do you know what the token response contained? I'll soften the error to an AuthorizationException regardless, but it would be useful to know what the JSON content of the response was that tripped up the library. Looking at the code, it's possible the response was missing a `token_type` field.
How long is your text?  I assume it tries to build up a location header which is not possible/sensible with a fulltext index anyway. 
Can anyone else confirm this for me?
Can you reproduce this issue on your machine and then when opening the new session with the new working dir, include the `client_init` RPC response (captured from the network tools wtihin Chrome)? This will let me see what initial state your session is being populated with.
Do you see unchanged metrics reported periodically too?
Could you enable it also for normal debugging? My normal scenario is to debug regular code, I debug unit tests with less frequency.
Does it mean, that the memory consumption of the app increases permanently with every rotate? 
Maybe the image is not kept in offline mode?

Could you confirm that `onlineMode` in your config.yml file is set to false AND your server.properties file?
Does this happen outside of eclipse, and is that the full code snippet?
Do you know how that could be reproduced easily locally so we can test it ?
Can you please share the file?
What do you think about adding a global flag to `NamedArray` and maybe renaming the class   something semantically similar to `MatlabVariable`? It'd represent an array with a name and global flag that sits at the root level. This would match MATLAB semantics much better. 
can you provide your factory.json or workspace.json?
does it happens when running with [example](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share/tree/master/example)?
Could it be the fragmentList in OpenScale that holds on to fragments after they have been destroyed?
What version of Minecraft?

Would that be possible for you to share a unit test exposing this incorrect behaviour? Thanks.
Do you think this qualifies or is it just poor performance that wouldn't impact game functionality (or API) to fix at some point?  Pinging @immortius and @flo 
Could you lay out the reproduction steps in order so that I can get this bug to happen?  Pretend I am very stupid and state the obvious parts too :-)
Did you ever find a real solution for this issue? I've worked around it by just removing the zh-Hans and zh-Hant families from the fonts.xml file and setting ja's index to 0 but I have no idea if this is going to break anything down the line. 
Can you set a [break-point here](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/util/JavaVersion.java#L21) and check other properties inside the debugger? You could use the static methods of `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils` to access all important information. 
what version of jobdsl are you using?
What Java version are you using? I had the same problem with Java 11 but it worked correctly with Java 8.
Does this happen with all items? Or just one specific item?  (It looks like an issue with a large NBT tag)
Would you prefer if the modal message prevented interaction with the Maps View?
Don't understand the problem, please clarify (some example?).
Can you please give a test case to reproduce the failure ?  About the inheritance issue, you're right. We must change the way we validate type to take into account: 1. type inheritance 2. native type auto boxing 
Does this offer come from a browser, or is it something that you generate?
Can you give me the F3 view of this screenshot so I can see what coordinates the stargate is at? This might be an issue with the way the structure definitions are being translated into block coordinates. 
Can't `getSize()` be simplified to `return this.len;` then? 
Maybe you hit the minus key by error? Can you please verify whether the crash happens when you actually press a number key? 
Could you try reproducing the same issue using simple ASCII tags please? I want to see if it lies with the UTF encoding. 
Can you let me know what version of Cyclic this issue happened in? There was a similar bug that was fixed in 1.9.4 here https://github.com/PrinceOfAmber/Cyclic/issues/208  Also, im running the latest build of both mods (downloaded and updated through curse client) now and it works for me http://i.imgur.com/VFBfYbW.png
Can you detail what you put on application environment and on datalib ? In case the url in datalib does not start by http or https or ftp, the url defined at application level should be inserted before the service url where you can leave only the relative url. 
Which Neo4j version are you using?  Looks like an older one. Can you please try it on 2.3.1 ?  It looks like a dense-node-merge issue.  If you can't upgrade I can point you to some workarounds for this issue. But please test it first with 2.3.1 to make sure. 
What version of Gradle were you using? 
Can you confirm?
Can you please try that version ?   Regards, Ashish Bansal 
Doesn't that limit the user's choice?   If Fennec would be the default we show an "Open in Firefox" option currently, but if there are multiple third party browsers we show "Open in...".
Would you both mind copying and pasting your crash logs into a gist so I can take a look at them?  I plan on looking into this issue tonight, but for now I highly recommend, if possible, to remake the world and disable chest shops from within the main Total Economy configuration file.
Can you provide all the exact commands to lead to the master node shutdown? Provide any errors you saw in the log? Also what version of ES are you using?

Can you test this technique?  https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/docs/_docs/setup
Can you explain a bit more?

Maybe Guava?  Another option would be to use Java 8, then there is `java.util.Base64`. 
What other mods are installed when this happens? 
Can you please attach a screenshot of the Jenkins job config where the plugin is configured?
Which locale is set in the config? Do the config files exists? I don't have that problem ... Locales are working for me. Try to delete the locale files and execute "/bw reload" 
Can you try upgrading your version of IntelliJ as mentioned in the issue? 
What version of the mod are you using, and which Minecraft version are you playing?
Can you execute `/qs paste` again after you execute `/qs reload`, so i can see details of loading shops? Also please upload your `shops.db` file.
Can you give an example of such a gif? 
Might also be a good idea to somehow adjust the test so that it would fail in cases like this, maybe by checking for some specific value in the response?
Which build from the Jenkins is that?

Maybe the guy has an Mega2560 with the old firmware? 
Could you please also upload technical service file?
Didn't we remove owned attribute for some reason? 
Can you confirm that the bug happens with *only* Minestuck and AppleCore installed?
Maybe also is something similar to #2365 or #2323 ? 
Maybe give the controllers a bit more time before the reset and make the broken state a bit more obvious/less likely to be overlooked? 
Can we add a redirect from zipkin to zipkin/ (or even better support both in the code)?  It's very annoying that /zipkin returns a 404
Do you have a reproduction case that shows otherwise?
Can you point me to those?
Would you mind posting a video? I'm not have much luck getting the touch event to go through the callout onto the map.
how is exist-db able to serve out the right document? there is no absolute path. what happens if you provide a compile url starting with `http://localhost:8080/.....` ? 
Can you enable trace logging and give me the (redacted) query + response issued directly to slack?

Can you please post a screenshot / screenrecord? 
Can you confirm if you're looking at all tasks on the server then, or just the tasks for a single project?
What permissions plugin are you using?
Can you test older versions?  I think some paths in plugin.xml of this this plugin have to be changed for Cordova 8. Currently I only use this plugin with an older Cordova Android.
What version of the library are you using, and on what devices/Android versions? 
Do you have modify the registry directly via ``Glide.get(context).getRegistry()``? Or register any custom components in a ``GlideModule``?  I haven't seen this before. If you have any ideas on how to reproduce it let me know.
Can you provide a link to the podcast?  Also, what device and Android version are you running?

Does this work on any of the older builds (1330)?
Could you please share with us any errors you may find in your IE11 or MS Edge [developer tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bg182326%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) while doing the CSV export? 
Do you know the feature branch on which this has been implemented? :) 
What MC version are you on?
Could you give me the release number of Spoon and the name of the project you're using, or at least a pointer to the pom.xml file?

Could you paste your config on [Gist](https://gist.github.com) anyway?  Does this happen every single time a player joins?
which Run Configuration type does that?
What kind of backup did you import? 
Can this be an inspection in Plugins SDK group: that would help much? 
What Minecraft version is this in?
Can you provide a GitHub project that shows the failure? 
Which encoding are .you using at server side?
Can you confirm and then I'll close it?  Edit: Generating a handful of {U}{X} origins decks or mono {U} decks should prove it. There is something about the mana curve of the cards in that colour that seemed to trigger the bug consistently. 
Would you mind providing a breaking scenario using [one of these repositories](https://github.com/springfox/springfox/tree/master/swagger-contract-tests/src/main/java/springfox/test/contract/swagger/data/rest) as an example?

Can I get the full stack trace? (Try mvn -e). 
Can you let me know the device, approximate date and time of crash? Will help me filter the log. Thanks
Can you provide a link to your hello world project?  I can diagnose it directly for you. Also you can use the [the sample app](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold-sample-project) as a reference, paying close attention to the Java 8 portions of the pom file. 
Does it fail consistently for a particular test? I have a suspicion about what might be causing this assert, but I have trouble reproducing it.
Could you please share the problematic file, so we can see why `Mp3Extractor` thinks that it's an MP3 file?
Can you copy-paste the file in question and/or the spotless part of your `build.gradle`?

what's the problem? 
Should we just construct "the right thing" anyway, since this is in the type store? 
Which artifact are you adding as the dependency? You seem to be the first one having this issue, which is a bit weird.

Can you provide a link? If it's https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time you should report the bug there. Thanks
Can you share the URL? Or some other URL where this happens?  Is there any way you can print the complete stack trace and post it here?  Or are you trying to use a self-signed certificate? https://github.com/delight-im/Android-DDP/issues/100 
Does changepw work?
Shouldn't all options be sorted in alphabetical order ? It makes it easier to search a specific one, specially when there is dozens options.
Can you upload or link to the files that are causing the errors? 
can you describe exactly what you did?  Like  ?
What do you think? 
When the program freezes, does the animated cursor go to the busy cursor?  What type of system are the remote files on? (Unix, Windows, Mac) and what protocol have you set up the share with (e.g. SAMBA, NFS?)  Thanks. 
How many alert conditions do you get when do a `curl -u $youruser:$yourpassword http://$graylog/api/alerts/conditions`? Is the number of alert conditions returned correct? 
However could you provide a simple example project that have your described problems so i can debug it? would be great if I can find the bug and fix it.
Can you pull changes and give it a try again?
Do you see this line in your logs: `Detected DNS change ...` ? Also please make sure that DNS entry TTL is low enough to support this.
What Chisel version are you using? 
What do you mean for not working the text/plain content type? Do you mean configuring encoding as text/plain? Can you provide a reproducer for that specific case?
Can you work with Wildfly 10?
What about trying --image? 
Did you try to debug as well? Do you somewhere call `holder.getAdapterPosition()` ?
Did you try adding `JAVA_OPTS` to a `.conf` file next to your jar? Looking at the init script I think that should work (although it looks like we've missed that [from the docs](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#deployment-script-customization)) 
Could you disclose more details about the issue you encountered? I.e. - what is the BLE advertisement's payload you want to match? - what is the exact setup of `ScanSettings` and `ScanFilter`s you use?

Could you give me a list of the other plugins you're using?
Can you try build DEV - 346 and see if it's fixed?
Do you have the same config file on the server *and* client?  They both need to be the same, otherwise issues like this will appear with client-side things.
How does it behave with http ? 
What driver version do you use?  Also, second snippet doesn't close the connections. While first one - does.
Would it be possible for you to try the code from the "next" branch just to make sure it hasn't been worked out already?  I have no specific reason to believe it has, but it is worth checking. 
Can you provide a sample script so that we can reproduce this?
Would you suggest there is no file extension constraint on TeiCollectionReader ? Or maybe a *.(tei|xml) ? Or set the constraint to *.tei to match the documentation ? 
Can you describe the summary in title for search friendly?
Does this also resolve the problem with `withFileSystemBind`? https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java/commit/1952fa6fad94d7ff071e578f6c46e5bb81124c9a seems to be already released in `3.1.0-rc-2`.
Did the player that destroyed a chest get any message in the chat? Are you using the latest version?
Do you still see the crash if you uninstall and reinstall the new version of the app? 
Can you add `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=heap-dump.hprof` to the JVM settings and see what dominates the heap when this happens? We repopulate all indexes in parallel, and it could be that this creates too much Lucene state on the heap in your case. 
Could you provide a sample exception stacktrace? 
what mod version are you playing on?
Can you confirm the locale of the computer you are using this on? I believe `jg-messages` is a language localization properties file that one of the internal libraries use. I must be excluding it when I put Portico through it's "one-jar generation" process perhaps.
Do you have one?
What were you doing when you observed these npes? 
How are there negative results if the negative NES scores are filtered out? Can you please send me the session file.
Would anyone of you mind sharing an URL to a piwigo setup showing the effect? - Feel free to send it by mail only to android@ pigigo org if you don't want to share it publicly.
Can you please provide a complete, minimal example (something that we can unzip or `git clone` and run) that reproduces the problem?
which endpoint are you referring to? all of 'em?
Does it happen when you join another server you've joined before or just that one? 
How sure are we it's that bad? Will a new project created in 1.4.0 work or is this only for converted projects? (It wasn't clear to me the initial reporter had converted their project.) 
What version do you use? It was already resolved from #462, and released (2.3.0). Please note that latest release is 2.4.2.  Friendly reminder : If you think this issue is not valid anymore, please close it. :) 
What are your device clients doing during these long periods of time? Are they actively sending messages? If so, how frequently? What kind of authentication are you using (sas token, device key, or x509)?
Could you provide your configuration and version of used SSM? 
Do you have a failing test?  If I understand correctly, you mean we need to use `type.getName()` instead of `type.getCanonicalName()` here: https://github.com/j-easy/easy-random/blob/master/easy-random-core/src/main/java/org/jeasy/random/util/ClassGraphFacade.java#L56  Is that correct?
Can you reproduce this with only JER and Googly eyes? (and there dependencies ofc) 
Did you not find that in the creative inventory?
Do you run a local full node in prunded mode? That would be a reason. Bisq require a non-pruned node if local host node is running. Can you post a screenshot of the settings/network screen? Do you have any network restrictions or network problems? Does Tor browser work well?
Maybe you remember what you did before you get that problem?
What do you want as a solution? That all libraries be installed? 
Can you verify this issue with the latest version of each mod with no other mods installed?

Could you provide a build link for this failure? Thanks
What versions of the mods involved are you using?
What kind of storage system is this (hard drive, cd/blue ray, external hard drive, etc)?  Also, the zip functionality has known issues (like not preserving file timestamp among others) and is not recommended. Instead you should create a bag and then use another piece of software to create a zip.
Do you use the chcp cli tool to generate the manifest? I've haven't run into this issue using it, but I did using the gulp implementation mentioned here: https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/issues/54. Somehow it generates different MD5 hashes. 
Do older versions of Forge for 1.10.2 still work? If so, then there really must have been some internal changes. 
Can you please check if you can reproduce it when opening more than one project at the same time?

Which website are you using? I will look into this issue. 
What recovery do you use? 
can you select a trader and use the /trader command?   then tell me what info you got for the wallet type  
Does it freeze also with debug disabled? Duplicate of #3507 and #4611. Related: #209, #3209 
Does it really matter? The increase is pretty much uniform across all countries, so we could just count it as global inflation. Market prices/cost of reduction etc. are increasing as well, so with some proper balancing it should all mostly cancel out. 
Could you post the actual logcat? The syncthing output should be in there.   Finding the right line really isn't the problem :P  
Do you actually want to scroll with the popup open?
When you say play/pause button, you mean the audioplayer view, right? (There is also the widget, notifications, lock screen...) 
Does this happen all the time? Did you refresh the story while it's still in loading state (...) or after it has already been loaded? 
When workspace is created via factory - does it contain workspace config or workspace devfile attribute of the workspace instance?   On my side - I tried to reproduce the issue, but did not manage - it works.
Shall I include the fix for #7118 into release as well?
Can you give me a better view on your domain model? How does Brand and related classes look like? 
Could you provide a "Minimal, Reproducible Example" in order to debug the issue?
What do you mean? Like after a few days, they're noticeably bigger? 
Does it happen when the player is standing on the very top & bottom of a craft (like https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft/issues/65) or is it the very back of a craft (https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft/issues/86)?
maybe we can introduce a new Take decorator, which will work like this:    did I get it right? 
What would it do instead? Somebody needs to close the response and release resources.
How are you playing the audio from the pipe?
Do you think you can retrieve the application logs and send them? This may help. 
Can you change the folder to the desired folder there? 
Did you enter valid credentials in your case? Could you please post your system info (about c:geo - system tab)? 
Did you attach the screenshots to your email? That does not show up on Github
How are you configuring the broker cluster on your environment? How are you referencing the JMS host configuration on your Payara installation?
Can we prefix them with ACTIVITY_ and maybe put them in one place? 
Maybe share the project on Github?  Thanks 
Can you please explain in more detail what is going wrong? 
Do you use Guava? In general our Java 6 compatibility relies on the presence of Guava, in this case `Lists.newArrayList()` would be used instead of diamond constructor. I just worry that there are couple of other places where this might strike-back, and using Guava all will be easier on Java 6 
What version are you using?
Maybe you open a wrong folder in the Android Studio?  Thanks.
How are you adding your close button to the view? 
Can you please expand on "with remote caches this results in failed builds if you accept this file in your cache" - what exactly you are doing, how it breaks, how you determined that null hash is at fault?
Could you please show here how exactly did you try to start the batch?
While it may make sense to include only the JARs, is it wrong though to have an XML file there? Isn't it a bug in Graal?
What CAPS version are you using? Also: are you separately depending on some Neo4j version?
Could you elaborate a bit on what is needed? Thanks.
When does that happen? Generally, Geocache.supportsGCVote() is implemented to only request caches starting with "GC". 
What versions of the mods are you using, is this in 1.10 or 1.11?
Can you reproduce this error without Sponge?
Do you see messages in the `tracker-server.log` file? 
Can you add the source for ModularityAnalyzer as well? I don't believe the class is available anywhere publicly accessible, and I cannot replicate the issue without it.
Which device and android version? 
Do you have an example atom feed? I don't think I ever saw one... Isn't Atom the betamax of feeds? 
Maybe a stack trace?
Can you please send me the apk file to Steven.Arzt@cased.de? I'll then have a look at it. 
Does your program finish (exited with return value 0) normally? Or some exception was thrown? Or the progressbar simply did not reach 100%, but the control flow continued?
Could you provide more info about how you made this happen?  Specifically it would be helpful to know what you have input on each of the wizard pages.

Can you report back once it is working? :+1: 
Could you provide full stack trace ? 
Could it be a Kotlin oddity ?
How large of an image display do I have to create for it to create such a lag spike? It might be caused by something specific ImageOnMap does, like adding and removing a lot of entities rapidly.
Do you have a log file from that moment?
Did you update recently? It's probably broken since https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/507b00f7ec3145e817b200db571b8bd93b40c330.   Try using `useDefaultSemantics()` instead of `setSemantics()`. It's probably better than making skylark_semantics public (unless someone needs it).
Could you run `/ess debug`, *then* run `/afk` and post that output? After that, run `/ess version` and paste its **full output**.
Does anyone know how to solve this? It would be nice to know if someone already fixed it before trying myself.   
Do I understand right that the notifications get expanded when N-ify is disabled? 
What is the output of `bazel version`?
Do you already know when you will fix this, or shall I take over? 
What version of the plugin are you using? You can find out the plugin version by going to the header menu (File, Edit, etc), Arma Plugin->About. Thanks for the error report. 
What version are you on? 
Could it be that `DeferredLinesWriter` doesn't get reset between tests that use the same `ApplicationContext`?
Do you use Apache, Nginx, other web server? Could you provide us with some web server logs ?   Thanks. 
How reproducible is the crash? 3. Is it device specific? 4. Can you reproduce this using `voice-quickstart-android`? 5. Does `CallInvite.reject()` work when you don't have a cellular call? 6. Is this reproducible using beta17?  Thanks.

Could you turn on TRACE level debugging for the TA CMI binding, like:    in your logback.xml file?  This should add verbose logging for [when the binding receives a command](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/blob/master/bundles/binding/org.openhab.binding.tacmi/src/main/java/org/openhab/binding/tacmi/internal/TACmiBinding.java#L223).

how is this one looking? I'm going to move to in-progress as I believe you have most of the code in?  Be sure when it's merged to add a "Fixes #issueNumber" to the PR.  It's handy to have that on the commits to as it then logs to the issue and we can see progress if any.

Can you please check if the problem still persists with the current jar http://dl.bintray.com/chschmid/generic/jdotxt-0.1.7.jar ?  Thank you! Cheers, Christian. 
Why do we have to throw explicitly, if a non-cleared exception will be thrown automatically when a native method returns?
Can you post a log right after Syncthing stops working? I don't think logs are kept during a restart. 
Why do you want to loose information?  Your fix may work but it allows something I want to avoid: you might "aggregate" a trade in two (or more) different ticks, which is a perfect non-sense for me (but I am open to anything).

Will you please find "swagger.json" in the target directory and tell me what line 688 looks like? Maybe include lines 680-700 for context?

Can you be a bit more specific? What item/recipe is it happening on? Do you have logs, screenshot?
Did you lose the take-offer fee (you can see it in funds/transactions)?  I made a change for the new version (not deployed yet, but soon) to reduce the risk that this can happen. The price is really stange though...  I cannot see the offer though, but will keep an eye on it.

What do you think @melvinzhang ? 
Does it happen to all file types? You also mentioned that it does not `always` update.
Do you have a reproducible example project you can share?  While it likely isn't the cause of your problem, plugin version 0.9.1 is a couple years old (there are more recent versions available), and I haven't updated the plugin to support Gradle 6.x quite yet.
Would it be possible for you to export the project as a zip file and share it with me?  Best regards, Harald

Can I get the full log produced by starting the game to the main menu? Looks like a resource error of some sort, which usually produce outputs. Also, does wearing it still work?
Could you look at your IDE logs and see if you see an exception that looks related to the plugin?  You can find your IDE log from the **Help** menu, then **Show Log in Explorer** (for Windows; I don't know what it says for Linux or Mac versions). 
Can you supply a sample of the failure case (the shape types and coordinates and Ray details)?  I’d like to investigate further.  
Does this also happen when you run the application outside of an IDE? I assume that there is another agent active that overrides your instrumentation.

Can you select additionally by type? One of them should be a Switch, I guess?

How are you running it? I have tried running the sample in both my IDE and using `./gradlew check` and the test passes. Thanks again for the report!
However, the IDE should reconnect  @sleshchenko can this be caused by nginx reload?
Does that help?  I'll try to tack in some more comments to the javadoc.

Does this fail with every browser?   I will make the server more fault tolerant in any case by allowing a string to be transmitted and setting a default if not present. 
Maybe we should add a feature to check the current installed Bazel already matches the given version in .bazelversion? So that users don't run into the having to install Bazel twice problem.
Does that make adaptation more simple? 
Does it work now? IE after the update? I can't reproduce it.

What difference does it make? My guess would actually be that the null coalesce operator is the better choice in such situations, because it does not try to coerce the variables content to a Boolean, but rather checks for null only.
Do you mean that it restarts immediately after finishing? 
Can you please try using an entity name without an underscore in it?  I wasn't able to reproduce the error locally. What version of Structr are you using? Can you post a screen shot of the problem / error?

Why ? Because **Achilles** provides very **limited** support for secondary index. Why ? Because they're tricky to use and do not scale very well. Documentation here: https://github.com/doanduyhai/Achilles/wiki/Entity-Mapping#secondary-index 
Does that mean it's fixed ? :P

Can you try to enable new image loader in settings ("Feature flags" section) and see if it still happening?
Why do you need Computronics 1.4.6? You should always use the latest version... Well, if you really need it (I'd still like to know the reason), download it from [the archive](http://files.vex.tty.sh/Computronics/). 
Could you set your logging level to FINE to see if you see logs that say `Unable to load the library: netty-tcnative-linux-x86_64`?

Can you build `jdbi` from after that change and verify that we've fixed your issue (and not broken anything else)?  Thanks!  (We had to remove Oracle build and tests from main jdbi because of the ridiculous Maven setup required, and Oracle's inability to reliably host their jdbc driver)
Can you please share the logs from the `my-cluster-kafka-0` pod? Also, are you sure you are using the `0.16.2/examples/kafka/kafka-persistent-single.yaml` file? Because that should have only one Zookeeper node while your example shows 3 of them.
Do you have any logs from your server which you might be able to share with us?  This is only for the case that we can't reproduce the issue.
How about merging engine-tests back into engine? I remember that one of the reasons for the separation was that eclipse didn't deal with it properly, but I think this issue is fixed now.  I think that the junit failures in NameGenerator and Pathfinding are different and probably caused by #1169 .

Can you define more precisely which activity was open when the app was sent to the background? Can you give a step-by-step description? What version of c:geo did you use?

Could you let me know if the problem still exists with 0.5.5 ? 
What locale (exact value) did you specify in your config.yml?
Can you help me on that? 
Which PR do you refer to ?
Can you check if a command exists that is running in `NBODataService`?  Feel free to paste the raw Hystrix stream here as well and I can try to determine what's going on.  It would also be a good idea to look at a thread dump on your system and see if threads with that name are being created. 
What about /he search?

Does it happen with all machines or just one type specifically?   I'm fairly sure Mek's pipes won't even let an item in if it has no destination, so it sounds as though a machine is letting something succeed on simulate but fail when done for real.
