v5 1 3  but it happened with the last 2 versions too   it happened to me right now again  maybe it's because the tab is a duplicate sort of  notice how the first 3 have script  15  script 18  script 21 and don't have errors  while the last 3 have just query and an error     selection_290  https   user images githubusercontent com 12811206 43380212 963e7f4e 93d0 11e8 8412 c31982f66adc png    selection_296  https   user images githubusercontent com 12811206 43380210 960ac8f2 93d0 11e8 9808 2a6aa0ad60cc png    selection_291  https   user images githubusercontent com 12811206 43380211 96245c0e 93d0 11e8 8c04 49ffe1355245 png    selection_288  https   user images githubusercontent com 12811206 43380213 96578fde 93d0 11e8 8c00 b08120bcf2cc png   i really like the feature that it reopens the tab  it keeps the workflow going from day to day  it's like sublime2   i have upgraded to v5 1 4  which mentions upgrade and linux fixes  let's how this goes 
 rpappalax it's more related to the android version of the device rather than the actual device  as i've mentioned  android 8 and android 9 devices do not seem to be affected by this issue  only managed to reproduce it on devices with android version   8

i tried checking travis  didn't see an obvious second build  maybe we could have gnag report the travis build number in comments  or include a link back to the travis job  could be configurable to be ci system agnostic  of course 
tried in my code  but still experiencing issue    here is how i'm doing this    i'm not sure how your library works  but maybe issue is somehow related to difference between query params of selection and deletion     neither onerror   nor onnext   is invoked when deleting  
no and if restore teh previous version the problem diseapeared   no blank with the same database and static core

ok maybe that was the issue   the primary group  that is   except that " custom" came back as a 'unknown command   ' even with the files present  so that may be something else or    i just have to do a total server restart every time i add one   i couldn't get it to work before even with the primary groups on info but  it does appear to be working as advertised now  at least on the  einfo command   maybe had been a problem with a previous build i had that got patched along the way  i don't know   there wasn't anything helpful in debug since    it acts like the command was never  even attempted

the unbreaking enchantment is able to be applied via the enchanting table though   and it is used in the code to reduce power cost by adding a chance to not consume power on usage  if unbreaking isn't desired for this effect  is it possible to add a new enchantment for powered tools that specifically reduces power draw 
here is my skype ckgan2004 hotmail com  what time you about want to do dis discussion 
1  i have seen this with two alerts  and their alert conditions were    "alert is triggered when there is more than one message in the last 6 minutes  grace period  60 minutes  not including any messages in alert notification  configured to repeat notifications "  this alert should have fired off after restarting it  but never did      "alert is triggered when there is less than one message in the last 10 minutes  grace period  60 minutes  not including any messages in alert notification  configured to repeat notifications "  for this alert i made it more sensitive by changing the threshold to "less than 1111 messages"  then it should have fired off straight away  it did not fire off until half an hour later   2  i haven't found a reliable way to make the alert condition work again  my current workaround is to create an entire new stream  alert  and notification from scratch with the exact same configuration as the old one   and those new ones work   3  i am not sure  the "unresolved alerts" list doesn't make sense to me   i can see a couple of alert in there listed as "still ongoing" when i know the corresponding stream does not have any messages anymore  may be a problem unto itself 
sorry just figured i would report this bug and then create a quick fix  let me know if you want more detail  but the pr should hopefully explain the issue

tested this  removing the style xml file makes the map visible again   so it is the map style files which are not working   to test this i changed the style file name so that it did not match the openandromaps  map file name  the map became visible  i changed the name so that it did match the  map file name  the map vanished  i changed the name again  and added a new different style file with a filename which matched the  map file name  the map vanished  i changed the name of the map style file and the map reappeared  during this process i did a full exit of geopaparazzi often    these are map style files   xml  which i use currently in oruxmaps  i tested them again today and they are working in oruxmaps  i believe that previously they were working in geopaparazzi too  but i didn't use geopaparazzi properly yet so i may be mistaken 
the problem disappeared after a few days right after i made a new copy of the original  classpath  i suspect it was a problem with how the  classpath was automated and not a problem with the extension it self  but i'm not sure as i can not recreate it either

i was killing wall beasts in lumbridge swamp dungeon  i realised that defence exp tracker was showing these things  when i reached 60 attack  i was wielding brine sabre   then i switched my combat style style to train strength  earlier i was training attack    i had no boosted stats what so ever   now i have closed the client so i can not check if it is still showing it incorrectly   tomorrow when i log in  i will see if it is still messed up 
i'll have a look at it  may take some time 
i am  so  sorry i haven't had a chance to check this out  i don't think i can do it on the boxes where i'm using it "in anger"  but i will try and at least spin up a nano or something with a similar config and give it a quick whirl 
just tested this  yes  this still work correctly after the change
yes  first time i have configured it have saved all signed blobs  but not the new one yet 
sorry for the misuderstanding  snicoll  spring cloud contract needs a configuration to switch to junit 5 but i think that since spring boot 2 2 x use junit 5 by default we can consider adding this configuration properly    wdyt 
it doesn't reuse the file  it marks it as read only and then it gets its length so it can compute the starting offset of the next file  if that  older  file's length changes afterwards due to a concurrent write finishing off  then the offsets will not match the sum of lengths before that   there is  however  a way by which the file is indeed used  after a successful open write  fencing   the segment's files are auto compacted  this means that empty files are deleted  except last one  since it was just created   and multiple files are concatenated into the first file  to avoid having an excessive number of smaller files sitting around    we are using the naming scheme we originally agreed upon  but it gets very hairy in some cases  suppose you have this  for segment "a"  this assumes no auto compaction is done  to explain how the very very original proposal would've worked  
yep  mvn clean package worked  and this does resolve this error  do we know when it will be rolled into this project   thanks

 2016 11 13 13 16 41 zip  https   github com simracingapps simracingapps files 587953 2016 11 13 13 16 41 zip  i tried both the one from the broadcaster spotter camera app and the individual carselector camera widget  each time  the console did register the command to change car  but the sim did not respond to it   i also tried moving the logging up to finest  but there were no additional messages printed at the time   edit  actually  i have a correction to this now  it isn't that the widget isn't working at all  it's that it isn't working correctly  i did additional testing and did a screen capture of what i was seeing   uploading 2016 11 13 13 16 41 zip…     based on the log messages and what the screen recording is showing  it appears the code is confusing car number  the number on the car and on the app  with the car's actual sim based id  from the attached video  for example  i click to change to car number 13  but it instead switches me to car number 26  it does this for a few other examples as well  which are included in the video  there are also several cases where attempting to switch to a higher numbered car simply does not do anything   my guess is that the code has essentially transposed carxid with car number in the camera code  the reference car updates correctly when using broadcaster spotter camera  for example 
i can reproduce with both enabling and disabling the chunkloading in the config  when disabled  it's fairly easy to do  when enabled  you just need to reach the chunkloaders limit  which is pretty easy in a public smp server 
here's a simplified version that fails with invalid signature 
i've just tried it on glassfish 2 1 1 and sadly glassfish v2 doesn't like the command in the different order   so i will keep my fork for glassfish 3 
freebuilder version  1 14 6 jdk  1 8 0_144 using eclipse oxygen  4 7 1  to build    looking at this a bit more  using eclipse to build seems to trigger this  when i run a maven build it seems to be just fine 
i've created a pr  https   github com eclipse hono pull 1009
these are the logs i could find since i've been on today   latest   https   pastebin com sftyh50l fml server latest   https   pastebin com mrqlzbrm fml server 3   https   pastebin com v6nx0zqt fml server 2   https   pastebin com e2p5ylgb fml server 1   https   pastebin com f2x5we4s fml junk   https   pastebin com ieq4r8s8  not sure how to fix the image links  but it does appear to be sporadic     so it doesn't happen all the time  also note  that smaller quarry sizes don't seem to derp it as much either  but the max size  64x64  do  also  the fluxducts do not connect in single  or server play 
anticheatreloaded 1 5 2 alpha  the 1 11 update  spigot version v1_11_r1
installing  g++  and  build essential  helped to progress further but now i'm getting a different error that embedded tools failed to build  below is the truncated error message 
the job is scheduled on a different task executor so only that thread will get blocked and vertx event loop should be running 
this is my log  if you need more info  you can contact me anytime   michał gregorczyk notifications github com于2016年5月31日周二 下午7 59写道：             beginning of  dev log system  d mtppropertygroup  1635

yes ，  check device error ！     the code   boolean android   system getproperty "java vendor"  contains "android"     android  is  false    on my device  and  osname  is linux   so  it will try to  load  libobjectbox linux x64 so
the exceptions are observed again even without data of long type  i am doing some testing to figure it out 
i don't get to see start  name 
nop      # enable the database caching system  should be disabled on bungeecord environments     # or when a website integration is being used      caching  false
i added  print  statement  but i cannot reproduce it any more  as i see reports in bazel itself 
mm     this one is yes an old one 4 1 2   but again got the same in 4 4  
sure  i will do it 
hi  sabbyanandan   thank you for your help  i'll try to describe the process     steps  1  i've registered previusly a task app  that only shows date time into a loop for ten minutes      all seems ok  app registered ok   2  i deploy the task app date time  it is  launching without scheduler  applying into "  parameters" textfield from web    4  and  if i do the same deply  removing  "deployer   kubernetes entrypointstyle exec" param is running  ok 
yes  the enchant effect works  i probably should have removed that for this issue  i just had it on my test skript 
sorry 👍
my mistake  i set colorsurface to a very light color which caused the issue    thanks anyways 
thanks for the info 
1  here is how we transfer uuid to messageid  it works okay  3  this issue rarely happens  the previous one occurs about 1 week after the process started i have change log level from error to info for package 'com microsoft azure servicebus' and will keep monitor 
i didn't enable the lockscreen for signal  notifications are normally shown at my phone   edit  misunderstood you  sorry  signal is not at the foreground  i locked the screen while being at my launcher screen

i think we just differ in opinion about how desirable mass prompt is  i would prefer to be notified prompted quite a bit when first running apps  so that i can get a feel for what they are doing in real time  rather than trying to anticipate every app's needs ahead of time  sounds like that isn't an intended use pattern for xprivacy  though   i am curious as to why prompt is considered an exception setup here  sounds like there is something i am missing  in many desktop security apps  there are settings for how much you want automated and how much you want to deal with via realtime prompts  i usually set them to lots of prompts  is there a reason that is undesirable in android  other than the aggravation of getting a zillion prompts the first time you trigger a new event

see the build logs on travis for master   https   travis ci org corfudb corfudb branches  it doesn't seem consistent  but usually somewhere inside smrmaptest  on my local machine addnodeit consistently fails due to a file error  i've verified that tests pass locally after reverting to head 1 on master 
that if i could answer  the fission port of the other two reactors did on version 2 7 sometimes the same problem  reactor complete build up and nothing would be imported  after switching the sides of the import and export it worked  best example  the second small reactor on the first picture  same build as the first small  don't accept fuel rods too   for explanation and clarity   2 small reactors  same build  2x2x3 fission port layer 2 don't work  doesn't matter on which side i place an export bus   first reactor  moved the fission port one layer up  backside of the port don't accept fuel rods  the top of it accept it and the controller doesn't recognize the rods   second reactor  second layer  don't accept fuel rods  third layer   surprise surprise   don't accept fuel rods    now i'm confused right now cause this are the same builds   well i build the same reactor in a few minutes and i think i have the solution and where it depends on     maybe chunks  my first 2 reactors are in nearly with the interior in one chunk  the small ones aren't  the chunk border is exactly behind the controller

many thanks for the prompt reply   i will try it with cyberduck   i really cannot tell how i achieved that  i started with an 1 2 x version and upgraded multiple times   just found out as i am working with git from commandline and wanted to list my files and was suprised that the directory could not see any files when i was using lowercase  as it always was not be a difference on windows 
hi  tuteng   i have attached all the 3 configs which i modified  i did run with and without  tlsprotocols  and  tlsciphers   where broker uses to negotiate during tls handshake but nothing worked  openssl 1 1 0g is available on ubuntu server   tls_running_config_inprogress zip  https   github com apache pulsar files 3044180 tls_running_config_inprogress zip   bin pulsar admin tenants list is ok      no   it does throw error like below   but without any auth tenants list works fine  while generating the ca for broker common  name given as hostname and for client given as admin
 jexp  this is a log of an embedded neo4j application  i did some traversal via the traversal framework  the whole enclosing transaction is read only   i don't have the storage files  but this very query succeeded the next time  so i believe  the storage was consistent 
my humble idea is its caused from ‘ ’  sign is not encoded …    browser can resolve it but as you know using java url like visiting the queen at the buckingham palace    
 marcingrzejszczak still no luck using those snapshots

i am not adding anything manually  but jmhtab is also called for queued build  and in this case url contains "itemid" parameter instead of "buildid"  i'd recommend to extend jetbrains buildserver web openapi buildtab which is only shown for running or finished builds  and also i'd show jmh tab only if there is an artifact with jmh report  this should solve the problem completely

hey   thanks for replying  actually the test case on which i am working is as follows  1  i have created a server which is able to handle requests for file upload  2  of course one client can upload many files using single channel  but i am considering a test case in which i want to create multiple clients and to do so i should create multiple bootstraps  eventloopgroup and channel that means    if creating multiple eventloopgroups is not advisable then how to replicate above scenario  because at real time there will be millions of clients and each client will have its own bootstrap  eventloopgroup and channel and the server should serve all those clients   and if test app is necessary to understand the problem then i'll surely upload the code snippet of test case

yup  i did some tcpdump and saw some references to segment numbers that should be sealed   the current segment number is around  2400 and i saw some segment metrics reported for 641  for segment_write_bytes      screen shot 2017 08 31 at 2 07 32 pm  https   user images githubusercontent com 9335655 29935839 971bd7de 8e56 11e7 9c1a c2aa53218638 png   my understanding with the dropwizard metrics  it just sends whatever it has in memory as a gauge to the configured statsd endpoint   i'm assuming if pravega isn't actively removing those metrics  then they will continue to be sent on the interval   also note that the 65k points per second includes our downsampling points  writing data to lower precision   so its not all pravega traffic

ok so i basically reinstalled vscode i think  it wanted to update then it did and i had to reinstall all extensions  so after i reinstalled the jdt ls extension  this worked as you describe   i think i might have pegged the v0 4 0 tag  confirmed that with latest master and v0 6 0  it works   do you think using the tags is the right approach   we're trying to pick a stable release as we head towards landing in ycmd    i know there's a lot of movement on the project  so i think we can track master pretty closely if you recommend that instead  we're considering marking java support as "experimental" for the first 5 6 months or so   closing this as it is clearly fixed in later version  sorry for the noise 
works for me now  thanks 
looks like it part of the problem  myhandlercache seems to be binding correctly at startup  and deadbolthandler is there  but when it encounters  subjectpresent in the controller  deadbolthandler is now null 
 vrallev i will provide a sample to reproduce   i agree this should work  in fact  our original way of canceling the job was the following     but looking at the library code  i realized that in this line  jobmanager  285  https   github com evernote android job blob master library src main java com evernote android job jobmanager java#l285  the  includestarted  parameter is assigned to  false   so  i assumed that that was the problem to cancel the job  because i was calling the method inside a running job and  therefore   getalljobrequestsfortag       was returning an empty set   that's the reason we are using  jobmanager instance   cancelallfortag tag    directly  because this method   jobmanager  419  https   github com evernote android job blob master library src main java com evernote android job jobmanager java#l419   sets  includestarted  to  true    none of the solutions worked  obviously  another thing to say is that the usage of  includestarted  in those methods is kind of misleading and maybe a better way would be to expose this parameter in  getalljobrequestsfortag       method    anyway  maybe i could open another issue for this or provide a pr

i tried it on top of aff46bc2f0e59cb9b59f6db982ddd490cf1d2b3c and it still fails  also  i think my proposed test from above is flaky in some way

ok  i've tried something different  i changed the mapping etc  to have the same set up as in the documentation   new field    just for clarification  there is no suggestion missing  i'm looking for "bohrer" which is returned for confidence 0   what i noticed is the following  when i create a fresh index and start to index data  at the beginning everything is working with confidence "1"  and at some point  which seems not really deterministic   i have to adjust the confidence value to "0" to get any result   i don't get it  in my opinion the set up is the same as in the documentation  is there still a weird configuration  i will try to distill a dataset that reproduces this behaviour  but this seems to be difficult 
nope  it seems to be related to magnet bauble  i use thaumcraft which relies on bauble too if i remember correctly  i don't know if that's the cause 
i made it a bit more hackish   the hack that is in place turns paths like "foo bar" into "file   c some absolute path foo bar" which is not what we want because the cmr only understand file paths or remote repository urls  of the form "http   "  "mvn " etc  not "file   "   a nicer solution might be to introduce our own  pathoruri  class that encapsulates this behaviour  but for now this works 
hey guys   i just tried it out with v2 0 0  the function is executed without any exception and the outcome is the one expected  i will do a few more tests later to see if it works with other cases   os is windows 8 1  thanks

i'll try the 1 2 2 rc but it doesn't fixed  i saw the source in the code   if "objectbox_objectbrowserstop" equals intent getaction       the intent will sometime be null when onstartcommand result return start_sticky or start_sticky_compatibility   https   developer android com reference android app service html#start_sticky if there are not any pending start commands to be delivered to the service  it will be called with a   null intent   object  so you must take care to check for this

 ezaquarii i'm not quite tech enough to do the screencast without help  however  i just got to this message and did a new test today  i was out of town all last week and can't remember when i did it  but i disabled the three main google docs apps  then _   _   i uninstalled them    i couldn't believe it worked  i recall trying to remove them in the past and it only let me roll back upgrades  this time it was poof  you're gone   now  both    odt  and    ods  open perfectly in the app without any man in the middle attack by google  interestingly though  i couldn't open a specific    xlsx  file with the app that opens fine in the collabora program in a normal desktop browser  i have many    docx  and    xlsx  files that opened as expected with one touch in the mobile app both in the _pull from the cloud_ and the "on device" areas  the problem file threw up the app chooser to set what opens it  but the only choices were "hp eprint" and "print" by canon  when i touch the vertical ellipsis for that problem file  i had options for "open with" and "open with collabora online developme  "  and the latter selection worked as expected  i then deleted the local copy of that file and it opened in one touch as it was supposed to in collabora   does this close this issue  or would you like me to reinstall those apps to diagnose something

thanks for the quick response    yes  you're right  i should rephrase that  the statement was referring to point 1   currently exoplayer decides to list the platform codecs with 'regular_codecs' or 'all_codecs' filter depending on whether the app needs a secure decoder or not    in file  library core src main java com google android exoplayer2 mediacodec mediacodecutil java codeckind   includesecure   mediacodeclist all_codecs   mediacodeclist regular_codecs   i guess if the utility class knew whether the app preferred a tunneled decoder it could select the right filter   anyway  i figure these are implementation details so you guys should know better how to address it  looking forward to try out your changes when they're ready   thanks 
yes  i can confirm that this fixed the problem with the oregon rain sensor  thanks

this is consistently reproducing the problem on my windows machine   1  open the cardiovasculardynamics model into a project tab  click the dependencies view  2  select the following codewords using the node selection tool  vrestrad  vrestras  eminra and emaxra  note these are all constitutive codewords  3  right click on one of the selected nodes and select "extract selected" 4  name the new model and attempt to visualize its contents    hope that reproduces it on your end   might have something to do with all the nodes being constitutive

that might be   i will double check
the annotation is shared  in a shared package   ceylon net  is also a shared import  so i think the visibility is correct  also  the cli seems to build just fine

we're on version 3 0 5c of boilerplate and b3 5c of steamcraft  the error doesn't show up in single player  this is indeed on a server   going through any other portal doesn't cause this error except with the portal to inner earth  from the steamcraft mod   which got me the error and then i think killed the server when i logged back in

i have intellij 13 1  at the moment i don't have access to plugin version 1 0 2  and in version 1 1 i see the correct error now in "antlr tool output"  didn't know about this before   so the main problem seems to be solved now  the npe appears in event log when i move the slider in "antlr parse tree"   the grammar is following  the problematic label is in rule "avaldis0"  
 brettwooldridge  hikaricp version was 2 7 4 but i've changed it to 3 1 0  problem is persist using both versions   minimum idle is 2 but 0 doesn't do much too  maximum pool size is 20 but i've tried it with 5  nothing really changed    nunnrlc  should i really stop them that way  because as you see in the initialization method i always stop the previous dataset if the conditions are met  i've debugged it for a while and it seems to be work right  i mean it creates a new dataset when it's needed 
ok  i will provide a pr for this the next days 
iirc it was all fresh 
that's great for sure  go for it 
that looks correct to me 
yes it does  i just tested it with a new server  _minecraft  1 8 9 spongeapi  4 2 0 snapshot 79f9c8e spongevanilla  1 8 9 4 2 0 beta 348_  should i close it here then and create a new issue it in the common repo 
sorry i meant it happens around 10  or 20  of the times i upload a picture  i am on cyanogenmod 13 0 based on android 6 0 1 on a nexus 5  i will try to get a log 
as an example  i have the  id for the entity public_rnaseq_3_samples  in above example example_id  and i want to get the information that is in the public_rnaseq_3_input_file  to which public_rnaseq_3_samples has an mref  i don't know which id in public_rnaseq_3_input_file is linked to example_id of public_rnaseq_3_samples  but if i request  public_rnaseq_3_samples example_id input_file_paths   i get the mref data from input_file_paths that is lined to example_id   what would be a better way to get this 
sure  here is the  index xhtml      i set a breakpoint on the line  int i   1  to see if the debugger stops  it stops only if i use the  commandbutton  
still nope 😭   similar issue  but not oculus go specific      #373
sure  one seond 
i'm not sure about the other villagers  but they do seem to be a bit off  like a white haired villager showing as middle aged    sadly  this mod doesn't work all that well with some other mods i have  so i ended up removing it   still  it's a great mod 
i'll provide you a smallish example  i can't send you the whole project   
and nativeeventemitter import reference is missing as well
i am connecting to the caché database using its jdbc driver  everything works great  select  dml  calling procedures  er diagrams  the only thing that doesn't work is stored procedure return values  either as the return value of the procedure itself  or as out or inout parameters  so the snippet above is the only snippet that there is  i'm trying to execute this      fce_operations atm_getamountoutandfee 100 0 5       fce_operations is not a table  it's a container for stored procedures only 
an empty omni tool 
manufacturer id is 154 device id is 1 device type is 3  i think it might be mislabeled as "outdoor" 
yes  i do  i unlock the phone with my fingerprint 
if the picture progress is now reported separately we could just use the normal string  the one which is used if there is no log picture  in step 1
i can confirm that interpolated value is  null  now  as opposed to  "null"  string   however  required   true  is still not respected  in other words  i expect  missingparameterexception  if the option value was not provided  i don't expect  null    and to reiterate  i don't specifically want to use  defaultvalue  attribute  i am looking for a way to define an option that will check explicit command line arg     mypath       first  then check environment variable    mypath    then fail with clear error message if neither is available  and obviously use     mypath      or   mypath  value if available   do you consider this a reasonable usecase or this isn't something picocli is meant to do 
i do even get strange results when disabling the save actions  from enabled to disabled  
the same issue does not occur  only when i try to place a item exporter onto a drawer controller does it crash
for me this version isnt usable     1  the issue is still here    2  if you set a adapter before having any data to populate the array with it will try to add a header that doesnt exist yet     3  when scrolling down i wont get any sticky header until the second header "is sticky" and then when i scroll back the first header works as it should   
i am using v1 3  from f droid   i have used the app since 1 1 3  but have always had this issue  the station names are displayed in the map view though  the same package on another phone does not have this issue  removing and reinstalling has no effect  neither does selecting another bike network     screenshot_2014 09 20 15 57 39  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4056484 4347874 70d8d702 416f 11e4 837b 982c1382c35f png 
i ran  bazel coverage   test_output streamed path to testtarget   i'm not sure how to describe the project   it has several maven jar dependencies  it uses  rules_protobuf  https   github com pubref rules_protobuf  to implement a grpc server    the test is mocking a few things and testing certain http calls would have happened 
theoretical should work but do not work  if i select refresh from eclipse context menu by right click on folder of project all ok

well i agree it defiantly has to do with the issues with #270 but it was working just fine before  i would say the simplest solution is to treat the new value not as  array anything   but as  dynamic  also is it not 
hm  i thought about it and i thing its our bot that creates the problem  i´ll try to find it and maybe i´ll be able to fix it by myself because at the fact that we uptaded the api version  our bot uses maybe old commands i guess  so thank you for your quick support
sample project will be difficult   at least since the whole stuff works like a charm if i deploy it on my local machine  only running in azure it breaks   we are assuming that the problem might be caused by a federated ad scenario plus a conditional access policy  access only from company ips  bound to the ad where we are federated into

hi  vanroy   i am able to reproduce this on versions 2 2 0 and 2 3 0  i just forked your sample  made changes and tested with that   here are the changes i made  https   github com berinle spring data jest commit 8480ab23cfd537fe43c4cfe133667f3b16693cf7  you can clone and test  you will notice despite the   jestid  annotation on the  id  property  the results are still coming back null     please let me know if you need any other info from me  thanks

it's possible  as i was fighting mobs and some of them bestow status effects thanks to infernal mobs  though i didn't specifically notice it   i'll turn fog options back on in the config and blind myself to see if that triggers the crash   i'll edit this comment with results   edit   https   pastebin com vltnxy9c that seems to be the issue   went to the spot i originally crashed  outside a mesa biome   set time to 23000  drank a potion that bestowed blindness and stood still   crash

it does clarify the issue   fwiw  i read what comments are present  and still this did not occur to me   i doubt updating comments are high priority  but noting somewhere in the class that it's meant to mimic line2d would have given me somewhere else to look to understand it's behavior   thanks for the library  it's been very useful to me

 ryanjbaxter i didn't try and find out the code but simply putting a breakpoint in the class with before and after upgrade showed that the default values are picked up afterwards  i suppose it won't be terribly difficult to create a project to demonstrate this issue  do you've any integration tests that test this feature 
i will check that right now 
class or whatever you call it in java  the offending string is my client uuid and that should be globally the same  so something like  globalclientoptions getid    
hi   great  thanks for taking this issue in account   for the first crash  it is complicated because the galaxy s5 is on lineageos 14 1  android 7 1 2     this is the only device with which i have this issue 
ok  well  looks like protocolsupport was the reason of that problem  i'll update if this appears again 
in the second example  i was expecting the "join lines" to be grayed out  because the result will introduce a syntax error  and we are talking about an ide who understands the syntax of the language  not a simple text editor that treats each line as "text"   i just checked pycharm  and it behaves like in the erlang case     which is funny      up to you to decide if the second case is expected behavior or a bug 
ok i pushed to my test project https   github com chongma test   choose test   gmap
 petebankhead in this particular case i am not attempting to use saved training objects from multiple images  these training points that i have saved are from this image but just during a different training session  therefore i do think this is a bug   i would like to be able to combine multiple training objects from different images in the future  is the best way to go about this the script you gave in https   github com qupath qupath issues 256  
i do not have console access  i am actually another plugin dev who the server owners contacted about this   it looks like the inventory clone isn't doing the trick  normal horses have a  horseinventory  object that has specific definitions for the saddle and armor slot  and these don't exist in the  inventory  object inherited from  livingentity   i know there is also a  llamainventory  that does the same thing  but all the other horse types  i haven't found a good way to access saddles  type casting the inventory won't do either   i haven't been super pleased with the 1 11 x apis from spigot for these reasons   
sorry for taking so long to answer  i was busy with uni this week   i tried removing some mods and as you say  i can see again the ore and all its uses in jei  the mod causing this is unidict 1 12 2 1 7  it was my fault not to notice this mod unifies several ores into one  thats why i couldn't see any uses for the uranium ore either  so ill just whitelist it  sorry for taking ur time for nothing and thanks for the mod

thanks for the fix  update it on our side and set it to autoupdate  basically that means as long as you don't make fundamental changes to project structure and keep tagging versions in the same scheme  everything should be fine   we use a straightforward text file for the build instructions  e g  see https   gitlab com fdroid fdroiddata blob head metadata de guerda matekarte txt   so just fork the repo  apply your changes  commit them and open a merge request   our server part at https   gitlab com fdroid fdroidserver  has some python script that help to check the syntax  look for updates  build the app and provide standard commit messages  if you don't want to use these tools  this is fine  too  just keep two things in mind if you do it by hand  first  use  git pull   rebase  to pull in changes from our master  that helps to keep our repo clean from "merge branch" messages  and second  prefix your commit message with the app name  like "matekarte  changed description "  that way we don't have to lookup the actually changed app files 
  updating forge did resolve the issue

after having some more time to test this  it does appear to be a number of boolean operators issue  not a number of queries issue  it was getting hung at a query  example  for about an hour  then it would hit a longer query that ksql could never get past    apurvam    there are no error messages  as i stated  i'm defining 'loading' as the "building ast" message  and ksql just stops printing anything  i never see the more common messages about rebalancing  etc as it executes the queries   i've created a minimal queries file that seems to exhibit this behavior 
do you have a test for the above case  if so  please close them both 
jose  thanks for looking in on this     i've created a branch https   github com edlunde dnastar biojava tree mmcif seqres that incorporates  1  the fix for the finding all chains in all models  and  2  disables the  replacegroupseqpos    method that causes mis numbering   a unit test for 2ksa is in the testdifficultmmciffiles java   the first listed residue asp in chain a  should be residue 2   this is correctly specified by the _atom_site records  but made incorrect by later changing again in  replacegroupseqpos      i think trying to renumber by the _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme is actually incorrect unnecessary here   take a look   the first change would fix the bug  1  only 
it happens some time i do not know how to repeat it

as i mentioned before a few times i am not going to use buildozer as i prefer to compile it myself  buildozer has few huge disadvantages which i also listed before    like i have to manually remove and install aimsicd which means all collected data will be lost    if you are going to use acra    that's exactly how it works  but you don't even get contact to a user so you cant ask them anything or respond  you just get a stacktrace    i had time to report other issues to other repositories  i gather crashlogs  when i have several log files i browse them and report issues    aimsicd compiled from development branch  i dont have any gapps on my phone  i use only nlp for location service instead google one  all other apps are from fdroid or manually compiled

great  this seems to have fixed it  dashchan never asked for storage permission on install  so you might want to look into that

have to correct myself  only two are archived due to woodwork  the others are residing so i was wrong  so just archived caches that are still shown on map  after killing c geo through task manager the disc icon from the one archived disappeared   so it is just that archived stay on map  is this expected   i wait for my dropbox to upload photos from yesterdays event and then i will provide screenshots   changed title 
of course  the android version is 6 0 1  stock rom    sony z2  last patch from march 2016  
on my emulator i am only doing fresh installations and there it works   the problem is that the column is also added in db scheme 16  with createsyncedfolderstable   so if you upgrade from 15 to 23  newest     16    add type column         23    add type column   same for wifi and charging column  
same behavior using com mysql jdbc driver and the latest version  5 1 26    extract from the pom xml  
i've had another issue very much related to this one  will try to find time today or tomorrow to write up the exact steps to reproduce   i think the processor order might be involved    stay tuned 
filename pattern   table _  timestamp      table _ timestamp   with our without the   sign  the file name is always the same  i try to export a json file  see this    grafik  https   user images githubusercontent com 6271057 36643999 d689c1ae 1a53 11e8 946a 5167ccf3b425 png   without the   sign  i get a json file on my desktop which is just fine and contains my data as expected

yes it does 👍  i made exactly the same change  but i figured the other places also need  update since it will fail if master changes and so on 
yeap  the jenkinsfile complains because it is expecting to find a boolean and it is getting a string  the thing is we can mitigate by casting but if we need to cast then it ain't transparent when using the plugin  do not get me wrong  you've done a hell of a job here developing it  it is just that after we updated our jenkins server to the latest lts the use case when we use your plugin is failing with github specifically  we've tested it in bitbucket and things work as a charm  so i am unsure why this is failing  my feeling is that if you do not cast to a string things should work   the gui  is just boilerplate for the real impact we are seeing    
 eivantsov  thanks a lot 
not sure about the xyz coordinates  i just know that its all in the same chunk  since i'm ocd about having everything be within the chunk and stuff  i use 2 altars instead now  each getting powered by 1 burner pylon  i'll check the coordinates later  coz it takes quite a bit for this modpack to launch on my laptop   oh and the 2nd pylon didnt burn fuel  it was just being idle 
it's actually a bit worse than the current build on f droid for my set of devices  unfortunately  it's getting stuck in with the buffering circle for about 15 seconds then plays like 4 5 and repeats    it displays 2 6m sec downstream continuously  no matter if playing or buffering  not sure if you can get something from that    vlc has issues  mx plays choppy with dropped frames  but displays buffering to be ahead  i'm a bit confused on why it's choppy then

sure  it was late yesterday   here is a minimal example   this snippet works  but when the cube monkey is loaded first the program crashes  due to looking for the animations in the previously loaded model's data  when i encountered it yesterday it even successfully loaded the data and produced wrong animations   with debugging it can be observed starting  here  https   github com jmonkeyengine jmonkeyengine blob master jme3 plugins src gltf java com jme3 scene plugins gltf gltfloader java#l785    here are the models   resources zip  https   github com jmonkeyengine jmonkeyengine files 2740333 resources zip  the cube is just a cube  the monkey is suzanne with 2 times subdivision applied  and the sway animation is a 2 bone armature affecting a cube  the models animations were created in the latest blender 2 80 beta version   also the error is on the current master branch  i don't know about v3 2 x 
this is just a logic thing in the sampler  not an sdk issue

there is no   pmd  file in the project folder   i fixed the error message problem but hit another   to fix the error message  i went into my pmd ruleset xml file and removed a custom rule   the custom rule is based on a java class i wrote   if i include the custom rule  then the pmd plugin throws a  classnotfoundexception    the pmd plugin does not have the class in the classpath   how do i add my custom class so that the pmd plugin can use it   i tried "select a working set   " on the property page but that did not seem to work

my modification take always the first result key word  "résultat"   so  2 solutions    take local  replace list  resultcolumnnames getauthorizednames    by a map  "fr"  "résultat" and "en"  "result"  and use get element by key  with local variable     just switch "result" and "résultat" and use always "result"  always "en" by default in sql    what do you think about it

i didn't disable anything from evilcraft   i have a mod that lets you change the vanilla ender chest into a color coded ender chest  but it changes nothing of the recipe  and is done by shift right clicking with an item on the chest   i think i have no mod  which changes potions  but i'm not 100  sure of that 
artifact does not exist  'build libs skyclaims 0 26 1 s7 0 snapshot 34 jar' in build #34  build id 34  buildtypeid skyclaims_build 
 tsmaeder what i mean with "builtins" is the vs code built in extensions as of this  https   github com eclipse che issues 14759   ibuziuk what i mean is that there is more complexity to the theia api and builtin extensions so users may encounter known issues with builtins while trying to add a  vsix extension to the plugin registry   in the case of html language features  which is a built in required by the vuejs extension  it was enough just by adding the html language features vsix prior to the loading of the vuejs extension but there may be cases in which built ins conflict with each other or  vsix versions of the ms vscode builtins are outdated   so this represents a blocker for a user trying to just make a sidecar container  and maybe a cli one too   and some extension's meta yaml to add a ms vscode extension to che  in this case maybe it would be nice to have p1 on this case to get help from che devs around it so users can continue their work

indeed  macos 10 14 4 maven 3 6 0 jdk 11 0 1 2018 10 26 i cloned into an empty directory and didn't change anything in the project 
i have tried it with blank  java  java mysql  c++ and custom stacks  i did not change the default settings for the blank  java  java mysql  c++ stacks and i have allocated 4 gigs for the custom stack which bases on codenvy ubuntu_jdk8 image with some minor changes  it happens when a workspace starts  it runs for some time ok and interrupts immediately after the last line of output you see on the screenshot occures 
i download the zip file and simply trying to build the code   mvn clean install  dskiptests giving me above error  if i simply clone the project  then it doesn't give me any build error   with the  zip project  how to fix the error  
i would suggest to write a test  i know that this causes additional effort for people who want to contribute  but we will not get a stable sample application otherwise  which can be already observed quite good 
sadly  no   i've been unable to reproduce  and lost the failing test result     in any event  the failure was that there were fewer job requests than expected   probably the change you just made will fix the problem   i'll close this  and re open if i see failures again

where a query has a colon in it  solr is detecting it as a field and returning an error  the ratings file entry would look like this      and the error looks like this     error  caught solr exception    error from server at http   solr location 8983 solr  undefined field wonderings   in our case searches with colons are most likely because that's a document title in our data  it's not clear to me that we should necessarily remove punctuation altogether  as we may at some point have to deal with citations  which can have a wide range of punctuation in them   while we can do some work to escape punctuation in our rated queries  i was wondering if it would be appropriate to do this escaping in rre instead  perhaps controlled by a command line flag or a line in the pom file

yes  i've made some basic queries and i didn't notice anything odd  it also works with any class extending e 
which means that the test is totally broken now     i would consider to fix it asap   and yes  it would be good to add some regression logic to the test as well  but may be it should be a different ticket 

  config   
in my case the filechooser is still responsive and i have no direct gui problem with it   but we would like to keep the processor usage low for other things    the java version is 1 6 0_26 b03
speed  i have it on 0 5

hmm  i disagree it's working as intended  first of all the  app elevation  property is there  there is also code around it  that tries to set the elevation   it doesn't work   i've just done quick research about that and found this https   github com material components material components android issues 652  which is also an indication that something is wrong here   my point here is  there is no clear documentation around  app elevation  and  android elevation   i had to spend some time investigating why there is no elevation there  wanted to highlight this to people working on the library and maybe make someone else's life easier in the future

 joeygrover   sure  steps are basic rpc communication  our automation test suite sends rpcs and performs some actions on headunit like button presses  app startup transition which would trigger some  onhmistatus  updates as well  but i am fairly confident that this issue would be visible even without any hmi action    important step to reproduce this issue is to prolong app rpcs request response  usage to about 2 3 hours with a mix of rpcs    this issue does have an occurrence of about 5 10   and occurs randomly  so i understand that it can be a little tricky to identify the issue  but we can run the tests as per specific steps which might help isolate the issue for you  do you have any recommendations on that

i don't think it's a matter of 2d vs 3d  if you have a game where you control the player or something else  with the mouse  e g  moba or strategy game controls  not clamping the mouse can often times result in unwanted behavior  especially in full screen mode  i agree though  that maybe this shouldn't be the default

my question is should the behavior from the gif be happening  i clearly clicked on save and the flow wasn't saved  in my point of view that flow should return 200 and empty string   what's happening is that i am expecting 200 and empty string to be returned  what i get is 500 and no response

only on the cauldron server  sorry for the late reply  worldedit is a plugin i use  in single player i have no problems or issues at all cause i use forge  i don't know if you will be providing support for plugins  but i thought it was worth mentioning since a lot of people use cauldron  also on the server i have found no issues with this mod  i'll do more testing with it if i can even removing all the other plugins to make sure exactly which one it is 
no it actually continues to run  it has a swing gui and everything else works fine  it just doesn't listen for keys from the hook  i have an error dialog that pops up on a nativeexception  sometimes it pops up and sometimes it doesn't but the bug is always there until i restart the os 
 paris i don't remember anymore  it has been a week since i pushed that  i will just remove it and try again i guess

i've tried with both 8 0 and 8 1  i have no idea if it used to work as it's the first time trying syncany   in the owncloud log  i get an exception about missing auth headers  but that's probably a side effect of the exception on the client side   regarding the dh parameters  i have been using those for years and i think i've been using the owncloud client since owncloud 6  i know java is quite picky about what it can accept as dh parameters  but i guess i've never needed to connect any java app to this server before

jesse   i don't want to drop the table   geonetwork does in its database init method  dblib java    we could change all that in 2 12 x but probably not in 2 10 x   in any case it's probably safer for geonetwork to remove the table rather than assume that a table with that name has the structure it expects    that aside  the problem seems to be caused by earlier code in jeevesengine which opens a database channel  originally to test the db connection  which is now also being used to select stuff from the services table but which is never closed  this seems to hang the drop table call made later by geonetwork dblib when initializing the database  closing that test channel in jeevesengine fixes the problem and releases a channel  probably better for resource usage   i'm just making sure that this has no other implications before committing the fix   cheers  simon       from  jesse eichar  notifications github com  sent  monday  10 february 2014 9 13 pm to  geonetwork core geonetwork cc  pigot  simon  cmar  hobart  subject  re   core geonetwork  postgres database loading hangs webapp when trying to drop services and serviceparameters table  #387   why do you want to drop table  shouldn't you simply delete the records   — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com geonetwork core geonetwork issues 387#issuecomment 34615961

that sounds like a great suggestion  wasn't aware of that hook in the statement builder  one thing i'm not sure about is dbmigrate appears to always wrap beforemigrate in a transactiontemplate  unless that were changed to follow the same transaction detection  likely wouldn't fix this particular case   somewhat related  the transaction treatment of beforemigrate vs e g  beforeeachmigrate is different  this is understandable based on their scope  but initially unexpected   i think your suggestion would work as is for beforeeachmigrate because it is called within the domigrategroup   method 
let me describe it like this  expected behaviour is     1  client sends put with header "expect  100 continue"   2  server reads header and checks if the header is ok   3  server sends http response  100  to the client    4  client sends the body of the put request    5  server sends 200 code to the client  actual behaviour is    1  client sends put with header "expect  100 continue"   2  server reads header   and   body    3  server is waiting for the body   4  client is waiting for the code  100  doesn't send the body   5  connection closed by timeout   but if you want i can try to come up with a minimal test

no  extension point is not needed  we can start debug session by just configuring appropriate launch config  that does not require any dependency between plugins and extension points  so in eclipse nodejs core there will be a single "configurer" for each type of debug session  those configurers will turn on  if installation has appropriate launch config type and will display in the ui    what happens right now  is that for each project a new tern server is started  the same will happen if debug mode is on  but all of those servers will start in debug mode

i mainly started thinking about it because i had a lot of cells of data that contained the string "n a"  so i just transformed all of them with  value replace "n a"  ""    now i realize i could have used  null  instead of  ""   but i guess for my end location  any postgresql compatible db  it won't make much of a difference for the data analysis workloads i'll do   i also noticed when i delete a column all the cells get set to null when the option to view null is enabled   i guess i just wondered why there was a distinction  but i guess it makes sense in the context of an sql db  or even for example  what value to store for a blank cell in a numeric column   i think it is the type of small distinction that it is important to mention  even if it is just to say  "it doesn't really matter which one you use " because now i've spent a while thinking  _oh no  which one is better more idiomatic  etc etc   _  i haven't tried doing the sql export yet so i haven't hit any problems but i'll keep you updated  also  i'm glad + excited to hear about new plans for records mode

i am using the zotero addon for firefox  not the standalone version  i have zotfile setup to move all new attachments to a folder in my spideroak from the default zotero location  the steps to reproduce are launching firefox  navigating to a journal article with a pdf that i would like to save  and press the 'save to zotero' icon in the browser toolbar   i tried it more extensively now and notice that the error persists for all articles i download  until i open the zotero pane and right click    manage attachments    rename attachments  this works without error messages and  curiously  makes zotfile work automatically with all subsequently downloaded articles  so after i have done the manual renaming once  i can use the zotero toolbar button to download article pdfs and zotfile will automatically rename them   i do use noscript and some other addons  not sure if that would interfere somehow

yes  the issue in the mailing list reported by stephen wong has probably the same root cause   there  they have a restricted proxy where domain names have to be configured explicitely  in our case  the server running pushy is restricted of external dns lookup   the common problem is  that the pushy mechanism  pushy or netty  i didn't have a closer look so far  does a dns lookup upfront and sends the ip address to the proxy instead of sending the host name to the proxy and let the proxy resolve the name

 niqo01 can you reproduce locally or are you getting this through crashlytics bugsnag etc   
i am trying to set the value via the "polling period" entry box in the "device configuration" section when viewing the thing in habmin  it lists 1800  i assume that is the default   i enter any other number  click save  and this error shows up in the log 
thanks to you  indeed that line helped  although i had to find out first  that the order of these lines seem to be important  got still a lot to learn about gradle

i don't know whether it will be better or even possible if we are talking about codding  but i think it would be correct if blue crystals would only drops from mature plants  because this is the only way we "create" something new  so  maybe  it will be even easier to implement

the plugin is 0 0 20  it doesn't seem to trigger on load  but it does trigger quite a few times  my last editing session had 6 triggers between start and clear of the error   either way  a decision was made to refactor to a json model instead of yaml  for other reasons  so the problem hasn't reoccurred 
hi luca  thanks for the response  i just tried the snapshot version  on my machine it works just like the beta   i haven't been able to reproduce the stack trace from the opening post in my development environment  it seems that the error only occurs after prolonged use   lifetime of the process  which causes problems for us in production  unfortunately i don't think that i can convince my team to deploy a snapshot version of a library on a production server    the stack trace is all i can offer for now  sadly  sorry about that   we are reverting to 2 1 9 for the time being 
yeah  i instantly deleted my derpy msg  i just woke up  head wasn't turned on   i moved the test up to 1 5 1 with the latest build 23  unless the fix was only applied to the 1 4 7 release   but in 1 5 1  there is no change with allowedits or perms   still have to allow fe p overrideprotection  but it only works when applied to a specific user  not the group they are in   and the same thing occurs with placing blocks as in my video   i wonder if there's something about the priorities i'm missing  because i haven't touched them  are they required to make this work   i'll test 1 4 7 now  back soon

i can't  because it was an immediate situation  so  i changed the iap package  now there are no crashes in +3k users  but  thank you  i will try it in my next project 
single player   there isn't a crash so i'm not sure what part of the logs you want to see  i don't see any mention of mana batteries or prisms or the power cache you mentioned in #741 in there  what are we looking for   there is a am2powerdata folder  it has sub folders for dimension 0   1  7  and  31   1 and 7 are empty  0 has files for chunks near the origin  though these are all empty  the one for dimension  31 has a single file corresponding with the region where my base is  though my base is in dimension 0   the one in dimension  31 is 36kb in size  and seems to have references to many  many nodes in it  though there are only a few anywhere in my world  and i don't really know how to parse the file here  
i just worked with codecov for the first time myself  according to the docs   codecov  on a travis ci server should work  don't forget to get another token for this repo after you changed the command

 miethanerr is this correct  is it no longer compatible with previous versions  so we cannot use existing services

i didn't know that  thank you for clarification  but my following lines of code still work fine  so it's look like the rightclick events are correctly detected  only the event cancelling doesn't work     however it was working fine with the dev20b  just before i update to the dev22f    in this example  the player always receives the message and the five dirts  however the cancelling doesn't fail occasionally but on each try

i believe all 3 cards are set to the height of the longest card  so what we're seeing here is cards where the resources card is longest  which varies by chunk  and therefore the space below source or translation will vary accordingly   if that is the case  that's fine for now  i guess this will be best we can do  as either the card must extend or the gap between cards is extends     i'm working on the resources layout some more  so will look at this again after that  
it's definitely a regression  can't say exactly when it started happening  but it's been at least 2 or 3 months

 jmakeig and  clockworked247  thanks for the comments   if i've worked long and hard to create a mapping definition in quickstart  that definition's representation in the ui should not break if a user deletes updates adds documents in staging   i like the idea of highlighting properties that the ui can no longer find   and that can happen currently if a user adds or deletes documents in staging   i also think the user should also see the type and value information that was there before  the ui can't show this information with the current data model when the property is gone

 h3xstream  in some cases we will not have compiled classes available for java files  in this case we does not want to fail the sonar analysis and continue with the warning message from findbugs 
i honestly have no idea  because i don't have any other mods installed that have different dimensions 
the call is just "mvn sonar sonar"  but we have some magic in our parent pom which sets the sonar branch name if git_local_branch is available  but as this is not set in my local test environment there should be no sonar branch name at all  the nullpointer source line indicates that the branch is null  which matches this

hi  i tried it again  the newest version on bapp store    i can confirm  that if the reflection happens   only   in the header  no issue is raised   as expected    when i scan request which has multiple reflection  the first and only highlighted occurrence is the one in the response header  is it possible  that this highlight would not be present  as it should be excluded  also  since there is only a single highlight in such a case  i would automatically miss all the other reflections   other 3 reflections in the body  only when i manually search the value can i see there are 4 matches  1 header + 3 body   is this something which could be fixed as well 
i called 'wallet encrypt' and then called 'wallet decrypt' again  and when you call the 'currentreceivekey' function 'deterministickey' which is the key value of 'keypurpose receive_funds' in 'currentkeys' which is a member variable of 'keychaingroup' is found  and 'deterministickey' value is known as 'privkey' is null   after 'decryprt'  the data of 'currentkeys' which is a member variable of 'keychaingrouo' is not updated 
sorry for the late response  this was tested with forge 1969 and bq 126  i'll confirm that it's still a problem  and if so  get back to you 
no   that does not match my case   maybe i was a little unclear  network  internet  so disable all internet connection leads to the problem   follow the steps above and tell me if you can reproduce this   by the way  the non available location should be avoided if you switch on coarse location on your device

hi    the requests which takes 30 ms was taking 6000ms  all i did was run 10 threads for 1 hour running about 18 000+ requests  the database had only 10 000 nodes so it not expected to behave that way at all  even worse  the response time stayed at 4000 + ms even after i stopped the loadtest  i had to restart the db and it went back to 30ms like before  so the memory was definitely not being collected   this is really unacceptable as you can see  we are very unlikely to restart production db    sajid   on mon  aug 31  2015 at 8 27 pm  tglman notifications github com wrote

in the worst case we need to define two comparators  for example      hashmap set     no comparators required    linkedhashmap sortedset     it is necessary to determine values comparator    treemap seq     it is necessary to determine keys comparator    treemap sortedset     it is necessary to determine both comparators
yes  tfc requires two ingots to make a single sheet  2 sheets are welded together to make a double sheet  the single sheet is not a large issue  as ie makes its own versions of those sheets  which cannot be melted down  thus avoiding the dupe bug  double sheets  however  are tfc  and can be melted for 4 ingots
after more thorough investigation it was determined that jetty wasn't the cause of the issue so i'm closing it 
 tvernum in the meantime  i would strongly urge you to document that you can't create api keys with other api keys to prevent anyone else from also wasting a day debugging this    ## my use case  we have many environments all writing to a centralized cluster  production sites feed into a production index  staging sites feed into a staging index  etc  originally  the script i wrote to manage this used one machine user that is accessed via an api key to create api keys  run_as  other users that have the set of permissions that we want each api key to have  after i ran into issues with that  i started to generate api keys for each of the intermediary users directly  rather than with requests  run_as  those users  so that they could then generate api keys with the necessary roles   so for example  if a staging site needs api credentials to be able to write to the index  then the  indexer staging  user that has the necessary privileges will create an api key that can be given to the staging site   i prefer the method of accessing everything with api keys because it allows for easy and frequent rotation of api keys  in fact  the base machine user is _only_ accessible via api key  because it is created with a  password_hash  that's purposely corrupted  i e  taking a hash like   2y 04 c6xlqlggrui o8if98urvoevblmurskqoysml9coxc7s w9n8 f8y  and replacing a bunch of characters with zeros like   2y 04 c6xlqlggrui o8if0000000000000000oysml9coxc7s w9n8 f8y   to essentially disable password login for that user   however  in my particular use case  the base machine user and the intermediary users are only ever used from the server that's running elasticsearch itself  so i can just switch those to use passwords in the meantime   ## my ideal solution  i have two thoughts about how api keys should be implemented   ### machine users  the first is that there should be a type of user specifically for system machine users  i initially use the  elastic  account to create the  machine_user_owner  account  with the corrupted password hash to make direct login impossible   and then i use the  elastic  credentials to run as the machine user to generate an api key    it would be nice if i could create a user that didn't have the option for password login at all    and that the only way to use that user is to access it via api generated by another user running as that machine user   ### permissions model  the second is that an api key should be _continually_ associated with a user  that is  rather than an api key having a point in time snapshot of the authenticated user's permissions  each api key should have the permissions that are the intersection of the authenticated user's permissions and any  role_descriptors    let's say i create three roles     this api key would be limited to the intersection of the user's privileges and the  role_descriptors   so it would only have index privileges  because it was specified as having no cluster privileges       https   user images githubusercontent com 542937 74367082 40c4ce80 4d9f 11ea 8dee b9cc21888c01 png    then  if i remove the  index_manager  and  cluster_manager  roles from  test_user_2  at a point in the future  the  index privileges key  should also lose its ability to write to indices  resulting in the permissions of       https   user images githubusercontent com 542937 74367320 a5802900 4d9f 11ea 9267 6dca6e9efce1 png   #### keys created with keys  and of course  we can't forget about the original issue of keys created with keys  in this case  i think that the permissions of keys created with keys should reflect the intersection of   creator's privileges at any given time    role_descriptors  defined when creating the first key    role_descriptors  defined when creating the second key  thus  even if the creator is the superadmin  if the first key is created with _no_ cluster permissions aside from  manage_own_api_key   then no child api key will ever be able to have cluster permissions

last time i tried it  the cause and context weren’t filled with the same things  some of which was required 
the thing being called is a tdi fun which writes a file  it does complete waiting before exiting does not help  the behavior is seen if the client  doing the dispatch on the node  is tcl  tree tcl  or node dispatch       the behavior is always fine if the dispatching program stays running 
if you mean an in memory map  then that associated would disappear between overture runs  if the test sequence was held in the results xml  then as long as the results were preserved on file  the individual tests would be re runnable  or we could just use a separate serialised file  as you say  but when would you save it

i know okhttp 4 has been rewritten in kotlin  so not sure what to suggest here   personally  i would like okhttp classes that are apis  such as  headers   to explicitly not have kotlin classes in method signatures  class inheritance  type parameters  etc  that would ensure maximum usability from java 11 + jpms  as the only dependencies an application would need to require in  module info java  would be java only ones   i don't think it's a kotlin issue as they need to remain java 6 compatible and such  so for kotlin jpms modules are far far away   however  removing  implements iterable kotlin pair   may be an incompatible change  so i raised this issue just as a heads up  as there is an easy workaround to iterate over  headers    trying to iterate over  headers  using  iterable  would not even compile with java 11 + jpms  so it's a hard error  but as i said easily workaroundable with a small code change  i only found this example in my usage of okhttp  but it may be possible that there are other cases where there is no work around 
i don't think so unless you have changed anything  it was java language  clean sonar without additional plugins  docker version with h2 database migrated into container

hrm  yes other zipkin issues are also addressed in finchley  span naming for example   my issue though is that there is a significant version jump to go to finchley  2 0 0 m5 is the latest version    which isn't even final anyways    what would be your recommendation in this scenario 
unfortunately it's part of a large code base with significant dependencies   also  it doesn't fail when run on its own  i have to run some number of other tests first  ugh   although the database is cleared before each test using  match  n  optional match  n   r     delete n r    this isn't terribly surprising since it is a concurrency issue  but it is a bit of a nuisance for debugging   my understanding of the locking in cypher is that locks should only be released at the end of the transaction  not in between queries   is there any condition in 2 2 where locks would be released early   that seems to be what is happening  if you have no idea how it could happen  i could try to reproduce it in a minimal test case  but it could take a while

oh sh t  _   i'm sorry      so  why does the logs show a default persistence unit   building jpa container entitymanagerfactory for persistence unit 'default'   why don't we have  ordersds  or  customerds  depending on the entitymanager we are working with  
no i did check disk space was fine   we added monitoring to detect this so the next time that happens i'll run a jstack 
i am afraid  with  java debug settings console  set to  integratedterminal   the previous incorrect behavior still exists  in a different form     i was not expecting the above to be printed out 
1  yes and no  the form on my page will always crash  but at different spots  2  pixel  1st gen  8 0  3  i haven't tried reproducing it in another app yet   it seems like the issue is coming from the auto fill service added in android 8 0  when auto fill is turned on the app will crash  when auto fill is turned off i can complete the form with no issue  as mentioned previously it seems like it only happens with the 8 0 auto fill  so something in the newer versions of android is probably fixed with it   is there anyway to disable the auto fill service in a cordova app  or is this issue not related   cant be fixed via cordova   related   https   stackoverflow com questions 45731372 disabling android o auto fill service for an application 46698028

would it not be possible to simply add +1 range to the check  to include the immediate surrounding blocks  i'm still learning basics of coding so feel free to ignore my suggestion 
 parrt same issue     which is especially strange because  as you can see from the output  i built it with version  1 6 0_35   so it looks like for whatever reason my build is bypassing the bootstrap

currently  first request returns 200 ok  response from httpbin  and second request returns 500  default spring boot whitelabel error page 
not that i am aware of  unless the plugin routinely reloads itself internally  the error seems to be spontaneous  a few seconds before the error occurred  someone used the command  spawn 
the issue is solved

using the existing fork would be fine  a new branch with a unique name would allow multiple iterations which usually will happen if the app is actively developed  maybe you can simply number them 1  2  3 or add a date string  so they are easier to distinguish put in order 
we have a  resttemplate  correctly configured for the app and want to use the other benefits of  testresttemplate  in tests   i expect mutation methods  such as  addauthentication   to change it  but not a constructor   if  resttemplate  was immutable  the constructor couldn't alter it   with accepting only  resttemplatebuilder  instances  will it set objects on the builder only when null or the default  or always   we need ability to specify something and not have it replaced  an unexpected replacement consumes time determining why something isn't working    since  resttemplate  is mutable  a current workaround is to set it again afterwards

i have the widget on my home screen  sometime it needs to be re added because it is no longer there 
 thomaspohl   the line causing the issue is the second line as below 
photos likely won't help but i will provide more detail to better explain the issue   query produced integer fields displayed in data editors  by default  appear as "grouped"  e g "1000" is displayed as "1 000"  there is a checkbox option in preferences  data editor  data formats preference panel titled "use grouping" that toggles between displaying the comma or not   if a data editor is already displaying an integer  and the checkbox state is changed  even if the change is "applied"  the current data editor integer display will not be changed to respect the new "use grouping" setting  this means that if the editor is displaying "1 000"  and the checkbox is cleared in the preference  the editor will continue to display "1 000"  to effect the change  the editor must be closed and reopened  and then the effect will take place  and the integer will now be displayed as "1000"   i hope that provides enough detail

the dependency is somewhat hidden to the scr because the abstractregistry registers a servicetracker instead of properly declaring a dependency  probably to circumvent such cycles   which worked in equinox ds most of the time as a "workaround"  so maybe it doesn't anymore since the equinox upgrade  which is now using felix scr   but i'm just guessing wildly  in fact i was surprised by it too   in any case  it's true and it hurts

thanks for the quick reply      woops  turns out  all the changed i made actually do work  the problem seems to be with jei  as it still shows no change at all  removing adding machine recipes isn't recognized by jei  despite getting registered with the specific machine  that leaves the question open  on what mod's end the mistake lies  maybe rt has to update the recipe in question in jei

intended  on circles  the circle is totally faded including with the number when it reaches the start of 300 range and the note doesn't expand when clicked  only the score  300  100  50  geki  katu  shows up  on sliders  the number fades while the entire slider body remains shows up at the same timeframe as the circle   actual case  circles fade completely when the note hits the end possible range of 300  and if "show perfect hits" is enabled  the note will just dissappear when clicked and if it is enabled  the note will expand when clicked and displays the score  same case on sliders when the number fades at the same time period of 300

as suggested for retrofit 2 i am working with an interceptor to change the url at runtime  there was something wrong with the interceptor and it dropped it's scheme   in case any1 is interested in the interceptor 
nope  not seeing this particular issue anymore  i'll re open if i do and try to get better repro conditions 
 javiersantos  it will take some time but i will test  i'll let you know as soon as possible 
oh   didnt added the test anywhere  why i pasted the code   was a sample locally  if that's too boring complicated to recreate it for you i'll do it this evening

sorry  i wasn't present for the bug  just saw it in my server logs after the fact  i'll go hunting for the exact item 
 jotschi we were in standalone mode  no cluster  but restore occured when getmesh was heavy loaded  40 req   s average   after a restart it returns working properly without lock  only certains type of schema were locked  i created a new schema and new node and it worked fine  all get queries were ok  only some update queries returned errors due to orientdb lock  perhaps because not all orientdb files were locked    another thing  during the restore  i saw some errors logs about orientdb was locked too  mesh cli returned status 504 too   but in the end restore was effective  we manually checked that modified nodes during the current day were restored to precedent version    hope that pr about restoring older node version will become effective soon   
oops    i meant client session  signed cookie    initiated by  cookiesession      config 
 timer only happened once and it was solved by restarting the client 
okay so we've rolled out the updated version onto the server  and all the things i _was_ losing   are now found   trouble is now other things are being lost periodically   at present i will occasionally search for "copper" and see 3 types of copper ingots  as in    from 3 different mods  in my system despite the fact that i know i only have 1 type in my system  so i pull out the 2nd and 3rd ones with smaller amounts and once on my cursor they magically transform into say   copper wiring  or copper plates   if i put these items back into the system   they transform back into copper ingots from other mods again  really strange   please let me know if you need anymore testing  i would love to give you a map download so you could test it but unfortunately i don't have access to do that  i can do testing however

my friend did not crash  he disconnected meaning there was no crash report to post for the bug report  disconnections will take you off the server and bring you back to the home page  disconnecting does not provide crash logs 
it doesn't happen with schematics  i must've not written the title correctly at 4 am  xd i meant that some blocks have a chance to tesselate  for example i crash instantly when joining a server because one of the stairs stone bricks tesselates  sometimes from someone placing a block  it tesselates  but personally i never saw it happen from me placing a block nor schematics

nodes should be self contained   lustre does not have a concept of "global" variables   in this case  the node foo   refers to a variable outside of its scope   when we translate into jkind  this triggers an error because the node foo   is translated as a separate node from the "main" node that contains the definitions for system a and system implementation a impl

 olgakup somehow i missed the first comment  sorry    yeah you finally changed what i was referring to  so +100 to you    for the number of pending txs history event i remember we said that we're not going to implement it  at least yet  mostly because when we are syncing the number is always 0  in any case it should be a live event and instead of showcasing a graph just only a number  but i suggest to move this to m2  
well i dont know much about the key modifiers used in windows ubuntu  but the whole seemed quite consistent for me on mac  now  i barely use the arrow keys    of course we need to rationalize them  so that the same modifiers have the same effect on both mouse and arrows    no problem for me  if it is documented  to remove the menu for switching between rotate translate with the mouse   the roi is quite ugly at the moment  but potentially very useful  i will probably open a whole new issue  or we stay on this one   it works like in the movie below  i think this possibility to have a way to draw an area  in 2d or maybe 3d     to measure its size  and to select a whole set of agents is really interesting    now  its limitations are mainly that it only works in 2d  having the same in 3d would be awesome  but clearly too much work  not on the opengl side  but on the logic side of the display of agents  we dont record in opengl where each agent is drawn and so the roi bases its calculation on the shape of the agents  which is not always true      screencast 2016 04 02 12 58 15  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 579256 14224808 92fa1acc f8d3 11e5 99a4 340889e74b1f gif 
if someone has physical access to your device  the entire directory structure of all connected ownclouds will leak through the upload pane  also  if #674 lands  filenames will leak too  this is why i called it a "security risk"   i should point out that dropbox does this with their upload pane

i have researched a bit further on this  and  it seems to have to do with   windows vista   onward   user account control   and windows protection mechanism for its   c  program   directory   if i start _dbeaver_ as i described in the support issue  with   mydata   directory in the   c  program  x86    directory then _dbeaver_ can't will not generate a   dbeaver debug log   file    this is a bit surprising since the    log   file is created without any fuss   if i instead ask _dbeaver_ to generate its configuration files in the   c  programdata   directory  then the   dbeaver debug log   file is created      ps    on   windows xp    or earlier  it is allowed to create and edit files in the   c  program   directory  so the   dbeaver debug log   file is created without any trouble     pps    with a bit of luck this might solve my support issue #3750  trouble to run repacked version of _dbeaver_  i will try it out when i get back to work  i'm currently on vacation

hi tyler    the idea behind this proof of concept is to build a graphic editor completely agnostic about languages it is processing  uml  bpmn  ecore  adl  jackson notation  flow charts        the piece of software implementing the editor would be the same for every possible language  and language specificities will be encapsulated in the specific object palette and in the language server that would process the diagrams  providing similar services to the ones that current language servers provide to text editors through language server protocol  current graphic tools already provide some of those services  but they have similar issues to the ones that made possible the inception of lsp  as a tight coupling between editors   languages    this aim can be achieved in two different ways  1  generating a text representation of the graphic diagram and using lsp as it is to process that text representation  the path chosen for the proof of concept  2  augment lsp to match requirements to process graphical models  maybe to be able to define a diagram as a list of svg objects with specific properties  this idea is in a very early stage   the usage i envision for a tool like this  is inside the "design studio" component that many high level tools  e g  a telecommunications operator management tool  need to allow users to build their processes  with an approach like this  it would be very easy to add new types of "process" to the tool  just adding an object palette and the language server to process that palette  i feel there is plenty of market for an idea like this  and i also think that che is the ideal platform for such a component   the idea of this query was to get some hints about how to use the code available in the provided languageserver editor in che to build the link between the javascript editor and the language server in the simplest and easiest way     thanks  best regards  alberto 
i fixed my code  i used this combination during debugging  still this should be fixed in future  pumppresort is parameter without action  similar to cache size   then i can choose or disable cahce  so i would expect that specified pumppresort without pumpsource will behave as empty source or without any action

i couldn't setup admin access at once  i used this online service  https   bcrypt generator com  it generated a hash  but it didn't work  i thought  it was because of "special" symbols  like       that's why i put the password in quotes  then i tried another online service  http   bcrypthashgenerator apphb com  it's hash worked  finally  i forgot to remove them   as soon as online generators are not reliable  and there is no way to access admin tools without having hashed password  would it be better    to have some standalone util for generating hashes for passwords    to let login to admin without a password  then you can generate hash using built in tool     to skip passwords hashing  and let users encrypt their passwords using master key   for me all this three "security" realted topics  "application secret" "password hashing with  bcrypt " "master password for values"  looked a little bit messy  or complex  when i read docs  probably  it could be a subject for simplification or more clear explanation

yes  it works perfectly without enum  it is not about class path  i have all classes  listenermethod is just another annotation   it's about synthetic methods in enum  this class doesn't compile at all  i would like to get listenermethod   method   default     and string remover   default ""  but without enum  because mistakes inside enum  can spoon help me with it  or he just says illegalargument and that's all

this appears to be a bug in querydsl jpa       apt hibernate one jar jar since i removed all dependencies to it and added references to the following individual jars   querydsl 3 2 3    and everything compiles correctly now
 ntherning not sure if the message was directed at me or  ashleyj there  but i don't really know why the bug is happening  if the problem is that we're trying to add everything on the classpath to the  classes1 jar   and that includes itself  you can take a look at the classpath and include only the files you're seeing right now i guess  or take a look at the files and their sizes  and if any of them changes while creating the jar  bail out   as an example  doing  zip test zip    r  doesn't show that behavior  so there are definitely things that can be done   if the issue is some other thing  then i don't know  smile    as i said  i don't think it's very concerning if this is the only case in which you get that behavior 
i am not sure  i believe it was a c demo     
isn't that basically what the current implementation is doing   thinking   i think  for these degenerate polygons  when using an algorithm intended for regular areas  you'll by definition end up with a point that can be  anywhere  since you're basically at some point dividinging zero by zero for the weighted average    i was wondering that as well  but as far as i know  me not being an expert in this field at all   when working with floating point numbers  the best one can do is to minimize such rounding truncation errors  e g  by using more clever  summation  https   en wikipedia org wiki kahan_summation_algorithm

i can reproduce it by changing these two lines in the example      note that my  outputtype  is  string  while the example uses  boolean  
no  it's not working with ipv6  what i'm going to do is  use ip address validator to remove out ipv6  only accept ipv4 for now  
i mis typed  i had this bug occur several times  figured out how to fix the units  did so  but attached a save with only one damaged unit when the bug recurred    gm editing the damage on the unit not appearing in the repair bay also causes it to reappear 
 samuelklee yes  setting the  gatk_local_jar  and or  gatk_spark_jar  environment variables will cause the gatk script to use that jar  instead of looking in its directory for a jar  the naming of the jar itself also doesn't matter if you use the environment variable method 
it's a custom one   here's the modlist  http   www modlister com user brisingraerowing 
 ywelsch thanks for looking at this    these are not master eligible nodes  there are 3 other master elegible nodes in the cluster  which don't store any data   while doing a rolling upgrade  the script processes all the master eligible nodes first and then moves to data nodes   all data nodes  the kind which show failure  have similar config to one given below    the master elgible nodes are  10 44 0 43 44 45  which don't show any failure     closed indices are mostly created on 7 x  for the latest issue  the indices mentioned in the logs above were created using 7 x
well this is quite peculiar  i set it back up the exact way it was before and no crash now  below is how it was set up though  not sure the difference between hooking it up today and hooking it up 3 days ago though  _shrug_  the connection with the transfer pipe was accidental and i didn't mean for it to connect but failed to see it when i first placed the transceiver down    image  https   f cloud github com assets 5308389 1323508 28664214 3484 11e3 84f4 d298d0565aa8 png

interesting  the cpu waste seems to be reduced  but there are still too much increase of  _seconds_count counter  before  with default settings  the increment was too high by factor of 5k  with your settings there is only 5

 andyscherzinger i uninstalled the app and removed the owncloud beta folder   yet getting the same error  
yes  but the same exception happens  we've noticed that this problem occurs only on that htc device   but there should be some validation so that app doesn't crash in that situation 
updated to 1 2 1256  it acts weirdly  sometimes it escapes the chars correctly  sometimes not        with  é  or  ö   it does not work    if i substitute the  é  with  œ   u+0153   it renders the html    if i substitute with a  ѩ   u+0469  or a  ｅ   u+ff45   it spins  then breaks 
maybe mresources return null but fresco is initialized in the oncreate function resource should not be empty

it seems to work perfectly now  great job  thank you for the quick fix    
hi  karldahlgren   i think i already attached them to the initial issue  but sure   i'm sending it to you once more  by the way don't you think it is better to leave the issue opened until it is fixed and confirmed to be fixed from the reporter and then close it   then we will avoid creating many issues linked to each other   regards  milko  creditsafe_wsdl_local zip  https   github com castlemock castlemock files 2476669 creditsafe_wsdl_local zip 
because this has been a recent change in this release  what we are going to do in this version is allow users write   password without raising an exception  however  if that's the case we will print a warning message saying that they should not do it and that it will be forbidden in future releases   regarding adding   password automatically to the other command lines  that will be probably added in a future release 
correct  if it is less than 8 chars then account validation function gets confused  as long as it is equal to 8 chars it is fine  it does not even needs to be posix compliant   though having it as posix compliant would help in case of integrating it with an ldap server or federated authentication in future

the behavior is a little less wacky  but you can still type past the character limit

very possible  if your headset doesn't actively check to see which of the active streams are actually playing stuff and instead just takes the first available stream  it would likely lock itself into newpipe's dead stream until you tell it to change

hum just thinking out loud  talking about web api services used in combination with web api contract  it would be best invisible to developer how data is transferred over the event bus  it might be jsonobejct or directly to a string or an integer  it is important that it  can  be transferred over eventbus  and  that it matches expecting return type defined in contract  here openapi spec   so it must not be always json  right

i've sent a full bug report to dev exoplayer gmail com i could also see the issue in a nexus 6 with 7 1  but only once  haven't been able to reproduce it anymore in such device  in a huawei p20 lite with pie seems to be more common   doing some test  if i delay the video playback to start around a couple of seconds after releasing the codec  then the problem doesn't seem to occur anymore  but  i can't confirm at all if placing such delay may be related or just pure chance  since the issue happens rarely and i need to perform several times the video encoding followed by the exoplayer playback before the error happens again 
yes  i did  this can be easily reproduced by applying  this patch  http   pastebin com 6h4nmz12  to the sample project  it basically sets flag_translucent_status and fitssystemwindows "true" in the main layout file  this will make the crouton appear  behind the status bar  http   i imgur com ymfkcg4 png  when it should appear below the action bar   the solution i suggested  by the way  won't fix it  i just tested it 
thanks for your answer james   i've got a front end web page containing a paging list of some resource  in which add and delete operation can be performed  add or delete operation will reload the current page  i'm considering how to design this  for example  when i'm in the 2nd page  delete all the resources in that page making the page empty  then i go to the 3rd  then turn back to the 2nd  the page is still empty  this is what i met  but it's not a matter now  i've got a plan to deal with it  your answer really helps me  tks   btw  a search data cleanup every 10s by hapi would lock the search tables frequently  any possibility this will result in a performance problem when it faces an influx of a large number of search requests

hi   i still dont know    as from the beggining  using the alternative player or the old one worked for me     according to google     my board is am805w with mali450 graphics https   androidtvbox eu x96 mini android tv box powered amlogic s905w chipset now 24 99 promo   so i never investigate on this  maybe i am wrong  i didn't found a resize feature  the video appears like a small windows  i am not in windows mode     without border on the center right side of a black screen  maybe you can guide me to send you debug logs  etc     i would be more than happy  but since the old player feature is going to disappear  maybe juste allowing playlist to be all played with the alternative player would be a simple solution for those like me     i can't tell about how much people encounter that 'bug'     regards  fred
 serge rider well  it's starting just fine if i change the workspace  or the data_path   my issue is   how to migrate settings from my previous workspace  and also  even if i start on a fresh workspace or data_path  it seems to get corrupted anyway  i haven't tried since last time  it's really annoying to add manually the connections and see they all got lots with no way to retrieve them   how can i export import these settings so i can easily add a couple of connections  save them somewhere in case my workspace get corrupted again 
well behavior is the same for string  integer double  array has size 10   in this case it was string but i'm testing it with integers  i believe it might be a problem with resolution of source field    unexpected exception is thrown while reading source field  null  
ah right  i can pull a released jar   thanks  i'll use that   anyway  here's the full stack trace    error  failed to execute goal org apache maven plugins maven surefire plugin 2 20 1 test  default

i think he maybe closed this as i accidentally submitted instead of putting "enter" when just entering the ticket initially    so it was no where near complete  but probably left it closed since it's technically a duplicate of #104  not at all the same behavior    but i guess the same error   that one is closed as he keeps thinking he's fixed it 
like you described  banners banners   tvdb getbanners "73739"   but there are only methods for getposterlist   and getfanartlist   expected something like getbannerlist   or something to get the banner images
 adejanovski great news  that def  fixed the cassandra storage   exception stuff s

submitted the pull request from a different fork  was not able to create a branch on current repository

 mfussenegger thanks for your quick response   i just tried the refresh command and it didn't work  i test this with multiple node  let me setup a single node cluster and try this again  will get back to you later   best regards  ryan

i think that including a low res icon to be used on older phones sounds like an easy solution   the problem is  how to have a single apk that uses raster on old api and vector on new api   i need to do research to see how to do it or if it's possible   using vectordrawablecompat would also require research  because my earlier conclusion was that it might not work the same for _launch_ icons  as opposed to icons within the application    so  yeah  digging is required 
yeah sure  just one moment 
sorry  wasn't able to be online to use that link in time 
yes  you can still wear it  the model is fine  but it has the purple black texture  not sure which log is the one that you need  so i'll attach both   debug log  https   github com itsmeow betteranimalsplus files 3464156 debug log   latest log  https   github com itsmeow betteranimalsplus files 3464157 latest log 
the content pack is wwii  the vehicle is su 1 12  this is the line  the date was may 3 2019   and i'll keep it in mind for the future to report bugs separately  in terms of the crash  again  it wasn't i who caught it  my staff reported it to me  i'll eventually go back to check the logs and find the error when it happened and paste it in full  using the teams command to set despawn timer to 0  never  fixed the issue 
oh i see  i assumed it was a multi threading bug  good to know it was intentional  thanks   
i'm using 1 9 3 on the standard launcher at the moment  i'll try updating the mod to see if that fixes it 
sorry about not specifying the version  just updated the post the random   at the end is a mistake after using markdown   also removed 
thanks  i've made a local build of the latest master and the npe no longer occurs     
well  since i don't have any particular way i know to reproduce this  let's just close it  thanks 
no  just on my laptop  but i am running windows 10 on mac via bootcamp  it is my primary os  ios exists only for hardware drivers and i never boot into it   perhaps this is messing with it   i can try today on a true windows pc and get back to you     thanks 
hi jonathan   with these two files you should be able to reproduce the problem  take a look at the last chunk of code in the rmd file   thanks   michael
good morning all  i there some progress on this issue  kindly help  thanks
ok  apologies for being vague  in order to invoke the issue  in my pom i specify   gwtquery 1 4 3 snapshot enhance plugin 1 0 5  the issue is that when i drag an element  in ios i just see rettt in the console many times  this console message is generated in com google gwt query client plugins events eventslistener  in it's onbrowserevent   method   i tried it on my nexus 7 and no issue  but on my old ipad ios 8 1 1  the drag doesn't work  and when i attach the ipad to my imac  i see the rettt in the console        what is quite interesting is that this issue even shows up when i test in sdm mode in chrome with touch emulation enabled  when i select nexus 7 emulation  no problem  but if i select iphone6 or ipad 1 2  i have the issue   so is it related to my  gwt xml    here's my gwt xml     xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"    module rename to "gwt_module"       module

hi thomas  sure  just give me some time  i'm not very familiar with code contribution  aurélien
i suggest we relocate the logic of "complementing" the mapped software units to validate  this allows both validate and graphics you function normally without being to spent time on creating new code  since it is already built  we just need to relocate it 
i installed vs code and the language support fo java by red hat extension  i still don't get jdk javadoc when i hover   hovering on  string     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 7351168 56749055 9794e500 6746 11e9 90b9 5d38519f66f2 png   hovering on  system out println       image  https   user images githubusercontent com 7351168 56749395 42a59e80 6747 11e9 88e2 e5f7548cab40 png   output from  dpkg query  showing that the doc package is installed 
i will submit a unit test later 
i am sorry  i will elaborate a bit more  for context  i am currently building a framework for fuzzing libraries that evaluate xpath expressions   we found that jaxen behaved differently than the rest when evaluating   nonexistent  false      in the framework we pass a sample file  not important in this case  and the xpath   nonexistent  false    as args to the java program below  this then evaluates the xpath expression and return  false  in the aforementioned xpath expression  which is wrong   unfortunately  i currently do not have an example with a unit test 
1  i deploy openstack juno release by using mirantis  2  i download openstack4j master branch source code  then i compile the project and package the class file into jar with maven tools  3  i am using resteasy connector other than jersey 2   see the picture below   the lines i comment will raise the exception   at 2015 01 15 00 45 23  "jeremy unruh" notifications github com wrote   this is working for me during my tests  a couple things i'll need first   what version of openstack are you testing this with  what version of openstack4j are you using  are you using one of our connector options  ie  something other than the default of jersey 2  okhttp  httpclient  etc   thanks  ¡ª reply to this email directly or view it on github

thanks for suggestion on   debug   that showed we were pointing at two locations and one of these locations included some unwanted migration files   short term fix was to rm those files in build script and once we did that the "ignored" issue went away   longer term fix is to add a gradle property to pass in the   locations   not to worry about the u22__allow_null_ordroutinginfo sql as "missing" that file still needs to be added to our build artifacts   it's safe to close this ticket 
yeah  because i am using the default  collapsingtoolbarlayout  somewhere else in my appllication    no issue detected
 modwizcode yes  similar to what i would consider damage in the sense of a minecart  player punches which could possibly cause destruction of the object  except with armor stands  destruction is guarenteed  
it was a 4 person commander game i belive
no bouncer  yep only one message when i open the chat  it seems to always happen and i think they all come through immediately but i'm not positive 
 ns1123  hi  i still not to start worker or any setting for worker  i am trying to run master with this config and encounter this error  thanks 
logcat doesn't seem to have anything when opening the player discovery      it does freeze for maybe two seconds after returning      i tried  mupeace debug apk  and it doesn't seem to be any different 
  "id" "bm_pro_c"  "name" "protein component of biomass"  "compartment" "c"  "charge" 0  "formula" "h70 5616c44 9625o13 1713s0 2669n12 1054r 1 0"   
yes  exactly  and the posibility to return a function too 
 hideki do not see any crash after making master branch build from the above link 
dear phillipp   pardon  i have to ask  what calls do i have to make to get the things you asked for   i can provide you the "create table" statement  but i don´t know howto get the other things you asked for  there are some sensitive data  i would like to send you these infos in private  hope thats okay for you 
no js console errors  happens on both safari and chrome  not tested on ff yet   can do later 
here you go   i am not sure if i should add a machine for initcontainers as well  if i do it complains about machine not existing in the recipe  are initcontainers not allowed   or we have to specify them in machines in some special way  
it's a limitation of the browse  not the appbuilder   for a variable or expression displayed without    the column is added but it has name       when walking the widget tree of the browser it's not possible to identify those columns   if  myvariable   myvariable  is used the column widget name will be "myvariable" 
it's a good thought  but my gut is to leave it as is   here's a couple reasons     if a misformed mat file happens to have the  global  flag set in a non root array  what would you do   ignore it   throw an error    looking at the  matfile  interface  the only way to get the  isglobal    value is through the  iterable namedarray  getentries      that's okay  but it's a little awkward for people who care about the  isglobal    but want to access via map or index  it's not crazy to change it  but it does seem like a bit of an impedance mismatch with the file format   it's too bad that there's a mismatch between the underlying format and the semantic meaning  but there's too many mat files out there to change it now    
hi  it seems to happen with asia rangoon time zone  thanks

ok  thank  first i think it was worldguard an check any config at this point  but there is only the global region  than i checked the uskyblock config and set the terraform for nether to false  than i check all uskyblock permissions and find nothing and than i post it here 
works  thank you 
well  sorry i cant do that because it is internal proprietary project  but i have found the source of the problem  were i more familiar with git i would fix it by myself  but at this point i have to ask you to do it if you don t mind 
we should  unfortunately i am on android n where instant upload is  completely broken   so i am not able to test debug this matter  cry  apart from this  yes fixing it right away would be the way to go   since it is related to #25 which hasn't been merged  yet  we can postpone it since i just postponed that one too  due to the fact that i can't test anything related to instant upload at the moment   so to "re enable" me we should prioritize getting instant upload working again for android n  i already started with the build process part  but there are still some quirks i need to fix 
hi   danieldietrich    thank you for your quick response   i see and agree with that storing the hash lazily _can_ have a significant memory overhead  maybe it would make sense in scala  a language that has native support for lazy fields  where most of the overhead  the  lazy  instance  the lambda for the supplier  the  integer  instance  and thus the implications on gc  would not be present  the fact that scala's immutable collections don't do this is a good sign that  even in scala  it still doesn't worth it _generally_   when the benefits do outweigh the above overhead  such a wrapper class that you proposed seems perfectly feasible to me  we'll consider implementing that class given that our measurements confirm that it worths doing so  as a wise man once said  "measure  don't premature "  the fix for this issue in master is perfectly fine by me  and i'm looking forward towards your next release     until then  we'll stick to your snapshot builds   keep up the good work

the pr i mentioned is just a first step to bring more transparency into the process  by no means the goal     "recent" is very tricky when you index concurrently different documents of different sizes on different nodes  depending on how things run  there is no notion of a clear "recent" shard as each replica may be behind on different documents  all in flight  i currently have some thoughts on how to approach this better but it's early stages  one of the options is take make a intermediate step which will indeed involve some heuristic around "recency" 
yes  so basically  when user tried to join the room in a freshly installed app  this crash occurs as soon as he joins the room after giving the camera permission  it does not occur after that

i would prefer that font and size were separate  i may not want a monospaced font in the chat  as i would definitely want a monospace for the macro editor   same goes for the sizes  i realize that it may not be practical at this point in the process  in which case i would be able to accept that the font size was shared for now 
i took jed out to see if it was causing problems  even in a standard overworld i was not getting any ore decoration   but i found the issue  i must call  addblocktoreplace    as part of my decoration setup  even though the docs say this is defaulted to stone   perhaps the default isn't correct or some other mod is messing with stone  but adding    dec addblocktoreplace "minecraft stone"    to each ore gen decoration fixed the issue

sure  the main issue is the "jump" handling when you need to go more than one item forward on any side  my previous code example represents case when i need to set 6th index active by default right after component initialization  basically it can't jump from 0 item to 6 in this case  instead it will set item with index 1 as active    i've slightly updated sample code with this block for component init   technically  listed blocks related to "jump from the edge" cases only  jump from other positions in the middle does not work either 
again tried it  without using imageonmap and it looks like it's happening because of fast placing and destroying item frames  https   i imgur com cpq549n mp4 looked to the timings then and it was high

it won't double it since tmaster only runs on 1 node  so it would add 1 1 with the number of topologies we run  which is insignificant   we use a watch on statemanger for the packing plan for a couple of reasons    the executors need the packing plan and doing rpc with them isn't practical due to their lifecycle  following the same patter for the tmaster is consistent    the initial deployment should be able to proceed without a requirement that the deploying user  where the scheduler as a library might run  maintains a connection to the topology for the entire startup phase  so the client puts some state in statemanager and if that succeeds it launches the aurora containers and it's done  from then on the topology can initialize itself  we don't want the production topology to have a dep on the users client  which scheduler   tmaster rpc would require 
i was able to connect to the server using the login password "test"  the content was shown instantly and everything worked like a charm    i would help if you could tell me what i need to do  my device is not routed and as far as i understood all kind of logcat apps doesn't work with android 4 4 2 anymore  any idea how i could get access to the "important" log files     btw    after the successful test with demo owncloud org  i decided to test it with a newly created owncloud account on my server  i was able to show all files within a second  this leads me to the assumption that the described problem might be caused by the fact that i'm not using local storage but external webdav file systems with my account

i don't think a reproducer is warranted  given that it is clear by inspection of the following code  taken from  vertximpl internaltimerhandler   that  canceltimer  is not linearized with respect to  handle      as written  the  compareandset  in  cancel  might as well be an ordinary load and store  since there is no other atomic operation on the  cancelled  flag to establish a linearization  another way of explaining the issue is that there is a possible interleaving where  handle  sees  cancelled  is false  then  cancel  is called  the cas succeeds in setting   cancelled  to true and thus the function returns true  and then the handler proceeds to execute   sorry if this is an over explanantion  i don't mean to insult anybody's intelligence  let me know if i am missing something

i've found out that  app recyclerview " +id recyclerview"  attribute in  com turingtechnologies materialscrollbar dragscrollbar  is the cause of the error  it might work well in an activity of only 1 recyclerview with id  recyclerview   however  in an activity with multiple fragments of which each fragment contains recyclerview with the same ids   dragscrollbar  could not determine which recyclerview to bind   my immediate solution is to give unique id to the particular recyclerview with  dragscrollbar

hassan described the problem pretty well  in my case it were numbers with luxemburgish prefix  for example the original number would be 00352 621         in kiss history it would appear as 0049352 621         or +49352 621           00352 beeing the luxemburgish prefix  i have not encountered the problem with numbers saved with a + for the prefix  opening the contacs app the numbers appear normal and sometimes even the history corrected  i will try to recreate the problem some time but for the moment i downgraded to 2 25 
i'm now inspecting this issue  i've not seen the root cause yet  but generally  i guess it may be required to set  podaffinity  to run pods in the same node  an example case  the environment is under per workspace strategy and pv is an emulated hard drive  like azuredisk

the issue is when i use the javacpp maven plugin  i got a failure just because i use maven 3 0 3 to build my wrapper   basically i would have to rebuild javacpp and upload it to our internal nexus to bypass the requirement   will work as we don't use nexus staging maven plugin 1 6 6  but i would prefer to use directly the official version

yes  that seems to be the case  i tried again and was able to reproduce it  if i interact with the other chrome window while ht is starting up  this behavior happens  if i don't touch the other chrome window while ht is starting up  things seem to be fine 
i got a step further  looks like curly quotes copied from browser     now i get a 200 response but it is      "message"  "unknown"    any ideas 
i actually don't know    it was something i ran into while working on a completely different problem  and i just copied the exception into a ticket so it wouldn't be forgotten  it also looks like something that we should be able to track down purely by analyzing the code for things that could create out of bounds indexes  the exact example may not be necessary to solve the problem

i stopped all apps that might force close this app  i have similar apps on my galaxy note 5  s4 and tab s but heads up still does not pop up   i have to keep on tapping the test button on the app  which does appear  to make sure i know the app works  but it stops appearing  not the test pop up  after a while 
i guess it is caused by the auto umount of user home folder by ecryptfs in ubuntu 16 04 
if the fragment is in viewpager and still  resumed  then it will technically be visible all the time so it's not the best solution  but i guess i could make it work by simply switching the whole list visibility to  invisible  based on the   calls in fragment  or maybe navigaton controller state 🤔

after deeper investigation i see that in normal configuration indeed it works   however  when you look at the code above it should be clear  that for hierarchical contexts it won't work because of recursive call with the same argument for each call   and this is exactly my case   i am using 'spring cloud starter config'  so i've got contexts hierarchy as follows     will be trapped inside infinite loop leading to stackoverflowerror

npc doesn't detect you at all when chase range is anything higher than 0  however  we tried putting it at 0 so it attacks and follows the player  than put it at 30  and when the player left the chase range of 30 it indeed went back home  so the only problem here seems to be an absence of detection when chase range is higher than 0

most of the time the crash does not happen on first startup anymore  instead on the 2nd launch of the game  it crashes with only curios and it's addons installed about half the time  however when it crashes once it will not stop crashing no matter what until i remove it all  somehow gets fixed after a few tries and fiddling with my mod list  removing everything then adding it back  removing curios  etc   currently trying the new build  no issues so far

probably i see where problem is  in json request body field   odata type  is missing  but actually i set it by  fileattachment   odatatype   "microsoft graph fileattachment"   or with  #  at the begging  so the request body looks like   when i send it by raw json with   odata type  it is created correctly   why setting  odatatype  to  fileattachment  won't add   odata type  in request body

i have removed 20 of the mods i used to load  no change  currently have to fob around "in the dark" for lack of a better term if i want to craft armour   i dread the prospect of heuristically checking each mod to see what the cause is  is there a way i could check for a rendering issue

its a map mod

 dsyer the request grant type used was custom  c_password  which extends the  password  grant type  i'm using the oauth client setup to make the request  i was posting the incorrect credential and noting what gets return in the body from my api  secured by spring oauth     now the response header  i get back from the api is  401 unauthorized  however  the response body is empty  as you can see from my first post  i get that json response when making the request using my advance restclient however  using my resttemplate  through spring oauth client configuration   the response body is empty  httpclienterrorexception  getresponsebodyasstring is empty  though simulating the exact request through advance restclient  return a json error response body 
so i can not run 2 lt's in the same directory the same moment  okay  i will stick to one  slows down the process though 
in the benchmark repo  run    mvn clean install  dbuild native image  pl ' testingframework'   run the insurance service      insurance service target insurance service 1 0 0 alpha1 snapshot runner   you don't need a db running  it doesn't get that far
hey  yes  the tabs get refreshed and everything is ok if tab is refreshed  i know this is a general "problem" with all the views  i realized just now  that this is actually duplicate of issue #1079 so i am closing this   i had a feeling this issue was posted before but i could not find it 
when the server is opening maybe is not authme error  the old error is fixed  thanks
i have a file in  downloads dmhy    and the path of directdownload is set to http   ip_of_mypc downloads  when it try to download the file  however  the link will be http   ip_of_mypc downloads thefile but not http   ip_of_mypc downloads dmhy thefile  
ok     i think i'm an idiot x   it's ok now  the problem is solved    it was a shovel problem    the builder didn't accept the diamon shovel
sorry  was on vacation   what  exactly are you looking for 
i use 1 22 release  so seems it is already fixed in the current source 
after changing to user pwd  it was api key before  and after entering the credentials in the history window it looks like the following screenshot after creating and modifing a ticket   image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10806821 12579940 edada20e c42b 11e5 8ac2 00fe327c889d png   you can scroll down to see the history in the window  but this is probably not  how it should work 
the 2 plates + ingot how else  was crafted   was chopping big trees and notice that 
only deleted files  new copied files are scanned correctly 
 cypher121   yeah  i'm aware of that    sadly  i was hoping you would have a clue because it was working on the last version flawlessly  to your questions  it crashes by   any   block and item this includes creative and recipe less items  too  any block or item behavior is normal  this error is seemingly restricted on nei and the recipe function   i do not use optifine or a specific texture  resource pack   just some parts of texture replacements for jabba  buildcraft  gravel  lava and a few others  but no texture pack in for your mod and nothing larger than 64x64   access_denied
there is a "save chart" button on the gui panel  but there is nothing else there to save the rule density curve  the grammar  and the anomalies  i will push a code change right now that has some preliminary panels and fields whose functionality needs to be implemented 
on startup the che version is 6 18 0   this is a fresh install using docker 
unfortunately i don't remember which dataset was it     i'll try to reproduce it and keep you in touch 
hi  sherfert   we tried running with the snapshot flag and while it lessened the frequency of the observed issue  it was still present  what you're describing sounds like neo4j does not meet acid compliance  specifically isolation    our situation in the real world is far more complex than the simple example  it's a cluster of 5 core nodes and 3 read nodes with several ingestion apps writing data and many more apis reading data  we're ingesting data from a pipeline and end up deleting and recreating both nodes and relationships during reingestion  we're seeing these deletes creates interfere with at least 2 locations in our system and in multiple ways  both from referencing the original node and referencing nodes attached to the entry node   we've implemented some logic to mitigate this by retrying queries in situations that we recognize as being invalid  but it by no means covers all our edge cases  because of this  we'd really like to be able to avoid rewriting our ingestion transaction as it would be a pretty substantial rewrite   i guess i'm left with 2 questions at this point  1  does this mean that neo4j is not acid compliant  2  for the  unsupported dbms query snapshot   should we choose to enable this on our servers  what sort of performance impact might we see  it does seem to make the situation better  but it might not be worth it if we lose performance 
i don't think so  because this is not the behavior in a standard text field  and i've not seen it on other text fields  which of course rtf field ui developers have to wrap with javascript to make the magic happen    indeed i just checked here on github by clicking edit on my original post above  and if it were an overall browser env issue  one might expect it to occur here as well  but it did not   mac el capitan 10 11 6   chrome version 61 0 3163 100  official build   64 bit   i could try another browser os some time  but in the meantime  i just wanted to call it to someone's attention that this is the behavior i observed

you are right  all logs are from the same thread  i share with you the logs filtered with the lines of  traceid "3239b0fd76624aa7" 
i have a mod that when opening a specific gui will freeze the game for a few seconds  however i later found out that this was not the cause  it is a simple nullpointer  because the items displayed are ghost items without a real itemstack  adding a null check fixes the problem immediately 
 patilshreyas thanks much for the quick reply  it's a simple issue    there are two   firestorerecycleradapters   not one  one in   ui firestore   directory and other in   ui database    you added   updateoptions   in both of them but forgot to change the constructor in one of them  in   ui database firestorerecycleradapter   _moptions_ is updated   but the same isn't done in   ui firestore firestorerecycleradapter    see lines 38 and 39  https   github com firebase firebaseui android blob d7aec385c2bbb807b39b4c3c444f161f55be17fc firestore src main java com firebase ui firestore firestorerecycleradapter java#l38   patilshreyas  samtstern let me know if you need more details  i can give the code but this is more succinct way to get to the root of the issue

that was my bad i accidentally hit the post button before i finished 
that is what the method  listplaylists    was returning and it was crashing when i tried to cast it to  list playlist    i will investigate some more though  it could be because im using kotlin  but i'm not sure

 jmrozanec happy new year to you too     i am new this this  how do i create a pr if i cannot create a branch to put the changes on    the test would be something like   anyway    hope that helps  let me know if i can do more 
yes it does  but not hidden

mlcp sh mlcp bat invokes this behavior out of the box   an easy way to trigger it is just to mlcp import  fakeoption  but it does it with a valid option and a bad value too  it's a very spammy helpfile 
when i run the demo   the bug happened  crashed in mainactivity after i saw mainactivity view normal operation of the demo on the nexus but crashed on ibiza_f2  android 4 4 4 api19  other logs show 
because currently our system pass in parameters to resize the image on our server side  which will make the link of the image looks something like this     www someweb com image pic01 jpg width 100 height 200  as what i observed  all other images with extensions like  jpg and  png able to be cached well in disk cache  but these images with links above will not cache  so is there any option to modify this to allow image caching for other extensions

whoops  yeah that looks incomplete   1  create a text field with index_phrases   true 2  create a custom search analyzer with the synonym_graph filter 3  index something and do a query with the analyzer created above   i'm currently on holiday away from my workstation  but the above should result in the error

hi all   no  im using pot textures as well  i have not tested with the latest version of the robovm backend though  will check if that solves the problem   but  i have been overriding iosapplication delegate's didbecomeactive and willresignactive to simulate calls to applicationlistener pause   and resume    i need these to show a pause screen when the player comes back to the game  after a phone call maybe     can the backend be modified to call pause   and resume   just like android 
no  exatcly inversely  i updated from v2 x android to 3 0 x and server to v13  and after that my profile account hasnt got any image  on friends mobile phone  android 4  galaxy s3 neo  it is working  but he doesn´t use an own avatar  there is only the standard avaratar with the first letter of his name  i tested new accounts adding to the app and it is working on my device 
tried searching multiple contacts as well as single contact phone  their is a considerable amount of delay  after some time it crashes randomly testing on moto g

ok
 parrt see the attached file  maybe i'm just missing out something very simple  it works before the update    simplexlexer g4 txt  https   github com antlr intellij plugin v4 files 662030 simplexlexer g4 txt 
still failing  though differently  how about waiting until after the vacation  and fixing it then 
i think the code right now is vulnerable to failure any time an update occurs   my ideal behavior would be that the code is only vulnerable on the very first run on a new system   after that  failure is easy to avoid on any successive run  since one successful run guarantees a data file    here's my ideas suggestions   1  provide a way to specify the cache directory  default to java io tmpdir  but allow the user to override   the only downside to using java io tmpdir is that some systems will clean the directory on reboot  but it makes a good default   2  put the online updater into the core package   i'm sure the majority of the user base wants to use online updates  those users don't require a dependency on a package that's updated monthly   as a bonus  it'll be easier to click through the code when viewing on github   3  you could simplify the code by combining the updating and non updating parser   the updating parser can default to 1 day for the update interval   the non updating parser can use long max_value as the update interval  292 millions years    this makes the less common use scenario  i e  no updates  a subcase of the common use case scenario    i e  giving you less code to test and maintain with the primary code path being the one that is most used    4  consider the option of _not_ bundling any data files with uadetector  do you really want to make a new release every month for many years to come   that's a lot of work for a small number of users that don't want online updates   you can include information on how manually download the data file   if you do decide to bundle  the bundled package can copy it's data file into the caching directory to maximize the shared code 
apologies  1 10 2   i'll add mod version mc version to my other tickets as well   in fact  i just realized i'm several versions behind  1 1 17    i'm going to quickly update and see if i can close some of these 
will do  probably tonight  will get my mate to use his glider again and try to recreate the problem   which sods law will say that i then don't disconnect haha

yes  i checked it during installation and it's in the users path  c  program files dpf manager  also added the path to the systems path but that did not work either  perhaps the jre did not recognize the updated path     a restart   new login might be required but i am just guessing   edit  cannot be the jre   forgot  that it is a vbs script running there

i've found a work around for the issue by not registering the gpdsc files to fgeneratedpacks unless it actually exist  this will also solve the issue with the listener which then is activated when the  gpdsc actually exist on disc  however  saving the rteconfig before the gpdsc will leave the gui red for the cubeoption until a new selection event occurs  for this i've found no solution 
good morning matthias  there is nothing in the error console  only the log message that i have  loaded my bib file  attached the error popup  i'm on win 7 64bits  btw  i speculate the help files are inside the jar file  because in the  installation there is no  help en  directory  thanks          mario  on 30 nov 15 08 45  matthias geiger wrote    ##   ing  mario valle swiss national supercomputing centre  cscs  v  trevano 131  6900 lugano  switzerland tel  +41  91  610 82 60
please be aware this was not systematic  i assume it is related to a specific icon  yesterday i upgraded to 1 0 6  i will monitor if this happens again in next days  it didn't happen so far  
no need for changes entries for tests 
hi  jimczi   ok  so if it is finally a breaking change and so  only a "docs" issue  i think that this doc page especially should be updated  referenced by kibana search bar     https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current query dsl query string query html#query string syntax

thanks for the quick response  yes  this is a problem that anyone might encounter  i discovered it when i realized that the sd library wasn't finding several files on my card and narrowed it down to those with latin characters  here are a couple examples of long names and the windows generated short names  1  ¿por qué te vas_ mp3    06¿por 1 mp3 2  penélope mp3    05penÉ 1 mp3  windows shouldn't generate short file names with spaces  but other systems may  i believe space is allowed anywhere except for the first char  but there is a separate line of code to handle that case   thanks    mike  on wed  nov 11  2015 at 10 23 am  cristian maglie notifications github com wrote 
sorry my code is on an internal network and i cannot post it  all i can say is i followed the instructions posted here for swagger springmvc 0 8 4  i am completely xml based with no custom config files  too much out of scope work to migrate to java config based so i'm kinda stuck  from the readme md  my config now includes     mvc annotation driven        mvc message converters            bean class "my messageconverter"           mvc message converters       mvc annotation driven       bean class "com mangofactory swagger configuration springswaggerconfig"      mvc resources mappings "  html" location " "      mvc default servlet handler     so it seems to me that i'm confined to using your provided config class and annotations  i think my troubles are confined to the  api annotation on my controller  it seems the description is ignored and  from a reply from ron on swagger swaggersocket googlegroups com  so is the basepath  my annotation is set to    api value "roles"  description "operations on roles"  basepath "mycontextroot"    displayed in swagger ui is     roles   roles             try it out     so the second "roles" above should be the description and the "try it out" request url used is missing the context root   from ron  "as for the context root  that sounds like your basepath is misconfigured and does not include the context root of your application "  any help appreciated

through essentials there is a money limit that a player may have at   100 000  if the player has 100 000 in his hands  then when they withdraw money from the atm  they disappear  there is not enough verification whether it is possible to give the player money or not

it seems to be more than just updating this script  in the end  as several bundles seem to not be living in the org eclipse kapua    namespace anymore   at least the jars aren't  i started to update the scripts but stopped   there since i guess first step is to make sure all kapua bundles are   org eclipse kapua xxx jar as per eclipse development process   le sam  15 oct  2016 02 13  henryk konsek notifications github com a écrit  
turned out to be a generally rare circumstance that wouldn't affect a server operating "normally"  if you loaded the plugin while the server is up and you are logged in at the time the plugin is loaded  you are not added to the actors internal database  and any database insertions that require a non null actor throw an exception  logging out and back in again fixes the issue 
okay update to the issue  it seems to only be when you break the core ill test it on its own
sure  i will submit a pr as soon as possible

ok  now i understand the problem with my configuration    i clearly misunderstood what  quarkus log console level  does  and honestly it makes absolute sense  has i think it's been very well thought out now that i read the guide properly   and it worked properly for both  application properties  and  meta inf microprofile config properties  so i am going to go ahead and close this   perhaps the various   minimum   levels that come into play should be more clear  since that's what i hadn't noticed initially

it seems to happen in the client and in the game  i got asked if i really want to join "that" game  because my rating is lower than 1000  i first thought this was just a bug with the rating check  but when i got listed with 365 games and 0 rating in the in game lobby  i realized that it's not just a bug with the rating check   i just tested it again  these are my stats in the profile  https   i imgur com zhucvkt png  this is what is displayed in the lobby  http   i imgur com 2xa0tjo jpg  achievements say  i have played 12 games   switching back to the standard faf client fixed my rating again 
i will work on updating the documentation to reflect the current implementation  for me it would either be the ability to say  use  hostname  from the node  or alternatively be able to provide a hostname which will be used by each broker and the bootstrap without the need to specify an override for each individually  which do you prefer   thank you for the offer  for the meantime  i would like to continue exploring on my own and learning my way around the codebase   
by "valuable" i mean with matter values     every item that got value during calculation recalculation process will have that value untill restart  so  every vanilla item like coal  wood or ingots for example will have their fixed matter values but crafting table or chest will not  i will send you log when i will be able to generate proper one for report purpose 
this is weird  looks like only my phone model has this issue  my device is general mobile 8  android version 9 and game version is 240x320  k800i version  but actually it has same problems with other 240x320 versions too like 240x320 c905 version

this is a segment from logcat last week  our app is com bynd looper   which doesn't give a lot of info yet   i'll try to get a longer segment and some stats on how long it takes etc  note that it's excessive cpu use  not battery use   one thing is that it could be that our app does quite a bit of custom processing which is done in the activity  not the navigation service  although we need that  we might need to look into pushing that into a second service  which would also need to be a foreground service  so will require a second icon in the status bar  which is mildly annoying  
i'm sorry but i dont know which android method to start debug with  could you tell me the code related to this function so i could use android studio to see the values come out

hi tobia  the server administrator has contacted you via email can be fine has created for you a test account has shown you the problem    this are the issues     it is impossible to reproduce the mp3 files downloaded by the ios app   some android clients can not connect to the server  either using the username password or the token created in the user page   i never was abel to connect via webdav  even bycopying  pating the link that is shown  in the left colum  at the bottom  but this is a secundary feature  for us  thanks
i will try to get a simple reproducer  however data size is not huge   its generated json couple of hundreds of kb  however there is normalize allocation happening in buffer which rounds to nearest power of 2 or so  it takes many requests to go for next allocation   also is there possibility that it doesnt get decoded if command timed out  i saw await being used
sorry but i still get the same error http   paste ee p 3mkh0 if i add galacticraft again it works fine but i dont like that oxygen system   
well i wanted to do something like that     do you know how i can make something like that with the bit expression  i don't really understand the expression well

hi there  i am using openkeychain v 3 0 1 os is cm11 android 4 4 4   currently using the nightly builds for jflte aka galaxy s4    does the fact i am using the art vm and not the dhavlik vm matter   i got around it by importing the keys from the file in sections  the export file is over 10mb  so maybe size is the issue  or size combined with old key data is the problem   can provide file for download if you like   it is a 7 7mb bz2    
hi  lolodomo can i help you   i use openhab 1 8 0 but your jar file will work fine with this version

yes  and i see an open close pair being called by the transaction manager   but there's extra opens being called from the methods in org springframework data orient commons core abstractorientoperations that are never closed  so the opartitioneddatabasepool acquiredcount never goes back to 0   for example    override public  ret extends list  ret query oquery query  object    args    return dbf db   query query  args    
i think it's simply that hdf5library uses  org apache log4j logmanager  rather than  org apache logging log4j logmanager  
here is my code 
yes  that's right  we initially discovered the issue in a setup with haproxy  but we are able to reproduce it easily with just a standalone jetty serving a static page and a remote browser  chrome or firefox    for example accessing jetty from a smartphone connected to the local wifi   as i explained in the mailing list  we can reproduce it also with jdk 1 8 0_72 and alpn 8 1 7 v20160121   i attach a log running jetty with    module logging  dorg eclipse jetty http2 level debug   the page load that fails  the second in the log i think  starts at 2016 02 29 19 20 13 985  in this case the visible symptoms were that page load halted while loading an image  and after many seconds page load finished leaving one of the images with the broken image icon in the display    2016_02_29 stderrout log gz  https   github com eclipse jetty project files 151522 2016_02_29 stderrout log gz 
here is a pastbin file of the config   http   pastebin com hkd3ezuq  if is definitely not working properly  whenever i attempt to fix it by removing the duplicate spaces and text it reverts to this upon restart  then on the next restart another copy of the top is added  so every time the server restarts it duplicates everything in the config file 
i think the values should come from the build  so most likely an issue for scdf itself 
i got it again without anything related to pom xml change  just creating empty class and writing the package statement using code completion  you can see the long request response attached   jdt_messages txt  https   github com eclipse eclipse jdt ls files 2470360 jdt_messages txt 
sorry  i meant post instead of push  the flag is also wrongly named "pushalways" instead of "postalways"   until a couple of weeks ago there was only i "save" method on the resource repository  in the v2 version there is now a "create" and "save"  so it becomes possible to distinguish "post" and "patch"  before that it just did a post  this thing now just needs to be enabled   the general issue is a bit more complicated due to the flaws in the current serialization handling  i looked into all that and think i will have a solution tomorrow that does a first cleanup in this area by having a proper representation of a json api document and moving the logic out of the serializers 
sure   this is the  server xml  of my example project  the database properties are injected from  bootstrap properties

 meincs the specific cron specification  quartz  etc   doesn't matter as i believe all of the cron dialects supported by cron utils do not support nanosecond precision  thus  comparing cron schedules with nanosecond precision would be wrong  which fortunately  was easy to catch   here is the link for the quartz cron trigger  http   www quartz scheduler org documentation quartz 2 x tutorials crontrigger html

i use the recent beta 17   there is no error message  dna just deletes not all selected documents 
this problem happens after migration authme database to mysql  i trying to resolve my problem with database editing  in the database was one empty name  and cirka 20 without "last login " i delete this  is "real name" important 
sounds plausible and i would agree that the bug seems to be in the automation part   so  danchom  your call

 saudet hi samuel  i tried downloading the bin files and adding them as dependencies  as the installation guide said  but still didn't work   then i did some more search and extract opencv android arm jar and ffmpeg android arm jar and copy all the result  so files under app src main jnilibs armeabi v7a  and now it works  thank you 
i just replicated the bug as described  and yes  it involved the return button the first time it happened

yeah sure     the bottom part is just an addition to represent why enforcing getmockforabstractclass is not always a good idea  it is really hard to recognize what each flag does   without the show argument name feature of phpstorm 
i do not have this issue when adding contacts  strictly in the qr invoice amount section
an artificial example   dot  has a default node node spacing  nns  of 15 and  neato  has one of 12  the  layoutdotexporter  retrieves nss from a graph using the  coreoptions  class  there  a default nss of 10 is specified  thus  for a graph without any explicit nss set  both  dot  and  neato  end up having nss of 10   additionally  after the first  #getproperty nss   call  the graph will actually have a specified nss  10 
thats my first impression  yes  looking at the decompiled sdk makes that seem very unlikely  admittedly      we have a wide range of devices this is affecting according to fabric they are all running 4 4 4 and below  that may be incorrect  though      note 2   galaxy s5   tab pro 10 1   s4   droid ultra   the stacktrace may not be as helpful as we use an internal array that takes the first two cameras retrieved from  cameramanager getcameraidlist      this is returning an empty list  causing the index out of bounds exception 
 tonylo1 these issues are related  i am not quite sure about the technical details   i would prefer to write and experiment with the interpreter  just to see if this is a better solution to the issue which i am seeing here  it's just a suggestion 
this is not conditional on the  catapultsstring delm   it can be whatever  just make it  catapultsstring delm    "foobar"   the problem is the "interpreter" in r rstudio or  maybe  shiny  actually   
it still exists on one of my local machine  but the program can run fine with this error  i will close this for now

if you are testing this through the twitch launcher  twitch has the tendency to enable disable other mods related or at least dependent on the one you disable enable  an example is disabling jei will disable just enough resources and twilight forest  theres more too  but that's not important   re enabling jer will re enable jei  but re enabling twilight forest does not

no  but it shouldn't exclude directories just because they contain a buck file   it should only exclude directories if that buck file defines a project_config for that directory module   an example would be a module containing a lib  directory which in turn contained both  jar files and a buck file with a load of prebuild_jar entries  since the commit referenced above  that lib  directory is being excluded from its parent module and is therefore hidden in intellij  it wouldn't make sense to put a project_config   in lib buck because there are no appropriate src_roots    there are no sources

thanks for your quick reply  i change the log level to debug  i just got the data of pageusage 1 time  after that  i could not get that info again   
i using distro is cdh  and the version is 5 1 1  elasticsearch is default settings   i just change the server's ip 
 skabashnyuk imo  providing both che_api_external and che_api_internal is reasonable even if it was in k8s openshift world   workspace containers will connect to the ingress  or external endpoint that have external ip  if che_api contains public domain name  on the other hand  urls with  http   che server 8080 api  will be resolved as the local ip address by the local dns   at the viewpoint of functionality  some ingresses like nginx does't handle websockets well  so i want to avoid connections via ingresses if it was possible    i can't say with absolute certainly since implementation of ingresses are so many  but i just can say it's better to suppress traffic to  ingress  it will give us some stability and quick response

 davidcui amzn yes it is  so the thing is some functions are not supported to put a field as the input param  some are not supported to put a constant as the param    
 bleskes  no  we don't set that  should it better to set it 
the issue happens when using mybatis to insert text clob column with below config      result column "request_json" property "requestjson" jdbctype "longvarchar"         check org apache ibatis type clobtypehandler      public void setnonnullparameter preparedstatement ps  int i  string parameter  jdbctype jdbctype        throws sqlexception       stringreader reader   new stringreader parameter       ps setcharacterstream i  reader  parameter length            it will call preparedstatement setcharacterstream   which take reader as argument type  but in abstractshardingpreparedstatementadapter  for all setxxx    it always calls preparedstatement setobject   which does not accept reader as argument    the solution  if you check the code i pasted above  for all setxxx    it will call underlying preparedstatement's setxxx   instead of setobject    so it solves the problem     ps  changing mybatis mapper configuration to  jdbctype "varchar" may also solve the problem  my fix is just to make shardingsphere support more methods in java sql preparedstatement

you're right  it was fixed  sorry  i had been assuming that master was the last dowloaded version  i can see i was wrong      by the way  i am considering writing a clojure wrapper for this library  however it seems the api is evolving rapidly  if you have a precise idea of the direction it's taking  please shoot me an email

please watch this movie  my android device is version 7 1   https   vimeo com 253194519  url 
here are my gradle dependencies snippets for applicable libraries     i think there is an incompatibility with how mockmvc handles forwarded requests  i see it's not really suported  but  it generally works from the restdocs perspective when i pass querystring params in the url  and when i pass the form content as body  if i try using  post      params       then i can only make assertions on the  mockmvcresultmatchers forwarded   related parts 
hmmm  not really sure  the bug was due to a malformed uri  which shouldn't really affect the cells  but it did anyway  i do remember that restarting the app fixed them  can't really confirm because both all branches are now completely different from master 
yes  at first i thought it was because my client side config was not the same  i copied the server config to my client and although the tooltip shows that absorption is at 100   when i tested it out by letting some blazes hit me  my ds equips' durability still dropped

 ronblum in the course of trying to document this i realized my mistake  it seems if you have a  tag included in the highlighted text that rstudio can recognize as documentation  like   example  or   param  or even     by itself   then using ctl+shift+c will result in  #'  inserted instead of  #    could you confirm this is true  or am i still missing some nuances in how the shortcut works   i didn't see this behavior documented when looking at the rstudio ide cheatsheet  but perhaps i missed it  i had assumed initally when i posted the issue that there would be a separate shortcut to add #' to lines of code instead of #  which was incorrect   i think this implementation is logical and no feature request is needed  feel free to close issue   to make this clearer to others who may see this  this is the behavior i have discovered  if i have 3 lines in an r script opened within rstudio    so plain comment symbols   #   were inserted instead of documentation symbols   #'    this last chunk was what i was trying originally  which lead to my misconception

most android cameras i've seen have a single correct orientation  usually landscape  phone rotated 90 degrees left from normal orientation   when a photo is taken at a different orientation  the actual orientation of the image itself does not change  but the correct orientation is reflected in the exif data and various viewers correct for that  ideally  clover should rotate the image before uploading it so it appears correctly when embedded on 4chan  don't know how easy it is to do though   i have uploaded a zip containing 3 images taken at different orientations  if you open them in gimp or something like that and chose to not correct the orientation  you will see that the images are not rotated themselves but that the correct orientation is indicated in the exif metadata    camera zip  https   github com floens clover files 105246 camera zip

i used firefox version 60 3 0 esr  i just tried with internet explorer version 11 09600  again the incorrect input is accepted but this time without the brief red frame that i see with firefox   by the way   i'd consider the bevaviour you described in your comment  i e  replacing the incorrect value by a valid one  as a serious bug  too  it is as if the application said  "i don't like the value you submitted  so i'll take one i like instead " an incorrect value should neither be accepted nor replaced by a valid one 
i did sent the right one and the problem was present before  but i can't reproduce it now  closing this 
it is tested  work like a charm  thanks
finally narrowed it down  it seems to be moving world the core mod for davincis vessels  
thank you for the update to the pgt definition in the gatkvcfheaderlines    if the possible discordance of the gt and pgt in at least 1 genotype in  7   of the phased variants  is a feature and not a bug then i am not understanding the pgt field correct    for example why is gt and pgt concordant for the genotypes of  93  of the phased variants  anf if pgt  will only ever be heterozygous  then why are there pgt fields with the value 1 1  both concordant and discordant with the gt field   thank you for the extra clarification  a link to documentation describing the pgt whould also be very helpful     pgt 1 1 concordant with the genotype field

i hope so  tried to find some example with same kind of functionality  but all offered just moving to another page   that could be also included in test directory  and just load the page from file when running integration test phase

yes  just upload large images  it will happen。because it doesnot work   anyway bmoptions outwidth   0   bmoptions outheight    if not add ‘bitmapfactory decodefile imagefile getabsolutepath    bmoptions  ’ before 'int photow   bmoptions outwidth '
ah  got it  yep  it sounds like my  target classpath txt  got out of sync  not sure what happened  but i moved over to  es4x cli  and after doing  yarn install  i see that  es4x postinstall  ran automatically and  target classpath txt  has the latest great jars listed  i'll close this out as not reproducible  thanks 
 sapessi i can confirm that the workaround above works for me  you might want to use   in practice  the file name passed in to the method is not the path of an actual file  but the path of an http request  for static files this is unlikely to be the correct path of the file on disk  and for dynamic requests the file may not even exist  and the type detected may be used to route to the correct handler   this method is essentially saying  "given a hypothetical file xyz html  what would the mime type be based on the file extension "   requiring that we mark all paths in the application working directory as valid seems unnecessary and potentially a risk if the same security check is used in other places   my preference would be to keep the security check in place  but to isolate the file system  probecontenttype  to a known  non existent  path to allow the content type detection to work without custom security exceptions being needed   that's just my view of the problem  i am happy to leave it as is if you disagree   
no exceptions or anything  interestingly it works fine for some sketches but not for others  i've uploaded the sketch in question here  http   www astroeq co uk filedump bldcmotor zip
thanks  cliffus   its not super urgent  just using this expandabletextview on a project i am working on  i'm pretty sure it has to do with m layout as it is a bit complex    i've attached my jobcard layout file to this comment  as well the main layout that my activity uses  this activity combines the jobcard layout used by the custom adapter and the main layout  please let me know if there is more i can provide to help you help me      activity_main txt  https   github com blogcat android expandabletextview files 382821 activity_main txt   jobcard txt  https   github com blogcat android expandabletextview files 382822 jobcard txt 
ok my bad  but the 2 issues are unrelated  yes test mail is not getting sent and it is an issue and so is this error showing up in logs but the action of sending test mail does not result in these errors showing up in the logs  sorry for the confusion

hi nghi   here is the complete model   time  is the built in variable  defined by  time   cycle   step   representing the time in the simulation    i was expected  t  and  time  to have the same value     but i do not understand how is computed the  t  value    
i need to block all sites except the checked  but for an example it is better 
 pavolloffay thanks for reply  using 0 3 2 version  it worked  but there is another problem  maybe not relate to previous problem  if it's better to open new issue  i will do it   # problem abstractasyncconfiguration throws exception   # reason defaultasyncautoconfiguration generate a asyncconfigurer  and project framework org springblade  generates a asyncconfigurer too  two asyncconfigurer  cause this exception    img width "706" alt "abstractasyncconfiguration1" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 18543769 59663216 1b1c0100 91e1 11e9 9835 1bd6baa930ab png"    img width "737" alt "abstractasyncconfiguration2" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 18543769 59663221 1eaf8800 91e1 11e9 8de5 141f6880f292 png"   bladeexecutorconfiguration sources 
i'm not using command line flags  i use the jar from within a web application  the compiler is setup like this

yes it happens on a converted project  i didnt try on a new project  it's a group of simple sprites with physics component and polygon component  if i try to click on one of the sprites the editor crashes immediately  i have another group in the same scene but without physics and polygon component  selecting the works fine though  
hi  i moved to a smtp service using port 587 instead of 465  for this last one i tested with firewall enabled disabled and for two providers     and it's working  so it's ok for me   thanks m
it seems that using a  viewpropertyanimator  on the progress bar triggers the issue 
the message appeared this morning  but i only started testing ums yesterday   i didn't have debug logging turned on for your library at the time  i've since turned it on  added some logging to output the buffer if it's negative  and am waiting for it to happen again  i'll post more info when i have it   i'm not up to speed on the chromecast protocol  to know whether it's guaranteed to return 4 bytes   but you're calling   read    on an  inputstream  and not checking if the return value is   1   which would indicate the end of the stream   you could get some strange behavior if that happened   a different approach might be to use the  read byte   b   method on inputstream  in case there are fewer than 4 bytes available

apologies  that's what reporting bugs at 2am gets me   still have a few issues with it in 0 1 715 with rolling machine and centrifuge not updating power bar till i relog with singleplayer
first  thank you for the quick response and the test case   we could reproduce the problem by slightly modifying the test case in the pull request   you just need to run update view after the 2 x objects are saved and before the 3 x objects are saved  which is what happens in normal syncing with the server  first  get the conflict state  update view  then get conflict resolution  update view    we have an idea for a fix as well   but that comes later     please re open this issue after reviewing the new test case

i created a new file called  derp   inside the root of my project directory  and that warning did indeed go away  however  i then moved the file into another ignored directory  and the warning did not re appear to tell me it was covered by the other directory  lastly  i removed   node_modules   and      from my  hignore and then did  hg st   grep ' '  to see what files were being covered  and there does not appear to be any     files in my  node_modules  directory   find    name     only finds my one  derp   file too  so i don't think i have any other     files  if that's the case  how can   node_modules   be covering it

the  appcompatapplication   full source below  is what i'm using right now  so the bug is no a blocker for me  however  the provided  context can be in fact some custom instance of  contextwrapper   so getting resources from it directly would be a more bulletproof solution

when i press load there is warning in console   warning  each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop  check the render method of messagefields   see https   fb me react warning keys for more information   but it seems to be unrelated   no other error seen neither in js console nor in graylog logs   i'm using yandex browser  chrome based

hi  diotto  yes i have sent the custom ui notification besides the other two and it seems to be okay   in the main screen it shows the watch is connected  however after some time it disconnects  it is also an issue for me  but this no custom notification issue is present when it shown as connected   in the stats i can see e g the gmail notifications twice  one of them has a record with group comment  the other is with continue  but i can see only the standard notification on my watch 
no  system gc   is only a hint  also with java 7 and its concurrent gc  i doubt that this method would ever block   http   docs oracle com javase 7 docs api java lang system html#gc 28 29  there are a couple of suggestions  aka hacks  around  but basically you can never really estimate sufficiently enough how much main memory is left  i would rather suggest to take a percentage of overall memory instead of free memory  you could also make that percentage configurable   i know that you can already configure the absolute number  however these errors occur mainly on ci vms and i have not figured out how much ram they have and even if they have the same amount at all  
i made a mistake  it's not  objectstorageobjectserviceimpl getmetadata objectlocation   throws npe  but objectstorageobjectserviceimpl get objectlocation  that throws npe for non 2xx  i haven't tested it yet with getmetadata  i have updated the title of this issue

 mkouba    i thought the same  i did a quick test  but the fix for the other pr did not seem to solve it  i will double check it now that it has been merged    my initial thinking was not to solve it using a test and a warning  because i was afraid to hide a root cause and potentially not using this opportunity to correct a bug  if any  somwhere else    but yes if everybody believes that the right solution is simply to make the code more robust  i can take care of it 
well i would say  the ideal use case is to have access to a series of maven prototype based project templates with built in sonarqube integration as a basic feature  the sexy thing about sonarqube is that it can inject quality hints just in time into the editor view  just like we know it from java grammar hints in eclipse  there is a standard sonarqube container available  so i think the feature is feasible   screenshot how it looks like in the classical eclipse ide   http   vitalflux com wp content uploads 2014 09 sonarqube analysis in eclipse png  background information to extend ndlu2's comment  screenshot of large scale oss deployment of sonar  jdk7 is green  good for all of us who codes in java    https   jaxenter com wp content uploads 2012 06 treemap sonar png
hi serge   from our db i cannot say precisely if the table i used to find this bug is a iot table or not    if i execute the following query     the values for iot_name and iot_type are both null  so i suppose the table is an ordinary table   additionally  the reported issue happens with all the tables of our test db  but does not happen with the development db  so maybe this could be related to some oracle instance settings

unfortunately  i don't think there is a general rule   german writers would likely simply avoid ending a sentence with a digit   there are too many  1  platz  1  preis  1  mannschaft  1  bundesliga  1  liga  1  rang  1  kategorie  1  reise  1  tag  52  woche  3  monat  1  jahrhundert  1  buch samuel  42  kongress  "1  simmeringer sport club"  "1  fc nürnberg"   these are all grammatical correct use  it's not specific to dates  that was just where i first noticed that this is really a major problem  once you look out for them  they are literally everywhere  just go to http   de wikipedia org  and type "1 " into the search box  even with "42 " you get many suggestions   so i believe my workaround is doing the best heuristic   assume that digits followed by a dot does not end a sentence  it could  but it usually won't    there are other cases where the assumption that a dot always ends a sentence is incorrect   in particular abbreviations may or may not end a sentence  "Äpfel  bananen  usw  sind obst " is another example that is incorrectly split by corenlp   usw    etc   apples  bananas  etc  are fruit   but these are hard to define without already having pos tags and without massive learning dictionary  to get some samples  you could look at wikipedia page titles  https   de wikipedia org w index php title usw  redirect no  for the digits+ no space +dot rule  i  guess that not splitting the sentence is correct in over 90  of cases  but that is a wild guess  linguists might be able to come up with a number  though

i guess you're lucky     since vertx core is an eclipse project  we do not need a cq in order to use it  the question is more  do we want to rely on a beta version  what's your take on this

hi  i'm very sorry  i'm new to springboot and was going around in circles for a little while trying to work out where the dependency problem was  i downgraded jadira to version 5 0 0 and it works  thanks 
yes 'e' and 'eee' to just show day name in week  though i'm pretty sure i have had the same working in an earlier version 
sure   
thanks  updating version works for me   btw  is it possible to force restamp the binary if the head commit changes  even if all dependency is unchanged  afik go rule is using stable_build_scm_revision instead of build_scm_revision which can force restamp  can cc_binary configured in this way as well

well i can't seem to even replicate my issue in the dw20 pack anymore  after a few server restarts the labels are working fine  i'll be messing around a lot with the mod still  see if i can figure out what i did  
perhaps they are vengeance spirits  i'm not sure of the nomenclature  i can assure you that the ghosts are not part of another mod   the ghosts which i'm discussing are the semi transparent clone entities that appear after you kill a mob with the evilcraft mod  ie if you kill a pig  it'll spawn a semi transparent pig with altered sound effects  normally these "ghosts" are only visible if you're in creative mode or using an item from evilcraft in survival   i haven't been seeing either the expected ghosts or the glitched dragonflies myself  the provided screenshot shows what one of my users has seen   a mysteriously appearing dragonfly that i theorize is a mistakenly identifying the ghost entity type as another id  the dragonfly   since the entity takes the form of whatever it was killed when a living mob was slain that's the best guess i've got   again of course i'm no expert  this seems to be exclusive to evilcraft and doesn't happen with it removed   though i have no doubt that it is due to an interaction conflict bug with another mod   if i provided a console log would that be at all helpful  like i said it isn't causing crashes or anything  its purely a cosmetic issue  i will keep an eye on the console in the mean time and see if anything catches my eye

thanks for testing  i can't reproduce the error for files on the internal storage  sd is still the same   as a workaround copying the files back and forth works    one weird behaviour though  i can't navigate to  folders   root   storage   emulated   0 and therefore i can't navigate to the files  is there any other way to get to the internal storage   my workaround was the "last added" playlist
sometimes  when the player destroys the cart  the cart the player is in will teleport into the ground  i've noticed the game freezes for a second  you'll see into the world and glitch back and forth  you can't exit the minecart   and then it kicks you out with the error  any further attempts to rejoin result in "internal server error" with the following crash    edit2  for some reason i can't reproduce it now  i didn't modify anything  but it's only happened once since my report  but i do know that my steps show exactly what i was doing when i did have the issue

thanks for taking a look at this  that makes sense in terms of precedence but i'm admittedly am not an expert   i bumped to  3 5 4  in my  pom xml  file and realized the difference is that this works     now that i know that  i can just change our imports to have      to keep prototyping  but it'd also be nice to have parity with node  although the      prefix is admittedly more explicit   thanks 
 kalessil i used   user  as return type just for example  in my current project i have some methods  that incapsulate some db queries and return some ar records  yii2   in some cases method called few times  first time in validator  that know how to deal with  null  result  and another time in some action method  that running after validation and can be called only after validation passed  in this case  method unable to return  null    also  it's a bit weird to see inspection detecting every nullable variable usage  but not first time access  because after first call it will be npe or valid object of expected type  
i'd completely forgotten about it    only noticed as i'm updating my example projects that use the plugins for a talk and forgot to include the other dependencies and thought to myself how is it even baking a site without them being declared 
could anybody solve the issue

i twice opened the inventory of both fillers  initially there were two items in both and at the end one item in both  but ok  i am going to create a new video   thank you for answer  
yea agreed   nothing should be valid _when executing_ which is why i assume it's tryin to kill some tools   specifically  this code is never referenced  so likely not used  i didn't fully unpack the protector    so i'm assuming it's not used     dexlib2 handles this fine since baksmali worked on it   no access to ida right now or dexdump   this actually would be a cool detection use case for a protector or anti trick if apkid or something detected register ranges outside the context of the function 
i'm not sure what is wrong  the failures are intermittent and not always in the same test case  possibly it is just a bug in the openjdk code 
actually i'm using 1 3 0    if you need more info  i can provide some example
any of these three blue buttons on the right  i tested it again  though  and for the lower two it only happens once i put something into the inputs  so probably not the button press itself  but the form handling or server queries are the problem     buttons  https   user images githubusercontent com 14839707 36886462 cc560ba6 1dec 11e8 9ecd 5f891170442c png 
 skabashnyuk   b describe the bug  b  we have build a wrapper around eclipse che through which we create workspaces via api and then allocate the links to different users  users are able to open the link through https    domain  dashboard # ide  namespace aka username   workspacename   b https    domain   namespace aka username   workspace name  has never worked for us   though it may be a subject for a different discussion    b  this works well for 30 requests   meaning we can create workspaces through api's as well as open workspaces in browser tabs using above url format   https    domain  dashboard # ide che  workspacename  beyond 30  work spaces get created but can't be open in browser tabs as we get a 'workspace doesn't exist  unable to open ide ' on the browser  b che version  b  7 4 0   b steps to reproduce  b  1  create more than 30 workspaces through api 2  try opening the 31st url   https    domain  dashboard # ide  namespace aka username   workspacename     b expected behavior  b  the 31st workspace should open as it opens for the 30 workspaces before that   not too concerned now about 31st and more workspaces getting displayed now    b runtime  b   kubernetes   b screenshots  b    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 1023534 72595495 eebf9300 392f 11ea 8f20 65a57a9fb5cd png     b installation method  b    i don't know   b environment  b  ubuntu on amazon cloud   b additional context  b  one more thing   b you can create 31'st workspaces   b  can create through api  b  you can start 31'st workspace  you can't open 31'st workspace in browser   b  since i can't see these workspaces on dashboard  i can't start from there  but guessing when i use https    domain  dashboard # ide  namespace aka username   workspacename  on a browser  it should start first and then open in that order at the same time  the message indicates it can neither be started nor be opened   b  you can't open 31'st workspace in the dashboard  what exactly is not working    b  can't see the workspace in dashboard but can't open the workspace url got through api in a browser tab  hope above is sufficient enough to figure out a rc 
it can be reproduced with any version up to  dalston sr1  included  i created a simple application using the spring initializr by including the features  web    eureka  and  actuator   here is a short excerpt of the logs   once the application is started  try to _pause_ it via a call to  post  pause      the eurekaserviceregistry simply update the instancestatus   but nothing is listening to these changes anymore since he eurekaclient is dead   and nothing will restart it  nothing will happen anymore beyond this point  the application won't be registered with the eureka server anymore nor any heartbeat will be sent

i suppose i could try that but it doesn't make the above any less of a bug  so    for example if you already have an item stored in a variable   then you can't use the syntax suggested above without resetting the properties of the item inside the variable   also if you have for example  10 lines of lore with specific things stored on certain lines then using one line lore makes modifying the data cumbersome

we actually had this come up during some routine maintenance at hubspot  it actually raises another issue  which i'm not sure how to file  we were swapping a master  with the intent to sustain no downtime   the redis docs recommend setting the replacement as a slave to the old master  making it writeable  directing all traffic to the slave  and then once the old master is not serving any traffic  promoting the slave to master  at this time  we found out that  1  when you  slaveof  http   redis io commands slaveof   the hostname is just a fully qualified domain name  so something like  mountain top subdomain1 subdomain2  is just as valid as an ip address  while the master stores slaves as ip addresses  the slaves stores the master as is  this means the topology provider will hit the slave  fail to parse  and die   2  in order to do a master swap with no downtime  you must write to a slave with read only disabled  lettuce _does not_ support this at all  at present  i think it probably needs a write routing option  with either  master  or  write_enabled_slave_preferred    the former makes sense when swaps may incur downtime  but the latter is required for downtime free swaps

generally  what would be needed in the case of those bridleways would be for people to tag them on osm with the relavent information  so when they are bare earth  they should be tagged using the surface earth or similar  in general  the way type just says whether the way "could" be used  but then the other information is used to actually determine if it is useful for that particular user   i think we could do yhat you suggested and limit the bridleways to be only if they have been tagged as wheelchair    but i believe that tehre are very few that would be tagged that way

yegor  sounds good  the only issue is that with "fully hardcoded" file name you won't be able to run several builds simultaneously  what is usually done on build servers  so i would name this parameter like socketdirectory  which is equal to "data" parameter by default  and use file names like "mysql 2013 12 25 14 00 48  random  sock"   as another alternative  to simplify things for users   you can add parameter like "usetempasdatadir  true false "  if this option is true   a random directory is created inside temp on every build  if this option is false  data is located according to "data" parameter  disadvantage of this solution is that your plugin will be needed to determine "temp" directory location and this is platform dependent thing  don't know whether java allows to do it automatically or not    another solution would be to introduce option like "dataparentdirectory"  user will point you to parent directory like " tmp" or "c  windows temp" and all you need is to create random subdirectory there by yourself  this is easier  but less elegant

hello   i find that the problem was in the system windows 10   i put the same program in ubuntu and it's run well   
there are 3 transceivers   one sends power only   one receives items only  and had 2 chests on 2 sides   the 3rd one  that created the error  was attached to the quarry  and receives power and sends items   after this error  the world would not even load  the server would crash   i used mcedit to remove the quarry and transceiver  i could see the location of the ticking entity in the crash log   and then was able to load the world   i then noticed that the transceiver that receives items mistakenly had a 2nd chest adjacent to it  and removed it so that only 1 chest remained   from that chest me cable is connected to import into an ae network   i then placed the quarry and transceiver again  and no problems   there was severe tick lag just prior to the crash

these are the apps where i started seeing it quite frequently   https   github com kdvolder chatter   that may very well be true  i don't know  but the issue is not whether the app is listening on the port  but whether asking what the port is from the admin bean returns the number of the port rather than 'null'   is it possible that the app starts listening first and then makes that port known to the admin bean asyncly

here is a project that may help you to reproduce this issue   raml 173 zip  https   github com phoenixnap springmvc raml plugin files 1258447 raml 173 zip  procedure    mvn clean install   mvn spring boot run   send a request get to http   localhost 8080 resources a_resource   confirm that the following error is displayed on the app console  in the source code  the controllerdecorator implements controller  but the decorator adds a constraint to one of its argument that make the decorator more strict than the interface  if you remove the link controllerdecorator       controller  the get works  note  you need to use http headers with contraint to generate the right method hope this will help you to find the right solution

unfortunately this issue is different from the one that we have already discussed on the ml  https   groups google com d msg rdf4j users eer3qqwopow hpcyfadyagaj  let me explain   the issue on the ml concerns the project  rdf4j runtime   which is no longer available as a jar artifact  this problem affects dependency management by maven  which i use to build my projects    this issue concerns the project  rdf4j runtime osgi  that should build an osgi bundle containing all classes and resources corresponding to rdf4j's runtime  you can think of this bundle as a sort of fat jar aggregating all rdf4j's jars  without the dependencies  plus some metadata  in  manifest mf   of interest for an osgi framework  i use this bundle when deploying my osgi based applications that use rdf4j   i think that some change in the build process of   rdf4j runtime osgi  has erroneously excluded most classes and resources from the aggregate

 sunix i would distinct two issues here  1  che server token must not be sent to plugin devfile registries  2  add an ability to configure plugin devfile registries as secure  should we use keycloak token for that or another one   it's implementation details   it may seem easy to solve but if we take into account that users may want to use different registries  some maybe not secured by the same keycloak as is used for che server  and che server should be able to access all of them maybe it should be reworked and client should provide everything downloaded  then it does not seem so easy to solve and imho it should be solved separately  if we need it 
hi  setting the limit to 1 is already a good workaround  as there is no need anymore to restart eclipse to free memory   setting a sliding window seems a good solution  since i usualy only dive into the latest lines of  trace  logging  if there is a need to dig into all other logging  a logging file is a good idea  however in most cases the test has stopped at an error  so that is usualy the latest logging  besides that  there is also the possibility to do debugging  so an external file is not a must  thanks for the quick investigation  regards  evert huijben

i will try to make up a simple project that reproduces the problem   but generally i think the flow goes like this    initially there is no session created on the server and no session cookies in the browser    the controller servlet creates a new session and sets an attribute  then throw an exception  thus the error in the response above     a custom exception handler forwards request to an error page  a jsp without      page session "false"

66 for sure   both because it matches the io menu and because  everything  isn't another level down   it does make the 74xx  basic collection strange in the component tree because it breaks them into 3 levels   maybe build separate organizational constructs for each to take advantage of their differences   even when the menu is too tall i can still get to the items via the tree in 0 18release   is there a way to remove the icons from the menu items   maybe only show the last 3 or 5 selected parts in a menu so it has less of a growth factor   then there could be more items before a sub menu is needed

 anishshah101 sorry i didn't come back to you  i will try to elaborate a little bit more although as  tarelli  said if you are starting to fix some bugs this is not one of the easiest  the problem has to do with the way we are loading the dom and executing the jquery  if you want to execute some jquery commands on a html component you usually need to embed the jquery command in a     we are doing something wrong because sometimes we are trying to execute a command on the console component  i e   this  https   github com openworm org geppetto frontend blob master src main webapp js geppetto console js#l277  and the dom is not ready  console is null   therefore a js error occurs  some components  simulation buttons  zoom in out  etc  are not loaded in the layout and the console can't be opened  it is a random error i guess because it depends on many things internet speed  local js processing  elements being loaded asyncronous    this error may potentially happen in a different line also because of async execution   if you finally try to fix this bug let me know if i can be of any help  this time i will be faster in answering you

ok i feel that we are missing the point here  let's ignore the round to nearest second and the fact that we do have sub second ticks and also the fact that we get many  many ticks per day    we're talking  in a carl sagan voice  "billionzz and billionzz" of rows in the database   whether the time period is ms  sek  minutes  days  years or centuries shouldn't matter btw  every time period has an open close and high low  as well as total volume  this is what i understood your tick class was handling  by having an addtrade   method for all trades that occur within the tick period    anyhow  we are using ta för intraday trading  and i was testing your framework on our data  by doing a quick hack of the tradingbotonmovingtimeseries java example  it immediately gave exceptions on "cannot add a tick with end time    to series end time"   i read trades from the database for a whole day  symbol  timestamp  price and qty  and feed it into the program  in this particular testcase i had about 34000 trades  a few of them has the same timestamp  whether the timeseries period is 1 second  10 minutes or 1 hour shouldn't matter  right  for the sake of argument  i created ticks with period 1 minute and 1 hour too  but got exactly the same exceptions   since it occurred every time we had two trades with the same timestamp  so i started to see if i could find a way around the problem   the tick class computes begintime as the given time  stored in endtime  minus the period  doesn't this complicate matters when you add trades sequentially  wouldn't it be a lot easier if you took the given time as begintime and set endtime to begintime + period  since you normally have trades in time order with increasing timestamp  how else can i test that "this timestamp" belongs to the "current tick" or if i should create a new tick  i must have misunderstood something here   thats why i had the "lasttick inperiod d " call  to see if my tick was to be added to the current tick object  else i would create a new tick for the next timeperiod  also  the rounding was just trying to avoid the problem with the endtime begintime i mentioned earlier    so  to clearify  we are not talking hft and we are talking intraday ta  of course in coop with other proprietary analysis   i just want to be able to feed in my data with duplicate timestamps

 fullwall arm_swing is so fast you can't necessarily see the effect  try  start_use_offhand_item  while its holding a shield in offhand  that lasts varyingly between 0 seconds and half a second

somebody touched memorystatusbar java and made a change to how the value was being saved but didn't notice that there was a public method used to access it       no worries   easy fix 
hi ritchie   here is something    not quite a unit test  but close enough    this is  the test code i used myself  and the simple fits output it produces   i hope this helps     i'm a little snowed in with work until late september  at least  so i  cannot offer much help    not it the short term  at least    but  if it  turns out to be hairy to fix without breaking other things  i can  probably help out a bit starting in october     if you or someone else can fix it before  all the better     thanks      a

thanks for the fix   yes i'm a big kotlin fan  and i'm very pleased to see that you're working on improving this library for kotlin devs   thanks to you for your work on this library 
same issue   sorry  i had also tested that  should have included in comment as well   i have a test project setup  just not sure where to upload it  i can great a public github repo if it helps  is pretty straight forward though 
sorry    a  sudo find  users mats    grep digital_  didn't uncover any files except a bunch of pdf scans of old books 
yes  even tried clearing partition cache to see if that will change anything but still didn't work 
now it is back  haven't done anything since my last try  really don't know the reason  it was persistent after a reboot  after installing different versions etc  – and now it works again

i can try that  but we run builds once a day  so i wouldn't have results until tomorrow 
works perfectly  would you be happy to release  rc3  as well please   thanks a lot   ps i don't know if you want me to close these tickets now or you'll close it after creating the final release
well  when using the web ui  the save to json and save to csv buttons no longer work  they pop up in a weird location and nothing happens when you click on them  i'm sorry if that's generic  not sure how to be more specific 
 chochreiner the "related articles" tab is always disabled 
sure  i have here android system web view version 74 0 3729 186
i am also not fully sure  is the check   isencryptedfile     done after obtaining the permission 
i'll contact the customer now 
thanks for the quick response  unfortunately it behaves the same way 
no  his comment after the proposed solution is  "but i decided not include these changes into library " which i don't understand  as it's a valid issue  perhaps most users of his app don't return the text that the mythtv services api does  or  most people don't search the protocol for rsts

 eivantsov ah  great idea  how can i enable debug mode for postgres 
do we need to throw an intermittent exception  perhaps just at startup  or when it fails  is enough

hi  thanks for the quick response   yes  i think the problem seems to be related to the slidingmenu problems  here is the issue on github   https   github com jfeinstein10 slidingmenu issues 680  below are the screenshots from genymotion 5 0  nexus 4     menu closed     actionbar1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6816070 5372576 5c28b096 804b 11e4 9698 110f0d1e6e2e png    menu opened     actionbar2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6816070 5372577 5fe5487a 804b 11e4 939c c47a5de0288d png   as you can see  the problem exists only when the menu is hidden   i've made a fork  https   github com mack369 androidresidemenu you can check out the problem there  it works with android studio 1 0 and the problem is visible under genymotion's nexus4 5 0

hi kyle   i've asked andrea to reply if she has time  if she is not able  i'll get back to you after my next trip  beginning tomorrow   after i've tried to re construct the path to the errors  note  a couple of other achieves have been built since the update and they are fine 
sure  we have many custom plugin that we developed for us  but the common one are   banmanager  chestshop  citizens  denizen  deathmessagesprime  dynmap  entitylwc  farmlimiter  fastasyncworldedit  holographicdisplays  iconomy  logblock  multiverse  nocheatplus  pex  playersql  protocollib  simplepets  supertrails  supervanish  vault  worldborder  worldedit  worldguard   originally i've tested luckperms with version 4 1 87 and this version still works fine 
the crash is avoided but there is no solution to handle the situation correctly  i e  continue with merging  
thanks for the quick fix 
store the precision and scale in the system table   they're already declared in the schema  but you'll need to add then to metadataclient insert_column and set the values in metadataclient java where this is used  during createtable and addcolumn   you'll also have to modify metadataendpointimpl gettable    the routine that builds a ptable in the coprocessor implementation class  take a look at how the expected key values are declared and used starting at line 117  and how the optional column column_size_index is handled at line 237 
here you have  1  yes  the decryption was successful  and the crash happens once the decrypted text is displayed and you tap on it  2  the message is signed  3  nfc authentication is disabled   more information  the test was done in a nexus 4  with the android 5 1 1 stock version and the encrypted data was copied from gmail application

gc2bhv1  sorry 
 npark mozilla thanks for checking   vesta0  i just tried it on geckoview and still seeing the issue   can we sync up a few mins on vidyo tomorrow   would like to see if we're using same str to arrive at result 
 nezihyigitbasi i'm pretty sure that  c  does not precede  À   at least for a decent number of languages  if i'm not mistaken  the "naive" sorting will always put special characters after the "normal" ones due to the order on the utf 8 table  to have proper ordering of text  you need to use a collator    i don't necessarily agree that the min max statistics should have the correct alphabetic ordering  but if more writers have the same default behaviour as the spark one  presto should at least have an option to deal with it  i'll check if hive also generates that same statistics for my data and i'll report back  thanks for the quick answers 
that reasoning is correct  but the behaviour does not follow that exactly  sometimes the ui shows a panel as selected  e g  the focus is in the filter box  but ctrl+w wont close it unless an issue is selected in that panel  yes  closing a panel should move focus to another panel

it's very strange  i did not find any crash log 
error message  execution of cql or elm statement named  adult  failed due to error  cannot perform differencebetween operation with arguments of type 'org opencds cqf cql runtime datetime' and 'org opencds cqf cql runtime date'    cql 
either for it to ignore the body and respond with the settings or provide a relevant exception saying that sending body is not allowed with this api
ok  will test again with new nightly as soon as i go out for caching 
the headless flag was intended to allow the plugin to run without issue on headless jvms for docker   but a user might have some plugin that requires to have headless false even in non gui mode   so i think previous behavior should be restored   thanks
 valodim sorry i haven't been keeping up  i haven't been getting github's emails for some reason  i've forwarded it now  and thank you 
it basically stopped placing blocks   say for the building gadget  the ghost preview of the placement of a column would render but when right clicking nothing would occur   no blocks would be removed from inventory  nothing would render into the world  and no blocks would be placed   i've got some free time today to try to isolate and repeat the issue 
where are the permissions

with accurate you mean something like a warmroast  unfortunatly i only have had timings with paper  but these don't show exactly where the problem lies and instead just showed playerupdatetask as cause    maybe i can organize a warmroast next week  but i can't promise it  as i never used it before and it seems at least somewhat complicated to make it run     ps  i do understand that the task is just calling some default minecraft code and is not really at fault  but it would be nonetheless nice to be able to disable it if the features needing it aren't even used   

when  shouldusedummysurface  is returning false the anr doesn't occur

 dariuszaniszewski the delay is not used in "production"  it's more when i have to debug stuff with the actual device   here the core of the packet writer i usually use     the operation goes farther  i'm able to write about between 6 and 14 lines but at some point  operation hangs and transfer stops hitting the timeout exception   i know the transfer is happening since there is a led blinking on the peripheral when transfer is in progress   just not sure why the operation hangs like this 
 simonbasle the problem is with how  wip  counter is used in serializedsink  if  sink next t   throws   wip decrementandget this   is never executed and all subsequent executions will only enqueue the object and return      similar problem can happen within drain loop   it is assumed that  wip  will be always zero after  drainloop    completes  but it is not guaranteed in case any of callbacks throws an exception   i also believe it is not the only place where similar approach is used and the code assumes that callbacks will never throw an exception

i'm using eclipse  and it err on the above code it's the same if i replace it with a simple integer   i imported  import com jjoe64 graphview graphview  import com jjoe64 graphview graphviewdatainterface  import com jjoe64 graphview graphviewseries  import com jjoe64 graphview graphview graphviewdata  import com jjoe64 graphview graphviewseries graphviewseriesstyle  import com jjoe64 graphview linegraphview   thank you
assuming theres only one country  you should need a drop of 0 995 in the first year   but you know what   maybe that is fine for the moment   some countries will still need to reduce to get themselves back to near 1990 levels   leave it  for the moment 

thats what we currently use  with hikari dev from 12  sep  the database name gets ignored  however i just tried hikari dev from today to check the threadlocal leak bugfix and it seems to work well  db name is honored now

i tried " u0004"  eof   " n n"  " r r"  " u0000" but without luck — they are copied by  cat  to stdout as ordinary characters and the process doesn't end 
on my win10 workstation the test crashes after 19 seconds with a stackoverflow  but the stack size on windows is much lower than on linux  like only 250   i tried the same test in an ubuntu 16 vm with 5gb  there the test runs for a whole minute  then it crashes with      testcase name "stresstest" classname "org dizitart testing nitritestresstest" time "59 335"       failure message "java lang outofmemoryerror  gc overhead limit exceeded" type "java lang outofmemoryerror" java lang outofmemoryerror  gc overhead limit exceeded 	at org h2 mvstore page splitnode page java 400  	at org h2 mvstore page split page java 371  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 205  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211    on java version "1 8 0_131" java tm  se runtime environment  build 1 8 0_131 b11  java hotspot tm  64 bit server vm  build 25 131 b11  mixed mode   again inside a a page split loop in mvstore mvmap put where the problem seems to be in     protected object put page p  long writeversion  object key  object value                                      page c   p getchildpage index  copy writeversion           if  c getmemory     store getpagesplitsize      c getkeycount     1                   split on the way down             int at   c getkeycount     2              object k   c getkey at               page split   c split at               p setchild index  split               p insertnode index  k  c                  now we are not sure where to add             return put p  writeversion  key  value                     object result   put c  writeversion  key  value           p setchild index  c           return result          it looks like it's creating maps of only 11 records  after 11 records it splits the map  adds them as child node to the current page and self calls the method  no wonder that after 15000 records the stack goes 1363 calls deep and the map containers occupy more space than the actual data  something is very wrong here anyway  when i put a breakpoint in line " if  c getmemory     store getpagesplitsize      c getkeycount     1   " i see that for every insert it stops a few times on this line  6 times for the first insert  and for every two new inserts after that it stops there one additional time  increasing the page size by a factor 1000 might help  but the whole concept of getting a deeper call stack for every other insert seems very wrong  please put your breakpoint on mvmap line 201 and see if you get the same behavior

as i said about the plugins  it does not matter what for plugins are on the server  with an fresh config where   only   the force login is turned off it workes fine  but after i also change other things to false the plugin decide to be annoying    servert version  spigot 1 12 2  but sure  if you still wnna know the plugin list  https   pastebin com imfpuy6r  and so i tested it now  even if you only have authme and protocolib  you have still the same issue 
thanks  no  i did not—it works once i follow the instructions  there's no link to this page on the suse tab of the download pages  we should add it  like we have for the other linux environments

hi  bsideup   initial test "passes"  but there are several logs like this    it reproduces all the time on my pc    but before making it reproducible  i played  around with  sc  properties and delays    i've updated tc so it will fail test 
inconsistent locking is pretty much always a bad practice  per jcip    listener registrations can occur while a revision is being inserted 
 andre601 yes  although i did not remove the pex folder just in case it didn’t work  only the  jar   sub sent with  a href "http   githawk com" githawk  a   sub

its happening on api level 19 and 17 lenovo tablet and techno 
i think that gradle's dependency resulution is working fine  here is the relevant part of "gradle dependencies" when the tomcat module is excluded  so all the jetty related dependencies are there  but the spring boot application does not serve web content    see below for auto configuration report
the missing input file is because you need need to prebuild the compiler via  scripts prebuild binaries sh  or build with    define yaspl_bootstrap true  to actually build the main compiler using the bootstrap compiler  my bad for missing that in the instructions   it looks like it is still broken with 0 18 0

i think it is a bug     think about the following request flow   you make a request for adding an user and expects that it forwards to users listing adding an user uses the post method  and listing users uses the get method     it doesn't work  you have to accept post method in listing in order to fix it   in redirections it works    but i think that redirections work only to get methods

hey  i made a repository with a sample app with which i have managed to reproduce the issue 100  of times provided i follow these   exact steps     https   github com andreiharasemiuc android job rescheduling issue sample  1  launch the app 2  app will wait 10 seconds  handler postdelayed  and schedule an exact job with a delay of 20 seconds  3  at the moment you see in the logs that the job has been scheduled  close off the app from recent tasks  4  in 20 seconds the job will run  the job will do 2 things  show a notification   schedule another job with a delay of 1 minute  5  when the job runs and the notification is displayed  immediately click the notification  clicking the notification will take you to an empty activity  as soon as that activity opens  background the app   result  the second job that you just scheduled  with a delay of 1 minute  will run with a delay of 0 seconds soon after you background the app   please note that the sample app does not use _1 2 0 alpha3_ because i had some weird errors and couldn't buld the project and didn't have time to see what they were about  so i used _1 1 11_   however    i succesfully added _1 2 0 alpha3_ in my main project and i could still reproduce the issue just like before 
 michalgr the newest version  0 5 3  and all versions are same   the png some bytes was not correct  i can not avoid all png images which app loaded are right format   if any image was corrupted  all images followed can not be loaded  following log  non callback was done 
sorry for the delay in response  but yeah seems like it is with all mega evolved pokemobs going by the values under "scale" and seeing them visually grow bigger  the values keep increasing every time they are returned to their pokecube and haven't been reverted back to non mega forms first 
tested without essentialsx on  the spawner still turns into a pig  tested with latest experimental builds  spawner now places correctly  thank you for fixing 
 krzyk there are intermittent results   failure success   within unit tests that have something to do with creating files in the  temp  dir in my computer     the same error messages may appear on    apache maven 3 2 1    apache maven 3 2 5  and  apache maven 3 3 3   i also experience a similar problem at  https   github com yegor256 takes issues 506
hi  luigidellaquila  maybe it was bug _github com_  do you see my issue completely  like this   issue  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7984378 12445599 d7d54512 bf6d 11e5 95f6 ce5e357dc66b jpg   because my friend from other country sees my issue like this    badissue  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7984378 12445906 c6737e54 bf6f 11e5 806d 876559e40de8 jpg

of course   
hi  the validate   api throws an ioexception  so we are forced to catch it  or rethrow   but the problem is when a response different than xml is obtained  we get xml parsing exception which is of type org xml sax saxparseexception  so our catch block will fail when this exception occurs  unless we are catching exception which mostly is not the case   ideally  the api should wrap every exception to ioexception itself with proper cause  detail  explanation and reason set so that the api can be used with confidence without having any side effects  the validationresponse may include methods to provide such additional information   also on a side note the main page for jacabi w3c should mention all the dependencies  only minimal set  to run this validation service properly  the minimal set of jars  aspectjrt 1 8 4 jar httpmime 4 3 jar jcabi log 0 15 1 jar jcabi xml 0 13 jar slf4j api 1 7 5 jar hamcrest core 1 3 jar jcabi aspects 0 20 1 jar jcabi manifests 1 1 jar jersey client 1 18 1 jar slf4j log4j12 1 7 7 jar hamcrest library 1 3 jar jcabi http 1 9 2 jar jcabi matchers 1 3 jar jersey core 1 18 1 jar validation api 1 1 0 final jar httpcore 4 3 jar jcabi immutable 1 3 jar jcabi w3c 2 0 snapshot jar log4j 1 2 17 jar

hi  apologies for the misleading issue above i have finally reproduced with curl  i had missed something from my mapping previously   this seems to be cause by nested fields  in the last step outlined below there are 2 results  if the mapping for entitycontent is removed then there are no results  this is correct   n b  not sure if this helps or not but this is a regression from 1 7 3 caught by one of our tests as part of me upgrading to 2 1 0  steps

after my initial post i realised that anything after 37  or perhaps 47  might not be supported  so i refactored all of the colors in my script to range of 30 to 37   the problem is the exact same  it still only removes the escape sequences  it does not replace them with colors  using these same codes with just 'echo  e' works fine  so i believe this is python specific   i call the python script with ' u' to disable caching  and print with      just to be extra sure      the user profile that runs the script has its default shell set to  usr bin sh  i've tried using ' e'  ' 033' and ' x1b'

what do you mean by it does not fit in the screen  the problem is caused by the has_child filter  the filter works fine by it's on   i removed some parts of the filter and removed indentation so you can see the filter

"does the  real  test actually need to execute the real code of some methods  while others are mocked " correct  "null is the default result for any method returning a reference type  so recording "result   null" for them is redundant  or is there something i missed " yeah  that's just for this test code   not null in the real code
hi   i have just been testing again and i've found out that the issue is not related to the specific faction claim land  materials with one durability such as endstone do not blow up in this occasion http   prntscr com 7o04g8  vertical wall   but  the endstone does blow up when the the wall is horizontal  http   prntscr com 7o05j6   server version  paper spigot 1 8 7 obsidiandestroyer version  4 3 9 snapshot factions version  2 7 5  thanks  frozon 
in backpack put an 2 tool in slots under them  pressed the shift key  scrolled the mouse wheel went crashes 
i still seem to get this issue occasionally  and i believe this is more due to us using multiple repositories   in the instance i had this morning  a code review i was looking at had a parent commit that was not in my local repository  so the object references didn't exist   if i manually did a fetch from gerrit then the plugin worked   when the gerrit intellij plugin does a fetch from gerrit as you click thru reviews  is that fetching directly into my local repository or just fetching in memory  i suspect something like the later   
sheesh  has it been a month already  sorry for taking so long   as of the latest tic build  this doesn't seem to occur  thanks for keeping this mod maintained   now i just need to figure out why my modpack can't load a world on the newer forge versions so i can update tic   edit  updating mods is important  the pack loads now

 findepi  it is the same for unpartitioned table    there is no  connectortablelayout#getnodepartitioning  so i'm a bit confused   actualproperties#getnodepartitioning  is not empty  and  connectortablelayout#gettablepartitioning  is not empty either  hope i'm looking at the right method   looks like the remote exchange is added here  https   github com prestodb presto blob 7dfbe1be3c61455047827335c5dadd94125e0c48 presto main src main java com facebook presto sql planner optimizations addexchanges java#l309 l311    after we checked  isstreampartitionedon   yet in  visitaggregation    https   github com prestodb presto blob 7dfbe1be3c61455047827335c5dadd94125e0c48 presto main src main java com facebook presto sql planner optimizations addexchanges java#l232  i do see that we also checked  isnodepartitionedon    in addition to  isstreampartitionon      for window function  if  partition by  columns include columns the node is partitioned on  i think a local exchange should suffice

why i propose to have 2 types of comments  annotated and not annotated   because i want to have comments that both look nice in the  k source code and produce nice latex  whenever possible  if i want to use a latex special character in comments  i don't want to escape it like     it don't look nice anymore  i don't want to see in k comments statements like "performace increased by 5   " moreover it is easy to forget to annotate such characters  now if latex backend would know to annotate such characters automatically  then we would have the same text in latex as in comments   however  this approach is not applicable in all cases  sometimes we want to add specific latex formatting in our comments  like  begin itemize   item  end itemize   in this cases we need a different latex comment marker  to instruct latex not to annotate special characters   why i spent one hour  well just try the example i wrote on the beginning of the topic  looks like latex backend put   on the same line with the code generated for endmodule  and broken the latex document 
feel free to take a stab at it  i'm just collecting the issues right now 
hi  i think it might have been a problem on my end    i ended up deleting and recreating the  pgd  works great so far  but i'll reopen if i run into problems again 
first  i has installed the plugin from jetbrain's repository  then i generate the  jar from github  master version  by idea 14 and installed it  overwriting the previous version     the doubt that i have is that i do not know if it was the other way around  first the master version and then i has returned to the repository version of jetbrain   and finally  i returned to the master version  
yes   i'm using the chcp cli tool  it just happened again on my config js file   starting to think it's with generated files somehow  my css file is generated from a preprocessor and some gulp tasks updated the config file  the other 20 some odd files that i manually updated match   it's almost as if generated files from windows get a different hash from the objective c function  i've verified all files from the server match the hash in the manifest 
it shows the normal response   if replace initrediscluster         initredissingle      the log didn't show exception     but it also didn't return the result 
interesting  now it seems to work for me also  but i have seen this problem on another project  might it be the case that the ordering of plugin execution within maven phase is not well defined 
basically  red plug in is working fine  it just throws the syntax exception 
adding a constructor to the builder that takes  blobinfo  makes sense to me

i'll check that next time it happens but if it isn't a bug with chromecast discovery then why would a chromecast have both services one minute and only dial a minute later  and why would two phones on the same network get different services at the same time  and why would calling stop   start   on the discovery manager make this happen every time 
 mjpt777 thanks for the quick response   i can verify that the fix to the statusmessageflyweight has stopped it causing a jvm crash   i did however hit one further alignment issue when starting the mediadriver in the cncfiledescriptor which also causes a jvm crash   it looks like the client_liveness_timeout_field_offset needs a 4 byte pad  but this would break the cnc compatibility and would need to follow your version strategy i expect

everything works perfectly in single player  i figured  well mcpc+ has updated a few times  there had been no mention of any enderio related fixes but  let's try it out anyways   i placed a long run of cable  fifteen or more blocks   attached everything exactly as i had in my original picture and sure enough  it is working    i am now using version 0 5 0 98 of enderio with version 4 2 1 of buildcraft on mcpc+ version 160    here's a picture of it up and running  http   i imgur com 8bkxlnw png  thank you for getting back to me  i'm sorry i can't give you anything more concrete then "poof  it's working now"  i've gotten used to things breaking and  subsequently fixing  it comes with the territory  running one hundred and sixty four mods together  mcpc+ of course  has always been a bit wonky 
thanks for your efforts  xmd5a2  the data were generated with srtm2osm  as described in a comment in the linked osmandmapcreator issue  but all ids were positive  though close to 2 63  since i wanted to use a larger area in my garmin map  i created the elevation data again for a larger area  but now with smaller ids  some 2 40 for nodes  less for ways   a smaller maximum length for ways  319   and used a fresh geofabrik extract also  now  all ids stayed constant during the process  i checked the original id in josm for one object  and the final id after osmandmapcreator process for the same object  137 439 087 617   the issue prevails   but i found a new hint  lines which are shown are open  while lines which are not shown are closed  oddly  this does not happen with building and islands consisting of circular ways   is there some "flag" required to treat closed ways as lines instead of e g  areas 
i was missing a config file in the classpath  i expected it to fail gracefully

it's fairly simple to test    just create a web worker js file with the following       watch the javascript console to see the errors   essentially  dojo and jquery both attempt to use items that are not available to web worker scripts  window  document  etc   the likely correct answer is to use an alternative library implementation designed specifically for use within the limited web worker environment  with the acknowledgement that doing so might mean limiting some of the sdk features  authentication might get a bit weird  for instance     this would not necessarily be a simple fix  unfortunately

 mayankgarg1990 you're right  json is not orderable  in that case  i don't have a good solution except for falling back to a regular checksum  we can still apply array sort to structured type but have a regular checksum as a fallback  this allows to handle the most kinds of scenarios    for array of orderable structured type 
shouldn't add imports it was text from the same file  i just copied a line  not sure about the second 
in the 1 61  the second solution was working well  so i'm more up to stick into this solution

all i can say that it's 100  reproducible on my android  and it's "introduced" with 1 9 1  i'm using connectbot for years now  never seen before   as i've never developed anything for on android  do you have any ideas how we could "sure fire" this  any chance to trace debug log gui activity

stephan  thanks for so many good suggestions so quickly  i will definitely try those breakpoints  at the moment  the ear is working perfectly  of course    so i will have to wait until it fails again  as to ear  tom's project is a war and he is seeing the same behavior  so i don't think it's likely to be a packaging issue    one other thing i do notice is that when the app is failing  the screen comes back very very fast  much faster than when it is working correctly  the difference is only a second or two  but it seems like the speed may be because the renderer is skipping things  just one more piece of the puzzle to mull over    thanks again

it's hard to clarify since english is not my primary language    but basically 1  if a player knows the username of a player that is  rich  or got a lot of stuff 2  that player still have to know the password to log in and do the bad things 3  but before  2   they might need to know if that username is worth griefing or not by using this bug a  if that username is worth griefing  then they will use some password leaking tools and waiting it to be cracked that is downloadable on the internet  b  if that username is not worth griefing  they may stop do it at first glance in inventory  4  if they can't use this bug  they'll need to hack this account first  if it success but that username doesn't have the prize  it'll be their failure  every account in their glance should be hacked again and again  why i want this bug to be fixed  hacker is doing bad things  they should work harder to get the prize  or they will not get it  not just knowing that username had a prize then spend 10 hours of breaking it easily without thousand hours  of course there's a chance  that player is hidden their treasure before log out  but i want to make it impossible to exploit or there's a big chance that i'll not use  authme reload anymore  but it's inconvenience that i have will to run it 24 7  speaking of the " authme reload" command  is this bug related to " reload" command or sort of autosaveworld plugins  so each update might be recommended a full restart  i haven't tested it so i can't tell  if this bug exist it'll even more inconvenience

the purpose is achieved on the second case as i'm getting ok on overall execution  although is not really user friendly and can lead to doubts if the user is looking to the execution for the first time  i wouldn't reach this solution honestly but it was suggested by filipe and made the trick  in my modest opinion my suggestion would be simpler to understand  when a property is not calculated following some condition it should be considered as it wouldn't exist   although i understand that fa should be generated on the second case because it fails to get a certain element i wouldn't know how to work around this type of case  so maybe can be useful to leave it like this 
checkout #425   we created the configuration at one of the first meetings of the course  i don't have a case  you probably assume some statement type somewhere where it could be also if statement 
hi terrymanu   it's 4 0 0  i just cloned the master branch  as mentioned  only _select_ statements can be performed   thanks  parsa

config catalog is very much like spycarbasic and has been verified with the load tool and getbaseplans   call  calls made were createtenant  createaccount  createsubscription  getaccount   what is supposedly 'wrong'  maybe nothing  i was under the impression that the balance is supposed to reflect the customer's outstanding liability is that incorrect    after looking into this a bit more  i think your client getaccount "externalkey"  has a bug  maybe you are using a    instead of  equals ""

ok great   was just about to upload the build log  but i guess not necessary now 
sorry  was writing from phone and forgot to add the info  edited first post to include it  unfortunately i cannot provide you with a debug log as i already removed the new version from phone as it already maxed out my data plan for this month  but it should be easy to reproduce 
unfortunately i don't have the environment or the data anymore so i'm not sure how many segments there were   as for nulls  i'm not sure  we don't really process the data  it's more of a load test 
yes it works now 
 fleshgrinder you are correct in this case  but if we use short ternary we can get error on undefined variable  but with constructions like  isset    empty        we should never get error on undefined variable    p s i saw  rentalhost report issue related to empty  isset and    oprator
actually  i may have jumped the gun with this issue   i'm not exactly sure how i managed to fix this issue  but it actually works fine   i did recently update my android studio  maybe somehow this is related   i will post again if the issue reoccurs    sorry about that 
exactly  i even upgraded to 3 3 4 but eventually downgraded because of  https   github com querydsl querydsl issues 772  this apt issue has been following me for literally years  but i have  finally reported it  best regards   luis fernando planella gonzalez

the error appears randomly on the console   i dont exactly know how to replicate it
currently i don't have one because it didn't work so far so i abandoned this thing   e g   for using sprintf and sscanf  stdio h would have to be #included  or it shoudn't work    but if they are needed and stdio h had been  #included   then  all ansi standard features also should have to be provided  e g   float formatting    in case a nano user would not like to have these full features but just some basic ones he should have to #include a different smaller lib    let's call it nanoio h  feat  a  sprintf_nano derivative of smaller memory claims  this argument was often heard when talking about the "full features"   for  h and  c files i just don't see how to save or open such a file in the editor window additionally in an additional tab window   i can't write code and save it to a file named "myheader h"   and if my current dir contains 2 files  e g  sdfgetsdemo ino ansitools h i can't even find the header file listed using the file_open menu   and if i currently start sketch i get a program "bareminimum" pattern  if i designed it to be a header then i can't "save_as" by a name like myheader h or ansitools h   that's roughly what it is about

hi  npomfret  unfortunately it still doesn't work   today  with the current production code  on a iphone 6+  ios 9 3 3 with 3000 contacts  my function that use the getall with thumbnails takes around 17s 
 eivantsov i created a normal user and everything works now  i think the problem is running as root  problem not a good idea to run as root anyways 
i've tried 3 times  yeah

this problems devices take from comments our app in google play by google play developer console

i haven't been able to reproduce since so i suspect it may be related to the matrix org issues    would this require a network request to something other than my homeserver or google itself  is it intended that this block the client from starting up or running at all 
yes
after first launching a new workspace with this stack   runtime   recipe   i did use two che ide terminals    terminal 1 on dev machine    terminal 2 on rt machine you can see the commands and flow on the screen shot below  what i  have done  via eclipse che ide terminals i used both terminals to navigate  cd  to  projects folder  initially  projects is empty  visible via ls  la on both terminals   then on terminal 2  rt machine  i create a file via touch fil   file gets created and is visible in  projects in both terminals  creating file via touch from terminal 1  dev machine  is refused with permission denied  using sudo touch file is working  the second created file  from dev machine created  is visiible on rt machine  projects folder via ls  la  unfortunately attaching screen shot seems not to work here in my comment      at least something noticable  while on the rt machine there is only the user _root_ on the dev machine  eclipse ubuntu_jre based  there is a user _user_ and _root_  by default on dev machine  user is logged in in bash  in eclipse che terminal  by default on rt machine  root is logged in in bash   in eclipse che terminal

then if i make a change to templates date html and refresh the browser the change is not shown   of course changes to the ratpack groovy script refresh fine   also touching the ratpack groovy script will cause the cache to be discarded so the template change will show up   i don't think changing the cachesize to default to zero is a great idea but is a reasonable workaround for simple dev purposes   the behavior i'd like to see is for the template file timestamp to be checked and compared to the cache's timestamp for that template with a switch to disable the timestamp checking   i was looking at the code and started to work up a patch  but i don't have time to finish it at the moment   i think the easiest way to implement this is to change the compiledtemplatecache to cache string  compiledtemplate  and make the key be the timestamp + separator + file path   the timestamp will just be 0 when checking is disabled   would you like me to finish the patch and submit it later or is something you want to deal with yourself

nope  singleplayer   if you're suspecting it's a multiplayer issue  i e  other guys on the other ends of some other computers   i am only using this mod on my singleplayer world  if you're thinking about a more strictly server related issue    well  i am suspecting one of the mods i installed messes around with the internal server  although i've got no actual proof of that  it's "fastcraft"  it's supposed to make your playing a bit smoother  but i know neither what it does nor how it does it  sometimes i get block lag  so maybe     i think i should also note that in my f3 screen i can see a "multiplayer chunk cache"  i don't have a single clue about either what mod is using it or what it is for  maybe i'm a bit rusty on my vanilla and there's always been such a cache  even in a sp  but i think not   i am talking as a complete noob  so maybe whatever i just said makes no sense whatsoever  in which case you are allowed to yell at me  i thought i'd let you know anyways  i found fastcraft here  if it helps  http   forum industrial craft net index php page thread threadid 10820  i also just downloaded the new 1 12 version  i was using 1 9 till now   i'll see what it comes out of it  if the cow still doesn't eat  i'll try deleting the mod entirely and see if my computer and moo can compromise on that  i'll report again tomorrow 
i have one primary node and 3 replica   when failover happens  the following is logged by redisson    "time" "2019 01 10t16 08 35 968 0800" "fullmessage" "detected dns change  master rediss   xxxxx usw2 cache amazonaws com 6379 has changed ip from 10 153 99 49 to 10 153 99 219" "loggername" "org redisson connection dnsmonitor" "thread" "redisson netty 1 12" "severity" "info"   it seems to me that redisson did identify the changes  but when i ran " netstat  nt   sort +5   fgrep  6379   grep  n  "  i saw redisson sent "syn_sent" to previous primary node even redisson had already "established" connection with new primary node  once failover completed  it took about 10 mins   redisson "established" connection with previous primary node as well  33 connections to previous primary node  34 connections to new primary node   another thing i noticed is that the following two calls seem using different connection pools  redissonclient getmapcache "foo"  get key  always uses pool which points to new primary node   redissonclient getmapcache "foo"  size   always uses pool which points to previous primary node  after failover happens  in about minute  get key  starts to work  but size    keeps on throwing "slaveconnectionpool no available redis entries" error   the reason i'm trying not to use individual node is that if we need to add new node or delete a node  i don't want to restart app with new node configuration  we used aws redis  cluster mode disabled   the primary node can handle both read and write  the other nodes are mainly for failover

discussed in fixitfriday   we've decided that we want to keep the  lte  adjustment and to fix it to follow the following rules      lte  adjustment only happens if rounding appears in the date math expression  eg  now d  or  2017 01 01 14 53 12   h    rounding is implemented as a floor operation on the date  using the specified unit   then  any other calculations are applied  eg  +2h +10m    etc   the smallest unit mentioned in the date math expression should be used for the  lte  adjustment    for example       lte  now d  rounds down to midnight  then adds 24 hours minus 1ms       lte  now d+2h  rounds down to midnight  adds two hours  then adds 1 hour minus 1 ms      lte  now h + 1d  rounds down to the nearest hour  adds 24 hours  then adds 1 hour minus 1ms  this probably requires a significant rewrite of our date math parser

hello  vietj  i suspect this happens if the host name  of the client  happens to be an internal network name and not exposed to the outside world  that's a guess based on the use case which seems to have triggered this  it's a bit late in the night for me here  so i haven't had a chance to experiment with it and reproduce this in a more isolated fashion  i'll probably find some time tomorrow evening and see if i can provide an isolated reproducer for this 
most likely not before next week  in the meantime you can disable the display stand  this should allow you to start without crashing 
apologies for the long reply but these are taken form my notes from debugging the differences and i thought they might help you pinpoint the issue         i've further debugged the stacktrace for my app with both the old and new library versions  and with the new libraries tried my parameter type as both  longparam  and  optionallong    combinations tested   1  dropwizard 1 3 16 and  longparam  2  dropwizard 2 0 0 and  longparam  3  dropwizard 2 0 0 and  optionallong    my initial comment that  this line in  singlevalueextractor   https   github com eclipse ee4j jersey blob 2 29 1 core server src main java org glassfish jersey server internal inject singlevalueextractor java#l61  was where the error occurred was wrong    one difference is that in 1  the  1 3 16 version of  abstractparamconverter fromstring   https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob release 1 3 x dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverterprovider java#l49  does an explicit call to  com google common base strings isnullorempty value    and so returns  null  for empty string  this check here seems to be responsible for making it then use the default value   this has changed in  2 0 0  https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob v2 0 0 dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverterprovider java  and it no longer has a check for empty string  however from the traces above it doesn't actually appear to be called called anymore   the trace for 2  calls through to  io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverter t  fromstring  instead   and there's  no empty string checking here  https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob release 2 0 x dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverter java#l36    it just blows up with the exception    similarly in case 3    io dropwizard jersey optional optionallongparamconverterprovider optionallongparamconverter fromstring string    https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob release 2 0 x dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey optional optionallongparamconverterprovider java#l30  has no explicit empty string check  the parse error results in an  optionallong empty  as detailed earlier   so there appears to be no equivalent code in 2 0 0  at least with the rest of my config  that does this explicit empty string check for either 2  or 3  that appears needed to get it to then use the deafult value       does that give you any ideas what it might be or how to fix this  or does this differ from your hellow world example if you set breakpoints and debug from here    if not i'll take a look at trying to create a simple reproduceable for this          i've checked the gradle build scan for my application and all dropwizard dependencies are at 2 0 0  for test 2  and 3

yes  i had worldguard  build version 1722  the latest build version  as of replying this message   the dev builds are from here   http   builds enginehub org job worldguard branch string ids
this is definitely a real increase and it happens with the antennapod ui as well as when using my headphones' play button  this is on lollipop on a samsung s4  no similar issue occurs with other apps 
i am using version 0 11 6  intellij version 2016 1 1 build 145 597  osx el capitan
as an investor in both mycelium and steem  i'd like to insist on this feature to be fixed and not have those coins ignored 
i found an instruction file  centos6 quickstart txt  in the 'doc' directory  with the help of this file i finally launched the project    new question    it seems that zipkin can not find the services  i open the  localhost 8080  and see the zipkin ui  the  service  droplist has no items  i open the localhost  localhost 9900  and  localhost 9901   i can see the hello text   i think it is the problem of zookeeper  it can not find the servers  right  when i launch the  bin collector  and  bin query   i find some warns and errors 
 twisterrob i don't think it is a case of wrong url as everything works fine without okhttp  but i've tried to trim it and result is the same    sjudd here is the full stack trace http   pastebin com yfcs0nrl  you can find image url in exception if you'd like to test it   
then the control characters are back

ok  i will let you know by tonight
one is mixstream one is remote forword stream  but only get mix stream in  client1 info   getremotestreams 
i have worked around it by extending concurrentmapwrapper and overriding the appropriate methods with the fix  as you can see here  https   github com thegoodlike13 twitch sahyun bot blob master src main java eu goodlike sahyun bot http cookies correctconcurrentmapview java  then instead of cache asmap   i manually cast the cache into internalcache and use the constructor  it's not pretty  but it works   
 yegor256 yes  sure
well idk to what it was related  but it seems to be fixed now   
you can replicate on the simplest model  example below   the error occurs when the array element to  pull does not exist  mongodb shell correctly reports nmodified as 0 but the mongo driver's writeresult incorrectly reports 1 because it reads nmatched as 1  ignoring nmodified      and check the  updateresults  
fortunately  i'm with the pc at the moment  will look into it right now 
the previous issue is gone but now a new issue exists  the message states  "no ' java' file or non empty source folder was selected in a valid module"  i appreciate your development on this project 
i use postman with default get method 
why can't hide the home button 
but the point is not only that we do or do not do the check     what bothers me and the student here is that the warning message regarding the name of the module and the program extension makes no sense  and that we should not see any maude errors   maybe all these are related in some way  but our users do not know that   grigore       from  radu mereuta  notifications github com  sent  friday  december 06  2013 2 02 am to  kframework k cc  rosu  grigore subject  re   k  kompile bad erorr message reported by a student  #201   i also remember doing that  maybe it's a bug  maybe we didn't take into consideration anonymous variables   — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com kframework k issues 201#issuecomment 29970316 
hi jules   yes i expected that it will use the hpo terms associated with the omim id   the error message is really confusing  it gives the impression that some files are missing  maybe we should add a better error  like  please insert hpo terms for method phenix   or convert the omim id to hpo terms 
 rexim given the simple purpose of the reputation  as i explained in the description   the whole mechanism you are describing is rather pointless    so far  users just need to learn the platform  period  do you see it as a realistic representation for something else  i really don't

thanks  new release works on 4 5  but it works only for projects with separate  gopath  with src  pkg  bin in project tree    i have some projects with the shared  gopath  inside  gopath src   but i can't debug and even run them via run menu due to error  process path is empty

i guess the complexity is due to the fact while ticks are removed from the timeseries  the cachedindicator's value list is not touched and we rely on the beginindex  endindex  and removedtickcount to square up the two    on cachedindicator java line  87   result   calculate removedtickscount     looks like it causes the stack overflow  should it be  result   calculate 0      just let me know if this is the direction you want to go and i'll create a pull request  i already have the fix in my local "fork" and it works without issue 
it says v 0 1 4 here  i don't know how to get the full build number

yes  i've tried 3 of our streams in the sample app and we have the same issue  i submit the logs  even though they don't say me much    the first streams logging  with 4 seconds shown as start time  from sample app gives me 
using the elasticsearch 6 5 4 as storage  sorry that i couldn't send a fix for you asi don't know the exact cause for this problem   maybe i should upgrade to the latest skywalking 6 3 0 and try again

yeah  certainly looks like the natives trouble  btw  the os is windows 7 and windows 8  both 64 bit   the cause of the exception  unfortunately  does not tell much more  there is only one cause  calling  getcause    on it returnes  null    and it is not much different than the original message     is there any special  not very traditional mechanism that is used to load the native libraries

i mean that when service_a call service_b  service_a create a span named span_ab as a bridge between service_a  and service_b  then service_b has a parent span named span_ab and a local span span_b  when the request is over   service_b record the last log at methed below       because span_b has a parent span sanp_ab it always goes to the branch 'if  parent    null   ' and mdc remain it until gc yet  it does't matter at most time but i think  it will be better if we can clear mdc by hand it's just my advise 
how stupid  you are completely right mark  i must have been staring at too many type errors lately    
i personally like that idea   show a loading screen whenever user opens a folder which has been changed in any way and or shows incomplete data  there are a few issues with this approach though  mainly that the current approach  small loading bar at the tom  lets you interact with files while others are loading  making interaction with the app much faster  if user has to wait for each screen to load updated content  it will damage the user experience    i really like how mega app reacts to data changes   github  https   github com meganz android     it doesnt seem to be running in the background and the updates are immediately synced  i would enjoy this very much on nextcloud

hi  hiroyuki sato   with verify  i mean it should check the syntax of the dig before pushing  what happens i think is the version number updates but the code still stays the same  i'm going to run a few more tests today to get the correct steps to replicate   rejecting push command when old revision is running is a good feature but i have not encountered this

i answered "y"   
spilling   not enough memory  in order to unspill the spilled partitions  and matching probe rows   we free memory by forgetting the partitions that has not been spilled  and are no longer needed   if the "partitions that has not been spilled" are to be needed later  for next bucket of the probe side   we need to keep them around    spill them and then unspill    or keep in memory during unspilling   this can work  but we need to free  1 more partition for the unspilling    this should happen automatically  via memory revocation   so yes  seems doable

i updated to the latest commit   7b106923e078ac2435e8c8ce9d615f9903106ed8  however  i cannot test whether the bug is fixed since i hit the following exception in a code path that is precursor to where i can reproduce the bug      this is why i didn't directly file a new bug  however i don't think these modifications have anything to do with the sslexception exception above since i've only removed unused java 7 apis and an annotation  but i might be wrong   also  thank you for being so responsive

yeah  that looks like a solid start  i don't know if i should break this into a new issue or not  but here's something i've been considering  do we want to make a subclass of activity that we use as the base for most  or all  of our activities  it seems like a lot of functionality  mainly showing these warning and the navigation drawer  will have to be duplicated in a lot of places   if we had this "super" activity  we could avoid a lot of redundant boilerplate code  that hinted at my next point  which is that i think these warnings should be displayed at the activity level  a  we avoid a lot of boilerplate  and b  they would remain still when scrolling between tabs  when launching the activity  we could check the internet connection and display this if there is none  if we want to get really fancy  we could register to receive updates on network status and hide the warning and trigger a refresh of all fragments  once all of them incorporate the refresh framework    i think i answered my own question  we need a new issue  p

yes  we could fix this so that if you had the environment variable set  or the download service enabled  it could pick those up  we'd still need to make the change to go down the cram path though  however  in the  common    case where neither of those is true  the downstream failures may not be obvious  so maybe we should have this check for a  cram extension  and throw only if neither of default reference or download are set   on mon  nov 16  2015 at 2 07 pm  tim fennell notifications github com wrote

i use carbon widget framelayout to display a group of fragments in it  i change them using simple transaction  and it works like a charm  but when i open the launcher  i e  desktop screen of any android device   turn off device screen by pressing power button  and when return to my app via recents app i am getting this error  i thought it happens during activity recreate  but it works fine when i change screen orientation  so  it seems like it is a bug in carbon widget framelayout itself  changing it to regular android framelayout fix it   anyway  your project  whole library  is fantastic  it is really hard to build material design app with only google's support libraries  but your project makes it easy  thank you a lot   alex  p s  sorry for my english  sometimes it's bad 
it incorrectly detects the part of the road  and connected roads  as oneway subnetwork and removes it from the graph  but what exactly goes wrong i do not know yet     still debugging

 sylviadehn i created a new subscription and i checked again  the status of the subscription was "pending" but it changed when i opened the link from the email  sorry  i did not know about it earlier  i mean confirmation e mail link   i can log in to the aws controller dashboard and the status of my subscription is "completed" now  fyi  i have the updated app domain   i think that we can consider this bug as invalid  should i close the bug 
yup 
well  i fixed it    will need to re break it to see 
thanks for fixing  concerning the java version check  it didn't work properly on my mac  the  java_home  variable set in the script was not pointing to the proper java folder  so the command  java  version   differed when run in the shell and within the script  i fixed this for testing by adding manually  java_home  as an environmental variable
java version "1 8 0_60"

no  they happened in the gev project  we need to invest here deeper 
i'm using it in a list adapter  some items should have a green button and some should be red 
the output  is it intended that it posts that errors 
i am unable to test this  my logs are filled with error and other spam at the moment making them really hard to read and that error didn't seem very regular

well  in php  we don't have concept of longs    
actually i notice the error while  i am running  failed together  i believe i am running in the same environment as everyone else  i am using jdk1 8  is there any specific configuration that i could provide that you might think will be helpful 
i ran though each different gamemode  using the command myself  and it worked each time   survival creative adventure   i also went in each gamemode and tried using the command block with the command and it gave the same error message 
yes i did  i believe this is caused by this piece of code   stackmob listeners serverload   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 17891302 57985289 87f17f00 7a1a 11e9 8e37 4a87ed848a44 png   if you swap peroid and 100 i think it should work   thanks 
oh yes vital detail   humanmine  live and beta   although i haven't checked other mines   it happens nearly every time i try to export a list 
no  the problem occurs only for jpeg compressed tiffs 
that sounds great  any idea when a version with the fix will be available in fdriod  i'd prefer to not have to install the apk directly   i agree  colons in filenames are not great  but some artists   podcasts put colons in the names of the titles of songs episodes  so they inevitably end up in the filenames     there are lots of music players that can play files that have colon in their name  i'm not sure what the technical limitation of parsing out special characters from a file name would be    the default music player that ships with lineage os   music player  https   github com maxfour music player   simple music player  https   github com simplemobiletools simple music player   vanilla music  https   github com vanilla music vanilla  there are other's i'm sure  these are just the ones that worked as i went down the list of music players in fdroid  i prefer the ui in odyssey and how it handles relative path playlists  so i'd really rather continue using it rather than switching to something else if this can be fixed   edit  i'm not a java programmer  but in the commit mentioned above  why not split on "   " instead of " " to handle urls

perhaps a new shell command calling awaitindexonline   would be a solution  something like   begin create constraint    commit wait online begin create    commit

i use mssql we also wondered why query passes without exceptions even if script is incorrect  the problem occured when we tried to create foreign key with wrong data type  flyway ran patch  foreign key was not added to the table  but patch was marked as executed in schema_version table  then i tried to use execute batch  because according to the spec  it throws batchupdateexception  a subclass of sqlexception  if one of the commands sent to the database fails to execute properly or attempts to return a result set  further research showed that execute does not throw exception if first query in the patch ran successfully  as far as i see it happens if foreign key  problem occurs  did you try to reproduce this bug adding new patch to flyway samle project 
thanks for quick response  the custom header is visible in the traces  the name is  management access token   we are using this header to secure access to management actuator endpoints

i grabbed alpha08  the first query runs fine  the second indeed takes a lot of time  but it does not crash as it used to   as it does a big antijoin operation followed by a double optional match   anyways  i don't think that's a problem  i changed that query a lot since then  see its  commit history  https   github com ldbc ldbc_snb_implementations commits master cypher queries opencypher bi 19 cypher    it turned out i misinterpreted the ldbc spec in one place and we also changed the semantics of the query in another  the new query runs a few seconds using alpha08   so in conclusion  i believe this issue is fixed now 
i would say two arrays are equal if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order 
i did get an outlook notification on my phone   i can try to generate another log

yes  i think there is a connection between editing the old photo and opening the owncloud app  i just edited a new photo and right after i opened the owncloud app three  old  other photos were reuploaded the sixth time

i checked  we only unbind from butterknife when the fragment's view is destroyed  and it doesn't look like that's happening 
yeah hang on  i'll reproduce it 
i need a permission to access your file 
if a project is stored in tfs source control  files are ready only unless checked out for edit   and just in general  files can be marked read only to prevent modification    strange i have to state that explicitly 
the general question here is  shouldn't dataview support primitive type arrays  i can query for a list byte  so that would probably be the correct translation  but this is a horribly inefficient way to store this data  also  if i translate a list byte  to nbt  i will get a nbttaglist containing nbttagbytes 
i would settle for either smushing it all into one line     as long as there's no lines starting with     and it compiles i could go either way  my work around just moves the "  true" back on to the previous line

i downgraded to 3 4 1 to avoid for now  so not seeing this again for now  i am actually seeing this still  it happens occasionally when i just open my app  but not everytime  i am initialising the stream client in my main activity  the log doesn't show me where this error originates from my code  so it makes it difficult to point out the origin from my code  but i'm initialising the stream client in my mainactivity  and other times in my channel list and detail views in case the stream client is destroyed by the system

hey  hideki  when couchbase calls  changelistener changed changeevent   and within this callback i do some faults  e g  nullpointer  the app won't crash because the exception is catched from your catch block and consumed  this could lead to inconsistent app data behaviour

anything like this does the job on safari  but not on chrome   firefox  where the same circle is serialized to approx   13k   6k message size  both of which arrive without any issue at cineast   so it is most likely a safari problem  however  i think i've encountered the problem already on chrome   firefox  it seems also to depend on the size of the sketched circle  small circles do not crash    screen shot 2019 12 19 at 09 22 56  https   user images githubusercontent com 14314470 71156879 34117780 2241 11ea 86f3 e0d3b52f07ac png  i suggest keeping this issue open in case someone can reproduce it on firefox   chrome

no  and it doesn't just happen to me  it's the whole server   
i don't know  just executing them  i guess  😉   the problem with these tests for sure is that they actually are integration tests  not only testing the binding  but indirectly also the complete esh framework  that's why the are hit by asynchronous behavior  automated magic like autoupdate if item states  auto linking and all that  if some of these things change in a slight aspect  e g  timing  implemented in a different way   then these tests also suffer   i think if you want to really get rid of this stuff  then it would make sense to reduce the test scope to the binding itself  just making sure it uses the esh apis correctly  i e  if you want to test if a certain action leads to an item update  just take the standalone thinghandler  feed it with a mocked thinghandlercallback and ensure it's calling  stateupdated        don't care what happens afterwards    the new  testing documentation  https   github com eclipse smarthome blob master docs documentation development testing md#mockito  gives a pretty good example of how this can be done using plain java 8  hooray  with mockito  for the majority of binding tests  this suffices and there is hardly any need for osgitests 
i want to make a item class for all  then i will put a layout and a bindview to update for each item type as this  library   https   github com stankocken efficientadapter

yes  this crash also happens when i create a new folder named "test" in " " and switch to grid view  the app also crashes when i restart it  delete the folder and recreate it  it then crashes immediately  i don't even have to switch to grid view   when i clear the  currentlog txt  file and then immediately create the folder "test"  the app crashing in the process  no log file is created at all   immediately before the exception is thrown  there is this entry in logcat 
hi   so i tried to create a message with no number in the 'to' field  but the app doesnt allow me to do that  it does not even save it as a draft without a number in or contact name in the field  i went through all the logs in that phone  to see if a specific phone number came with no phone number  but that is not the case  they all have either a contact name or phone number attached to them 
yes  i assume issue #26 in your gradle plugin has the same root cause as issue #16 in your maven plugin since they are both caused by a javax naming noinitialcontextexception with the same exception reason  i may be wrong though  in any case issue #16 is still relevant for your maven plugin

i don't recall it ever working   otoh  the post i linked to above stated that it worked in 2 5 m2  frankly  i don't see anything materially different between m2 and m4  other than the charset change you already mentioned   from what i saw  even the  javax mail  and  org apache commons mail  lib versions didn't change   as it works with the oh1 binding  there must be something different

so  i think that  x 1 hour or less before y  _would_ be  true  if  x  is at the exact same time as  y   because i said an hour or less  and 0 hours is less than 1 hour   the more that i think about this case  the more that i think it overrides the exclusive definition of the before  in fact  i think it's even broader than i initially proposed above  consider  x 1 hour before y   intuitively  if  x  is exactly 1 hour before  y   it should return true  but based on the exclusive definition of before  it should return false   in other words  i think the relative qualifiers should override the exclusivity of the before after comparison operator in all cases  not just where the two boundaries meet  thoughts

no  any chest at all   the one in particular was not connected to the me   it was just a standard chest     and yueh  the server owners have a system that allow you to actually purchase points to buy kits that will basically just creative in items for you   that is how i got my me drives     i did some further testing and just can't figure out what is causing it   i have the exact same set up on an sp world and have not seen such an issue   got another guy on the server that has an me set up  no issues   i have used ae since unleashed and never seen anything like this before     restarting the server is like an on off switch for it   after the items dupe  they remain duped until the server restarts  at that point when it comes back online the items literally undupe unless i have pulled them from the me and placed them in my inventory   i am at a loss 
i have not encountered this bug actually 
you cannot add an empty file  but you also can't add any other files you select at the same time  using multi select  either  this is problematic because then you have to go hunt down the one null file and delete it before uploading the rest of the files  can you make it so it just doesn't upload a null file  but uploads the rest of the files  and gives them a popup warning that says "x files were not uploaded because they were empty" but still lets the other files that aren't empty load in

is that it is just a suggestion not required at all for compiling  at least for the intellij plugin  that could be used for other ides including the   display   the meta is to enable completions without adding explicitly an "using" clause  without the metadata  it would be slow and displaying zillions of static public methods that probably are not meant to be used as extensions  with the metadata  it should be faster limiting the classes you are searching and would avoid suggesting lots of garbage

 jvalkeal  the shell is a sub module in core  so whenever we release scdf core  it is implicit that we will have an equivalent shell release  i was hoping to make a simple improvement to resolve the shell version automatically and add a download link in shell ui    there's a lot of chatter due to incompatible shell + server combo  we could make it simpler for the users to download the right shell release  perhaps when we will have a lot more apis to support  we could revisit the versioning angle  thoughts

it should either show a empty label  or generate an exception that tells me clearly what is wrong with the code  it took quite some debugging to find the actual cause  because the exception happens latter  when the json is being generated  not immediately when the label generator returns    i would prefer the first option  since i think it will be a common cause of problems   if the second option is chosen  i think the javadoc in the setitemlabelgenerator should also mention that it is not ok to return null values

so from your experiment we can conclude that a value was printed which had a different in memory representation than the reference value  hypotheses     an equals method which was implemented wrongly  producing false where it should have produced true       this may happen sound like something about annotations went wrong  but that would have been the inverse situation i believe   equals  should include annotations  and isequal not        we forgot to override  equals and hashcode  somewhere  like in one of those annotation or keyword parametere wrapper classes      we have a rarely triggered bug in an existing equals method  let's say one of the locations or the datetime implementations

hi  the bug is fixed  thank you for your quick reaction  best  pj  edit  i think you've left the debugging 'on'  the program produces quite a lot of  main  debug lines at the beginning 
will try to remember to do so  i usually file these as soon as i experience them  which usually isn't when i've got a laptop and a usb cable handy  on jun 3  2016 11 56 am  "budowski" notifications github com wrote

the version of rstudio is the one from the main desktop download section linked here   https   download1 rstudio org desktop opensuse15 x86_64 rstudio 1 2 5001 x86_64 rpm   i believe it is 1 2 5001   the error on executing   what's particularly wild is  if at the error prompt  if i choose to ignore dependencies and install anyways  rstudio launches and seems to work   the main problem any time i subsequently do a  zypper dup  command  it flags rstudio as broken and wants to remove it       image  https   user images githubusercontent com 56571941 66978164 fee08180 f065 11e9 98e1 9b0a99318bcc png   yes  preview has the exact same issue 
i had forgotten to add this  however it only seems to add extra padding to the  textinputlayout  but the error text is still in the same place   i'll see if i can reproduce in a stand alone app 
limited how  as i see it  i as a lp etl user see a file and its size  and i have 2 options  download or preview  if i see the file is big and still do a preview  that should be my problem   i would start with the usual   all with  charset utf 8  in the header 
yep  fixed  thanks 
the version that ships with activemq 5 9 0     i can't find a specific hawtio version     uses hawtio core 1 2 m23 jar
i'm using the dokan version that came with cryptomator  is it safe to install a newer one   the same thing is happening in all my vaults  all in onedrive   no special characters  or spaces  in any file names 
this is my fault then  i was confused due to an article i read about delve not affecting the cmc of spells  but since x is declared when the spell is cast  the cmc still becomes 2+x  regardless of how the cost is paid   sorry for the confusion 
hi  really sorry  was a bug that i found in 0 10 0  in a 0 12 0 it works   seems that in 0 10 0 in schema ftl there are two roles defined with a old definition  schema update and schema insert  when the correct roles must be registry update and registry insert   i correct this in my installation addign this two old roles and i deletem them when i update to last version   regards and thxs for answer 
i do not have experience with other java ee applications using native memory instead of heap  i am only aware of memory analysis tools for heap dumps  not for the native memory   unfortunately  even if the observed behavior were considered normal  websphere administrators would take issue with an application using several times the memory figure allocated to heap   i could see the memory grow on the java process corresponding to the jvm in the windows task manager  not using some websphere tools  i let the memory grow to 5gb before pulling the plug  the db usage volume was minimal although the few records affected were relatively large   1mb   the database size was small   2mb   i was basically adding  reading and deleting a single record  the heap size was 1024mb  the physical memory available on the server was approximately 5gb   now  i did open issue #6493 which could well be related  since deleting a record results in error  i suppose that it could factor in that record being preserved in memory 
yeah
i meant p2  sorry   but definitely a bug 
i remember we require the upload size to be less than 50 samples
the version is 1 3 1  by ttl i mean  bucket set value  ttl  timeunit seconds     where ttl is 10 seconds for what i called short  and 3600 seconds for what i called long ttl
the following code works for me with  r version 3 6 2  2019 12 12     "dark and stormy night"  outside of rstudio desktop   1 2 5033  on a windows machine  i am able to create the object  ple4 retro  which i can't do inside rstudio desktop   1 2 5033      however  i did not try rstudio desktop 1 3 776 
 akarnokd thank you  this was a test to make sure we buffer a lot of data and thought of informing the team  we want to buffer in case of back pressure and not lose data  would the default onbackpressurebuffer   do that  the documentation doesn't mentioning about dropping beyond capacity but in the code it looks like the capacity is 128 and will drop after that 
it happen when i am open full screen from the recyclerview item in separate activity  and when i am back to screen my recycler adapter is notified that time it give the exception 
ah  good callout  it looks like closing the previous response before retrying  does  fix the crash on 3 14  i was able to change my code to the follow and re run the same scenarios with no crashes     that definitely gets me unblocked  but it's interesting that this changed in the new version  maybe something to note in the documentation for the future   thanks for the rapid response   and of course  for all the work on maintaining this core library       
ah ok  haven't seen that call  thx for the remark  i will try to disable this  i will get back on you tomorrow  but probably you are right 
 snicoll i'm aware of  management port   it changes the default actuator port  not the behavior i opened this ticker for   the properties i'm referring to are the  server tomcat  thread pool properties  i've not checked for other server properties  but i see the following getting picked up by management endpoint     the numbers above are defaults for development  and overridden for performance testing 
np now that issue is fixed as we pack jre within the client
it basically crash when you pick the barrel that is filled with something

i agree with  kbd bug  kbd   even if it has never worked 
please excuse the delayed response  to answer your questions    i have actually attempted many different versions in an attempt to fix this issue but i am positive that i have tried the top three hybrid modems and can confirm that i have restarted the device each time  i have even attempted to manually switch the radio to every option related to my device in terms of what band to use through the "info" screen    to recap   this problem only happens when i have wifi and the cell radio on at the same time  if i place it in airplane mode and or turn off wifi i don't have any issues  further more    when both radios are turned on and any of the top 3 hybrid modems are used my wifi signal will typically show 4 bars and my lte signal will have 0 2 bars  i am in an area where i have a week lte signal from one tower and a strong signal from a non lte tower   in any case   i definitely believe there is some type of key issue which specifically show how does not tell my device to use my wifi radio as the primary when it has a strong connection resulting in every request from any app which uses the internet having a long delay before  and sometimes times out  it completes its requests   please advise if there is any way for you to look into this for a fix or if you know of some app which would allow me to force specific applications to use wifi if its available   thanks in advance   chris h

hi    this subscription 
xscorpion93x
i'm using 1080p  don't know about the other launchers  it does not always happen so it's hard to reproduce
sorry  here's the log 
yes  this issue still persists with wip internal v0 1 24 alpha b6  and maybe it's because i switched from dalvik to art runtine  but afaik the next android "l" will be art only 
sorry i didn't mention it earlier  the client calls the envoy proxy running at port 8082 and the proxy routes to its local server 8086  but the problem persists even if i call the server directly without the proxy layer 
indeed  i'm not sure if the size with "use hi res cover" off is correct or not  but with "use hi res cover" on there is definitely extra padding 
yes fixed  thanks
i simplified this a bit too much to get the stack trace  but if you look at the json output from calling http   localhost 8080 organizations first with the 1 3 5 then with the 1 4 0 you can see that  xmltransient is not being honored  just switch the comments on the spring boot version property and parent version in the top level maven pom xml    here's some sql to create sample data      api sample zip  https   github com spring projects spring boot files 345103 api sample zip

hey  sherfert  thanks for your help  i will report back as soon as we have upgraded to the latest version  unfortunately i will be on holidays soon  but i have made sure other team members will look into it 
https   github com bytedeco javacv pull 415
i am not blaming spigot because all the other plugins managed to find a way to cancel event without it leaking somehow  i think this can be fixed in skript by trying a different method or changing the code  as for the items breaking  it is really easy to reproduce but just not clear exactly what causes it  if you cancel event of 2 items and then put 1 in your offhand  spam click both  then they will stop working properly and ignore the trigger  it will cancel event on these items for other irrelevant clicks  i think that's the easiest way to reproduce the second bug  all though i've done it without using offhand and sometimes doing nothing at all 
somewhere on the project page on https   coveralls io there showed up a red    banner containing an input field where i entered the correct path to the project root  now it is gone on my page  i think that coveralls io recognizes the broken configuration and gives us the opportunity to fix it directly on the web page 
i still get a tip to do so 
you can see the code in https   github com proofpoint platform blob master http server src main java com proofpoint http server httpserver java  sha1 stream ciphers are not currently a problem   hackgziphandler works around a jetty bug that has subsequently been fixed  i have not yet gotten around to pulling that out 
when you are installing the j2me loader closes 
 pstorch if you follow the steps i described you will find the cache in history but not on the "stored" list 
fails in the same way as above  tumor or other "above" thresholded cells are not classified  the warning isn't important  but it did let me figure out why i thought the command wasn't working overall when loaded   it does create "above" objects and classify them when initially creating the classifier   and in case anyone else comes across this  you can work around the current problem with scripting  create the below threshold objects  assuming an either or situation  and then invert the annotation and delete the first set 
yep   scopeinfo  
thanks for this  thomaswue  i'll give this a try next week and maybe have a crack at a smaller test case
no  it wont allow the tool part ot be replaced giving the standard warning saying the modifier cannot be combined with luck etc etc
here is the request id  i think   i just made another test right now  c44b1acc 6357 4eb8 96df 9524b64165dc let me know if you need anything else  thanks
i apologise for the delays in a reply  but we have found the following out     pterodactyl does not make the folder read only when the server is running   we tried your fix with  # libloader jar  but to no avail   same error as before   the error specifically states that forge can't lock the base of our container  so i'm not sure what's going on there   we have other "mixin" mods  mods that don't originate from the pack itself  working just fine  so we don't think it's the tickprofiler mod's fault   however  i am now out of ideas to try to fix it    and the fact that a fresh spongeforge server running on my local machine works fine baffles me 
yes it seems to occur every time for me 
i use android support v4 app fragment  i downgraded version to 1 1 1  i'll check 1 1 3 today 
i have done some testing in between my rick and morty binge and set up a new environment with only hqm and found that it may be the mudpack environment that i'm running  ill post logs    fml client latest txt  https   github com lorddusk hqm files 999079 fml client latest txt    that's the log file  too bad most of its enderio failing at finding its translations      running 1 10 2  forge 12 18 3 2185 lwjgl 2 9 1  not that that matters    the only thing that i did right before it started acting up was install veinminer  ill continue testing  maybe there's an incompatibility issue that i cant explain

that was the url used   apologies i shortened it in the issue text   on our status call today you mentioned an issue with security enabled  i do have security enabled  so that could be the reason  happy to test a fix

 paultdd mc thanks for the reply  the part with the players pet named  player 's pet instead of  player  pet worked  but the item  nether star  is still in the 4th  or 5th  can't remember  the default one  slot in the hotbar  and i want it in slot 9th  which would be slot 8 in config  since coding "usually" works that way  and  mysql does not work either  i did set it to the correct information   over my bungee network  i might have set mysql up wrong  since i am not familiar with mysql  i set it up for the purpose of having this plugin on all servers  thank you again  your help and time is much appreciated     nomiis
 yogevbd  2 0 2620 has the issue as well 
it gives the right output    strange   but for some reasons  it doesn't gives the items edit tested this   on death of player       loop items in victim's inventory           remove loop item from drops          add loop item to  inventory  name of victim      on respawn      loop  inventory  name of player           broadcast " debug  loop index   loop index   loop value   loop value "   edit2  http   paste md 5 net sedufirife vhdl  github code just broke the format   no output   
one minute and i'll test it  if i can't  then you will need to set the minimum required forge version 
 snicoll thanks for the quick explanations  i see what you meant and i just noticed this on the upgrade instructions    we wanted to put the our service bean together with its configuration  and use   enableconfigurationproperties  to conditional switch on off the bean initialization in a consistent way 
4 4 2 previously was turned on  after reinstalling wasn't re enabled as far as i remember 
yes  exactly  it happenend twice  "before" ist a bit of a stretch  because ist was anyl running for 60 days or so  in both cases the operator crashed 
with the new version of the analysis  the analysis correctly reports the finding for the method  decryptaes      in total  the detected violations increased by three  one violation for the secret key  one violation for the iv  and one follow violation as the key used in  cipher init  isn't generated properly   one question  johspaeth   kruegers   shouldn't it be "same" violation for the third parameter as the iv isn't generated correctly as well  at least  that would make sense for me    details in the  report  https   github com crossingtud cryptoanalysis files 2317410 cognicrypt report txt  
so basically the problem is with the grpc server that is setup with dagger  client initiating compression works fine   a very basic simple example would be a server  taken from the dagger article  https   dagger dev grpc servers html     but because  dagger grpc server proxyservercallhandler servercalladapter  is not delegating the  setcompression  call  compression never happens  solution is simple   delegate setcompression      
i do have "always run in the background" on as well    all the same settings i've had before
here is my setup   in my main application java    then in one of my activities  prompt is triggered by    amplify getsharedinstance   promptifready mpromptview     the prompt shows up the first time promptifready is called  but does not show the second time it is called  on the second time  however  when the screen orientation changes  the prompt suddenly shows up   is setalwaysshow true  supposed to show the prompt each time promptifready is called  this used to be the behaviour in 1 0 0   i am testing 1 2 0 with a custom prompt view on nexus 4  android 4 4 
thx  sberyozkin    i can remove the quarkus specific hack and share the same code with all other servers  +1 
 dennisdenuto  i did until i found out uaa doesn't actually send any emails  the api and docs are pretty lacking in this regard 
tried 3 different clients  only happens in rl  doesn't happen in osbuddy or on the og client 
 jsotuyod in regards to the first question  i have tried the cli with both the ant cache file and with its own cache file  the cli command seems to fail on the creation of the cache file resulting in the cache file containing no violations even though there are violations present in the code  the cli command i was using was the following    this is after fixing the error that occurred and it still says the cache was hit  looking at the code it should say   incremental analysis cache miss   file changed     i also attached my very basic sample project which can replicate the issue  i enabled the duplicate imports rule as my rule set to easily see the issue   run the ant pmd task once then remove the duplicate import and run the ant pmd task again you should see the same output    testpmd zip  https   github com pmd pmd files 3408938 testpmd zip   test log  https   github com pmd pmd files 3408917 test log

filiphr  thanks for quick reply  versions that are used  mapstruct   1 2 0 beta2 lombok   1 16 14  i didn't create the bug for lombok as it works as expected  i don't use   objectfactory  as i understand the problem here is that the search for  mapping target is done by properties  not by get set methods so the code that is generated by lombok looks like this    it doesn't allow to use lombok  delegate together with mapstruct

i agree with you about even malicious data should never trigger such an exception   i have a tcp input with two extractors  the first extracts data with grok pattern and extract the field localtime  for example  localtime   "05 may 2015 07 00 00 +0200"  the second extractor is a timestamp extractor that copies the field localtime and convert string to date type with the pattern "dd mmm yyyy hh mm ss z"   i think this is correct because the message have a correct timestamp when i search it    "localtime"   "05 may 2015 07 00 00 +0200" "timestamp"   "2015 05 05 05 00 00 000"  the timezone on the system running the graylog server is      date +" z  z" cest +0200

1  false  i drop out of the region arena kicks me i do not get my inventory back i get teleported back to my old position i am still part of the arena  because i get game updates   pa list shows arenas  i think  need to double check this one  i could leave with  pa leave or wait until the game ends to get my inventory back  2  true  i drop out of the region arena kills me i could respawn if i had lives  but instead get placed at the spectator spawn because death  spectator i do not get my inventory  pa list shows player list  i have a red name as dead out  i could watch the game and get updates i could type  pa leave or wait until the game ends to receive my inventory and tp to old  i believe the issue with 1  was it wasn't kicking players out of the arena properly  a fix would be if leavedeath  false  kick the player out of the arena  not keep him in  if leavedeath  true  respawn the player if have lives or use death  old spawn setting otherwise

 tsmaeder this is on the openshift dev cluster we use  i don't think it's a cluster issue as it's pretty consistently reproducible   what do you mean by "default" registry  we're currently moving away from having che provide default registries of any kind  since the che openshift io registries are for prod prod preview only    https   github com eclipse che issues 14266   i've tested    che server  7 0 0  + devfile registry  7 0 0  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  nightly  + devfile registry  7 0 0  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  7 0 0  + devfile registry  nightly  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  nightly  + devfile registry  nightly  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  nightly  + devfile registry  nightly  + plugin registry  nightly     does not work

no  i no longer have the execution  the error happened when the sparql construct to file list was executing  however  i assume the higher level exception handling is the same for all components 
because this means that this is a local issue  as i suspected   nobody on the server i'm on knows about this issue but me and the owner  so we're fine   are there any ways that a mod could do this  it would help us find the culprit

so that behavior would be leaving the file from time t2   i don't think that is a possibility  because that file doesn't pass the filter s  saying to only give us files that parsed   i always viewed the behavior as 'give me all the code at time x  and then filter out anything not matching one of the filters '

hi  i have two android mini tv boxes  one is cx 919 with 4 2 2 "stock" rom  the other one is mk808 with 4 1  the problem happens on both devices with the same scenario  but with different symptoms  on cx 919 you see the crash above  while on mk808 i see strange rendering artifacts  like split screen and snow during playback   the scenario is always the same  use a multi variant  hls source  for example 0 1 2   where 0 is the best quality  and wait until a situation where exoplayer decided to switch from a lower quality source to a higher one   i've also added some printings in hlschucksource  getchunkoperation   and i noticed that in the given scenario the player simply "ignores" higher quality chunks  and crashes  on acodec  while reaching to the last buffered chunk of the lower quality sample  i'm starting to suspect that maybe the higher quality sample isn't perfectly aligned with the lower one  for example  if the "lower" chunk contains video from 0 to 6000000us  then the "higher" one doesn't continue the video smoothly at 6000000us    i really want to understand how to smooth transition between different variants is designed to work  so i will be able to try to dig in deeper in to this     any thought on this   thanks 
thanks for investigating  i guess i cannot do anything myself about it   any idea when you can resolve this 
 robbwatershed i using latest version

i just did    my bad  didn't thought to send a crash report   
when i move my cursor the speed of the cursor randomly changes so if i was moving fast one second it would suddenly slow down and id miss notes 
just the copy button in the pipeline list 
i have tried the command script and attempted to load a session  there are no errors  the bar just constantly says " loading request into browser  " etc 
i'll see what i can do

yeah  that's a good point   so the widget plus some adapter that listens to the network state conveniently 
sorry  i linked the commit of me reverting this actual commit  the actual commit is  2149c3280ae38cd77ca5edc619af2b5e80d5668a  i think it came from pr #2178

tried to reproduce in 7 0 0 and was not able to 
 mrniko  thanks for your reply  i am not sure if this is only reproducible when the cache is full   i tried to run the lua script manually and i found that probably this line is causing error  local msg   struct pack 'lc0lc0'  string len lruitem   lruitem  string len lruitemvalue   lruitemvalue   looks like lruitemvalue is returning boolean and this section is under the condition that  if cachesize    maxsize  please help take a look  thanks   maybe this is the reason  redis nil does convert to false in lua scripts  https   stackoverflow com questions 42123757 redis lua script redis callget nonexisting return value i think this could be due to i manually cleared my cache but didn't clear redisson__map_cache__last_access__set  so they are out of sync 
expecting no  _det italian  an     _det is not generated for sentences like "an orange is tasty "   so it's something different for this sentence  an italian is crazy  in particular   r2l uses _det only for "those"  "these"  "this"  "that"   unless r2l is also wrong

i found the issue and yes its not a bug from the addon  i used  ui getcurrent   navigate       in my login view to navigate to the main ui after login  inspecting google chromes network tab showed  that the styles of the addon are loaded after the dom loading is already done  i could fix that behaviour by using  ui getcurrent   getpage   setlocation       but i'm not sure if that is the desired usage of vaadin's navigation  thank you for the quick reply

thanks  i am using java 8 and did look into the circleci file but couldn't find anything different  seemed a bit strange that build was passing there but not on my machine that is why i asked the question in case i was making a very obvious mistake  i'll try and do it on linux machine   was looking into zuul and was hoping to contribute to it   to add few functionalities  just wanted to make sure i could build and run all tests before i start playing around

yes i did  non results   i cant understand why not   because fragments get destroyed and recreated each time 
my apologizes for the less provided informations  i thougt that my description were sufficient enough    windows 10 version 1709  project sdk  1 8 0_144 project language level  8  important for reproducing this error  my maven pom      my presumption  as described earlier  is that jda 3 3 1_299 is compiled with java 9  where the method  java nio buffer flip    is overwritten by  java nio shortbuffer flip     used at  net dv8tion jda core audio audioconnection encodetoopus audioconnection java 537    if i use java 1 8 0_144 and project language level 8  then i get a  java lang nosuchmethoderror  exception  because my runtime tries to call the method  java nio shortbuffer flip     which does not exist under java 8 and should be  java nio buffer flip    
 andrewlewis thank you for your help  after checking the code and the crash reports  the app doesn't call  imaadsloader stop  directly  is there anything else that might be related that i can check if the app is calling wrong   and we could only find this assertion failure in the reports   not sure if it is related

i'm using  spring boot 2 2 0 m1  and thus it's difficult to test  1 0 0 build snapshot  now  as it breaks several dependencies  i'll confirm your thoughts and close the issue once a new spring boot milestone is available 
hi  serge rider   i already jna installed in it  it's the same installation that i do with the workaround you send to me with the orbit repository   here is the log i have when i open a new editor 
hi  stuartwdouglas   unfortunately  option   dnodeps  did not fix it   just to make things easier i created a very minimal example and uploaded it into a new project https   github com sarxos quarkus issue 2809  the names of directories and modules are exactly the same as in my original project  i was too lazy to change them all  but all of my code is removed and only very basic reproducer classes are added instead   these reproducer classes are   the class from  abberwoult  module  this module is a runtime part of quarkus extension        edit    just fyi  the  abberwoult example  is not a module  it's a separate project  i already excluded multimodularity to be a root cause of this issue

 wu sheng  a little bit of code change，a pull request has been sent 
i'm using version 0 7 3 in 64 bit eclipse kepler on 64 bit windows 10  the original graphs that throw this error are massive  i can extract it if you wish  but the code below reproduces the nullpointer as well     edit  i noted before that the above code did not include the stacktrace  it returned after restarting eclipse  three cheers for turning it off and on again 
no added benefit whatsoever    autoconfigurebefore traceautoconfiguration class   in  samplerautoconfiguration  will be the perfect solution to our problem  then i can remove the custom sampler beans from  stackdrivertraceautoconfiguration  https   github com spring cloud spring cloud gcp blob 72d746486fedd19b16ead3cdbbcfb48c3e90c3a9 spring cloud gcp autoconfigure src main java org springframework cloud gcp autoconfigure trace stackdrivertraceautoconfiguration java#l80  for good 
thanx  orbiter i would do it asap 
yes i'm on windows the javahome variable contains c  jdk1 7 0_55 jre and as i've explained changing with the debugger with  c  jdk1 7 0_55 jre makes it runs    i'm going to try with maven_opts   
 ctron that emulator does work better  but there are two issues  one  it appears the "org eclipse kura example beacon scanner" is selected to run  this should be deselected  two  the persistent directories  snapshots  and data   are created in the kura distrib folder  i am not sure they belong there  historically these were kept in the workspace directory   i also think we should clean up the existing launch configurations  there are too many and likely confusing to new comers    pgufatibm it would be interesting to get your feedback on using oomph on a windows platform  we have only tested on osx linux  i would start with a clean install as i think problem 1 could be causing a lot of the errors  to get around the error  you need to set the "eclipse kura git repository " variable to "https  read write "  the "git  read write " option only works if you have entered your git credentials in the eclipse ide previously      image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1392274 22265648 89ef4eee e242 11e6 98b3 e415a69b069a png

 l0rd  yes  every try  it may be related to the number of files in the volume  there is a threshold     so if it does not happen  redo it again on another folder  maybe a cache issue   maybe there are some adjustments to do so that the limitation covers most of nodejs projects 
no it does not  if you connect redstone to a repeater  the first redstone is 15  now  connect a conduit to that redstone and you get 14 out the other side  then remove the redstone and replace it with a conduit  it should go up by one  but it does not    redstone sources set the level at the block next to them  redstone only reduces by one when it is connected to other redstone  the first redstone connection to a redstone source mirrors the level of the source  then the second piece of redstone starts the reduction based on distance    as the redstone conduits are now  it is literally impossible to get a level 15 signal out the other end  and this can mess with many redstone contraptions  even dialing devices for enhanced portals   a single piece of redstone connecting a source and destination does not reduce the redstone level to 14  yet a single piece conduit will

durability worked as usual in v3 5 8  for the latest commit i tried but it does not work yet   the durability bar does not decrease while using the item 
i'm not sure about the exact version number  the file used can be found in following link  https   github com wf9a5m75 phonegap http request tree master libs android
no  it doesn't work with manually installed texture pack i redownloaded the pack serverside with  emojichat resourcepack but always the same result  i also have this problem when i use vanilla textures 
yes  in the projection processor  ui seems to be displaying the "name" rather than "displayname" for functions   shahsank3t  can you take a look 
it is for 1 12 2 but i have found something there is a conflict with https   minecraft curseforge com projects mapwriter 2 version 2 8 1 got the rgb selection and use when the map writer is putting beacon type lights for waypoints

nice   i just ran into that scheduling issue last night and hadn't yet diagnosed it  but looking at your commits now realize that you've fixed both of my problems in one swoop   thanks for the quick turnaround 
i do not see this message in the console logs  but  after setting the jvm dns caching to zero as mentioned below  jdk1 8  it works     thanks  mrniko

i'm using java 1 8   webappcontext is declared with setwar   because i'm working on a standalone app  i'm declaring it like here   https   github com alanhohn webmvc blob master src main java org anvard webmvc server embeddedserver java
i can confirm that the busy bar is correctly rendered in the latest snapshot   to be honest  it would be nice to be able to modify speed and movement direction through widget properties  but it's such a niche actor that it's not really necessary

i have been using zap 2 6 0 for normal use  when i'm debugging i have been using the development build pulled last week    about the workaround  do you refer to the following steps  1  enable global http session tracking 2  open the request editor 3  select the cookie "use current tracking session" 4  disable global http session tracking 5  send request  in my attempts  this has been able to send the request in "ignore_cookie" mode  in the dev build     to answer your question  i think the request editor should not use any http state  and thus use the ignore_cookie mode  unless the user enables the option "use global http session tracking"  then it should use the global state  therefore using the "browser_compatibility" option or the "default" option  i think it is defaulted to rfc_2109      i must say i do not fully understand the difference between the global http states and the non global variant  could you elaborate on this  what is the functional use of a non global http state tracking in the request editor 
it doesn't fail at compile  it fails on  system loadlibrary     is there some other output i can provide 
sorry no  after upgrading the os and xcode the build stopped being that slow  we can close this issue and i’ll reopen if i see it again  i hope i never have to deal with a build so slow it overflows an integer though     
sure  if necessary i'll hack the ant build to skip the unit tests  i probably won't have time to work on this until wednesday

the code here  https   github com arquillian arquillian cube blob master openshift openshift src main java org arquillian cube openshift impl client gitserver java#l91 defines a hostport on the pod    this is something that is generally considered a bad practice  see  1    also its something that is not supported on all environments  e g  openshift dedicated   but even with plain openshift  it requires certain configuration on the user side in order for that to work  more specifically it requires that the user is associated with a security context constraint that allows host ports     so what i am suggesting  is to remove the hostport definition from the pod and use a service instead  so that we access the git server through the service  ideally we should also expose the service as a route  if possible  so that its easier to consume externally    1  http   kubernetes io docs user guide config best practices

i've reproduced it in single player just by spawning a few ghosts and some thaumcraft eldritch mobs   i suppose we can throw potions at entities with splash or arrows too   we're also using the infernal mobs mod  they will change potions when mob is spawning and might update them periodically 
debian package
 ryanjbaxter sure  in a few days 
sure  here you go     these are probably just fine  since without asyncwriteenable  everything works  slowly 
 jackyq2015 i haven't tried any others recently   will let you know if i find other examples 
no  unfortunately restarting device or the app didn't make any difference    also i cannot give you logs since it has been deleted after i reinstalled everything from scratch to make things work again  couldn't you reproduce the issue  if there's no other way i still have my backup which i can restore  and thus break my configuration 
 knightminer singleplayer    thequadshot what i meant was that when a building block for the smeltery is placed in the smeltery multi block while it is currently smelting items  the smeltery will then drop the items it is currently smelting in front of the controller  it dropped a set of real items and phantom items  for example  if it is currently smelting an iron ore block  placing a smeltery block in the smeltery causes the smeltery to drop the iron ore block  along with another one which is a phantom item 
just tried on a 1 15 1 server  and it is fixed for that  i imagine it won't make a difference updating my server to 1 15 2 but i'm about to do that anyway so i'll let you know if it works on that as well 
it was a plain text file  specifically my contacts as exported by android   i think its called "contacts vcf"

not in incremental tutorial but the model contained by the extraresources headless samples  folder of gama product plugin  you can see inconsistency
not exactly  i should have stated it a bit more specific  the connection gets established again  as proven by the connack   and should be followed by a subscribe from the mqtt binding  like in this correct sequence 
tyler   thanks for the advice  it helped find the problem   i ran the "info   bundle" and generated the tar archive  neat  the way that works    i looked at the various files in the archive   i found that 172 17 0 1 is the ip of my docker0 "device"  which is a bridged adapter created by the docker server  i also found out that che  as part of its network check  was running a curl command that attempted to connect to docker0 through port 32768  since i am running a firewall on my system  that port was blocked  once i unblocked it  everything worked   eivantsov  fyi the os i am using is centos 7 and  for various reasons  i need to keep my firewall enabled  that being said  i wish i had read your post before now  because it might have saved me some time   a suggestion for the documentation  the che folks might want to tell people about which ports should be open when doing a local install  that way  someone can know to either disable their firewalls or open the right ports before running che   one last question  how on earth do you pronounce "che" 
i used vaddin chart 1 1 9 and vaddin version is 7 6 5 you  also can reproduce in newest version  you should create a chart and use  containerdataseries set visible false 
i don't know if this is the only bug in proposition class but yes  i fixed that bug  i'm familiar with option for commiting+closing an issue but i thought  for some reason  that it will close it with this message too 
yep  1 7 10 with rtg 0 8 0 snapshot 1 only   seed 753548930  it should spawn you right in the split river  but if you want to see where it starts  you can tp to  258 90 57  it starts there and then eventually dissipates into a swamp biome 
ok you can make the bug work right away  no filtering needed  just get the second page and click on the item's icon  the recipe shown is the one from the item in the same place on the first page 
i see  at this point  the specific episodes aren't known  just the titles  so titleregex is the only choice   but how does a title that contains characters from the regex set get matched   since the encoding of    's works  it appears that they're decoded before the regex is used  that's why putting a   in front of them worked for the original case here  i thought that would apply to all of the regex characters that were part of the actual title  that should be matched without any expression    i found that this works     that is  all of the regex characters in the title were replaced with periods  the  20 above were actually spaces when testing from my browser  plus signs work too  as expected

it was a specific chassis or tech level but same result  no error message or confirmation message   refit via kit works no problem but customizing from the lab is just met with no messages of any kind

that's strange  that didn't look like that when i made this ticket  so i've tried several things like check the group weight and config  etc  i'm confused lol  welp guess this should be closed now 
it does  sorry about my poor testing 
added os  arch linux   i tried with a completely minimal hello world main go and it does indeed work   i'll try and create a minimal example where it fails  could you suggest a non trivial go project where debugging does work and i can try and work from there  i just tried with https   github com mitchellh packer  which doesn't give the error  but nor does it actually stop at my breakpoints 
i must not have gotten the full mod pack because irises are non existent in my game
for example  nativekeypressed for key a gives keycode 30 nativekeyreleased for key a gives keycode 38 nativekeypressed for key space gives keycode 57 nativekeyreleased for key space gives keycode 65  and so on  however  this does not happen with all keys  arrow keys for example have the following behavior  nativekeypressed for key arrow up gives keycode 57416 nativekeyreleased for key arrow up gives keycode 111  about my keyboard  i don't know how to describe it but the one in the following image has the same key layout http   www ceratech co uk product_images language lrg kybac260 usbblksp spanish jpg i guess it's just a standard spanish keyboard 
unfortunately no  it got reported once on gplay but i fear it might happen more often for a stable release with a much larger user base      
it looked it worked well with 1218 
that seems to have fixed it but also disabled the hardness x4  even made new config for itr  the mining speed of all things scales again now like skills and momentum mining ring etc  but the hardness of blocks is entirely gone  i mean it’s in the config but with iton true and on false doesn’t matter still the same base speed hardness   yes i did restart in between global hardness change true false 
using okhttp seems to fix the issue  thanks for pointing that our  twisterrob 
the mac address was not available when being set in  bashrc  i figured it out thanks to  mikagika  that it should probably be in  bash_profile instead of  bashrc   i can explain the diff to you if you want  i have opened an issue to make the change #135   and i have updated the wiki  https   github com olentangyfrc deepspace 2019 wiki getting mac address from roborio
my apologies   the stone golems no longer take the items from a chest and transfer them to another chest  tallow golems assigned with a bucket will refill a crucible  but will no longer refill the bucket with water from a designated source  tallow golems if assigned to an alembic  will pull the essence from the alembic but not go anywhere  clay golems no longer move items to barrels   all colors are assigned correctly   also  i haven't seen anything odd in the console 
for me it would be a menu entry on the main screen  "report problem"  with a popup then asking "do you want to send the logs as well   yes no cancel  with the default being yes "   i would not like an additional setting  it is not a big deal if we store  say  500 messages of 40 characters  that would be 20kb of ram  we would only store the severity and the data  we wouldn't duplicate the tag for example

thanks for replying  we have the plugin configured in the  build  and  reporting  elements  the project has around 45 modules   we have it within the  build  element to fail the build to fail the build when  failbuildoncvss  is    7      what we do is run the build on a schedule overnight  if the build fails we generate the report separately and send it as an attachment in an email so we're notified if our software has a vulnerability   maybe we have configured it wrong 
i agree with  siedlerchr  many thanks for looking into this
of course  thanks for answering

thank you  it worked   good question which version it is  how do i check this 
i was facing this issue in preview 5 version as well   this is a problem on ios as well and i am using the rest api to complete the room
git does not work as i downloaded it from github directly  full log here   https   paste ee p qdvhd

 romannikitenko hello  yesterday we have been trying it with  rhopp on 7 10 0 snapshot and the behavior was flaky  sometimes the exit code was returned and the task terminated correctly  sometimes it didn't but at least in 7 10 0 it didn't prevent me from executing different tasks  or restarting the same task   i am currently implementing a periodic test for go devfile  so i would get back to you once we have more data collected from running the same operation on the go devfile in tests and seeing how often the issue appears 
ah sorry  windows 7  chunky 1 1 3
ok  i've whitelisted n ify in minminguard  system ui was already whitelisted    before doing that though i had tried again and it seems the icon is updating without having to hide and show the shade again  but it seems to be very erratic  sometimes it takes a while to do it  up to 6 seconds or more  and sometimes it does it almost instantly  the behavior is the same if i turn toggle mobile data from the quick tile  collapsed or expanded   or from settings  there's a delay in the icon update wither way 
i have update the issue detail and some device with problem and without problem 
i haven't been able to  the message "processing " does appear  but around number 540  it simply hangs and stops checking  i've checked the file it hangs on  and the does not seem to have any issues  not corrupt  not 0b etc     the folders are located on a samba share  perhaps that could be the issue  i'll try to check with a local folder some time later today 
just tried  the oldest commit it'll let me compile   3bfcae3c779e875ea5f74a82d1359cb8aeba96db   still has the issue

ha ha my bad  we're on version 14  we updated from 13 1
lets keep it separated   just posted a pr          i can look at #231 as well later this evening 
take the realistic torches mod   in order to do its torch burnout it schedules an update tick x seconds in the future  on which it burns itself out   this is done to prevent having to use tes to track burnout time   therefore anything that calls the block's updatetick   method will cause it to burn out   in the case of the farming lamp  that means that the torch will burn out much faster as the lamp calls that method without checking to see if the block is even scheduled to receive updates   in the torch's case  settickrandomly false  is called in the constructor  indicating that the torch should not even be ticked by tick accelerating mods   at a minimum a check to see if the block is set to tick randomly would be nice before applying the random tick   a more robust way would to be to somehow check if the block drops foodstuffs  but i'm aware that's a bit more involved 
 stypox fixed

greetings  tobiaskaminsky   have you tried bigger files  i run into this issue when editing  pdfs   40 100 mb    i'm sure it's new to 3 5  because i used to do the same with the same files  i used to use the deprecated __available offline__ feature   i use xodo to add annotations to pdfs  they get saved  and they used to get uploaded automatically without a glitch   now  after upgrading to the 3 5 version  i edit  the files  i sync them by hand  the uploading starts  it gets __to full 100 __  and __then__ it spits out a message "upload failed"   i have to use  __share__ button from the xodo reader  upload it to nextcloud  works flawlessly  every time  but it gets uploaded under a modified name    delete the old file   and  rename the new file to the old filename    did those details help   i'm  right now  in the middle of exam madness  and i don't have neither logcat nor adb set up  it won't be until the beginning of march when i might be able have a look at it   i've also tried uploading small text files  and they work well  but the larger pdf do not   could you try those   i can send you one of the files  if you want     if it helps  server logs might be more accessible for me

thanks  thebentobox  i do like that idea of the command   with minecraft adding several new blocks items  not having the aliases easily accessible is going to make things quite tricky  and i know you guys are going to get 10 000 people asking you where they are    i mean  i know where to find them  but not everyone does    i think the other reason i like the idea of them being in the docs  is because everything else is there  so it just makes sense to throw them in there as well 
 jsroyal  i am on wheels right now  i will add screenshot later today 
for the moment i try to repoduce this bug on the actual server      but i did not know too much the technical side of minecraft      how long should i wait to be sure that chunk is discharge   like not charged because of me     juste charged by ftbutilities       my physical server have a big load in day  maybe a little lag     is possible     sorry but for the moment i don't have enought ressource for setup a new server only for testing and i can't force all player to update their minecraft  some guy's is realy dumb  _ '

exactly  and will do  just let me start minecraft from scratch so the log isn't quite as massive xd  this was on a server i set up  but i expect it'll also happen in single player  unless spongeforge is causing an issue somehow  if i can't get it to happen in singleplayer  i'll also give you the server log  obviously
 nosark sure  go for it  thanks for your help  please note that this is likely to be a high priority issue so if it's not fixed quickly  one of the core maintainers may need to take it over from you  our next release to get this issue in is in january  v4 1  see  the calendar  https   wiki mozilla org mobile focus android train_schedule   though so you've got a bit of time      unfortunately  i'm not sure what could be the matter here but you could start investigating by     from pocmo's suggestion  looking at the git log for  browserfragment    does anything look suspicious  perhaps back out a changeset and see if it fixes the problem   bisecting  check out different changesets on master to find out which reproduce and which don't to narrow down which changeset could have caused the regression  this is less viable because the issue isn't consistently reproducible yet    just reading the code      let us know if you need any assistance and don't forget you can find us at #focus on irc generally during pst working hours 
can you please tell me how can i see the logs  this is what happens  when i try to open the jnlp file through command prompt using 'javaws abc jnlp'  it works  but if i try to open using windows 'open with' option  it doesn't  it does not even open any command prompt to  logs things that are happening  this happens only in 1 8 version  whereas in 1 7 x  even when i open jnlp with 'open with' option  it immediately opens command prompt where i can see the logs and icedtea web looks to be working fine

sure  we could do that  there are a couple of outliers in  httpheaders that have words with consecutive capital letters   etag  and  www authenticate   see http   docs oracle com javaee 6 api constant values html#javax ws rs core httpheaders accept   maybe we can just create a special case for those   i'm not fond of special cases  but that would ensure that we normalize exactly once and use  httpheaders  constants everywhere else

as a test i changed to the default cookie spec providers and had no substantive change in my one test case  changing the version solved my issue  i don't know what the more wideranging side effects of changing that will be  i think a check to see if a cookie value contains whitespace and then setting it to version 1 might help some future compatibility issues   on mar 22  2017 11 17 pm  "d  hollingsworth"  notifications github com  wrote   does this need to be hardcoded  can the cookiespec implementations not figure out when cookies need to be sent as version 0 or version 1   not sure on this  we do set the httpcomponents cookie handling policy to a custom one defined in the project by the class laxcookiespecprovider  i figured that was mostly responsible for how cookies are parsed but it might also be affecting how cookies get sent too  apache does allow for cookies to be explicitly set too rather than rely on these manager spec classes   — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  https   github com machinepublishers jbrowserdriver issues 266#issuecomment 288606025   or mute the thread  https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth art1req3rceu9_tbim_2qzdqifte4jlpks5roerhgajpzm4ml9dz

i have been working on this for the last 10 days now  i have created a test case for it and have also re factored the blockwiselayer quite a lot so that it now handles all of this correctly afaik  in the course of doing so i completely removed all  special behavior regarding blockwise transfers  from the matchers as well   i will push the branch with the changes later during the day so that you guys can take a look  but beware  i made a lot of changes

do you have only one ssl certificate on that server   as far as i know  that problem only occurs if your server provides multiple certificates for different domains  sni   in that case  the app  if it doesn't support sni  will just use a "random" certificate  maybe first or last of the server config i guess  depends on the server    when using ssl i can't activate the service  "test" will fail with a generic error as far as i remember  i am not in possession of the phone right now    i will report back if i have any more information   here my concrete example    my picture gallery is located at https   pics stefanwienert de  that cert is valid etc pp   but  if connecting without sni  like     i just receive any certificate  for another of my domains fahrrad filter de

 leticiarossi thanks for the guess  after changing the default  colors xml  to  i was able to determine that the color of the text on the buttons is taken from  colorprimary       Аннотация 2020 02 12 080653  https   user images githubusercontent com 4838367 74307723 db58e980 4d6e 11ea 8dfd ade3f5b8fe1b png   is this expected behavior  how then can i create a light theme if  toolbar  color are the same as edittextpreference buttons text color    after all  in the standard theme  theme appcompat light  the text color of the edittextpreference buttons is taken from  coloraccent  which is more logical  accent only for interactive things  the rest is for statics  
sure  i should be able to do this tomorrow

i uninstalled orbot and now looks like everything is ok  i don't know if orbot was the reason to this problem 
could be a synchronization issue  only write and rotation are synchronized  not arithmetics and reset of the counters

hi  mkulesh  thank you for your quick response and for pointing me to the new firmware  actually  i'm not using the latest firmware and i wasn't even aware that it has been released   my current firmware is  2120 3000 0000 0010 latest firmware released in nov  2019  2140 5000 0000 0011  however  there might be some very serious bugs in the new firmware  see   http   www hifi forum de viewthread 272 6905 html  http   www hifi forum de viewthread 272 6905 html     post no  8 states that onkyo has confirmed the issue    post  no  9 indicates that r n855 is probably also affected even if the initial post refers to another onkyo product   i will have an eye on that issue and once they fixed the bugs in their latest release  i will upgrade my receiver  accordingly  after that  i will share my experiences here  in the meantime  i downgrade your app to 1 2 as i really don't want to brake my r n855 and app version 1 2 was already quite good   close to perfect    
i am using version v3 108 on minecraft 1 12 2

dita ot 2 5 2 but probably older versions have the same problem  i'm not sure how this usually works when running the dita ot integrator from the command line using the "dita  install"  possibly because my dita ot is installed in a folder which has french accents    we run our automated tests in such a folder 
 eivantsov my browser doesn't communicate with any language servers directly if my understanding is sure  so i guess it is not caused by unstable wan network  and i believe the network in azure is enough stable

hi   hmm  i could not find a configuration file for the karaf stuff  however  i checked out https   github com sonatype nexus public and modified https   github com sonatype nexus public blob master assemblies nexus base template src main resources overlay etc karaf config properties i added  co elastic apm agent    to the boot delegation  hmm  funny thing is  that with any agent below version 1  it works without modifying the sources from nexus oss   what i am not understanding is  why is the javaagent since version 1 impacting booting with  bootdelegation   to be fair  i am not a java developer  so there is a lot of things i won't understand   
sorry  i should have mentioned that i use dita ot 1 7 2  that is the latest one 
yes i rebooted  hmm since there are lots of other users i think it might be a problem    i am back to 2 0 25 and imported settings from 2 0 27 and accounts work great  i asked at xda if someone can provide a catlog   
i did install nunit  and for whatever reason the build all script works for every directory except nunit runners so i had to manually copy the tools directory from nunit consolerunner to get the build all script to work properly 
i reinstalled bloklauncher but it dont work
no did not do anything else besides changing logging to debug  i can do steps 1 3 but when trying to use jstack the command is not found  i could try changing xmx to 2048 first 
thanks  jexp   yes  i am using the enterprise edition and will raise a bug there   i don't have the errors from the time it happened  however  trying to drop the constraint throws the following message in the neo4j shell

charter member are basically premium member  which became and stayed premium since the first year of groundspeaks premium option  the difference should only be the member type name on the website  but technically identical to premium members   therefore i more suspect  that the live map might do something wrong on server side  but i don't know if there might be anything in the detail of the parameters we send to request data from the map 
thank you for your response  in the server logs i can't see anything interesting  just a bunch of failed parsed messages     the issue seems to appear in some days  usually is gets back to normal when the index is deflected  we have 30 indices with 20 mil entries each 
sorry   i will show you more details i want to break the logout request  and drop it by zap's api    the steps is  1  call addhttpbreakpoint  string  location  match  inverse  ignorecase     to add "logout" break  2  call waitforhttpbreak  poll keepalive    to detect if zap breaks  3  if zap breaks  call drop    to drop the request  these steps is ok on zap ui mode  but it does work on daemon mode  the error is in step 2   when the browse sends logout request    zap can not break it

just a normal ubuntu droplet   yes  it is because of two eth0  interfaces 
using otest with ohmage 2 16 3   steve's complex xml tests    message survey   a message tag exists and is supposed to fire after answer the timestamp message  but does not  downloading the latest sdk tools now  can submit logs for this  
unfortunately stack trace seems to be not logged by jenkins control plugin   it just displays error message in red "balloon"  it seems to be when parsing xml from jenkins  but i don't know which  the main one looks "normal" for me   the same problem occurred in an alternative hudson monitor   and i attach stack trace from it 
yes  it completely helps      thx   for those who are in docker land and want to see how i overcame it  i use the following assets to build my es json logging docker image 
no  there was a large plate pattern in the part builder 
it does happen on enabling and disabling  but when it happens seem to be random  sometimes flight mode doesn't change for two or three "loops" of the script  then it works a while again   too bad that it can't be fixed easily  i helped myself now by switching mobile data on and off instead of flight mode  should be a standard android feature in my opinion  because not being online all the time saves lots of battery power   btw  what's the difference between exact and inexact timers  how more exact is the exact timer and is the battery drain much higher

i'm using 0 13 7 201111141412  i guess it is  the latest daily build version   i've set my workspace eiditor encoding as utf 8    preference    general    content type  text    erlang source file  i changed to default encoding form iso 8859 1 to utf 8   but it still doesn't work 
yep  works fine now  thanks for the quick response 
yes one second  let me load up 1 8 9 
there is not that file in that directory 
yes  i used the latest version which was released about hour ago   i tried to add 3 different apps  and any of them makes app crash 
no    this is the precision issue   precision 11 is days and the time part was not zero   nevertheless  when i fixed that  i get a  new error  https   etl opendata cz # pipelines edit canvas pipeline https  2f 2fetl opendata cz 2fresources 2fpipelines 2f1564738794545 execution https  2f 2fetl opendata cz 2fresources 2fexecutions 2f1570193679934 515 28573c94 6e27 4b7f 9997 16959b04d330  
 yegor256 in general  yes  but it would be the best to have this behavior completely transparant for the library user
sorry  it's my fault  i'm using the version 18 5 1 that is defined in readme md  not the recent one 
hi  muffinjello  i did try the androidx migration just to find that android studio detected no androixx usage so  that warning must be misleading from flutter  finally i have managed to make it work using the below approach and honestly i am not happy with this plugin conflicts with required sdks etc  while i understand that flutter is relatively new and these plugins are generous contributions from the flutter family  they need to ensure that any flutter version upgrades don't break things line this   ok  the core issue came down to 2 plugins and esp  these versions  which i was using      flutter_webview_plugin   0 3 5 google_maps_flutter   0 5 16  so  if i just use the flutter_webview_plugin   0 3 5  i get the below errors and the apk build fails      if i use just the flutter_webview_plugin   0 3 5       it complies with below warning but does successfully build the apk   if i just use google_maps_flutter   0 5 16  i get the below warnings but it does end up building apk   i even tried to use webview_flutter   0 3 9+1 it builds the apk with below warnings     initializing gradle                                                 0 7s resolving dependencies                                              1 5s note  some input files use or override a deprecated api                  note  recompile with  xlint deprecation for details                      running gradle task 'assemblerelease'                                    running gradle task 'assemblerelease'    done                      25 7s built build app outputs apk release app release apk  5 3mb       but    if i have 2 plugins i e  google_maps_flutter   0 5 16 and webview_flutter   0 3 9+1  i again get the same big fat error about dex archives see below   and the build fails    so  in a nutshell the google_maps_flutter  0 5 16 conflicts with any of the other 2 plugins  an may be a few others which i don't use   hope this clarifies things

yes  i can provide an example  unfortunally this issue tracker won't let me add a pom xml or pom txt as attachment      so i have to add the pom content directly      xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"    project xmlns "http   maven apache org pom 4 0 0" xmlns xsi "http   www w3 org 2001 xmlschema instance" xsi schemalocation "http   maven apache org pom 4 0 0 http   maven apache org maven v4_0_0 xsd"       modelversion 4 0 0  modelversion       project   the problem is caused by the dependency declaration   if it is removed all runs fine   if it is defined  the rule execution crash with a npe     probably because a pom artifact hasn't "real" dependencies   but we need use such declarations in our parent pom to force all projects to rely on some basic dependencies

thanks for the response  it's a home grown kms client that expects a configuration object  the configuration object is constructed from values that are read in from a  properties file and injected as parameters into the enclosing  bean method  the issue is arising from the fact that one of the injected parameters is somehow null when  enableswagger2 is used  but non null when it's commented out  the code runs and builds fine in the absence of swagger

i think when a player was entering a town with enter flag set to false  but not always
no  i dont't  but i receive a lot of reports  up to 10 s  and a lot of them with the same cause  maybe it's timing or threading problem  in my database i have 4 entries with same stacktrace text  same version_code and version_name but different bug_id  and id  
yeah  it does  this examples does real time updates http   www flotcharts org flot examples realtime index html  it could be modified and use to test this bug by adding more points to draw  doing 300 points at 818 px  
yes
the problem might have always existed  i just discovered that category randomly  it does not happen for the other categories i have tried  i reproduced the problem for that particular category  so it probably has _something_ special 
just sent you an email
a modal would be better than the current behavior  but i think it'd be much better to be able to edit the form while viewing the definition  that's why a frame feels better to me

i took a look at the logs in the mail server  hmailserver   and there is a clear difference between the dummy message and the alert message  i'm not an expert in mail servers or the process by which they manage messages  but it looks like the following is happening    graylog2 requests to send mail   the mail server creates a session   graylog2 sends ehlo and authenticates   the mail server checks the from and to   graylog2 communicates parts of the message back and forth with the mail server   the mail server logs "sent  221 goodbye" then ends the session   the message is then written to disk and a session with the smtp deliverer is started relaying the message via gmail   after being sent  the message is deleted from the disk  when a real message  non dummyalert  is sent  the session between the mail server and graylog2 gets interrupted  the "sent  xxx goodbye" message is never logged  below is the logging although it isn't very revealing     i have been able to line up the last  sent  354 ok  send   message with the java exception  there are no errors in the hmailserver log at all 
this fixes the problem   thanks a lot

rt6   i just can't select the object i want it always gets some random ground objects if it would filter those away it would be alot easier to select the interactable object
strange  that link is working for me  try it again   in the app  open home gdg and then open the for leads tab and select gdg resources

i didn't realize that there was already a problem in the past   as a result  the same error    please look   https   drive google com drive folders 1nzonxfxfjvbwx2ozvbz_9inem1g3odg7 
the caches are not accessible  only the images are kept stored  for consistency  they should be purged at the same time as the caches   what you are asking is something else  do not expunge old caches  that should be raised in another issue  maybe an option could be used to set clear this behaviour  but most people will expect the data to be cleared  they don't even know the data is here as it is in a hidden folder  
hi  thanks   yes  i have 2 6 0 installed   i did try to reload the account twice but the total remains the same  i'm not quite sure what i'm doing wrong  this seems to be a little different from #197 in that in the transactions section there are no double transactions  i looked in the unspent outputs like in #200 but also there is only one entry for 0 01825049btc   searching my email for 0 01825049 i only see one purchase from coinbase   i suppose i can delete the app data and try again    maybe tomorrow 
i'm unable to reproduce the error myself  but have asked the user to try to narrow down the error by creating a short note and long note and try to cause the error to happen 
i was trying to craft a coal block using vanilla coal  i got the crash with the inventory 3x3 crafting  in the vanilla bench  and in the tconstruct crafting table

you can use tests regression java rewrite engine list test1  it's commented out but uncomment it and you'll have an example  although it doesn't print the stack trace unless you turn back on smt solving 
thanks for reply     in my application too many sprites and  if i run it on my old "shitphone"  phone memory is quickly filled with instances of objects    bullrampdump  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4895253 22746865 54352aee ee36 11e6 847b dd4adc0be959 jpg   happen very often calls the garbage collector 
what field type did you have on the data in es   most are keyword  but the source field is  "type" "text" "analyzer" "analyzer_keyword" "fielddata" true       does that happen always on all fields or only on that single one   i'm seeing it with every field i try  i first saw it with my top hosts widget  which is using source  if i do a 5 minute search and try doing quickvalues on various fields  all that i try will have random duplicate entries and the majority won't be sorted correctly       is this reproducible at any time   so far it is 
hello   thanks for the quick reply   sure  below is a unit test that does reproduce the error  details about the environment are     java 8   spring boot starter parent  2 1 7 release   amqp client  5 4 3   and using junit 5  i did try it on another project though with following specs  which actually works      java 11   spring boot starter parent  2 1 9 release   amqp client  5 4 3   and also using junit 5
seems like the json fields are different  private vs is_private 
after some more investigation  the comparison is actually against the  ref  field of the push object  the value of that will usually be a git ref  like  refs heads master  for pushes to branches  i think the proper solution is not to match anything  but testing for equality with  targetbranch  prepended by  refs heads     refs heads   is the only prefix that makes sense  because we do not care about tags that are pushed or other refs   i will give the fix a try and test it out on our server 
it was a simple copy paste
my dpi is 440  update  excuse me  i just looked up my smallest width in developer options and it says 392  so i changed it to 400 and everything is alright now

gregory   i agree it is a complex issue but also maybe a flaw in the tap protocol    if tap has started writing to the http response  it is forbidden by http to change the http status  forward or redirect   http_header info     as you said  if the response is committed  then the tap server can not modify the response  except close it but not reset it   of course  you should log such rare cases in the uws log with stack traces    maybe you should bufferize the complete tap response  formatter  in memory or into tmp files in order to let the response ready      or explain that issue at the ivoa level to make a tap enhancement    laurent
my mistake i meant #1173  i've updated the original post to say so  #1169 works fine  it's my current fallback  stability wise 
 spencergibb firstly  thank you so much for reply   it still can not work   in spring cloud bus 1 3 0  compositemessageconverterfactory init in bindingserviceconfiguration  bindingserviceconfiguration custommessageconverters contains 2 messageconverter  defaultdatatypechannelmessageconverter  and  busjacksonmessageconverter  in finchley build snapshot compositemessageconverterfactory init in contenttypeconfiguration  but the custommessageconverters is null   so  actuator bus refresh    could not resolve type id 'refreshremoteapplicationevent' as a subtype  with no busjacksonmessageconverter  thank you for taking time help 
im using identityserver4  yes  can be reproducing by installing microsoft edge on android  set it as default browser  run the default latest example in the project  try to authorize  after login  giving permission  it will just stuck at the screen "you are now being returned to the application  once complete  you may close this tab" and never return to app  but on chrome and samsung internet  it seems automatically return to the app

hi francisco   those changes to work with the new api are in our code  we read ckan contents to show them in a browser   not in cygnus ckan  i am sorry about the noise   we are using cygnus ckan without any changes and configure to publish in demo ckan org  i have tested 0 8 2 and develop branches  and both have the same issues   thanks for the quick response 
 pmwmedia latest   2 1 0rc 2 
not a problem  i am running version 3 1 3 
i have made what i think are appropriate changes and added test cases to support both the delimited and fixed parsers   i have committed and generated a pull request 
yes perfectly  i have deleted the usage data even if i never used aosp mode and the entry still there 
that's what i thought   which make me wonder why we get that error  after looking at the link  perhaps there is a setting we've missed somewhere  that tell osm not to look for this bubble

 aleruz ok   can you adjust the pr one more time for the mandatory ness part  we can release 0 9 3 rc2 within a week
methodname_args are the defaults as defined in the thrift file  right  that's mainly for programming convenience  and especially for supporting optional parameters but not useful for populating a debug form i think   for example  imagine a user_id field  no one's going to put a default user id in the thrift file 
ok  this is strange  i try on my home computer  ubuntu  and it works as expected  i used "fresh" pref and also the same pref than my other computer  it was the same database   i will try again on my work computer  windows  tomorrow 
it looks like github already cross linked this for us   thanks for addressing it 
still continues to happen with the owncloud server with selfsigned certificate  but on other with free ssl certificate i tried everything is ok on first look  so i think there is something wrong with selfsigned certificates  i have imported mine through cadroid 
good question  not sure  but in any case we can't allow anyone to place their stuff in any category

previously we had timing   synchronization issues where alert counts were getting lots when we overwrote the status when a new alert arrived and lost a pending status  dont know whats going on here yet  but i suspect synchronization   timing
might be causing #609 also  never had that before either
i had this issue on both debug and release  i couldn't resolve the problem  however i noticed i would only get this error when i changed from the view hosting the video to another view and then back again to the original view  it makes me wonder if this issue has something to do with the fact that i am re inflating the youtube view again 
add the widget with the previous version

i can't swear that the droid maxx has a step counter  though i could check if i knew where to look  but it's extremely accurate  so it's doing something right    it has happened 3 times now  but i haven't seen a correlation to anything i'm doing physically  i e  running   no task killer or battery savers  not rooted  stock rom 4 4 4  i don't reboot for sometimes a couple weeks at a time 
yes the request is sent immediately on keyup   i will try with the delay attribute and let you know

soory  it seems to be problem of the apache server  after deactivating nextcloud the problems came after some time back   have the reinstall the server and in the moment it's working  can't investigate the problem anymore 
missing methods would be reported by the compiler  here it was not explicitly missing  but inherited from  object tostring     which does not print the file path but some string which was not useful 
today  the test is success passed on ci  https   ci codenvycorp com view qa nightly job che integration tests multiuser master ocp all tests 96 selenium_20tests_20report failsafe report html#org eclipse che selenium languageserverjsonfileeditingtest   hence the bug is fixed 
my windows version is 8 1  the prozessor is a intel i7 5500u  2 40ghz 
currently a52  not currently in a position to push for the newest    and as i said  i couldn't duplicate it locally  so i couldn't see if a59 also exhibited the same behavior 
looks good now  thanks

 swankjesse if i call the close    method in the main class  i expect that all connections will be closed  not just those that are inactive 
i think so   we'll need to test this carefully because i believe google maps does retain its own state information  and we don't want to be fighting their implementation or moving the camera zoom unnecessarily  on jun 22  2016 12 22 am  "aziz batihk" notifications github com wrote 
i just ran the rebuild  now i do get back that parent when i query the main snomed vet endpoint  but it is very slow to return  like 6 7 seconds   before it was pretty much instantaneous  i also see this log message output when i call that endpoint now   that seems surprising for just a single concept parent query

 ryanjbaxter thanks for your response  the reason being we do not want the developer to be concerned with the fact the service is a eureka client in development mode  it is a  infrastructure concern  we only want to use the service as a eureka client  in higher environments by applying a profile accordingly   but  the concern now being it worked fine for us when we were using spring boot 1 4 5  probably something has changed in next version of spring 1 5 3 which has caused this breaking change for us  i was not able to find anything from the release notes   do you mean creating a eurekaclient bean would resolve this issue  not sure how that would do so 
i tried to extract something i could post  but failed  then i removed the affected folder from my workspace and re added   and  presto  no problem any more

for example  if there is an 8fe t solar flux reborn solarpanel on the battery and the battery is full then only 8 fe t will be output  without an incoming energy source  2000 will be output or what you specify in the configs 
actually not  i only observed the issue once from firebase crashlytics
 abhinay w3bminds i looked through the log and see the app received "transport error"  can you please set the log level to debug  voiceclient setloglevel loglevel debug   and provide logs 
i'll check after work  i re did my itemgroups conf and only have daggers and swords  which were definitely working before api 2 0 0 release   so i removed maces  and custom armors 
i mean that 3 finger swipes to switch desktops is extremely laggy if it exists at all  2 finger scrolling is almost unusable  as soon as i stop the hook thread all of those problems clear up

i see your point   on the other hand  some functions  zoom in  out  layer  etc  as always  ish  available so it could be the same importance as these   i consider viewing info on features as super important so the function should always be available   especially if labeling is dropped deferred 
yes  this is an ha setup  2 3 2   we use a rather weird setup  i can't even tell why  the decision has been made without my participation   one instance is embedded into java app and the slave is in standalone mode + configured as  slave_only   we restarted the application and this embedded instance's logs had these lines  i stopped the app again  configured a standalone neo4j distribution to use app's data directory and it reconfigured itself ok  then i stopped the standalone neo4j  started the app with an embedded db and everything seems fine 
seems like pressing the plugin icon solves the problem  thought it was supposed to be automatic thanks 
 javanna you are right   this is a perl issue   it silently converts  23 0  in the json into an integer  which is why it logged the integer in the trace logs    apologies for the noise   i'll probably have to work around this with a range check 
sorry for missing info  there isnt any error in the console
the call to  reduce    in  price getvaluenum     and  getvaluedenom     is to avoid having to do  this call  https   github com codinguser gnucash android pull 484 files#diff f09bdcd45d932eeaff0d88b567e44687l231   if we are to store it reduced  i think it's better to just do it automatically   if you are ok with it  i can fix the unit test 
i think "playnotificationsounduri" does not consider the case of "x rincon stream"  i can try to fix the issue 
it's with the rstudio developer blog

okay  it's not a problem with  remotespringapplication  itself  but if you have  spring cloud starter config  on the classpath and configure  spring cloud config failfast true  in  bootstrap yml  then autoreconfiguration of some other spring boot projects  in my case  spring boot starter actuator  or  spring boot starter ws   will try to connect to the config server somewhere and crash the  remotespringapplication  because of failfast true
i was curious about that message  too  i strongly doubt it because all the cfcs work perfectly and even though they will have issues  i'm 100  certain they won't have unclosed tags all over the place as indicated by the output above  or in other experiments i ran   will check tomorrow morning though

the up navigation is meant to create a _hierarchical_ navigation model  in many cases that is identical to a forward backward navigation  but not in all  the android navigation pattern page describes that very detailed  http   developer android com design patterns navigation html  it is completely up to you  what you specify as the hierachical model behind your activities  but in our case  we should surely have cache details    list containing the cache    main screen

working on this now  can i clarify  1  how should the  panelcontrol  be passed as a parameter  also because if we can access it from tests  we could just use  getpanel  in  panelcontrol  to get the panel directly  2  would it be okay to add getters in  filterpanel  to return elements  i e  filtertextfield  closebutton  etc  
please  go ahead  all yours   
yes
i think this issue is indeed related to #265  and the solution proposed by  strangenoises  #265#issuecomment 262994643  seem to work   however someone more knowledgeable than me should look at case of the reusable cells 
yes  sure  do a  mvn clean install  and then  mvn clean spring boot run   then   1  go to  http   localhost 48080 admin storages storage common proxies group common proxies update  2  reorder the repositories in the  group repositories  tab 3  save  and remember the ordering you did  4   cat strongbox web core strongbox etc conf strongbox xml   grep  i  a 8 'id "group common proxies"'    result will be the old order    i just noticed that if you create a new group repository   it preserves the correct order  however  if you're updating an existing one   it would not update the order of the repos in the xml 
so it just happens nothing      the ore isn't grinded  but i think it's a problem of the server because it works perfectly in soloplayer   but if you know what i have to change in the server files  i would be vers grateful 
the tests also run  i'll bring up the services not running 
docker4mac picks up the proxy info from the macos system preferences  if you manually put in proxy values there  remember  i don't actually have proxy values that i want to use for http and https proxies  so they would be blank   you goof up the internal docker4mac http and https proxies   here's my  docker info

the  doublecomparator  returns false  i think the problem lies in  normalizedkeysorter  because the support is checked in the constructor but in  write t record       is called anyway  would it be ok to simply remove the thrown  unsupportedexception  in  putnormalizedkey  of the comparator

tl dr   it mostly depends on the volume of the tracks song i'm listening to  some tracks i had the volume increased using easymp3gain  they're the troublesome ones  as lowering the media volume via the button on the side of the phone  will also lower the volume of the announcement by opentracks  with some other songs the volume of the song is similar to the volume of the announcement in opentracks so when the media player output is lowered it's  easier to hear the ot announcement  still i would increase ot's volume a bit if i could   especially during rides     i did a few tests and realized in opentracks the volume of the media player output was only lowered not muted entirely    muted as no sound but the announcement  similar to tasks or osmand     i think i noticed a slight difference between odyssey and vlc  to the benefit of odyssey  but it's hard to tell because it change on a song to song basis as described above  in both media player volume is only lowered not silenced though   when i poked around the sound settings in the parameter's menu of the phone   four separate volume settings   ringtone   media   notifications   system     i noticed that in tasks the announcements are channelled through the notifications one   in osmand user can choose where they want the voice guidance to go to through in settings navigation settings choose a specific profile  under voice select voice guidance output and choose   while in opentracks it's through the media output thus i can set the volume separately for media player and announcements for tasks but for opentracks the volume is changed for both media player and announcement through the media setting   or the button on the side of the phone for that matter  
i have an idea to what is happening as i came across this before with another attribute  android studio is changing the way they parse attributes  for instance they were switching enum parsing from integer to string in my previous case  my temporary solution was  view isineditmode  to check if it was in preview windows  error stack trace

i think it happens because you use the link text over the actual url in the link to retrieve the card information  same thing also happens with "return  card "  and i'm sure a few others 
thank you for your reply i find reason after i report this bug  and i comment it on my bug page  but now i can not find it  the cause of the bug is i am not consume the entire response body in my origin code   i do not consume the entire response body  here is my origin code    my new code is work  but i think some times people do not consume entire response body  so i think the better way is that it can implicit invoke by okhttp framework
 spencergibb sure  here are the steps to test reproduce     start a rabbit instance and the  config server sample    create  config client sample yml  under   tmp config sample        start the  config client sample and  get  3000   you'll get the value in the  greeting  property   now change the value in the configuration file    tmp config sample config client sample yml   to something else     the config server will pick this change and broadcast an event     the config client will retrieve the new value and return it on subsequent get requests    now the bug      change the value of  spring cloud bus id  in the  bootstrap yml  of the  config server sample  to anything other than  config server sample 1    config server wont send any remoteapplicationevents when changing the  greeting  property in  config client sample yml   more generally  if the value of  spring cloud bus id  is not    spring application name  1  the  remoteapplicationevents  wont be sent  please let me know if you need anything else   i could provide a  docker compose  to streamline this process if you want  however i wont be able to do it till later today or tomorrow

yes  i changed the options listed in the migration guide     isn't that enough  should i delete the lines with #alt# 
i do not currently use pnc myself  this is coming from another user   so i do not know all the details  what i was told is that updating pnc from a version some versions back to the latest caused the pnc converters i have to crash with a noclassdeffound on iairhandler   i do not ship the pnc api  i do not think i ever did

you can not create a shortcut directly in kiss  but with any cut you can create a shortcut through the app the same as for firefox 
yes  i do 
i believe its the problem in a specific version  i got it working on this version c511401d4392a485ee1fe2339ab0abf58c90aefb  but this 088478e376 is not working  if i'm pointing to the wrong one  can you tell the latest working version 
that is the code that registers the custom data  it persists fine even after a restart  it's just not rolled back from the block snapshot   it appears to me that the problem is not on my code  but on the code that does the snapshot rollback 
i just reorganize files in unity  trying to achieve same file structure as in my own project  not sure if it was some concrete move  just create new folder in unity and drag and drop old files to new folder structure 
cleaned at it worked fine  sorry about that 
fixed   this had to do with adding other dbeaver support sites such as office integration etc  once i uninstalled them they went away 
my driver is set to postgresql 9 4 1211 jre7 jar  default   do i need another one  how can i change it  in postgres you can use any marker for function definition     is used in examples  but you can use any other string   the problem is when you open function definition from dbeaver  f4    source  the marker is  function   from pgadmin it is  body   so if you try to execute this sql you receive an error  also this error is given in some other correct scripts  this one is just an obvious example

 serge rider i did  unfortunately it only supports a single character it seems   i was looking at solving this by adding another preference page specifically for ms sql  see https   github com juszczakn dbeaver commit 9cb9e768d21018bed499cef497fc16db5cd43503   i'm not sure if that is the best approach though  any suggestions  also  i'm not sure how to test my changes 
it's sanctioned now that we fixed the null pointer    it takes the money    there was a fun bug where the first time a country was sanctioned for cheating  instead of taking any money from it  it just rounded its availabletospend to the nearest dollar    i've fixed that though  so this all appears to be working

hi  mzelzoghbi  thanks for investigation  in our case  we use a foreground service  that must have its own notification  not really sure that there is a difference in this case   we are pretty sure that the problem is several processes because we started getting crash reports with this issue right after releasing an app version with the foreground service  it is 30 times more frequent than the next reason in our top crash reasons list 
all the bugs are fixed except for a case resulting from scenario 4    viskell currently crashes  probably endless recursion  judging from the stack overflow  in an attempt to check this program in which a connection is made higher up in an expression tree  after which it is no longer a tree but a dag   note that this doesn't hold in general  for example   type  manipulating a list and then zipping it with the original list works fine 
basically i had a config server and client in one microserver  i was trying to get rid of the config server being an own instance  maybe this was a not so good idea

 scottmitch i've debugged it and found out the reason of the problem  after that i had tracked changes of 4 1 0 beta5 version and i understood  that it is not a bug    apologize for the noise   for the version 4 1 0 beta5  according to #3712  i need to call  client ctx flush    after all writes to the channel  https   github com idelpivnitskiy aerogear webpush server blob 4 1 0 beta6 snapshot server netty src main java org jboss aerogear webpush netty webpushframelistener java#l203 l213 and it solved my problem   for the current version  according to #3860  i also need to call  client encoder flowcontroller   writependingbytes       isn't it  if everything is correct  the issue could be closed 
i only noticed it after updating from 1 1 456 to 1 2 1335

i still observe it with the version on the play store as of 20190701    img src "https   user images githubusercontent com 56189 60441598 e597fe80 9c49 11e9 84bd 54b3d295f85e jpg" width 200   i noticed that after a while  i took a photo of the screenshot  cropped and shared it with my laptop   the device was locked and when unlocked  the 0 eth ether card appears  maybe it takes a while to appear 
hi  philips77   sorry for the very late answer   yup  i have updated the verison of the lib to 2 0 0 beta5 and tried to bond after connection  unfortunately i experienced the same behavior as before  the request queue stucks    i will check again with the stable v2 0 0 tomorrow and will provide more details if the issue still exists

thanks  i'll add a unit test and pr it to this issue later today  as i'm in a meeting right now 
running a quick test  not only can i confirm that i'm not calling the global registry to create an npc  i'm  not calling the global registry _in my entire project_  https   i imgur com kfftbar png    the npc is created within an  npccontroller  abstract class which is shared amongst all my npcs  the only difference between the type of npc which is being saved to  saves yml  and the others is that i'm using pathing for this kind     creation in  npccontroller       note that guardconfig is entirely separate from npcs  all i'm pulling from it is the predefined path for the npcs to follow  perhaps not the most elegant solution  but certainly nothing  that i can think of  which should be making any saves to the global configuration   edit  to clarify again  guardconfig is something stored elsewhere in the project  it's not something to do with npcs that i've merely renamed 
what i mean is  i type in the username and password and click on "use ptc auth" and then nothing happens  i never get the option to save the password or see the ui  nor do i get the login has failed message  the javaw exe remains listed in the task manager and if i get several failures in a row  i get several jvms doing nothing 
aha  more information needed to reproduce this  when running the zip i get the correct documentation  but when i apply the following enunciate xml file that i use then it appear again  so if the default generation is used  then the documentation is correctly generated  this this is even more of a corner case than i realized

hi  i've run jprofiler and yourkit  this is where it gets weird  i cannot find any threads that are chewing cpu  everything appears ok and ehcache doesn't appear in any of the dumps i've taken  but the presence of ehcache is all that is required to max out the cpus  if i swap to jdk or guava caches  the system stops chewing cpu  i'll give jtop a try  thanks 
i will try   ftr our build is currently failing with    our nexus is connected to central so we should have it  and locally i got the warning   not sure what's wrong though  since i can see the pom in https   search maven org remotecontent filepath org jodconverter jodconverter local 4 2 3 jodconverter local 4 2 3 pom
couldn’t find any logs related to this and i think it’s not happening anymore  closing issue and will come back if it returns  thanks
hi joschi    i will test it with the next beta version    thanks
what do you mean  like i could make a gif
i've uploaded it  thank you very much 
yeah sorry  think this was caused by a pack that isn't used anymore  smooth sailing since then
try again  as my grammar change is checked in now  as is the above test  but with an  ignore   the grammar change allows an array to be returned by an expression  i e  remember how we were trying to allow array references to be expressions in the grammar     so the idea is that you can have an expression  like a case statement or a built in function return an array type  like this       the getdatatype   should return an array pdatatype  but my guess is that it's returning the element type instead

3 0 0 snapshot  checked out today  i'm kind of used to svn  how do you report the right 'revision'  
okay will try that and let you know the result
this issue happened with rv2 stable 9 i downgraded to rv2 stable 8 and it works  edit  i just tested this with only applied energistics and it does this on its own so i am sure its on the mods side and not some conflict
sure  i started with a note with this content     i think this may also have to do with timing  i waited a couple seconds  switched to preview  and immediately saw the preview with that new content  but when i closed and reopened the note it didn't include the added content   however  if i added the content and then immediately switched to preview  i had to wait a moment for the preview to update with that new content  it looks like in that case the change is saved when i close and reopen the note 
verified that the problem is now solved    yes indeed

no changelog for the original  sadly  but aideen was a priestess shaman whatever you call deirdre's vanilla class  and claude was a sage   however  i've got you a changelog of a different retain healers seed that also claims no healing staves exist in the first generation  unless you count claude's valkyrie   where aideen is a troubadour and claude is a high priest   i did notice that the item list contains two healing staves that aren't available anywhere  0x12   heal  0x8d   mend   i guess those are supposed to be assigned to aideen claude but just aren't for some reason  i played up to aideen's recruitment to see if she actually was getting one of those but she didn't  and i don't feel like playing further on another potential "no healers for half the game" seed to see if those items show up anywhere    fe4rando3 zip  https   github com lushen124 universal fe randomizer files 3100879 fe4rando3 zip

i never experienced this with other connectors using oauth but to be fair i did not play with them as much as i did with concur  there were no other deployments  no reset  nothing  it was on minishift  syndesis tag 1 4 5 so no image updates and i did not run any tests  it was all done manually   exactly what you mentioned   i set the oauth for concur  created concur connection and integration  it was  database    mapper    concur  create listitem     log  body  headers     log  everything   all i did between republishing was editing the mapper step

when i write a  ics from imagej  the header states the seemingly right dimensionality and scaling  the dimensions get mixed up  but not lost  when opening the image there  that’s why i only referenced the according issue of scifio

i removed hwyla yesterday and that's why i'm reporting this here  the errors stopped  the players aren't disconnected anymore  and before  they were disconnected after 6 10 hours of server uptime  after this time  all players started being disconnected  i think it's an issue with hwyla and 1 10 servers  and you haven't received issues related because right now there are only a few servers running complete packs  that includes hwyla    
main method is  insert   before the insert i do full delete on the same entity class   basically wipe replace content of an entity  if i get some more time i try to create sample project to reproduce it   so i could share it

it's an uncommon error with a race condition  i'm not able to reproduce it so i can't know if it also happens with 1 4 5 or not  looking at the code in 1 4 5 my impression was that the basic code of that part hadn't been changed  do you think it could be already fixed in 1 4 5 
this is boost from freebsd ports  it hasn't been built with any special options  and is supposed to work for everything 
those changes worked  +1   i am now able to claim my usb scale and read values off of it 
sorry no  it was on a new server with 12 people running in different directions 
well  when i set the probe retract distance to 20mm i expect it to hit the touch plate and retract 20mm   i thought the probe distance was the length of probe travel before it stopped the action and produced and error message assuming there was a problem   i maybe wrong but i thought these were two separate functions   is there a reason for them to be tied together 
michael   yes  i meant the query frame  i am using chrome  i shared the zipped version of my 2 3 1 database in the issue specifically related to performance tuning  no  i don't see any error messages in messages log  sorry  i have trouble locating console log   also  as i indicated in the other ticket  my 2 3 1 installation is really misbehaving now when i have 2 2 7 and 2 3 1 versions installed  and i dont even attempt to run them at the same time  i always make sure one is shut down   that may be a separate issue   thanks  gene 
this is now fixed 
i don't think an account needed to be selected at all 
i have version 2 6 rc1 installed on my personal laptop  and it's fine  so it might be my work laptop  i'll check tomorrow 
i am not sure why  but i have been unable to get any traffic coming from strongbox  requests and responses from clients to strongboxes are showing up fine  but requests from strongbox to the web are not showing up in my proxy program fiddler   maybe does strongbox not respect the system proxy  or fiddler is not capturing everything for some reason  i am not sure why  but i am working on it 
should have been fixed by fffd7dd

in this issue i'm discussing only   non static   fields  this problem does not occur with static fields    i was using a final field with a pertxbox to implement an optimization in the bplustree when i stumbled upon this situation  i've already found a way to work around the problem by removing final and using different initialization code      its value can depend not only on constructor parameters  but also on any changes made to the object  just imagine a tail with a number of hairs  the cat can chew on its tail and lose hair  perhaps i should have used a dog instead   it's true that the number of hairs is not persisted  when a cat is fetched from the database  the number of hairs is reset  worse   if the transaction is restarted the number of hairs is not reset    but the cat should   always   have a tail  because of the final semantics    what if the programmer knows all this  that the field is not persistent and not transactional  but still wants to use it for other ends  i e  keeping a temporary value of an intermediate calculation   or is the use of non dml fields an invalid use case for the framework  and thus not an issue 
thanks  we are running version 2 3 0  we have now turned on more verbose opentsdb logging and i will try to get some logs next time this happens  it happens only a couple of times per day out of millions of queries  so they can be hard to track down   
i tested it too  the problem still exists 
no   i only recognized there are all threads waiting  which has to be a deadlock    it is reproducible  and it has to do something with the timing  without debugger it's much easier to reproduce   
i have no idea why it crashed so i can not provide that information since my server did not record that 
please see the following configurations   ## the following are peer1 and peer2 configurations
e g     then i replaced  camelcase  named properties with  snake_case  named  e g   requestcontext  with  request_context   and came a step further in the code   but just from reading the code  with very basic knowledge of micronaut  it seems  that the global  objectmapper  is used for parsing json into  awsproxyrequest  which then lead to errors when i change the jackson config in  application yml  
ergh  i messed up  i was talking about the tanks and energy bar  but apparently somehow they'd got resized down to being tiny and i neglected to check first      my bad  no bug  you can close this      
the shift rightclick issue only seems to be happening with the copper  iron and silver variant  gold  diamond and obsidian works for me   the items not dropping was a mistake of mine  they drop just fine  sorry 
unfortunately i'm not using allure 2 yet  once i'll have a time i'll do it 
i've compiled the project to a jar and added it as a dependency to the pom file  the error persists   pom file 
hey hey  using this one  https   github com indiecastfm react native audio streamer  it does use audio focus  which i think prioritizes things  i actually find that if the main activity is closed by memory cleanup  the react native music control keeps open  but automatically stops playing  i'm going to try monitor the logs a bit closer and see what i can come up with 
using it  can't say more as i don't know

if there are no ranks available then an info message should come up to say mann whitney requires ranks  upload ranks to use this test   or if there are no ranks don't have the option in the drop down box    rank file missing some of the genes  will a rank of zero be ignored   i would rather we don't exclude the gene but by default put it at the bottom of the rank list or in the advanced settings maybe have this as a setting to either exclude unranked genes or include 
much better  would the following code even work  seems like it would only check once   don't want to give the user the wrong idea 
can confirm  this doesn't happen in spectator mode

i added a getrotation and dumped the value immediately after setting it  and     it is actually set to the rotation that i set it at  the rotation yaw are angles gotten by sponge are from  359 999   to +359 999 and pitch angles are  90 to 90 degrees  straight down to straight up  as they should be  trying to reproduce what angle it will be is a bit tricky  but it seems that if you are standing in one place and turn left a full circle the angles will be the negatives  and if right a full circle then some  they will be positives  and what they are at all other times is a flip of the coin     but it still becomes  gottenangle + 360  mod 360  to get a 0 to 359 999 usable     i have also tried to set the position 4ticks delayed task  and get the new position again 8ticks delayed task  to see if a delay was required  but there is no change   the client still stares where it was   1 8 7 vanilla client   i'm not familar with spongevanilla  but will attempt to setup a server now  
ah yeah i use faircircadian   i wanted to write an open source version anyway  maybe it doesn't really need internet access  but it shows weather and sunrise sunset for the local position   is gb supposed to make that kind of data available directly instead of allowing network access to the watchface   still though  some watch apps really do need network access    like the public transportation app i wrote  or a weather app that uses a specific source    will you enable that eventually   what about watch apps that depend on javascript running on the phone   is that supported  or will be

 funivan run that code with and without   v   0  
still the same with build 1423  on server start the loaders are not functioning  once i log in and go to each dimension all is good even if i log out for a while  i will try with world anchors later to see if its the same right now this is with chickenchunks  any thing i can get info from for you that helps  i'm not seeing anything in any logs 
there was a log for just one day on one of the phones   just to be clear  there are logs both before and after that three day period  for example  there were logs for yesterday  only the logs for those three days are missing  the phones were not restarted during this whole period as they were on charging  also  all three phones are password and fingerprint protected 
i was using v0 17 0  when error happened 3 days ago  then i updated to v0 17 2 and very soon v 0 17 3 was released   so far   i am still having that error in v0 17 3 linage9

thanks for checking  for me  it fails 100  of the time  even after a device restart  hmm 
well  it was just an idea  if it is too complicated  like you mentioned   then let's just close the issue 
can reproduce it with seemingly any crash  yeah  like throwing a simple exception on game startup to keep the stacktrace minimal     the actual log tab of course is still pretty well filled  but the stacktrace tab contents is tiny  does the log file tab just need a max size or something

i have exactly one ad hoc task and that one is being passed on to the create method   recurrent tasks are being "added" to the scheduler using  starttasks        before i build   start the scheduler  the method  starttasks       is called multiple times  i do a set of if statements to check for profiles which indicate the tasks that should be started     could calling starttasks multiple times be an issue  also having the issue if i have a simple scheduler with an ad hoc task  so passed in the  create  method

you are right  the event is not lost  it remains in the queue ✔ unfortunately owntracks   does not   retry the transmission  as soon as the wifi receives the internet connection  wlan symbol changes from ❗ to ok   a retry is done when it changes back from wlan to cellular  this means that the exit event is delayed for the duration of the car drive 😒  thanks  michael

sorry for late response  there is some code where this problem appears     in this case i get the following suggestion  see image     nullfalsepositive  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10072693 25938652 3e7224e0 3630 11e7 8874 7cbe90a7fea0 png   i cant use this suggestion  null      because this variable is never set before   disabling this reporting is not good at all  because it reported mostly the correct problem  only in cases when the variable is never initilized before it will be wrong   i have the latest phpstorm  2017 1 3  because of eap   but it also works wrong on open released versions  2017 1 2   work on windows and have the latest plugin 
 zackm0571 below is the code snippet   remote_video_container  is for the remote participant   local_video_container  is for the local participant aka the user  for the screenshots above  i put some margin to  remote_video_container  to demonstrate the overlapping

hi  neither worked  but i follow them and found that when the f class static initializer runs  when it gets to  computerthreads no_threads   config jas_no_threads   this causes an exception and aborts the try  including the runnable that would do the f count_down_latch countdown      so you are right  it is not called when f class is initialized   note that the app does not freeze at this point  there's only a logcat output from the catch  the app will only freezes when evaluate   is called with an operation later on   the logcat shows   07 14 03 02 29 792 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err  java lang exceptionininitializererror 07 14 03 02 29 793 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org matheclipse core expression f  clinit  f java 3312          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine  init  evalengine java 192          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine  init  evalengine java 308          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine 1 initialvalue evalengine java 72  07 14 03 02 29 794 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org matheclipse core eval evalengine 1 initialvalue evalengine java 64          at java lang threadlocal setinitialvalue threadlocal java 180          at java lang threadlocal get threadlocal java 170          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine get evalengine java 82          at br eng it jsvcalc stackitem  clinit  stackitem java 24  07 14 03 02 29 795 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at br eng it jsvcalc stackitem setprefs stackitem java 219          at br eng it jsvcalc mainactivity oncreate mainactivity java 124          at android app activity performcreate activity java 6984          at android app instrumentation callactivityoncreate instrumentation java 1235  07 14 03 02 29 796 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at android app activitythread performlaunchactivity activitythread java 2783          at android app activitythread handlelaunchactivity activitythread java 2909          at android app activitythread  wrap11 unknown source 0          at android app activitythread h handlemessage activitythread java 1606          at android os handler dispatchmessage handler java 105          at android os looper loop looper java 164  07 14 03 02 29 797 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at android app activitythread main activitythread java 6592          at java lang reflect method invoke native method          at com android internal os zygote methodandargscaller run zygote java 240          at com android internal os zygoteinit main zygoteinit java 769  07 14 03 02 29 799 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err  caused by  java lang nullpointerexception  attempt to get length of null array         at org apache logging log4j util reflectionutil privatesecuritymanager getcallerclass reflectionutil java 308          at org apache logging log4j util reflectionutil getcallerclass reflectionutil java 218  07 14 03 02 29 800 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org apache logging log4j util reflectionutil getcallerclass reflectionutil java 197          at org apache logging log4j core selector classloadercontextselector getcontext classloadercontextselector java 72          at org apache logging log4j core selector classloadercontextselector getcontext classloadercontextselector java 57          at org apache logging log4j core impl log4jcontextfactory getcontext log4jcontextfactory java 140          at org apache logging log4j core impl log4jcontextfactory getcontext log4jcontextfactory java 41  07 14 03 02 29 801 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org apache logging log4j logmanager getcontext logmanager java 267          at org apache log4j logger privatemanager getcontext logger java 59          at org apache log4j logger getlogger logger java 41          at edu jas kern computerthreads  clinit  computerthreads java 30    with the older version that works  this exception does not occur

yep  i print the actual values right below the gauge like seen in the video  also  because i knew you would ask 😄  i added debugging code before setting the values that prints the values to console triggers a debugger breakpoint if they are below zero  if needed  i may record a video for that as well 
there is nothing wrong with these cards  they expose bugs in the game engine  we should fix the game engine  not remove the cards   an analogy is say if attacking with first strike causes the program to crash  do we remove all cards with the first strike ability or fix the implementation of first strike  replace "first strike" with "cycling and madness" and that is the situation here

 dmzaytsev i think a better approach is to check for an existing bower version first     this returns the available version and if present  there is no need to re install bower again  agreed that this is a pretty trivial thing and even running  npm install bower  might get it from cache instead of actually downloading  but installing a package each time you build doesn't seem like a good workflow  or maybe i'm missing something   dmzaytsev   
no  it should be sorted by the "seed" attr of teamstanding  it's almost always already sorted when you get the data but it's not really a guarantee     so you'd need to sort each list of teamstandings east and west  in standings by seed  from 1 to 15      here's the data source if you're wondering what it looks like  https   nba app ca681 firebaseio com standings 22016 json print pretty

hi  efraespada   yes i can  the project is version controlled here on github so the code is exactly the same on both machines  i'm thinking this issue may be related with some sort of setting  or something that is affecting the way the plugin finds the paths to the files    do you have any idea   on the same machine  on version  0 4 1   i couldn't use the plugin either  there was some error  when the plugin tried to run the  androidstringobfuscator jar  file  this is the log     hope this can help you track the issue

well i've changed my image loading library for that part of the project  i tried to reproduce it in a sample project and found out a similar problem  i created two activites  first one has a button to start the second one  in the second activity i've the image view with the circular reveal animation  when i start the second activity for the first time  it works fine  but when i press back and start the activity again the image view stays invisible until the animation ends  and just flashes and became visible  here is the sample code 
sorry i didn't check that at the time  i'm currently crazy for a deadline on tuesday  but i'll give that a try afterwards   good job on the library btw  makes things a lot easier  is there a way to  custom  inject subscriptions  eg by entering a code i'd activate a subscription on the device locally instead of via the market 
yeah  i copied from the notifications on the library sample and it's still not working  i'm looking at my push logs on my dashboard and i'm seeing  publishing the message failed with error  mismatchsenderid   what could that possibly mean  adding the device was successful
it is solved for me now  i was taking a picture and noticed i was using a water output hatch instead of a input one  however the machine can builds anyway so i did not notice before 
 jasontedor i know that the number is insanely great  and i doubt it can be reached in regular operation  still  the exception clearly indicates a negative value  and assuming that  scrolltimeinmillis  is always positive  i can give no better explanation than a numeric overflow   this is the stacked grafana graph of  scrolltimeinmillis  of our 12 node setup  the overflow happens at 292 years  approx at 9222842861407 ms      grafana metrics es5 scrolltimeinmillis  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1222566 24157363 77e62342 0e59 11e7 8d90 caf54b915e2c png   the metrics are polled from the first node which is still able to return the negative value  but the inter cluster communication to sync the local stats between the nodes is obviously broken by the exception thrown in  searchstats stats writeto  
thanks  that helped to solve the problem  it seems that the last step from the library was deleted  probably related to the problem that if the user hit save before the page is fully loaded  cerberus saves only the steps on the page  could somthing to prevent this be implemented 
sounds good to me  please feel free  thanks

when i try to use the previous scoreboard  i get a problem with bungeecord  at the player's respawn  he is thrown from the server  i also tested version 1 11 and found the same bug there   this  plugin  https   forums spongepowered org t easy scoreboards v2 3 12746  uses a static scoreboard  but updates its values  the problem is the same as for my code 
synchronizing on a single base object will not be enough   if we consider the approach using synchronization we need to use the static property _ self _ as lock  this property is not visible from xtend code   and i'm not speaking about the performance slowdown

this recently happens quite frequently while the android app is in the background  i do not have any folder synced to my android device  i primarily use the app to auto upload photos   i did however move another folder  one which i have never opened in the android app  which was about 20gb in size  about 20 files   i moved it in the web interface and everything worked as expected and was synced to the windows client  but android app was never used to even look into that folder   anyways since the android app does not  intiated by the user  interact with that folder this really should not be the cause for any crash  from my understanding the app should not crash while the user is not interacting with it 
hi  marcingrzejszczak   just demo code for now      would it be possible to maybe just start discarding spans if the queue is full  it would probably be preferable to lose traces rather than throwing unhandled exceptions    a sampling rate of 0 1  or even 0 01  may be fine for expected traffic  but an unexpected spike should probably not start throwing exceptions if the rest of the code can cope  as you say  a custom poller would probably solve that  i'll definitely give it a try   i've tried similar tests using http as the transport mechanism instead of kafka and haven't seen any issues

yeah  all of the land is already claimed and assigned to existing towns  when a player steps into the chunks that are already claimed   assigned it generates this error  it does not appear to do that for plots that were claimed using  town claim    in the scenarios where this is occurring it was on previously wilderness claimed plots specifically in the three instances i noticed   two being the default 'admin town' for protecting  then a town that was for a player had some manually claimed by an admin and it was doing it there as well    the only plugin i am aware of on the server that could modify max health would probably be this one  https   www spigotmc org resources worldguard extra flags 4823   i'm not 100  confident on that though  i can send you a list of plugins if that'd be helpful too

technically nothing  the benefit is having a lot of states of one project that can be examined at one time   during one  longer  execution  also  if we knew that the project is "buggy" which means that the master branch fails quite often  then we could verify the fail time and fail coverage 
and that is what happens  yet  on the device registry side  that request is still present and will be processed  delaying requests coming in after that  so all requests which arrive in the future will also time out    it does  but that is not the problem    yes   assuming you have a device registry which allows for 100 credits  but only can process 1 request a second and the timeout it one second  and the request rate is 10 requests per second   on the first second  you have 10 accepted requests and 1 response  9 timeouts  and 9 requests in the queue  as canceling requests doesn't remove them on the device registry side   on the second you have 10 accepted requests  1 response  already timed out   10 timeouts and 18 requests on the queue …
i see   this makes sense of course  i just was concerned  something referring the code was not correct  using the on off buttons of the initial typical's node screen would result in a recent change of sliders position after changing to the'manual screen'   your suggestion above concerning the state feedback sounds very interesting  if it's not to much work it would be nice 
i will try to check on this later  but to continue my app i had already changed the logic to use non null values instead of nulls   i had actually run into another strange situation between two computers where i saw integer returned in one emulator  but long from the other emulator    to ignore that  i changed my local variables to  number

i'm getting a mpdconnectionexception   counter question  why do you make the initialization fail if the connection cannot be established at startup   ideally  the app would try to connect to an mpd instance continuously  and register the listeners once a connection is established  repeat after the connection is lost    to my  biased  mind this would be a perfect fit for using akka with play2  but  currently  i'm still withstanding the reflex to re implement the app myself

hi  i use 4 7 1 i have updated my eclipse and got errors and then try to find the problem  actually i try to fix it in branch   this seems to be a new change  it first comes to with java9 beta plugins but with 4 7 1 update last week it was official released in jdt   maybe it can fix fast by yout because you  know the code   
thank you very much for your fast comment   well  what type of client will be the right one to get both the header information and the bytes  the low level one or the declarative one according to the docs   can you perhaps pass a short example   something like this        client " documents"       public interface documentclient            get "  id "        single httpresponse byte     getdocument long id

no  nothing else the uxguide your read as well and the monitor i'm looking at       there's a table about fonts which states the color of the main instruction for the normal theme   but don't know how where to get it if users had changed it on their system   also  there seems to be a bug in swing's lookup of default font  http   stackoverflow com questions 11309861 bug or feature swing default gui font incorrect for win6   as a side effect  the typeface of the main instruction is wrong  should be segoeui  not tahoma 
the documentation itself is tied to the version the respective site has deployed  so on opencaching de okapi you can see  ver  1133  54ad2cf   in the upper left and the cache field list names the short_description  on opencaching org uk okapi you see  rev  515  and no mentioning of the short_description field  so in essence you have to check all sites you want to call wrt their apisupport level  in our code we currently have only two levels  current and oldapi  as luckily most of the sites nowadays update regularly with only oc uk staying behind

it took me awfully long  but i can finally reproduce the issue   if 2 threads share the same redisson instance  and both are using the same lock  it's possible for the following situation to happen  1    thread a   got the lock  and is within the  redissonlock  release  method  it has successfully released the  redissonlockentry  and removed it from the  entries  map  and is sitting on line 132 to unsubcribe the channel from the collection  and potentially release the connection  2    thread b   gets into  redissonlock  subscribe   finding no matching entry in  entries  creates a new one  and calls  connectionmanager subscribe listener  getchannelname      3    thread b    within the connection manager finds a valid pubsubconnection for the channel at  masterslaveconnectionmanager  subscribe   line 466  and will therefore use that connection 4    thread a   resumes  and calls  masterslaveconnectionmanager  unsubscribe   which removes the connection from  name2pubsubconnection   unsubscribes from the channel and remove all listeners for that channel  this effectively makes thread b wait forever on a notification that just will never arrive   this can be easily forced with well placed breakpoints   notice redisson 1 1 6 alleviates the problem by reducing the usage of pubsub connections by using optimistic locking  but is not free of this problem   i haven't cheked  but this very same problem may also affect other parts of redisson that depends on pubsub  such as  redissontopic  
looks like it works properly in 31 
i am playing on 1 10 2 and the latest version is from june 6th  2k17 and it's the 2 1 24  and it seems like you can select 2 filters after some restarts and then this bug appears again 
yes  we definitely plan to continue the tradition of nightly builds for gatk4    we can set them up after beta 
i will pay attention to that next time it breaks  as far as i remember i can only say not all writers on the same network break down at the same time  at least not always  that much i know 
the compiled  apk comes to 1679 kb   also to add  the garbage collection seems to happen after the startservice   call has been made  i've tried moving around when the service is started  for testing  and found the garbage collection always occurs just after the service is started

 breautek i can't remember exactly  it always worked before last android studio update or new setup  but know i see in the android studio path the gradle folder  i could set the enviroment variable to this path instead of downloading gradle separatly  but currently it works with my workaround from my prev  post  but the path to  c  program files android android studio gradle gradle 5 1 1 bin  should also work  it's weird  i never had to set the path before  something has changed  how detect cordova the gradle  is the gradle cli required or does it look up the android studio path   installing the android studio without any hacks will not work anymore  the error message of cordova should be changed  it's very trivial if you know what's the problem is and how to fix it  i was just annoyed to get one error after another    be free to close it 
i'm attaching a screen capture under rstudio 1 2 1511  but i tried in other computers with the same os and rstudio version and did not experience the problem  moreover  if i open a new rstudio window  the second window doesn't suffer from this problem either  for more context  this happens inside a project  with many tabs open in the editor  but these conditions alone don't seem to cause the issue either     selects_another_pane  https   user images githubusercontent com 11860098 57755901 b578b880 76fa 11e9 891a 247dfecab161 gif 
thanks for triaging  yeah it seems to be a hassle because local files aren't treated as proper modules without appending    js     vs code's monaco seems to be doing the job pretty well at detecting local modules  orion seems to suffer from that syntax 
this project has 2 flavours and a library dependency  builds nicely until i changed to put the generated drawables in the build directory     looking at this  i would think that the 'generatereleaseresources' and its respective targets and flavours would be a good spot to hook into   leaves it later in the build   its possible the clean is being done after the dependant library thats built first 
this isn't a design change  it's possible to encounter issues due to resources not being delisted   https   github com openliberty open liberty blob c3e13171e6b4042c2c43caaca7d4e0334771e8e2 dev com ibm ws jdbc_fat_v43 test applications app43 src jdbc fat v43 web jdbc43testservlet java#l2088  in that example  the same connection is used over the transaction boundary  to fix this correctly from the jca side  we need to receive the tmsuspend tmresume flags so we can properly switch to a new physical connection

the stacktrace is self explanatory  one can see from the flow of the source code that no converter is being employed  here's the markup                b datepicker id "sd" value "# testbean starttime "                           format "dd mm yyyy"                           ajax "true" update " f config"                 f converter converterid "calendarconverter"                 b datepicker     and the converter class      facesconverter value   "calendarconverter"  public class calendarconverter implements converter      private static final logger logger   logger getlogger calendarconverter class getname       private final simpledateformat date_format   new simpledateformat "dd mm yyyy"         and so on    the converter is created but neither of its methods is being called     zhedar  what do you mean by "we didn't implement this use case"  the whole story about converters is that you actually don't need to worry about different use cases  just tell me what your component expects and it's gonna be my responsibility to use proper converter

i think  generating uuid each time when an instance of multipartcontent is created is a very little overhead  having any static string value publicly available will significantly increase the likelihood of being included into someone content    at least it's possible   with a random value it's very unlikely to repeat that value

 asolntsev remote variable was one of the ways or maybe the only  for real browser maximization  i've described part of this in https   github com selenide selenide issues 838  so  instead of enlarging the window size to screen size we've used remote to manage this  cause remote really maximized the window   as now i'm not able to run test cases against jenkins  i've removed remote initialization and use getwebdriver   manage   window   maximize    directly   as for using remote in  aftersuite   it was used to store values into environment properties file for allure  so they a kinda two separate things

hi  paoloantinori    i'm afraid your solution will work only for problem 2  where the pod starts but complains about being unauthorized   for problem 1  it won't work  because the deployment is in progress   it is waiting for the pods to be running   and that won't happen because the pod can't find the secret      without scaling to 0   the deployment will timeout after 10 minutes and the deployment will be marked as failed and openshift will automatically roll out older deployment  so it will roll out the original version of the pod    with scaling to 0 first  it times out again  but because of the scaling  openshift will not roll out the original version automatically  however if you scale it up to 1 again  it will roll out the original version and will ignore the failed deployment    and it will be probably necessary to test this with rollback as well  as currently i always end with server and meta pods in version 2 where all other pods are from version 1  i'm using exit 1 as last step in upgrade_50_replace_template 
hmm  looks like it's been tweaked in 1 8 2  i'm going to retest it   ok  haven't tested yet  but i have a theory  does the code take the  current  speed of the horse and multiply it then set the  base  speed  because i had a mod giving nearby entities slowness 3  so if it took the current speed modified by slowness  and then set the  base  speed to a certain percentage over  that  it might effectively reduce the speed stat  since the decrease from the slowness effect would be more than the increase from the carrot  i'll have to test as soon as i can get minecraft finally booted up   yes    that does seem to be the problem  when the horse is under slowness it decreases the speed  when not  it increases the speed  btw  the reduced speed increase in v1 10 2 1 8 2 makes it require a lot more carrots  especially since i started at a low speed stat after it decreased it initially  i think i used 2 stacks just getting it up to 2 7x  from like 0 5x or something  i can't remember  edit  then again the lower the value the lower the increase and vice versa for higher values  since it's a percentage based increase  you could maybe just make it add a flat 0 1x increase to the speed stat by i think just adding 0 01 to the base speed   apparently  it also works in reverse with speed splash potions  greatly boosting the speed increase granted by the carrots  of course i think i was using speed 2   so until it's fixed the work around would just be to make sure the horse isn't under potion effects that effect speed when using the carrots

 tinwelint thanks for the response   i will provide the details you asked for as soon as i get in the office   a few things though  the bug you're referring to is a later version of this one that i also reported   i figured they were the same issue  and as far as i can remember   dmontag experienced the same behavior described in this report   cache type none just made the truncated result set consistent instead of fixed after second run   also  i gave neotechnology access to the server with this data on it  along with some reproduction queries steps   so you're more than welcome to jump on the box and play around with it   lastly  i don't know what your schedule looks like  but we're supposed to have a conference call at 10 30am est today  june 18  2013  regarding this bug  so if you're interested and able to it might be good to jump on it  mike linetsky organized engineer chris    either way  i'll collect and post the data you requested   thanks again 
i guess its the same with 1207  but i'll try your debug build
sure  with any profile switch  which information should could i provide 
promregator discovery hostname is not set in my instance  i will try and test it soon   when the prometheus server scrapes the  discovery endpoint  curl job  the json is returned with the prometheus servers hostname in the targets array  when i test it with my laptop the returned json has my laptops hostname in the targets array 
i left the instance running and came back to reconnect the next day  and this happens  i don't see it today but will try to see if it happens again 
will do  closing for now until i have the time to try this out 
 overheadhunter not 100 percent sure how you mean that  but i've tried the following    clients used  cyberduck and carotdav   server used  webdav server of box com online storage   transfered the mentioned files to box com via each of the above clients    the end result is the same as with cryptomator    only difference is that cyberduck doesn't even ask if the file should be overwritten  carotdav does   one unrelated curious thing i've just experienced is that cryptomator opened one of my vaults twice at the same time  i  e  it has been displayed as 2 separate drives in windows explorer  until locking   after unmounting locking the vault in cryptomator  there's still one instance left that i can still use  i'll leave it there until i shut down the computer tonight  so if this is of any interest to you  let me know   edit  dang   too late  somehow managed to accidentally quit the cryptomator client  now the second instance is also gone  sorry

on app option "analyze log" don´t show any error log  it only show info logs when the app crashes  a popup show that an error occurs  but don´t propose nothing to send a mail  it only say that i sent you if i consider necesary  can you tell me where is  if it exist  the main log on mobile   thanks 
it is hard to reproduce  and although i run this plugin frequently  i couldn't reproduce reliably enough 
our base url is set to https   stash domain com 8443 and i log in on https   stash domain com 8443   there is another listener on port 8080 that atlassian asked us to setup during testing for some issues that we experienced in the past  but that is not generally used     if i log in on 8443  then go to 8080  i'm required to login again

well unfortunately the above code did solve the problem only for a while   i made a libgdx project repository for testing which shows the errors   https   bitbucket org tomgrill itest  each time you touch the screen it toggles between load show interstitial  so always wait for "interstitial received" message in log before showing   you can switch between crashmodes      edit  iosinterstitial java to reproduce the errors   there are 3 modes you can use  explanation   0  will crash the app immediately when you touch the screen the first time to load an interstitial  crash error  terminated due to signal 6  1  will crash the app the 2nd time you load an interstitial  crash error  terminated due to signal 11  2  loading and showing new interstitials works     somehow  works for quite a while but then randomly crashes after  8 minutes   may take even longer  repeat  load and show 3 5 interstitials  dismiss the last interstitial and leave the phone without touching for like  8 minutes  crash error  terminated due to signal 11  tell me if you still need the symbolicated crash logs  i hope i manage to get them  seems kinda difficult to do that

i can't reproduce it either  it's happened exactly once and it was following a change  i was switching branches last night  probably from issue_14 145  to develop   figured it was better to document it   i can't recall any more steps to reproduce than in the original post

looks like log float  is natural logarithm up to and including sql server 2008  from 2008r2 it is 10 base logarithm  the docs say that if base is omitted  it defaults to 10 base     edit  it might be a typo in the docs  because i tried select log 10  on both sql server 2008 and 2012  and they both returned 2 3025     if that is the case log float  is natural logarithm on at least 2005 through 2014

hi  yinfeiru    1  i agree that this is not a memory leakage because i can garbage collect the memory  2 3  however  my concern is more about the constant increase of allocated memory until we reach the heap size and the device automcall the gc  during my test  i just initialize mixpanel with the  mixpanelapi getinstance my_context  mixpanel_token    call  i don't send push notification  track events or whatever else   if i use the exact same application and login with the exact same account  while the app is in the foreground      android 4 devices   memory allocation is constant   android 5 devices   memory continuously increase   i can do some test for you as needed  but it seems that we can focus our investigation on android 5+   just let me know if you need more information    thanks

sorry i am reading my description and is too vague  let me add this is by doing a query for my user  and not for the individual package  if npm stats is retrieving all repos for a user there is an assumption that all those have statistics  but for new packages  even after a few days  this assumption is not true as there are no statistics  and one package makes the entire query fail  so in the case of an errored package  it might be good to make it more exception safe

tested on 7 99 15 and confirmed not present  as for the build  it's the one linked in discords #testing channel released yesterday  and was also present in my port which is running from the latest commits  i'm unsure when the bug showed up 
i think i figured out the issue  last night i moved the analyzer with the book still in its slot  breaking the analyzer with the book in place doesn't drop the book  apparently the book contains the research  as opposed to thaumcraft where research is stored in player data   effectively resetting the discovered seed mutations  when i did this i went into creative mode to get a new book  perhaps that is the issue    the "missing info" i think  is then just the info being reset  it's likely i didn't get any new mutations after that happened  i thought it might be related to mod conflicts from mods i added to my installation this morning    when i just checked on mutations i ended up breaking the analyzer again and the same thing happened  i cheated in another book  by that time i had successfully mutated sugar cane seeds and they appeared    in short  mutations don't disappear from books  breaking the analyzer loses book and resets research

indeed  its in step 2  i've no problem with the code itself  as it works fine if i simply "run" the app   it displays the white screen if i "debug" it   when i'm "running" the app  the "flutter hot reload" button is greyed out"   i'd read that maybe it needs to be running in debug    i've also moved on through the exercise with no issues  other than not being able to debug or hot reload  
here it is 
i can't give a timeframe  but this will be a pretty high priority bug so we hope to tackle it asap and get it into the daily builds + a preview release of rstudio in due course

hi notcarl  thanks for your reply  sorry for not being clear   i did not intend to use any sort of idle mode  and setting  idletimeout  on the channel builder does not appear to affect the issue i'm describing   indeed  from looking at the source code it seems that this is because a newly created channel queues up outgoing requests while some initial name resolution work occurs  the name resolution work happens on the same  scheduledexecutor  as the idle timer  which we cannot replace with a direct executor   and when the name resolution is done the queued requests are dispatched  i e  though we try to use a direct executor  the channel still uses a non direct executor for important work    i don't believe the problem is related to the idle timer  it just happens to use the same executor as the idle timer  which seems to be the mistake as far as i can see    here is a minimal example     the reason that  onnext  is called on a different thread is due to the details i provided in the original comment  and it's fixed by the pull request i created   edit  updated to use non streaming rpc in example  since it turns out it does not matter

there obviously should always be a way to resize the window  at the moment i fixed it in my code by adding setshowresizecorner true  in a componentlistener under the componentmoved   method  putting it in componentresized   does not work  maximize now does not have the corner and unmaximizing again regains the resize corner  which is the correct result   i think keeping the corner is the solution that i think looks the best   making window sides and corners resizable would  i think  need an aditional border of some sort and i don't think that would look as good   the best solution is to provide options for all  optionally make window sides and corners resizable and  the already implemented  ability to show or hide the resize corner   it is however up to you   as a side note  you are doing great work  weblaf looks superb and it has been a blast to use it

it happens intermittently  but when it does happen that's pretty much how it is  repeated presses of the back button navigate the page in the background back  but the overlay stays on top  only a restart of the app appears to fix it   the issue started after the mathjax update so it may be that  also this morning my phone updated to android 7 1 1 so that may be related  but i don't remember if i encountered the issue yesterday

it takes the same time regardless if i let it sit to do the caching  about 6 9 seconds on average with the new version and 18 20 with the old one for me    select photos from the drawer  then open the drawer and go back to "all files"  the "photos" section will stay selected even if its no longer active    the app will crash if you select "photos" from the drawer again     all files photos all files photos crash    are those exact the same images  are they generated faster when you browse within the app to the folder containing these images   i found out they will eventually load one by one very slowly  yes  thumbnails are generated faster from the "files" section than from the gallery  also the non qa version is faster at loading the thumbs in the gallery  as mentioned earlier    another important issue i discovered was that some photos will refuse to fully load and instead are displayed by its thumbnail resolution  see below  only way to be able to load images from gallery properly is to go to "files" section  find in which folder the picture is and let the app load the thumbnails  once thumbnails are visible for that folder  it signalizes that the gallery will load the picture  in other words  user must visit the "files" section before heading to the gallery for it to load images properly     pic  https   user images githubusercontent com 36133540 61531074 18057200 aa26 11e9 9ccf 59a586b4b1d0 jpg          another highly important issue is that the folders will display images that are in fact not in those folders  talking about files section now  not photos   go to one of the folders where the pictures are and let it load  then  manually update that file by swiping your finger down  the "no files bug" will emerge for a second and  then random pictures that do not belong in the folder will appear in that folder   this problem is not present in the non qa version of the app  
you have to enable autocomplete in the main template  then start typing and select one of the autocomplete items  now it should focus that location on the map  but you get the exception

we receive our data from a third party that supplies versions  starting with 0   for one of our indexes  we only care about the most recent version of a given resource  but need to be able to support reloading old data  mapping changes  etc    in order to ensure we're only keeping the latest  regardless of order received  we've gone with indexing using  external_gte    our process simply ignores the versionconflictexception that gets returned when attempting to add an older version   it has worked rather well for us   periodically  we'll need to delete data  for a variety of reasons   these are one off deletes  usually related to expiring license agreements and such  and are separate from any versioning scheme   historically we've just manually done a delete by query to handle these cases  which has served us well until recently

it was on windows  i tried it on two different pcs   maven was 3 6 3   jdk 13 0 2 on one pc and jdk 8 on the other pc   i started it directly from the command line with „mvn package“ without an ide   when build with intellij the error did not occur   the issue is reproducible with different java versions on different pcs  it occurs again when the build is rerun 
even with no custom authenticationmanager  still seeing the same behavior of a nulleventpublisher and no events being published through   a minimal spring boot starter web + spring boot starter actuator + spring boot starter security example with no custom globalauthenticationconfigureradapter at all shows the issue off as you don't see badcredentials audit events when logging in with known bad credentials  as soon as you stick a custom auth in and auth authenticationeventpublisher you get the appropriate events being published

it does if i use  usenativegit false  usenativegit  if i use it to "true" there's an inconsistency because it report the state dirty but the resulting name is not reporting it  no  dirty is appended to the tag name   please consider this was tested in a just cloned folder so it's really annoying due to fact that it prevents to use any automation   during the build the target folder and a git properties file are created but both are in the  ignore list 
i guess this depends on its visibility for 107 compliance verification purposes    my assumption was that it won't be picked up by those tests  but i could be wrong

ahhh there ya go  i was wondering if those extra keys were causing the problem  but wasn't sure how they got added in   this is from the send method
ok    i also got the exception today  fatal error 1   it happened by closing an unfinished merge request with the closing "x"  the assignee was filled with an incorrect name  this way seems to behave not like the close button  unfortunately i can't reproduce it several time in succession  another time  by closing with "x"  i got an an intellij notification  "cannot add new remote  new remote origin cannot be added to this project "  this is also not the expectation on an merge abort  hope it helps to stabilize the closing action 
it may  but still depends on setup  i need to rewrite this bug description when i have some time   the basic issue is that the application being developed should  only  be run in the main workspace container  the only mode of debugging supported by che in any sustainable way is remote debugging in the main container  in my eyes  all "launch" configs should be hidden in theia unless absolutely necessary  since end users should not have to worry about what's running in sidecars

because the choice of default widget depends on whether the state description is editable or not  it looks like now the state description seems to answer "not editable" while it should return "editable"  https   github com openhab openhab core blob master bundles org openhab core ui src main java org eclipse smarthome ui internal items itemuiregistryimpl java#l244 https   github com openhab openhab core blob master bundles org openhab core ui src main java org eclipse smarthome ui internal items itemuiregistryimpl java#l781 and it looks like the only very recent pr that was in relation to "editable"

confirmed firefox 70 0 1   after further investigation  i've observed that prior to upgrading linux webdriver to v13  a process called _geckodriver_ opens on a random high order port when you use the launch browser button  and zap makes the connection to it  then the browser starts   however after upgrading linux webdriver to 13  geckodriver does not start and does not start a random listening tcp port   then zap times out trying to connect to the non existent port and the logs show a connection timeout   zap log below showing timeout 
i can confirm that this is fixed now

1  as i said  it started happening immediately after getting lp 2  read the second part of the stacktrace  it's a permissions error 
i do not see anything which could make a difference   it is hard to tell anything from the above information  the best would be to try to reproduce it  though i don't have much time to take care of it  i will talk about it within a team to see if it is possible to take it into a sprint 
i asked  but no one is sure who was messing with it at the time or what was being used  sorry

problems with reappearing warps should be fixed in the latest dev build  see #43   if you are using offline mode  i do not think that updating your sqlite driver will change anything  it is more likely that bungecord somehow messed up a players unique id causing the error on insert  did the problem occur again within the last days

i simply had the source code in an eclipse ide which had all three jdks configured  pde will do the validation for you   to be honest  this was the only workspace i had configured with all three jdks up until now   tycho could so some validation as well when multiple jdks are configured  1   but i never tried it out  so i am not sure how good and easy that works    1  https   eclipse org tycho sitedocs tycho compiler plugin compile mojo html#usejdk
correct  these are simple queries without group by   the query looks something like this

i am using version 1 0 3  the issue is with the "logger" definition   when i create the logger as below  the application runs without issue  logger "com abc def"  info   "file"   root warn   "file"  "cloud watch"    but as soon as i use the "cloud watch" appender in the logger definition  the application fails to start  logger "com abc def"  info   "file"  "cloud watch"   root warn   "file"  "cloud watch"  
 spinscale  1    i don't know if it's happens on a non scripted field   i don't have any fields that are always the same ratio of another field for comparison  2   https   gist github com yehosef f96dc491bcd5ee9bf7d3 is the query i also included the index template   perhaps it's related to doc_values     3  i'm not sure if i can share the data right now   if you contact me at my name at gmail  i can probably give you temp access to the marvel kibana install  because store is off for everything  you can't see the values but it might help in the debug   if that doesn't help we can look at giving access to the data   to give some background   this is a testing server to test load capabilities for a server   we have storing all fields to "off" and are using doc_values   it's a single 16g machine with 8g heap   220m rows   60g storage 
 rbygrave thanks for the workaround  but a workaround isn't a fix  i would expect a stateless update to work with  cascadetype all   this bug is the reason why we are stuck with an older version of ebeans  the newer versions are unusable for production due to this issue   note that a fix for this and another issue was proposed in https   github com ebean orm ebean pull 1403  but was rejected due to refactoring work  the provided unit test shows that a proper solution never made it to  master  
i have tested several versions down to 1 6 2  as i said it is also the same on another machine running windows and most probably different version of java  i really want to use the map and not items   i actually posted the full source  only missing the "system out println data  "
thank you for your reply  we are using scala 2 13 with   play ahc ws standalone   of version 2 0 8 please let me know if you need any further information
