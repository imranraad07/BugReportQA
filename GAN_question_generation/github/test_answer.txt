I'm using `java 1.8.0_112`. Yes, indeed as it's not static class, the first parameter in the constructor became the instance of the parent class.
@Unpublished thanks for finding steps how to reproduce it. ~~You added "pr exists". Is this fixed within #3459?~~  ~As this is a rather annoying bug, I would like to release a 3.6.2 soon, containing this fix.~~ ~~Can you point me to the fix?~~  EDIT: read it wrong. Fix is in #4044 
i think I see the issue. I used your Tomcat example that happens to have a   "username" : "monitor",  "password" : "monitor!",  This adds an environment in the JMXConnectionParams and this causes a unique value for hashcode each time.  I don't even use the username/password so removing it from the json fixes my issue. But I did confirm that if you leave it in, your remote server will get an extra thread created every time JMXTrans polls it due to borrowObject not matching the existing entry.

Yes. As long as the working directory is set correctly in the local debug configuration it loads the include file and I can continue debugging.

Yes confirmed can run if i exclude xerces.  So far still runs fine but i don't know if i will use that xerces or not.  Can you please enlighten me what the usage of xerces? and why it conflict with liquigraph?  Can this issue solved without  i need to exclude the xerces?  Thank you
@thboileau Yes I can see the payload now in the browser (but just after applying a fix), here:   http://www.pastekit.com/lWAg6

I'm running 0.5.1, I'll see if I can check an earlier version. I'm playing on Win7 with Java 7. The issue is ubiquitous. I have it just starting a new world and it doesn't ever get better, no matter what I do or don't do (well, besides the even lower FPS spikes when the world loads/generates of course). Just to mention it, there is at least one other player on the server with this issue, but also most people are fine (or at least not as bad as we are).

I'm running 1.4.0.2 and yes I have persistent playback control enabled. I'm on my phone so not sure but shouldn't the playback services be started using startForeground() to make it less of a target for killing?  
Hello Alexey, thank you very much for looking into this so fast. Unfortunately, the change didn't seem to fix the issue.   I was able to reproduce it in isolation: https://gist.github.com/belowm/379718a5d772fcbb5c32ab9f34ffd2d8  When running this in a JVM , it correctly outputs `[0, 1, 2]`, whereas the emitted JavaScript produces `[2, 0, 1]`. 
@anurags1106 Looks like the update is not available on the website. When I do check for update (using beta2/updates) it says that there are no update available. Once I can get the latest updates, I'll go ahead and test this 
Yes, no problem. I'll work on a fix shortly.

Just updated the latest build and it does appear to be working. Sorry, should have checked that first.  
@orimarco . But Yossi asked me not to assign these issues. 
Yes, it's Storage Emphasis with: * Mining Filter Upgrade * Quick Deposit Upgrade * Void Filter Upgrade installed.
Hello Costin: thanks for the quick response! Ok, so the exception I'm seeing is below, I pared down everything to keep things simple for debug purposes, but, basically I'm creating an EsTap to an index/type together with an array of fields of interest, then simply outputting all data from the tap to stdout, no queries to complicate matters, no "es.query" config param either since this also doesn't seem to be working any longer.

Copy, working on it now.  Will be back in a few, using the released versions i assume.
Thanks for submitting the STU comment, @brynrhodes. I think the definition you recommend is the proper one (purely evaluable at compile-time). I also agree with @cmoesel in that it makes sense to _not_ allow `Today()` and `Now()` in parameters, since a DRY-enough pattern can be written using regular CQL expressions when `Today()` and `Now()` are necessary. For authors who might discover this thread later, an example is probably something like,  ``` ...  // This parameter can be overridden by the User parameter MyYearInterval Interval<DateTime> default null  context Patient  // This expression provides the 'default', and can be used throughout the library define DefaultYearInterval:     Interval[DateTime((year from Today()) - 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0), DateTime((year from Today()), 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)]  define MyOtherExpression:     if MyYearInterval is not null then MyYearInterval else DefaultYearInterval ...   ... ```
No anr, no crash. I'm fully unable to unlock screen so maybe something pops up after a while however that is just thinking out loud without any proof.  I'm not able to compile kiss. I'm user/tester so i gathered no knowledge to set up android studio plus my os is freebsd so i believe there would be extra troubles.  I will try to put catlog into some use, maybe i could get some info from the device. Maybe i can also use adb in this case to retrieve some logs. 
Damn, they did it wrong too. See vanilla for plural convention. 
[2020-01-01-1.log](https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedDynamics/files/4015910/2020-01-01-1.log)  I could'nt paste the whole file on pastebin, that's why, is it working like that ?
> @geomonlin `max.connections.size.per.query` decides synchronized execute unit groups. What's your major question? different `max.connections.size.per.query` size ,the number of rows printed  is same  but  number of rows printed is different.  
It works on single node cluster for me and it recreates it consistently. I tried on 2 and 3 nodes cluster but it does not recreate it. Please use single node only. 
This problem were in 1.5.0, just updated to 1.8.0 and there are no problems with scrolling Thank you for this amazing library! Sincerely 
I'm unsure how to upload the font as the file type isn't supported here, however I took pictures demonstrating the problem. The first is the order of the keybinds and the characters they're associated to, the second how the same order appears in the alphabetical order section (for some reason that includes overlapping letters), and the third an example of mismatched letters that I've found. Some characters are even connected to keys that aren't supposed to be used at all.  ![example notepad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36904084/36820897-a72d34fc-1cc6-11e8-81a5-3c22357fd386.png) ![example polyglot 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36904084/36820898-a7487d2a-1cc6-11e8-928d-989c6554edcc.png) ![example polyglot 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36904084/36820899-a782e802-1cc6-11e8-995e-4c9438343182.png) 
Yes, the enchant effect works (I probably should have removed that for this issue, I just had it on my test skript) 
FingerprintManager#onAuthenticationHelp called with helpMsgId=1021. This is not error, but some information. Therefore, I expect that SDK will deliver to app level the information from the system. What shouldn't be is that such information will be mapped to error. 
I can't see the visual representation of how full the tank is. WAILA / functionality works fine.
I woke up to see both of these responses today. :D   I'm glad you got it sorted out, can't wait for a release.  Thanks!  That is weird with the Mekanism cables though, but yes, I did update that as well about the same time.  But like I said, all of the other machines (TE4, Mek, IC2) on the line were still getting power so I figured the problem wasn't in the cables.  I was using Mekanism 7.1.0.87 when everything was working before...perhaps he also changed something slightly that made the rounding error you just fixed more noticeable? 
The bug is fixed on the master branch, and there are instructions on the readme on how to use it.  I'll cut a release as soon as possible. 
Bonemealing yes I have. Wasted 4 stacks, and waited 3 RL days, nothing won't grow. Even with clear skys and clear space for 20x20x20 around them. ;/ Biome is Plains it says, but It is a custom Othala biome so donno. It will grow in my Dakara Res even though it too says it is plains. Grrr. Still cannot get leaves there though. 
I updated it anyway. I know some of these may be duplicates but it's a chore to try and search each one when Minecraft and chrome are lagging your computer as it is 😆 
Shit installing dev version delete weight history?
But so far I never removed the `pool.queues` ...  Anyway I retried, ... 3.0.25... dcache stopped... moved back the old `setup` file as generated by 2.16. `pool.queues` in place... started pool... and the same crashing loop as reported before.
@tlrx I had seen it but it seems to be implemented by `JSonXContentParser`, which returns `new BytesRef(CharBuffer.wrap(parser.getTextCharacters(), parser.getTextOffset(), parser.getTextLength()));` (which does a utf8 conversion) and none of the subclasses override it. 
Yes it could be fine. See for example _jakarta.json-api_ or _jakarta.persistence-api_ .
Authme.log has been uploaded [authme.log.txt](https://github.com/Xephi/AuthMeReloaded/files/751737/authme.log.txt)  
@domdomegg I am also not able to reproduce this error. 
It doesn't crash the app. Don't have much time right now but I quickly added a toast message #99 that displays when something goes wrong, if you wanted to include that for this release
Hello @xfeep ! I see, that problem in https://github.com/nginx-clojure/nginx-clojure/blob/master/src/c/ngx_http_clojure_mem.c#L3090  When ngx_http_next_header_filter return NGX_AGAIN, no more try to call header/body filters will make.   
Only other mod I have at this time that may cause an issue is ExtraUtilities2. I agree with your diagnosis on Psymatics' thread:  > Seems to be some sort of race condition where Minecraft starts to empty the tank before it finished filling it. Not sure there is anything we can do as there is no place in the code to catch this crash, the stack is never null on the line its crashing.   As far as I'm aware all my mods are up to date. I'm just going with a different setup using multiple Smeltery Drains each with its own output table. This seems to solve the issue as they're drawing directly from the Smeltery and not an external reservoir. 
I've searched for `StackOverflowError` and there [was this](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/158) and a [this on on bugs.eclipse.org](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=491929) - notably this looks the same as https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=414767.  @cdietrich @kthoms thanks for engaging SO fast!  > Which Xtext version?  originally 2.13.0 but [just tested bumping to 2.14.0](https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/72550/) but still there.  > Another option would be a small description how to set up the situation for ourselves.  I don't have a simple standalone reproducer. Creating that requires me finding the cause... ;-)  But if you don't mind downloading half the universe then it should actually be very easy for you to reproduce if you d the following (I hope I'm not forgetting any steps, but try and shout if NOK):  It will need to grab loads of stuff from https://nexus.opendaylight.org, so [as documented here](http://docs.opendaylight.org/en/latest/developer-guide/developing-apps-on-the-opendaylight-controller.html), do:      cp -n ~/.m2/settings.xml{,.orig} ; wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendaylight/odlparent/master/settings.xml > ~/.m2/settings.xml  And now doing this should hit it:      git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/netvirt     cd netvirt/aclservice/impl     git checkout cbe43c366abf098554a230c975e7750ed1ffa707     mvn -Pq clean package  The `git checkout` is to get the rev where this happened, before [we worked around it here](https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/72573/).  > give us some insights on the state when hitting the StackOverflowError? You could add remote debugging options, set an exception breakpoint for StackOverflowError and attach to the debugged VM then.  OK I'll try that and report back if I find anything... but don't let that stop you from trying to repro is as above! ;)  BTW: I suspect that his is caused by some recent code change on our side which added a new library or introduced a new generics thing (but it's nearly impossible to pinpoint; this is in a huge community with lots of spinning parts changing all the time). What could help as well to at least pinpoint what is causing this, if not solving it, would be to catch the `StackOverflowError` and provide context on which type it happened?
@tsmaeder It is exactly how you described it actually, let me paint you the picture,  ## Example Task Access and list any remote machine file structure in a tree view through an ssh connection,  ### How this is achieved in che-6  + add remote-server-plugin   - create a REST API (written in java)   ``` POST /connection DELETE /connection GET /connection GET /connection/{id}/files UPDATE /connection ```   - bind it to wsagent-server with guice library   `service is available under URL ${che-host}:${port}/api/connection `  + remote-ide-plugin   - get wsagent endpoint and sent a request with related dto    - extend the gwt ide accordingly (tree widget, view, editor, etc)   - parse retrieved response in order to display  + make it part of the [assembly ](https://github.com/eclipse/che/tree/master/assembly)during the maven build  What I want is basically to reuse the rest api I've written.  I see that theia offers a framework for front-end with [TreeDataProvider ](https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia-samples/blob/master/samples/tree-view-sample-plugin/src/ftp-explorer.ts)to the parse the data, but with new structure I am confused for back-end. How to expose this service for theia, how to bind it? How theia-ui will listen to that service, how do I make the request?  Thanks for the help! 
It does. 
Thank you for your quick response. Yes I understand, Plex is optional, but it is good option 😄  Every time happening for me. Just play a video from your SD car (external storage). When it is playing try to push back button. Not working for me. After 2-3 seconds try to push again (just 1 time), not working again. 3rd time, push to back button. Carstream will crash.

LGTM. I see the missing handling of `detach(close=false)` is part of a different ticket now (#467).
Hi, @bf8086 I tried that too but no luck. Other metrics like Alluxio Remote Host and UFS read is being updated but not the Short-Circuit Read and Alluxio Local cache Hit.
Let me ask the admin of the server - my client didn't crash, it just booted me off the server. I'm playing SMP, sorry for not mentioning that sooner.   I can confirm that the crash does *not* occur in single player when using a *blank, cheated in* biome crystal. Trying to get a non-cheated one is proving a little challenging, so a single-player crash log might take a little longer...
Thanks @davidehringer that's exactly my problem.  Sorry for the late answer @scottfrederick, but I'm not truly working on that currently. 
Well, what do you know! That's what it was. I changed the banner one of the bannermen was wearing to a new one I summoned via command block, namely this:  ``` /give @p minecraft:banner 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Base:1,Patterns:[{Pattern:flo,Color:0},{Pattern:mr,Color:0},{Pattern:mc,Color:1},{Pattern:sc,Color:0},{Pattern:bs,Color:1},{Pattern:ts,Color:1},{Pattern:flo,Color:0},{Pattern:tts,Color:0},{Pattern:gra,Color:0}]}} ```  I dunno why it shouldn't work, but I guess I'll stick to more vanilla banners for now. 
Yeah we're upgrading to 1.6 to see this solves the problem. Our upgrade cycle is slow.. I'll let you know.
Yes, sorry Mark, I use IE11 with IE10 emulation. (see the image attached) In this mode when I click on a function for example "Components" the page page is not rendered.  ![error](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13817916/22583657/4bc98734-e9ee-11e6-8af4-4507a6406c74.png)
Appreciate you taking a look Electroblob77. I'll close this issue. 
Thanks for the quick response. Unfortunately I can't share the file because it holds sensitive information, and therefore I can't use the online validator either. I downloaded the 64bits for Windows - We run Windows 7 Entreprise. I will see if I can dig further and maybe reproduce.  
I've tested a random sampling of machine blocks from the following mods for 1.5.2: Forestry, Railcraft, IC2, Mystcraft, Thermal Expansion, Extra Utilities, DartCraft, Ender Storage, Factorization and Mine Factory Reloaded.  The only machine blocks I can get to do this are from Thermal Expansion. Every other block from another mod that I placed rendered just fine, but the Thermal Expansion machines won't show textures. I've checked to make sure it isn't an anomaly just with the Colorblind Textures option for Thermal Expansion, but turning that off doesn't make a difference.. machine textures from TE still won't render through the EnderFace. 
Yes, of course. I though the client-log might be useless, since the mod works fine in singleplayer, so it must have to do something with the server :D  I hope this is the right file, at least the time matches.  https://gist.github.com/Accurexx/9346c76526b8d54f119fd3f6123c5d47  There are 2 regions within the log where thinks go weird (at least when i open the log with the notepad). If it's the right file, the first one should be the clay soldier placement, the second one the reconnection.
Nothing actually. 
Not really, but perhaps adding a lock around the part which starts it and flips some boolean should be enough? 
I assumed /p debug only debugged permission actions for the player who issued it.  Didn't realize it sent ALL permission debug messages to the player. 
Also checked that FORGE link and it looks like I will have to wait. It's not just JEI. it's the sprint key itself that can't be used for anything else. The sneak key also has this problem

All servers are specified in connection uri. Once no active error is encountered from passive, it is treated as handshake error and connection establisher doesn't try next in the list.
Well I was wrong about supressingException. It works fine at least in my test case. Website becomes very slow when DB shuts down, but it's nothing with cache2k but JDBC pooling internals.  About eviction issue, I cannot reproduce it because it only happens on my high traffic website, and also once (last week) on a low traffic website. Here is the way I construct a cache2k:  ``` private <K, V> Cache<K, V> buildCache2k(String cacheName, Class<K> keyClass, Class<V> valueClass, final Loader<K, V> loader,         Integer expireAfterSeconds, TimeUnit timeUnit, int maxSize) {     org.cache2k.CacheBuilder<K, V> c = org.cache2k.CacheBuilder.newCache(keyClass, valueClass).maxSize(maxSize)             .source(new CacheSource<K, V>() {                 @Override                 public V get(K k) throws Throwable {                     return loader.load(k);                 }             });     if (expireAfterSeconds != null) {         c.expiryDuration(expireAfterSeconds, timeUnit);     }     c.name(cacheName);     return c.build(); } ```

Yes, I can join any server, build, talk, etc. When I relog, however, I instantly crash before I can join back on the server. I can relaunch minecraft and forge to join again, but once I get back on, no blocks were registered.  I tried it again and the same result happened. 
@rombert : The issue seems to be with happening with this specific AEM Project that i am using dev tools with .  AEM Dev Tools -> 1.0.6 Sling IDE Tools --> 1.0.10  The following details may help you guess whats going on ..  Step 1: I have setup an AEM project using information available at https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/lazybones-aem-templates Step 2: Added another content project module to hold initial "authored content" , which is actually packaging and deploying content to "/content"  Step 3:  this project is "develop" branch of my git repo and there is lots of merges already happened . Step 4: Nothing pops out from filter.xml for either of the content projects   Please let me know if you want more details .  Note : When i add some thing in Dev Tools that is syncing into CRX , but the issue is with import operation (getting from crx into local folder)

Hello @mkulesh, instead of the bright pixels there are now black pixels in the right and bottom area with the current debug build.   Please see this screenshot: ![Screenshot (29 11 2019 16_32_58)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57828742/69878900-65dc9180-12c6-11ea-82bd-4fbe65d45e5b.jpg) 
@costin Yes, it works. Thank you! 
Thanks for looking into it. Sorry I am not the best tester. I only have one computer and am only running single player. Just tested with only Astral Sorcery and Baubles it still occurs (new log):   https://pastebin.com/9Hi14fuC  LWJGL 2 version: 2.9.4-nightly2015209 Minecraft version: 1.12.2 Forge version: 14.23.3.2662  Again thanks for all the work going into this mod.  
No, I didn´t change anything in setting except music. This isn´t the first time I have problem with this mismatch (even in previous versions, no setting changed), but after first restart there was no problem so I thought it is my computer´s failure. 
Is this no longer slated to also be fixed on 1.12 then? I admittedly should have replied earlier, but since I am working with 1.12 currently, that's a little unfortunate.

The issue is when I use the javacpp maven plugin, I got a failure just because I use maven 3.0.3 to build my wrapper.  Basically I would have to rebuild javacpp and upload it to our internal nexus to bypass the requirement. (Will work as we don't use nexus-staging-maven-plugin 1.6.6) But I would prefer to use directly the official version. 
Hi vladak, - there are no tomcat (warning) logs - the Java SecurityManager is not active - Indexing and tomcat run under the same user - all dirs are readable  I am now using apache-tomcat-8.5.13 I have added  some debug printf to the list.jsp to see if tomcat can read the corresponding dirs and can verify that I get a response. E.g  ```       if (!files.isEmpty()) {             List<String> readMes = dl.listTo(                     Util.URIEncodePath(request.getContextPath()),                     resourceFile, out, path, files);                     System.out.println("ContextPath:" + Util.URIEncodePath(request.getContextPath()) + " resoureFile:" + resourceFile + " out:" + out + " path:" + path + " files:" + files );                     System.out.println("readMes:" + readMes);  gives me a decent file dir pointer and the list of files:  ContextPath:/1830-srosviews_source resoureFile:/devel/opengrok-data-sros/stage1/source/panos-pkt2-dune/bcm/sdk-new/include/bcm_int out:org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspWriterImpl@15ea310 path:/panos-pkt2-dune/bcm/sdk-new/include/bcm_int/ files:[api_ref.h, api_xlate_port.h, async_req.h, async_server.h, bcm_dlist.h, bst.h, caladan3_dispatch.h, client_dispatch.h, common, compat, control.h, dfe, dfe_dispatch.h, dispatch.h, dnx, dnx_dispatch.h, dnxf, dnxf_dispatch.h, dpp, ea, esw, esw_dispatch.h, loop_dispatch.h, petra_dispatch.h, ptp_common.h, regex_api.h, robo, robo_dispatch.h, rpc, sbx, sbx_dispatch.h, shadow_dispatch.h, tk371x_dispatch.h, xasync_req.h] readMes:[]  ``` Happy Easter anyway..

Hi @stuartwdouglas,  Unfortunately. Option `-DnoDeps` did not fix it.  Just to make things easier I created a very minimal example and uploaded it into a new project https://github.com/sarxos/quarkus-issue-2809. The names of directories and modules are exactly the same as in my original project (I was too lazy to change them all) but all of my code is removed and only very basic reproducer classes are added instead.  These reproducer classes are:  The class from `abberwoult` module (this module is a runtime part of Quarkus extension):  ```java package com.github.sarxos.abberwoult;  public class TestClassDependency { } ```  The class from `abberwoult-example` module:  ```java package com.example;  public class TestClassProject { } ```  A `@Template` class which also belongs to `abberwoult` module:  ```java package com.github.sarxos.abberwoult;  import io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.Template;  @Template public class TestClassTemplate {  	public void test(String clazz) { 		try { 			Class.forName(clazz); 		} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) { 			e.printStackTrace(); 		} 	} } ```  And a `@BuildStep` in `abberwoult-deployment` module (this one is a deployment part of Quarkus extension) which records template invocation for these two test classes:  ```java package com.github.sarxos.abberwoult;  import static io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.ExecutionTime.STATIC_INIT; import io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.BuildStep; import io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.Record;  public class AbberwoultProcessor {  	@BuildStep 	@Record(STATIC_INIT) 	public void doTest(final TestClassTemplate template) { 		template.test("com.github.sarxos.abberwoult.TestClassDependency"); 		template.test("com.example.TestClassProject"); 	} } ```  To reproduce:  1. `git clone git@github.com:sarxos/quarkus-issue-2809.git` 2. `cd quarkus-issue-2809` 3. `mvn clean install` 4. `cd abberwoult-example` 5. `mvn clean install` 6. `mvn quarkus:dev` or `mvn quarkus:dev -DnoDeps` (no difference in output)  Observe:  * Class from dependency **is** loaded, * Class from a project **is not** loaded.  ```plain java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.TestClassProject 	at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:382) 	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424) 	at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:349) 	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357) 	at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method) 	at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:264) 	at com.github.sarxos.abberwoult.TestClassTemplate.test(TestClassTemplate.java:11) 	at io.quarkus.deployment.steps.AbberwoultProcessor$doTest2.deploy_0(Unknown Source) 	at io.quarkus.deployment.steps.AbberwoultProcessor$doTest2.deploy(Unknown Source) 	at io.quarkus.runner.ApplicationImpl1.<clinit>(Unknown Source) 	at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method) 	at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:62) 	at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45) 	at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:423) 	at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:442) 	at io.quarkus.runner.RuntimeRunner.run(RuntimeRunner.java:113) 	at io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain.doStart(DevModeMain.java:157) 	at io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain.main(DevModeMain.java:84) ```  **EDIT:** Just FYI, the `abberwoult-example` is not a module. It's a separate project. I already excluded multimodularity to be a root cause of this issue. 
I've 1 RGB (4 slots) and 3 Analog values (2 slot each). 
Also I think refresh time probably should be calculated based on ttl instead of lease duration (or creation_ttl).  For example, if you create a token using:  ```vault token-create --ttl=10m -wrap-ttl="24h"```  And then look up the token property using the wrapped_accessor,   ```vault token-lookup -accessor $wrapped_accessor```  you will see the following  ``` Key             	Value ---             	----- creation_time   	1493666164 creation_ttl    	600 display_name    	token explicit_max_ttl	0 id              	 meta            	<nil> num_uses        	0 orphan          	false path            	auth/token/create policies        	[root] renewable       	true ttl             	491 ```  The ttl value is always decreasing, it shows the current ttl remaining, whereas creation_ttl (also called lease_duration in the unwrap response) is always the same.  Refresh time calculated based on lease_duration can be off by a lot if the token was not used immediately after it was created. So I think using ttl is a better idea.   This may require an additional call to the token-lookup API because ttl is not part of the unwrap response.  
No, they are not shown as stored. 
I could not fully confirm one way or the other, but cursory review showed only the clicked item (whether or not the check mark changed) was the only thing changed in the order book.  > On Feb 18, 2020, at 21:02, Christoph Atteneder <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > ﻿ > Sounds like a rendering issue on the list.

Can you elaborate on the Eclipse template you mentioned? Is that a thing you need to do to make the setup work? 
I'm sorry for the late response. Yes, I forgot to mention, I need to zoom in in order to trigger the crash.
I switched between OSM Mapnik and the two Google Maps views. 
I will get back to you about this.  I have this issue with multiple devices, it has been there since I started testing ST for android for couple months.  thanks

Hi @a-hacker,  thanks for the quick response. If it's that hard to access the plugin's saved data, I do think such a button should exist somewhere hidden in the options. But in any case, yes, I can probably manage building the plugin myself from some branch containing this feature. I'd be thankful if you could put that together.
Either for it to ignore the body and respond with the settings or provide a relevant exception saying that sending body is not allowed with this API 
> I'm having trouble understanding why those two lines are at fault. Can you walk me through how you got here?  the first set the query time, the second get the query time,  maybe it is not the reason, it is only my guess.   In fact ,when i use QueryTagBuilder ,I set the range time ,but it not effect.
Yes, i made reset to this commit and now it works ok. Thanks 
The issue is consistent across browsers and reboots or RPi3.
I think it will not solve the issue - although the net.sf.cglib.proxy.Callback class will be available at startup, it will be different to the class loaded by webapp classloader.   If your code runs from "agent" classloader (directly from the plugin), it must be launched via java reflection, because "agent" classloader does not know anything about classes from weabpp.   The other way is to call the method from modified class in webapp classloader. It is possible, because all "agent" classes are replicated into all webapp classloaders (see org.hotswap.agent.util.classloader.ClassLoaderPatcher).  Javaassist is something else - it is included only to support bytecode manipulation.  
Yes, on Finchley.RC1 works OOTB. I think it's designed to work with Iterables (judging from mentioned method).
solved the iisue by deleting   androidTest folder in all 
latest compiled. 
Thanks for the quick response and fix!

I haven't reported it to cofh yet but plan to. I wanted to get some more screen shots and see if I can do a screen capture video of it. What I am seeing is two behaviors one, a redstone block is broken by the quarry and red liquid comes out and spreads and stays and continues to spread until the source block is filled or picked up with a bucket. the other is I break a redstone ore block with a pick, red liquid comes out and quickly drains away leaving the ore pieces. it's no big deal and to be honest the only reason I have the mod is because it was one of the recommended mods to be able to use the BC tank mod.  
```java 	private void showPickDateDialog() { 		DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener onDateSetListener = 				(view, year, monthOfYear, dayOfMonth) -> { 					String date = 							String.format(Locale.getDefault(), "%d%02d%02d", year, monthOfYear + 1, 									dayOfMonth); 				};  		DatePickerDialog dialog = DatePickerDialog.newInstance(onDateSetListener); 		dialog.vibrate(false); 		dialog.dismissOnPause(true); 		dialog.setVersion(DatePickerDialog.Version.VERSION_2); 		dialog.setAccentColor(0xff2096f3);  		dialog.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "DatePickerDialog"); 	} ```
Apologies for the delay, I will see what I can do. What I'm thinking should happen in this case (where a single "word" is larger than the column's maximum width) is that the output should fall back to naive splitting and breaking in the middle of the word. What do you think?
Sorry I also cannot repro it now. Seems that I mixed up the global security and path security.

@joshiste during our CICD process, we have a phase where we run the app as a non web app on a random port. This is causing failure due to above exception.
Yes I had about 30-40 old merge requests that have already been closed, so it went ahead and parsed 20-30 of them and correctly added the comments but the build failed (not sure 'cuz the branches didn't exit anymore) And then it seemed to have run into some exception and won't parse the rest of the merge requests or any new ones which have the branches available, no comments, no build. just seems to be stuck. Restarting jenkins does not help either.  I'm using Gitlab 5.1.0 e36372e

Thanks, I am using java 8 and did look into the circleci file but couldn't find anything different. Seemed a bit strange that build was passing there but not on my machine that is why I asked the question in case I was making a very obvious mistake. I'll try and do it on Linux machine.  Was looking into Zuul and was hoping to contribute to it - to add few functionalities. Just wanted to make sure I could build and run all tests before I start playing around.
4.1.0, the latest available. The pack is Mythic Novus [Kinetic]. I am on SP.
oops, just found it's not happen on every class.  After try & error, I think it's naming problem.  for ex: `public class A {     public Object mapTypeToAiNewsType(Object o) { return o; } }`  If I change the method name, it won't happen again.
When you say build nd4s, do you mean to add "org.nd4j" % "nd4s_2.11" % "0.4.0" into my build.sbt? 
@tsmaeder If I understood correctly on the second screenshot we can see methods from "String" class. So I suppose that language server initialized. Am I right? 
The log4j is at classpath. if you look at bin/dr-elephant declare - app_classpath-"................:$lib_dir/net.sf.py4j.py4j-0.8.2.1.jar:`hadoop classpath`:${ELEPHANT_CONF_DIR}" 
It's 1.0.3, but not Gradle version, just jar. I don't set Typeface, it's just clean IconTextView in xml layout. Example:   ``` <IconTextView xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     android:id="@android:id/text1"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="wrap_content"     android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceListItemSmall"     android:gravity="center_vertical"     android:paddingLeft="16dp"     android:paddingRight="16dp"     android:textColor="#fff"     android:background="?android:attr/activatedBackgroundIndicator"     android:minHeight="?android:attr/listPreferredItemHeightSmall"/> ``` 
Linear but I do not think it matters as I observed problems regardless of the number of hardware cycles.

I tried to debug this "Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Current VaadinSession is not open" exception. It seems to be somehow linked to Spring session fixation and might be a corner case timing problem. We will get this exception if there is VaadinSession that is still alive and being killed by Spring session fixation and at the same time we are logging in and new VaadinSession is being created. Spring will throw this exception, since the the session being killed is closed and now UIScoped bean can be instantiated to that context. The application works since soon after this new VaadinSession is alive and UIScoped bean is instantiated with it.
How did you install the apk manually? - in android from directory on SD card D:\Distrib\gnirehtet-rust-win64>adb install gnirehtet.apk adb: failed to install gnirehtet.apk: Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED: Install canceled by user] upd: There is "Установка через USB (Разрешить установку приложений через USB)" [translated: Installation via USB (Allow installing applications via USB) ] in developers settings is OFF and do not want turn ON without SIM card (I have not microSIM). upd2: Now it works. It was problem in "Install Via USB" + "USB Debugging (Security settings)" + xiaomi account. I found SIM with internet and turn ON this two options. May be after install the apk manually will be enough turn on only "USB Debugging (Security settings)" without "Install Via USB". Thank you once again for your program and help!

Ok, I just got a popup that a new version 2.1 is available in Eclipse.  Previous version was 2.0.0.v20160927-2006 and I was asked if I want to migrate my settings and I selected "yes".  I am using it on Windows 7 64bit with a 32bit Oracle JDK8/Eclipse Neon.1a.
Yeah that's what we are doing at the moment. I just don't like having lots of exclusions in my poms. I can make the change, test and issue a problem if you are busy ? 
Sorry @leticiarossi, I didn't specify everything in the first post.  By the way to help you speed up the analyzing process I've created a sample project with the reproducible behaviour using 1.1.0-beta02. Moreover, I've changed the bug-triggering code a bit https://github.com/matpag/material-textinputtest  If you need anything else just ask.  PS: If you figure out the problem and be able to point me in the right direction I can work on the fix

I'm looking at andlytics/src/com/github/andlyticsproject/console/v2/AccountManagerAuthenticator.java which seems to use the Ubertoken method described in  http://nelenkov.blogspot.se/2012/11/sso-using-account-manager.html (excellent blog post btw). That blogpost mentions under 1. in "Logging in using AccountManager" that the first step is to get a ClientLogin token.  If it's not a ClientLogin token, what token is it used to pass to IssueAuthToken? 
@SecUpwN , My pleasure!  > Adding getprop -  AIMSICD internal Log & Logcat.  Hope it can be of any help. Need more ? let me know...

I have one primary node and 3 replica.  When failover happens, the following is logged by Redisson:  {"Time":"2019-01-10T16:08:35.968-0800","fullMessage":"Detected DNS change. Master rediss://xxxxx.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com:6379 has changed ip from 10.153.99.49 to 10.153.99.219","loggerName":"org.redisson.connection.DNSMonitor","thread":"redisson-netty-1-12","severity":"INFO"}  It seems to me that Redisson did identify the changes. But when I ran " netstat -nt | sort +5 | fgrep .6379 | grep -n ^", I saw Redisson sent "SYN_SENT" to previous primary node even Redisson had already "ESTABLISHED" connection with new primary node. Once failover completed (it took about 10 mins), Redisson "ESTABLISHED" connection with previous primary node as well (33 connections to previous primary node, 34 connections to new primary node)  Another thing I noticed is that the following two calls seem using different connection pools. redissonClient.getMapCache("foo").get(key) always uses pool which points to new primary node.  redissonClient.getMapCache("foo").size() always uses pool which points to previous primary node. After failover happens, in about minute, get(key) starts to work, but size( ) keeps on throwing "SlaveConnectionPool no available Redis entries" error.  The reason I'm trying not to use individual node is that if we need to add new node or delete a node, I don't want to restart app with new node configuration. We used AWS Redis (cluster mode disabled). The primary node can handle both read and write. The other nodes are mainly for failover.

Hi @marcingrzejszczak , just demo code for now :-)  Would it be possible to maybe just start discarding spans if the queue is full? It would probably be preferable to lose traces rather than throwing unhandled exceptions .  A sampling rate of 0.1 (or even 0.01) may be fine for expected traffic, but an unexpected spike should probably not start throwing exceptions if the rest of the code can cope. As you say, a custom poller would probably solve that. I'll definitely give it a try.  I've tried similar tests using HTTP as the transport mechanism instead of Kafka and haven't seen any issues. 
This wasn't an issue, per se. As I had not tested or even 'try' to burn dust as fuel in my sessions., however I saw this in my log and figured I would share for you. Dust was the only AA item listed in this error list (two others were unrelated mods).
Meaning...  When I go to my "Gallery" in Android, select a photo, select share.  My apps list pops up which allows me to choose how to share.  I select nextcloud client.  Next Cloud client asks to "Verify Identity" which is what I mean by log in.

To clarify: Are you referring to only the first issue related to the Periodical or both? 
that was amazingly fast! thanks, it works :)
Indeed. I installed .NET 3.5 and it works now, thank you. It will be difficult to have a multiplatform software now :(  I saw that any others free softwares test if JAVA or .NET are installed and if not, download and install them. It would be interesting to add this feature in the installer. 
I will try to reproduce tomorrow.  Btw: do you have tipps to speed up schema-information (tables, colums, foreign keys) for an oracle db. My account hat full-access, and it takes very long (20-30 secs) to produce the catalog information; and this is fast because I already restricted to one schema....  I’m currently building an web-app where the people can create special triggers ... and therefore I didn’t want to re-invent the wheel and just tried to use APIs already in the wild, so your API was choosen.... but somehow I still have this performance problem....

I did. > TV is pingable. Wired connection.  > Mobile TV on is ON. > LG Connect Apps is ON.  OH2  PC & TV are on ports on the same eth switch on the back of the router.  Also: just tried the LG TV Plus Android app and it is working fine.  Some additional info. When I bought this TV for my mother almost a year ago, the binding was working. Sometime during spring/summer -18 it was always marked as Offline even though the TV was on.  Yesterday I updated OH2 to the latest snapshot, and noticed that it was still offline. Then I tried uninstalling and re-installing the binding twice. The last time I lifted the attached logs.

Hi @dzc34,  It's the develop version.  Thanks :)
I've just implemented it for the level 13 icons and the major differences to the previous version are: - does not scan for any borders of the icon - starts investigating pixels at the centre of the assumed icon location - walks in a spiral away from the centre instead of taking a straight line to find matching pixels - does not rely on certain specific 32 bit colors but instead just looks for color ranges like a human would do  Nevertheless it is still only 30 lines of code and very fast. I've not yet looked at the level 14 stuff.

Yes it is set with the server running. Why would a server reset the config back to the previous state after a restart though? Also what would be the point of having the ability to change a setting live in the game with a command if it reverts or the ability to reload the config after changing the setting VIA the config file. 
Because it's public server, I even don't know where this molecular assemblers and how many of them there is. But I will try to reproduce this in new world with busses. And as temporary solution I just made Molecular Assemblers to ignore patterns in it. 
wierd it stopped doing it
@idelcano I'm looking at the DB. The completion dates are definitively wrong, while the other dates are right, and in the monitor chart apparently we're seeing the completion dates. So yes, it's necessary. The composites  scores-related task that you're talking about was just that the CS 0 was not the root of the CS tree server side, and as long as it was being used to determine the main score of the survey in the translation into our DB, it was failing saying 0% (so class C score). 
Was posted in the IRC-channel by SammysHP, so I don't have any further details 
Yeah obviously the lava didn't enter the void, but that is what the player is telling me reproduces it (or at least attempting to enter the void). I will have a go later at seeing if I can reproduce it when the numbers get a bit lower.

Yeah, I know what you mean. Chat events tend to get a bit messy when you have formatters and filters all listening and acting on them. In my case, [ChatControl](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrol.271/) is the main incompatibility; I have to set its "Formatter" listener priority to "MONITOR" in the config, which then breaks my punishment plugin's mute command.  Edit: Scratch the mute thing, that seems to have broken with a recent update of ChatControl. >.<

I've found out that problem is with incorrect focuces for child views. If we have for example several inner buttons with custom drawable selectors -> problem comes back again. 
I found out that the finish line had to have a vertical plane rather than just horizontal.  I will still find out the problem with the random teleportation.  Also is there a release date for the update?

yes
@ryanjbaxter I guess some ISPs dont allow ```transfer-encoding: chunked``` for ```GET``` requests. It works fine from other networks, but our office network doesn't allow it when we try to make ```GET``` requests to cloud foundry from local instance.  It also used to happen before this [commit](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/commit/cfa4302965a439e6d0b7776febd70f45aab0aa79), when ```content-length``` was not set for non-get requests.

Yes the damage is enabled and it was a normal gate, not a pegasus gate. All damage is taken by my armor and more testing showd that a protection IV enchanted endstell armor from EnderIO can save your life too.
Nop, nothing change, i also reported the error on bnd issue tracker. Error appear with `*` option in conditional package. This is strange, i have not this error on old version of goomph.
@msand unfortunately since I cannot reproduce locally, I'm not very keen on deploying a non stable version of this lib to them to validate the fix. I'm downgrading to `6.5.2` for now. Hopefully we'll find a way to reproduce with the version 7
We did some tests now:  HTC DesireZ, CustomROM CM10.1 for DesireZ/Vision, Android 4.2.1 - broken HTC One S, CustomROM CM10.0.0-ville, Android 4.1.2 - working Sony Xperia Pro, StockROM, Android 4.0.4 - broken Galaxy Nexus, StockRROM, Android 4.2.1 - working  What I see here is, no matter if stock or custom ROM, that the devices with a hardware keyboard are not working while the ones with soft keyboard do.

@lixinchengdu In your example, yes, but you can't do it vice versa
No, the problem [predates](https://mattermost.eclipse.org/eclipse/pl/tk9f3crkdjy1ucuecoo1kzzgbh) your patch. 
Yes, the same user id. The user is able to access the home directory.
No, but it shouldn't exclude directories just because they contain a BUCK file - it should only exclude directories if that BUCK file defines a project_config for that directory/module.  An example would be a module containing a lib/ directory which in turn contained both .jar files and a BUCK file with a load of prebuild_jar entries. Since the commit referenced above, that lib/ directory is being excluded from its parent module and is therefore hidden in IntelliJ. It wouldn't make sense to put a project_config() in lib/BUCK because there are no appropriate src_roots... there are no sources. 
The typical meaning of "export" is "to a file format without all features" Following typical current UI practice, you could either rename to "save as" or have separate "save as" and "export" buttons.  "Export" is an optional notion in user interfaces, which is being slowly obsoleted by more sophisticated save dialogs; "Save As" is fundamental functionality.
I guess the complexity is due to the fact while Ticks are removed from the TimeSeries, the CachedIndicator's value list is not touched and we rely on the beginIndex, endIndex, and removedTickCount to square up the two.   On CachedIndicator.java Line: 87, `result = calculate(removedTicksCount); ` looks like it causes the stack overflow. Should it be `result = calculate(0);`?  Just let me know if this is the direction you want to go and I'll create a pull request. I already have the fix in my local "fork" and it works without issue.
@tyronen  I change the method (**Line Num 275**)  ``` android    private void updateAdapter(List<String> urls) {     if (mCurrentAdapter != null) {       mCurrentAdapter.clear();       if (urls != null) {         for (String url : urls) {           mCurrentAdapter.add(url);         }       }       mCurrentAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();     }   } ```  to  ``` android   private void updateAdapter(List<String> urls) {     //use the local pic     urls = new ArrayList<>();     try {       final String[] columns = { MediaStore.Images.Media.DATA,               MediaStore.Images.Media._ID };       final String orderBy = MediaStore.Images.Media._ID + " DESC";        Cursor imagecursor = getContentResolver().query(               MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI, columns,               null, null, orderBy);        if (imagecursor != null && imagecursor.getCount() > 0) {          while (imagecursor.moveToNext()) {            int dataColumnIndex = imagecursor                   .getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Images.Media.DATA);           String a = imagecursor.getString(dataColumnIndex);           urls.add(a);         }         imagecursor.close();       }     } catch (Exception e) {       e.printStackTrace();     }     if (mCurrentAdapter != null) {       mCurrentAdapter.clear();       if (urls != null) {         for (String url : urls) {           mCurrentAdapter.add("file://"+ url);         }       }       mCurrentAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();     }   } ```  and in the xml **activity_main.xml**  ``` android <ListView       android:id="@+id/image_list"       android:layout_width="wrap_content"       android:layout_height="0dp"       android:layout_weight="1"       /> ```  to  ``` android  <GridView       android:numColumns="3"       android:id="@+id/image_list"       android:layout_width="wrap_content"       android:layout_height="0dp"       android:layout_weight="1"       /> ```

Yes those many empty folders are created in C:\cache, it's just the jar file that can't be saved there 
Probably validationService.isCountryAdmitted(playerIp) is too slow... @ljacqu  
Oh dear... Ya know, I hadn't actually tried that, and it seems to have worked. Now I feel incredibly foolish, the possibility completely flew over my head.  It's still a weirdly consistent thing, but much less of a problem than I initially thought then. :0 I tested it, they spawn just fine under every circumstance aside from in their towers, so it's definitely tied to that, and only effecting the evil dudes. If it matters- I have Recurrent complex, dungeon tactics, and ice and fire all, and biomes'o plenty in this current build, all of which fiddle with generation a good bit.

In gh-core repo we have a check in RouteResource to prevent this:  ``` if (requestPoints.isEmpty())     throw new IllegalArgumentException("You have to pass at least one point"); ```
Quite often. It's difficult to describe how often them spawn, maybe 1-2 per 10 chunks. This pockets contains water from bedrock to surface.

Er, it was the duplicate at least. I don't recall checking flips, dunno where that title came from.
Thank's for fast answer, yes I'm using Maven, and `0.6` stable version.  Now i downloaded `0.7-SNAPSHOT` from   ``` xml         <repository>             <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>             <url>http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>             <snapshots>                 <enabled>true</enabled>             </snapshots>             <releases>                 <enabled>false</enabled>             </releases>         </repository> ```  And got a lot of errors, project crashed, and i just can't test modal windows. not even main page with just a <b:Button with `gwtbootstrap3`, and nothing else.  ``` 00:00:10,441 [ERROR] Errors in 'org/gwtbootstrap3/client/ui/base/button/AbstractToggleButton.java' 00:00:10,441  [ERROR] Line 71: The method add(Widget, Element) in the type ComplexPanel is not applicable for the arguments (Text, Element) 00:00:10,441  [ERROR] Line 72: The method add(Widget, Element) in the type ComplexPanel is not applicable for the arguments (Caret, Element) 00:00:10,446 [ERROR] Errors in 'org/gwtbootstrap3/client/ui/base/ComplexWidget.java' 00:00:10,446  [ERROR] Line 43: The method add(Widget, Element) in the type ComplexPanel is not applicable for the arguments (Widget, Element) 00:00:10,447  [ERROR] Line 53: The method insert(Widget, Element, int, boolean) in the type ComplexPanel is not applicable for the arguments (Widget, Element, int, boolean) ```  I will investigate all errors, but there is a lot of stack trace o_O 
@Nimrodda Thank you for the quick response.  It works fine with swiping the pages.  In fact I've also observed that it doesn't notify about all of the subpages when you go back with back button.  `onStepChanged()` is called for the `5` element even if you press back button 4 times and finally you are on the `2` element. After a delay and pressing back button once again, it logs `1`:  ``` D/onStepChanged(): 5 D/onStepChanged(): 1 ``` 
Hi, looking in Eclipse Installation Details the SpotBugs version seems to be:   SpotBugs	3.1.2.r201802250230-59118d9	com.github.spotbugs.plugin.eclipse.feature.group	SpotBugs Project  I configured my workspace to use compiler level 1.8 only across all projects. The problem occurrs even when trying to scan an empty new project (tested with workspace settings and with manual "Java 10"-level settings).   Okay, I installed the latest version from https://spotbugs.github.io/eclipse/ now and that seems to work. I hadn't realized that 3.1.2 wasn't the most recent version, which I had obtained from the Marketplace. So the issue should rather be: Update the Marketplace version. :)
That's a very good question.  I thought that I might have had an indeterminate state, leading to a mistaken exception, but that line has been Set not Map for as long as I went back... 
Hey, yes, the tabs get refreshed and everything is ok if tab is refreshed. I know this is a general "problem" with all the views. I realized just now, that this is actually duplicate of issue #1079 so I am closing this - i had a feeling this issue was posted before but I could not find it.  
Additional info, the library project is only affected if it doesn't contain **any** resources 
Why would modifying the auto-download setting affect whether a URL or a "Download image" button is shown? 
It does always happen, I've tried multiple times on the same world and multiple times on multiple fresh saves. I cannot reproduce without any other mods installed.
@khmarbaise, yes, I have created a PR here: https://github.com/jenkinsci/java-client-api/pull/283  Thanks. 
Yes, I assume issue #26 in your Gradle plugin has the same root cause as issue #16 in your Maven plugin since they are both caused by a javax.naming.NoInitialContextException with the same exception reason. I may be wrong though. In any case issue #16 is still relevant for your Maven plugin.
> Should be open a team discussion for it to clarify the procedure?  Same thinking, I just opened a normal issue to discuss that.
- put the mod in the mods folder  - Open the launcher  - start the game with forge  - game crashes

Yeah, url to clipboard is fine. If it's not too much work, maybe a linky clicky thing so people who don't want it in their clipboard don't get it. Could be just a link in the help text.

Yes, this bug appears when i select in histogram specific time interval and there is no so much data in DB. For now it fails when i select "Month".
So I'm using spring boot, katharsis-spring and katharsis-jpa.  katharsis version is 2.8.2, spring boot version is 1.4.2  I've got an object (hypothetically `Car`) which aggregates some other objects (hypothetically `Car` has `Wheel`s in a list).  If I annotate the aggregated objects (`Wheel`) with `@JsonApiResource`, this fails and throws the exception.  Sorry I can't be more explicit, hope this helps.  I will try to provide a test case later today, but am a bit swamped.
There should be an easy way to map the file names to the content of the tweets. Maybe this should be done in corpus management? i.e. a way to open a corpus, show its content, and which file a data point maps on to during analyses?  
It had to do with the `Connection type` being `Production`. By default that connection type has `Auto-commit` turned off by default. Checking that fixed my "issue".

Yes, the existing master is still wrong - the field shouldn't be autowired at all.

@Fleshgrinder you are correct in this case. But if we use short ternary we can get error on undefined variable. But with constructions like `isset`, `empty`, `??` we should never get error on undefined variable.   P.S I saw @rentalhost report issue related to empty, isset and ?? oprator

I opened the Quarry (as it now as a GUI in 8.0), and wondered if the new items are a filter. I couldn't put anything in, and tried shift-clicking, when it crashed.
Finally I could test your new release! Thank you very much for digging into this!  As you suggested in your mail, it works with the new release when I disable the "Use Google Play services: Provider-installer" option in "SSL settings". 😄  After thinking about it I tested with the Play Store version 1.93.3 again, now using the same settings... and it works as well! And I was so sure, that I tested that already. Still confused, that 1.93.1 worked with Play services enabled... 😕 
Of course, I have it running on my server consistently, so I will always get firsthand experience regarding what is and isn't working properly.

ok. the title has been modified.
Strange, it's consistent for me even with the latest build (58e60970e18a00ff54cd223d905ce6a158031b27).  Regardless, is it possible that two calls to edit for the same role (initiated on different threads) could cause this issue even after your fix?  I just took a look at the source code and it doesn't look like the request is asynchronous, but how is the result of the role updated? Is this sent later on by the Discord server?
I'm not sure what is wrong. The failures are intermittent and not always in the same test case. Possibly it is just a bug in the OpenJDK code.
Desktop info updated, tried recently 1st blob saved fine, after that hung up, random 
Looking in historycache, I don't even see this file's ```.gz```.  Does it have to contain it? Maybe something went wrong in the index? 
Yep, mvn clean package worked; and this does resolve this error. Do we know when it will be rolled into this project?  Thanks! 
Fixed! I'll remember the updateSite= trick just in case something similar happens again

I seems like the root cause of the indefinite waiting is that after I click "save as draft", the site is not redirected to integrations, and rather the view stays on the new integration page. The indefinite waiting occurs after second click on "save as draft", which seems to try to create the integration, which already exists. This occurs in the log:  {{ 2018-02-16 09:51:45,245 INFO [CurrentFlow] Error saving integration: {   "_body": "[{\"error\":\"UniqueProperty\",\"message\":\"Value 'test' is not unique\",\"property\":\"create.obj.name\"}]",   "status": 400,   "ok": false,   "statusText": "Bad Request", }}  Full log is attached.

Hello afdia,  here for you the contents of my .metadata from workspace as compressed tar-file - but its renamed to gif-ending to attach them If i could more do for you let me know !!

> Could you attach code at es.cashconverters.compraventa.presentation.views.wizard.WizardStepFragment.onActivityCreated(WizardStepFragment.kt:29) ?  Basically the code inside the WizardStepFragment is:  ``` override fun onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {          super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState)          label_header_wizard_step.text = context?.getString(wizardStep.headerStringId)              val gifFromResource = GifDrawable(resources, wizardStep.gifId)          image_wizard_step.setImageDrawable(gifFromResource)      } ```  and the xml with de ImageView for display gif is: ``` <pl.droidsonroids.gif.GifImageView             android:scaleType="centerCrop"             android:id="@+id/image_wizard_step"             android:layout_marginEnd="10dp"         /> ``` Thanks

Yes. Checkout the syncOrch branch and run AddRemoveNodeTestIT.   Note, you need to uncomment  "//throw new WrongClusterException(clusterId, layout.getClusterId()); " in the CorfuRuntime class. 
Okay made a simple 3x3x3 passively cooled reactor. http://br.sidoh.org/#reactor-design?length=1&width=1&height=1&activelyCooled=false&controlRodInsertion=0&layout=X  It does 42rf/t when it should do 107rf/t with the configs we have. Default being 268rf/t. With 0.4.2A2 it does 42rf/t and with 0.4.1A2 it does 107rf/t. I didn't notice any difference from ssp/smp, Sorry about that part, my friend noticed the differences and told me about that part. I didn't test until just now. 
Yeah it worked before the update.  Sure, I did the copy&paste workaround. That works. It just should not be necessary to write your password in plain text somewhere before you paste it into a password field 😉

Before the 1.8 update: 1. Give yourself a custom mobspawner (/give player mobspawner:mobvalue 1), where mobvalue is the mob network id, for instance pig is 50 2. Place the mobspawner 3. Essentials will check if a mobspawner has been placed, check the placed items datavalue (in this case 50) and then change the mob on the placed mobspawner  This is no longer possible, as the data value can no longer be stored in mobspawner items in your inventory. Giving yourself a custom spawner will simply reset the data value to 0. 
Gradlew build
i believe so @xBrownieCodez That's the only one that logged that i noticed anyways, however if you manage to fix it for that check, look and see what others will also cause that issue
See my comment here: https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/FABsMenu/issues/22  It is not a flickering, but a selection state on the menu items that seems to be triggered on fab button click.
Upgraded to SpringBoot 1.5.16. 
Somewhere on the project page on https://coveralls.io there showed up a red(?) banner containing an input field where I entered the correct path to the project root. Now it is gone on my page. I think that coveralls.io recognizes the broken configuration and gives us the opportunity to fix it directly on the web page. 
All these alignment options in 608Decoder are based on assumptions what the content provider intended to achieve by adding whitespaces around the text. As the negative value is caused by incorrect content, we should probably not trust the values and the safest could be center alignment for Pop-on captioning mode. But other modes cannot be center aligned, the only other common mode is Roll-up, always left aligned. So something like this:  ``` @@ -726,7 +726,7 @@ public final class Cea608Decoder extends CeaDecoder {        // The number of empty columns after the end of the text, in the same range.        int endPadding = SCREEN_CHARWIDTH - startPadding - cueString.length();        int startEndPaddingDelta = startPadding - endPadding; -      if (captionMode == CC_MODE_POP_ON && Math.abs(startEndPaddingDelta) < 3) { +      if (captionMode == CC_MODE_POP_ON && (endPadding < 0 || (Math.abs(startEndPaddingDelta) < 3 && startPadding > 0))) {          // Treat approximately centered pop-on captions are middle aligned.          position = 0.5f;          positionAnchor = Cue.ANCHOR_TYPE_MIDDLE; ``` Note: also added the condition suggested in https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3533
Thanks, now it works. By the way, is it OK, that I have to correct required Build Tools to currently available 22.0.1, as 22.0.0 is in no way available after ADT update? 
Hi Karol,  Sure! It can wait on my side, don't worry =).  Dani
Are you asking where the emails are coming from or the actual details of the emails?  Just had it happen to two again today so I'd be able to do either.  It's happened to varied emails, no real connection.  This time I deleted these emails in K9 but instead of deleting and disappearing, they turned to this no Subject/no text issue  
This source same with this sample source, but only refactor package name and auto refactor inside a folder in android-pdf-viewer. See this [https://prnt.sc/g0lvwg](https://prnt.sc/g0lvwg).  I don't know why the package name is refactored in the folder android-pdf-viewer.  
If you want to send a message without opening the default intent, you have to set the intent value to empty (intent='').  So if you're sending multiparts message (more than 160 characters), we need to add the following permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />`  I need to understand now why the callback method is called multiple times now (1 time per part of the message)

NPE, because ```@Autowired``` annotation is being ignored by ```DefaultValidatorProvider```
Of course I killed the apps:-) 
No, only username and password 
Not deep. Probably one level deeper. Request has an object which contains LocalDate 
Thanks! We are running version 2.3.0. We have now turned on more verbose OpenTSDB logging and I will try to get some logs next time this happens. It happens only a couple of times per day out of millions of queries, so they can be hard to track down :)
Crash no longer occurs, but shift-clicking the item does not move it to the villager. 
Reproducing should be easy, in my simplest case the NPE occurs for this auto-generated `toString()` method:  ```    @Override    public String toString() {       final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("TestClass{");       sb.append("portId='").append(portId).append('\'');       sb.append(", providerId='").append(providerId).append('\'');       sb.append(", providerName='").append(providerName).append('\'');       sb.append('}');       return sb.toString();    } ```  ![debugger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/858827/28909702-ce72d63a-7829-11e7-93c3-8e1c7fd1552f.png) 
Yes.  Thanks for bringing this up. Because also I couldn't change the Composertype in the FeatureIDE project configuration after importing the model. After changing the type and clicking `Apply` or `Apply and Close` a error prompt showed up but closed immediately. Reopening the configuration, the value of composertype was still `FeatureModelling` (default I guess). Restarting eclipse fixed this too. But this is probably another issue.
I think i can try the same steps within simple project or in one of the test projects. I'll write as I try
Uses for iron ore show both dust types for both iron and gold and does not give AA dust for iron or gold. Gold ore seems to be giving AA dust so the black list is working for that. (Sorry for the wait internet when down on Sunday.) 
Yes, that can be done and need to handled explicitly in the conf. So was just thinking if this could be made as Info as this seems to be important metrics to keep an eye on cluster. 
@md678685 Good to hear I'm not going crazy and there is an actual issue. Is there anything I can do to help OR have you made any progress? I have people dying from falling beneath platforms they teleport to daily.
@AntonioFilipov The VCH isn't down.  Operations continues.  Containers continue to start up and shuts down.  This is from viewing the vSphere UI.  I can access the VCH via docker CLI.  One other comment, this issue is 100% reproducible in my environment (actually Lakshmi's env).
It's pretty much easy. This field may be used different threads, and sync is needed here not for synchronization itself, but for visibility reasons, cause referenceCount may be cached somewhere in CPU, and another CPU's core cannot see changing this field 
Difficult to nail the reproducer. It's mainly a contract issue where the flush does not ensure that it establishes a checkpoint where it needs to ensure that the data that have been received by AsyncFile so far must be written to the disk (as it stays in the buffer). 
I think it happened when the webjars is modified without reloading the project info (so no change of version, just the content changes). Nothing that really affects anybody, but if we can avoid it would be the best. 
when doing `mvn -Dquarkus.platform.version=xyz clean install` to test/work with new version.
> Why wouldn't we?   Exactly, I don't have any good reason to object it. Then, I might know how to fix this, will send a change today.

I was using the Modern Warfare and Simple Parts packs, version 4.9.0 of each. As for Forge, I think at the time of this report I was using 1291 (sorry I forgot to include it in the OP), but now I'm on 1343.  I've been assembling an update and had moved up to Forge 1352 (latest that doesn't change the Fluid registry stuff and crash some mods), and updated to Flan's 4.10.0 to see if it'd still give me the error at some point, and it did. It's the exact same crash but I'm dumb and didn't bother to look at the full log to see the erroring entity ID, though I was able to once again log into the world after disabling Flan's, so that tells me it's still something to do with Flan's. I would try the absolute latest Forge builds but it doesn't work with a number of the mods that I have, at least not until they update.  I dunno though, it just seems to happen when something spawns, could it be a strange mod interaction messing with entity ID registry? I'm unsure of how entity stuff works in Minecraft's code so I probably don't know what I'm talking about here. 
Sure, here are some screenshots of a minimal setup I created in a single player world.  The mechanical user is set to Redstone On, Activate Block With Item, Right Click, Upper Left Slot Only. The Automatic Precision Dropper is set to Redstone Deactivation.  ![2018-10-13_11 10 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11310422/46903699-d5cc6480-ced8-11e8-9902-84a772b358b0.png) ![2018-10-13_11 11 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11310422/46903700-d5cc6480-ced8-11e8-8400-53d01e23cf13.png) ![2018-10-13_11 10 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11310422/46903701-d5cc6480-ced8-11e8-9ca8-d3062e76169e.png)
I'm sorry, it's really 1.1.9. I looked at grepcode 4.0.3: [http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.0.3_r1/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.java/](url) Database extends SQLiteClosable, which not implement Closeable.  Crash is from fabric, I wan't reproduce too.  Included via Gradle:  `    compile 'com.evernote:android-job:1.1.9'`
For me at least, if I use the apply operation with a 1 parameter operator, and specify a fixed value in the second slot, the result is a 0 parameter operation.  i.e. I have an operation variable that accepts an entity and returns an NBT value. If I use it in an apply with an entity variable, the resulting variable can be placed in a display to see the result. It seems it can also be used again in an apply.

I took out of his and put it in mine. Still working on getting a copy of what it had as extra bees I can get the straight bee but not with how he specialized it. From what we can tell it had something to do with two effects on it. (wishes there was a way to /give items with nbt data...) 
I built the images from master branch on Dec 12. 
Accepting files via notification works in the web UI, but the Activity pane doesn't have clickable links for the file.
I guess so, yes. While then we should probably still add the null-check since that is still the better way of handling it instead of an NPE crash.
Yes I can confirm!  2.0-SNAPSHOT  also don't work
Changing to an integer for the SDK_INT fixes the first error, but not the second error as the API doesn't exist in my build SDK for locationEnabled.  Changing my build SDK to 28 fixes both build errors. 
This is not the warning from the catch clauses inside GcmAvailableHelper that you had recently surrounded with "if (Build.Debug)".  It doesn't even get to that point because the GcmAvailableHelper  class cannot be loaded at all.

@jbq Yes found same thing as you when reading the timestamp.proto file, and if I generate a Java Class from .proto file I don't have same behaviour, I really have TimestampProto.Timestamp.  @garethahealy  Ok I pushed some code to github to reproduce the issue at [https://github.com/panes/dozer-protobuf ](url)  I did 2 correct cases:  - **DateConverterUsingXmlTest.java**, one with dozer mapping using xml file, defining one custom converter: **SUCCESS**  - **DateConverterUsingSpringAPITest.java**, second with dozer mapping using API with Spring injection, defining one custom converter: **SUCCESS**  I did 2 wrong cases:  - **WrongDateConverterUsingXmlTest.java**, one with dozer mapping using xml file, defining one custom converter and one mapping: **FAIL**  - **WrongDateConverterUsingSpringAPITest.java**, second with dozer mapping using API with Spring injection, defining one custom converter and one mapping: **FAIL**   May be I'm using badly dozer, and you can explain me how to do it in a good way, I want to define a custom converter from com.google.protobuf.Timestamp to java.util.LocalDate, this step is working, and use this converter automatically each time I define a mapping from class A with a Timestamp field to a class B with a LocalDate field. When I try to define a dozer mapping with such setup I got the issue about ClassNotFoundException. Let me know if you need more details, or if I should do things differently.  Thanks. 
Yes, I do. When I initialize my fragment, the setPosition() work, but when I call this method on a Listening, this not work
The problem is the deserialization process of the regionData.   ### Reason  When restoring the region from MonitoringStatus.restoreMonitoringStatus(), the method CallBack.readObject() is not called if the CallBack class is minified  ### Complementary Observation  Looking more in detail to the code to understand the reason of the bug, there is a strange Callback initialization for the regionData.  While in the BeaconService.startMonitoringBeaconsInRegion, there is a callback object as parameter, it's not transmitted to create the regionData. In fact, the MonitoringStatus class is reacreating a callback...  #### Actual code  **> Beacon Service**  ``` java    public void startMonitoringBeaconsInRegion(Region region, Callback callback) {         LogManager.d(TAG, "startMonitoring called");         monitoringStatus.addRegion(region);         LogManager.d(TAG, "Currently monitoring %s regions.", monitoringStatus.regionsCount());         mCycledScanner.start();     } ```  **> Monitoring Status**  ``` java  public synchronized void addRegion(Region region) {         if (mRegionsStatesMap.containsKey(region)) return;         mRegionsStatesMap.put(region, new RegionMonitoringState(new Callback(mContext.getPackageName())));         saveMonitoringStatusIfOn(); } ```  #### Code Suggestion  **> Beacon Service**  ``` java   public void startMonitoringBeaconsInRegion(Region region, Callback callback) {         LogManager.d(TAG, "startMonitoring called");         monitoringStatus.addRegion(region, callback);         LogManager.d(TAG, "Currently monitoring %s regions.", monitoringStatus.regionsCount());         mCycledScanner.start();     } ```  **> Monitoring Status**  ``` java  public synchronized void addRegion(Region region, CallBack callback) {         if (mRegionsStatesMap.containsKey(region)) return;         mRegionsStatesMap.put(region, new RegionMonitoringState(callback));         saveMonitoringStatusIfOn(); } ``` 
ObjectBox version: 1.5.0: Recently I did not notice any similar issue.   I will try v2 and observe. Thanks =)
Thank you for your quickly response.  Yes, I used forcehybrid to generate the app.  I have tried to use the same code of the example and it has the same error.  This is my code:  ``` forceLogin(): Promise<any> {          return new Promise((s, r) => {              window.force.login(                  (data) => {                      s(data);                  },                  (err) => {                      r(err);                  });         });     } ```  
Wrapping it in a function does not trigger the message but removing the function scope from your code fragment emits the message again

I have started the instance a second time. And also tried your advice. Still, I can't make any change in the tree of the configuration editor. Even if I don't color features. Looks like we reload the config file after a save, but the save never happens. So no configuration can be modified.

I don't know. I wasn't able to reproduce this error since it came up. A 504 Bad Gateway error would only be displayed and wouldn't crash the app. 
Yes, this would be an idea. But that mixes test classes with production code. I am not sure, if this is the best academic and architectural solution!?
Hello Thomas,  Thank you for your answer. Yes, you were right, "just" start-order issues, but unfornately Binding is still unfunctional. I have cleaned all items and sitemap files. I left only relevant items to this binding in items files:  ``` Switch Incoming_Call    "Ringing"           (Phone)    { asterisk=active } Call Active_Call    "Connected [to %1$s from %2$s]" (Phone)    { asterisk=active } Call Active_Call    "Connected to [%s]"     (Phone)    { asterisk=active } ```  and also in sitemap file:  ``` sitemap default label="OpenHouse" {         Frame label="Phone" {                 Switch item=Incoming_Call label="In call"                 Text item=Active_Call         } } ```  I have had no error in openhab.log in debug mode. With tcpdump between asterisk and openhab server I still saw communication, bud no state change happened if I had a call in Asterisk.  Do you have any advice where can be a problem? 
I am sorry, that's all I've got. Unfortunately I am not using this library anymore for a different reason. I think the only other detail I can give is that I have multiple fingerprints. But besides that I have nothing.
Could it be a maven `settings.xml` thing?

The file seems to have internal subtitles, but there are no external sub files at all. Made a screen cap with some information about the video file. Hope this helps and Thank you~  ![file-infos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34943398/34441590-0712eba8-ecbd-11e7-8de1-2d9779711ac1.jpg) 
Yes, I agree with your analysis that a fix for https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/837 would also solve this. 
Since movement from JabRef 9.10 to 3.4 resulted in massive loss of information, I reverted to the former and recovered the jabref-meta: groupstree for each database. While I lack any expertise, it seems that the hierarchical structure of group names could be readily preserved. For example, here is a hierarchical group tree:    1    -A     -- a  2  -B  --a  3   -C  -- b  So a bibliographic entry that is associated only the first "a", and with "C" and "b" would have the field:    groups = {1,A,a; 3,C; 3,C,b},  If this could be done, I recommend it. 
Chrome dev. I don't think it's a browser issue. I've had lots of troubles with GWT external css. It also happens that somethings works perfectly in dev mode and not at all in production mode. (That's why I opened #22.)

It should either show a empty label, or generate an exception that tells me clearly what is wrong with the code. It took quite some debugging to find the actual cause, because the exception happens latter, when the JSON is being generated, not immediately when the label generator returns .  I would prefer the first option, since I think it will be a common cause of problems.  If the second option is chosen, I think the javadoc in the setItemLabelGenerator should also mention that it is not ok to return null values.   
The bug is that it raises the lint-error instead of formatting code (I run the apply goal - not check)
I think the suggestion Radu posted (i.e. continually increasing) makes best sense because chapter numbers are usually quoted independently (e.g. ch. 9), not as a portion of the containing part (e.g.  ch V.2)

Hi, @vpavic thanks for looking into this issue.   I can't reproduce the issue on spring-security-core 5.0.12, however the 5.0.x release does not contain a CSRF-filter for Webflux; therefore only one saveDelta call is executed.  I'll try to create an unit test to reproduce the issue in an isolated environment.  
Don't know exactly how it happened.Maybe during a parsing or typechecking.  
Not sure, I’ll look into it. 
The problem has been solved with the new IOS update 13.1.3
happens all the time its permanent as long as i use the new version of EBWiz also happens on all mobs and i noticed it also happens to the text that apears when i use the feature from quark mod that makes mobs randomly talk nonsens (quark and neat are made by vazkii so probably using the same overlay tingy)
We're on version 3.0.5c of boilerplate and B3.5c of Steamcraft. The error doesn't show up in single player (this is indeed on a server). Going through any other portal doesn't cause this error EXCEPT with the portal to inner earth (from the steamcraft mod), which got me the error and then I think killed the server when I logged back in...  
yes, doesnt help no matter if in inventory, in bag, in hotbar, directly adjacent to bag, ...

I won't do a PR because I don't know the code well enough to know it won't affect something else.  Thank you for the workaround!
In minecraft we have method ```world.getWorldTime()``` applies to world variable. In vanilla/forge it is return long value [0-24000). When world time gets 24000 this variable automaticly resets to 0. But when essentials installed on server, this variable do not resets to 0 by command or just when worldtime is 24000. It is increasing unlimited. It is bug, because we have also method ```world.getTotalWorldTime()``` which return overall time of world. But somehow with essentials this two methods works same. I checked it on my server build with all mods & plugins installed, when removing essetials - bug disappears.
Sure! Where can I send it? 
Philip, thank you for your time, and effort. It doesn't work in the Oculus Quest built-in Chrome browser either. Are you familiar with A-frame, please?
I don't know if there updated and mcpe version is 0.7.2 the mod I really want is the climbing mod 
That is, strange...  The log that was on Minecraft launcher when the game crashed showed something about Vengeance Spirit.

An encrypted one.  I've never tried it, but I think, in a "normal" backup, there aren't my old keys or? 
I'll give it a try. Setting up an empty server with FE as the only mod. 
@michaelschattgen  I can explain you. In many languages we have declension (something like grammar cases). For example in Polish language we have more than 1 plural forms. In English you have just 1 plural form: - 1 entry - 2 entries - 5 entries etc.  But for example in Polish language I need to prepare translations: - 1 wpis - 2 wpis**y** - 5 wpis**ów**  Please look again to link and see rules: https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/33/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#pl  Currently I can't prepare correct translations. Do you understand issue now?
I do also have two sources active (geocaching.com and opencaching.de). @rsudev exactly describes my scenario. 
I added a commit to my branch that should, in theory, test for this fix, but I can't seem to get it to work, and I'm not sure if it's my weak gradle skills, or what. 
Hi, thanks for the feedback. I finally found out the problem. Entries with a tag always appear at the top of the list in the 'float' mode, even if they do not fit the search. In the 'filter' mode they are not visible, which is more consistent. Thus it is not a bug but rather an annoying feature. In my view, tagged entries not fulfilling the search may appear first atop the grayed items, however not at the very top. 
Thx for your answer and the for fixing the bug in the next update.   I somehow missed the Tutorials part of the book and looked at the page for the importer. I am sure i can figure it out with this informations.
I see this issue on JellyBean 4.2.2 and below. I'll double check my implementation if you cannot reproduce.

@rbygrave thanks for the workaround, but a workaround isn't a fix. I would expect a stateless update to work with `CascadeType.ALL`. This bug is the reason why we are stuck with an older version of Ebeans, the newer versions are unusable for production due to this issue.  Note that a fix for this and another issue was proposed in https://github.com/ebean-orm/ebean/pull/1403, but was rejected due to refactoring work. The provided unit test shows that a proper solution never made it to `master`.
@TheAndroidMaster This happened in like the 5 first launches but now its gone, I have no idea why
I've retested with the most recent version (115) and that fixes the item duplication problem :) 
I've tested it with another dataset with ~270k entries that worked fine as well. The project is really big and many classes are involved, so I hope the adapter classes are enough for you:  **NitriteDB:** Constructing DB: ``` Nitrite db = Nitrite.builder().compressed() 			.filePath(storageDir + File.separatorChar + DB_FILE).openOrCreate(); NitriteCollection collection = db.getCollection(COLLECTION_NAME); this.collectionAccessor = new CollectionAccessor(db, collection); ``` CollectionAccessor.java: https://pastebin.com/N63681vg IteratorWrapper.java: https://pastebin.com/vpeXUMcE  **MVStore:** H2MVStoreMultiMap.java: https://pastebin.com/V8wsUXP2 IteratorWrapper is basically the same, without the document converting.
I'm using dbeaver 3.6.7 and postgresql 9.5.  I'll give you an example on how to reproduce my exact problem. 1. connect to a pg database 2. open new editor, this should by default have search_path=public, since no schema is selected as active. 3. run the following sql:  ``` create schema mytest; create table mytest.mytable (     id int ); ``` 1. close the editor 2. refresh the database (so that the new schema can be seen) 3. set the mytest schema as active 4. open a new editor 5. perform the following queries:    ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6532949/15281046/d62599e4-1b37-11e6-8a3a-863f6b8a7415.png)  as you can see the search_path is set to public only although I've created a new sql editor when a schema was set to active.

@itzikBraun   That hasn't fixed it. Now the sample app is crashing. All you seem to have done in the commit is not set the typeface and hence cause the Null Pointer Exception.  Is there more code that you meant to push? 
I tried the new code with the same result.  Do you want me upload my data file? 
I'll probably need to write a new detector. [This](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01518606/document) document explains the bug in part 2. Basically whenever an element stored in a sorted data structure is modified, it needs to be removed and added again, or the structure might break.

Right, I have no one counter entries... After adding counters the error has disappeared. I think we need zero-check and do warnings when trying to get read/write information.
@findepi , it is avro table and the nesting levels are 11. I will try with version 325.
Yes this appeared after migrating to 0.8.6. I guess it has to to with the fact, that the look of lumen changed with this release. Yep I also noticed this behavior.

No problems will do, just rebuilding the machine now but I'll run the same query and give you the log.  In regards to the disk, the server is a VM so it 'sees' an SSD with 200GB. Memory is 32GB with the heap and page-cache settings being left at defaults.  The query itself is:  MATCH (p:Post)<-[:attached]-(m:Meeting) RETURN p, m  Disk scheduler being used was deadline (saw a recommendation for a similar issue to use this scheduler). I'll post through the debug.log as soon as the machine is up and running.  Thanks!
When reading `ViewColumn`  from view  declared in 312, I see `row(.... , table varchar)`. When view is defined in 323+, it's `row(.... , "table" varchar)`. This makes a big difference when we use parser to get the type.

My modification take always the first result key word ("Résultat"). So, 2 solutions: - take local (replace List `ResultColumnNames.getAuthorizedNames()` by a Map ("fr", "Résultat" and "en", "result") and use get element by key (with local variable). - just switch "result" and "Résultat" and use always "result" (always "en" by default in SQL).  what do you think about it?

Yes Teleport anywhere, then move about 10-16 steps away from your current location using whatever randomly generated seed the world gave you. The crash isn't 100% guaranteed to happen, but when it does, you'll usually crash 1-3 more times upon logging back in and trying to move forward New crash log with only TFC installed: https://pastebin.com/kDMxjb2i 2nd crash log upon logging back in and attempting to move forward 1 block: https://pastebin.com/hYcLa6Ef
Hm, there must be something else influencing this. When I tried in a separate project, both methods are ok. But I've confirmed again it's broken when I mix it into my other project.  In both projects I'm attaching it in the application's `didFinishLaunching`. I'll keep looking into it from my side, though the selector option works just fine, should this ticket be closed for now?
From what I understand this affected all versions 1.8-1.12. ViaVersion wouldn't solve this problem since ViaVersion doesn't work that way, I'm already using 1.12.2 Spigot so obviously, there's nothing to inject there.

It happened first time when I was logged in just after I switched the C&B ketbind to something that was already bound. Just wanted to get it out of the way from another keybind I was using.  Second crash was when logging in. This was all client side crashes. Server was ok
The headline gives it away: "previous working version": 5.3.3 "newer not working version": 6.0.3
Not related, this is a problem on the frontend.  The same deployment works on Chromium. 
Gnome, and the DE is gala (elementaryOS) 
Ah yes, apologies. It's this here: https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/blob/master/ksql-intro/demo_ksql-intro.adoc
I tested it with the default skin and the problem didnt occur with it. 
> Please use our latest internal Buildozer build and change your Issue title to something specific we shall solve - one Issue for each problem, please.  As I mentioned before a few times I am not going to use buildozer as I prefer to compile it myself. Buildozer has few huge disadvantages which I also listed before...

I had time to report other issues to other repositories, I gather crashlogs, when I have several log files I browse them and report issues.  > @agilob, where do you get your Apps from?   AIMSICD compiled from development branch, I dont have any gapps on my phone, I use only Nlp for location service instead google one. All other apps are from fdroid or manually compiled. 
I use gradle 2.14.1 to compile/run ``` sourceCompatibility = 1.8 targetCompatibility = 1.8 [compileJava, javadoc, compileTestJava]*.options*.encoding = 'UTF-8' ``` java code ``` System.out.println(Charset.defaultCharset().name());  ==> return UTF-8 System.out.println(System.getProperty("file.encoding"));  ==> return UTF-8 System.out.println(URIBuilder.create("redis://10.16.179.14:6379"));  ==> return redis://10.16.179.14:6379 ```
I see. Waiting for the fix.

Same issue.  Sorry, I had also tested that, should have included in comment as well.  I have a test-project setup, just not sure where to upload it? I can great a public github repo if it helps? Is pretty straight forward though.
sorry I have no time now, I will write tomorrow necessarily 
that was realy fast! i just tried and seems like the new version is working fine, right now they are all spawning outside of the range, i dont have time to try spawners and everything right now, but if i find something else failing i will make a new report  thank you!  
Here is a link to a session with two networks.  One is called "How the network looks" and the other is "How it should look"  https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m74365hgamt2bb/example_session_bug216.cys?dl=0  Genesets that have significant and postivie NES values are showing up but if the same geneset has a negative NES in a different dataset the negative value is showing up in the pie heatmap chart.  If users have selected NES positive values only they there should be no negative values.
If you look at the end of the trace, I think the issue is that the starter uses Spring Boot DevTools, which uses a different classloader. So this is really more of a documentation bug in that sense
The problem began since updating the client to 1.4.26v10, it has never happened before.  I tested with Windswept Heat, and Kodama´s Reach.   The game indicates that i´m waiting for other player to pass priority back to me, meanwhile the other players report that they are waiting for me to search my library, but the window never opens.  Other detail seems to be that the log indicates that i began searching my library.  Tested this problem with some friends, and they have the same problem to.
Good morning Sebastien, ok, added as project into my fork.  Also added you as collaborator. Will this work, or do I have to create a pull request?  kind regards Patrick

You mean flip arguments to an operator? I tried something like that before, but I always cleared the variable cards when I was done with an experiment.
Nope, I can still reproduce :( 
I'm not sure where it should be .. 
in current `OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration` you can find:  ``` java     @Override     public void configure(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer endpoints)             throws Exception {         if (this.tokenStore != null) {             endpoints.tokenStore(this.tokenStore);         }         if (this.details.getAuthorizedGrantTypes().contains("password")) {             endpoints.authenticationManager(this.authenticationManager);         }     } ```  and it is missing setting `accessTokenConverter` like:  ``` java         if (this.accessTokenConverter!= null) {             endpoints.accessTokenConverter(accessTokenConverter());         } ``` 
Here's how to reproduce the error: I'm using Janusgraph 0.2.0 with berkeley db and the bundled version of elasticsearch in this example.  ``` mgmt = graph.openManagement() titleKey = mgmt.makePropertyKey('title').dataType(String.class).cardinality(LIST).make() nameKey = mgmt.makePropertyKey('name').dataType(String.class).cardinality(LIST).make() mgmt.buildIndex('searchIdx', Vertex.class).addKey(titleKey, Mapping.STRING.asParameter()).addKey(nameKey, Mapping.STRING.asParameter()).buildMixedIndex('search') mgmt.commit() graph.tx().commit() v = graph.addVertex('title', 'FirstVertex') graph.tx().commit() v.property('name', 'VertexName')  graph.tx().commit() ```  the gremlin console gives me this error:  ``` 09:22:46 ERROR org.janusgraph.diskstorage.es.rest.RestElasticSearchClient  - Failed to execute ES query: {type=illegal_argument_exception, reason=failed to execute script, caused_by={type=script_exception, reason=runtime error, script_stack=[ctx._source["name"].add("VertexName");,                    ^---- HERE], script=ctx._source["name"].add("VertexName");, lang=painless, caused_by={type=null_pointer_exception, reason=null}}} 09:22:46 ERROR org.janusgraph.diskstorage.es.ElasticSearchIndex  - Failed to execute bulk Elasticsearch mutation java.io.IOException: Failure(s) in Elasicsearch bulk request: [{type=illegal_argument_exception, reason=failed to execute script, caused_by={type=script_exception, reason=runtime error, script_stack=[ctx._source["name"].add("VertexName");,                    ^---- HERE], script=ctx._source["name"].add("VertexName");, lang=painless, caused_by={type=null_pointer_exception, reason=null}}}]  ```  And this is the error in the elasticsearch output:  ``` [2017-11-20T09:22:46,648][DEBUG][o.e.a.b.TransportShardBulkAction] [02U0yu4] [janusgraph_searchidx][2] failed to execute bulk item (update) BulkShardRequest [[janusgraph_searchidx][2]] containing [org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateRequest@21f63a26] java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: failed to execute script         at org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateHelper.executeScript(UpdateHelper.java:266) ~[elasticsearch-5.6.2.jar:5.6.2]         at org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateHelper.prepare(UpdateHelper.java:202) ~[elasticsearch-5.6.2.jar:5.6.2]         at org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateHelper.prepare(UpdateHelper.java:82) ~[elasticsearch-5.6.2.jar:5.6.2]         at org.elasticsearch.action.bulk.TransportShardBulkAction.executeUpdateRequest(TransportShardBulkAction.java:277)  […] Caused by: org.elasticsearch.script.ScriptException: runtime error         at org.elasticsearch.painless.PainlessScript.convertToScriptException(PainlessScript.java:101) ~[?:?]         at org.elasticsearch.painless.PainlessScript$Script.execute(ctx._source["name"].add("VertexName");:20) ~[?:?]         at org.elasticsearch.painless.ScriptImpl.run(ScriptImpl.java:133) ~[?:?]         at org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateHelper.executeScript(UpdateHelper.java:261) ~[elasticsearch-5.6.2.jar:5.6.2]         ... 28 more Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException         at org.elasticsearch.painless.DefBootstrap$PIC.fallback(DefBootstrap.java:202) ~[?:?]         at org.elasticsearch.painless.PainlessScript$Script.execute(ctx._source["name"].add("VertexName");:20) ~[?:?]         at org.elasticsearch.painless.ScriptImpl.run(ScriptImpl.java:133) ~[?:?]         at org.elasticsearch.action.update.UpdateHelper.executeScript(UpdateHelper.java:261) ~[elasticsearch-5.6.2.jar:5.6.2]         ... 28 more  ```
I'm not so sure if I understand the structure.   The problem is, if one POI already exists in one category, like the example above, it's not possible to find it in the other category. Both categories are defined in poi-mapping.xml, and one would suspect that if a POI fits a category, it would be contained, but only one category you can select in the UI ("restaurant" OR "alpine_hut") gets the POI as result.  One could work around by moving tags which are often combined in child categories, but this works only in a few cases.

> How do we read the intentions of he user, now?  From the import option "Import variable declarations" :-)  Additional Note: most of the imported COBOL code should actually look much cleaner if the variables are not imported as the variable name would (or should) be used as is `single_data` where with variable import activated the names will always be full qualified `single_record.single_data`.  I currently see only the three options:  * executable with variable import and full qualified names - this is what we have now * simple-as-possible with variable names as they are [+necessary conversions like `-` -> `_`] - this should be the result if no declarations are imported, only "simple" code would be executable (like accept numeric variable, do calculation and output) * variable import and clean looking code - by changing the Executor to be able to qualify the name from the record (would be quite cool ;-)

Thanks @agazzarini ...I don't know how I missed that version file.  Indeed setting it to the latest supported ES version worked.  I've been busy but am planning to open a separate issue with the report server.  I'll try to do that soon.  Also good to see you at Haystack, hope to see you again at future events!
I enabled expert mode. retry does not help.  just to be clear, the problem is only for pictures taken while the 'only upload on wifi' is selected. pictures taken with the 'only upload on wifi' not selected, are uploaded correctly while on wifi (but of course those get uploaded also when not in wifi...). FYI, I tried with/without charger,  restart the phone, pictures in SD/internal memory. the behavior is always the same.   the log is empty, not sure how I can help.  2017-08-22 2:02 GMT-07:00 Mario Đanić <notifications@github.com>:  > Sounds strange.

I use MSSQL.We also wondered why query passes without exceptions even if script is incorrect. The problem occured when we tried to create foreign key with wrong data type. Flyway ran patch, foreign key was not added to the table, but patch was marked as executed in schema_version table. Then I tried to use execute batch, because according to the spec  it throws BatchUpdateException (a subclass of SQLException) if one of the commands sent to the database fails to execute properly or attempts to return a result set. Further research showed that execute does not throw exception if first query in the patch ran successfully, as far as I see it happens if foreign key  problem occurs. Did you try to reproduce this bug adding new patch to flyway-samle project? 
Works fine. It works in HB if element is created not via HB API. See https://github.com/vaadin/hummingbird-demo/pull/206
     what field type did you have on the data in ES?  Most are keyword, but the source field is {"type":"text","analyzer":"analyzer_keyword","fielddata":true}      does that happen always on all fields or only on that single one?  I'm seeing it with every field I try. I first saw it with my top hosts widget, which is using source. If i do a 5 minute search and try doing quickvalues on various fields, all that I try will have random duplicate entries and the majority won't be sorted correctly.      is this reproducible at any time?  So far it is. 
When I query the tables separately i.e., do a select * from <table_name> then it shows the column descriptions for both tables and it even shows in table properties or column definition window whatever it is called. I have attached the debug-logs and a screen-shot.

@cvance Sorry, it is all info, that i received. I can't reproduce it, it occurred only one time only on that device.
Will try to get the Arduino code. or atleast the looping code.  on the android Side is exactly the same the only difference is   ``` ... public void onBluetoothDataReceived(byte[] bytes, String data) {                 //read the data coming in.                 Log.d("data: ", data); ... ```

Ah yes, it being ClassCacheTweaker makes a lot of sense since it is quite a hack.  I can confirm that removing it indeed fixes the problem. I'm on the latest version for both ClassCacheTweaker and TickProfiler, so a conflict does indeed still exist.  Thanks, nallar :)
Hi @mzelzoghbi, Thanks for investigation. In our case, we use a foreground service (that must have its own notification)(not really sure that there is a difference in this case). We are pretty sure that the problem is several processes because we started getting crash reports with this issue right after releasing an app version with the foreground service. It is 30 times more frequent than the next reason in our top crash reasons list.
Hi, following your comment at Play Store I redownloaded the app today, so yes, it's 1.6.  The abbreviations and numbers for my phone: Model: ALE-L21 Android: 5.0 EMUI 3.1  I guess the problem might be with the fact that Huawei P8's come preinstalled with EMUI add-on, but it's a wild guess. 
Yes, using a spawn egg on the spawner resulted in the same thing.  The spawner spawns one creature then reverts to the original spawn setting.

Hello, thank for your reply  I have upgraded to the version 3.5.7 and I have adjusted my timeout config   ```     @Bean     public RedissonClient redissonClient()     {         return Redisson.create(sentinelServers());     }      private Config baseConfig()     {         return new Config()                 .setNettyThreads(4)                 .setThreads(4)                 .setCodec(new JsonJacksonCodec(mapper()));     }      private Config sentinelServers()     {         final Config config = baseConfig();         config.useSentinelServers()                 .setConnectTimeout(3000)                 .setTimeout(10000)                 .addSentinelAddress(split(addresses, ", "))                 .setMasterName(masterName)                 .setPassword(password);         return config;     } ```  It's look a little bit better, I can't see anymore the "org.redisson.client.RedisException" but long time after the failover (15-20 minutes)  I still have many "org.redisson.client.RedisConnectionException" with the message  > RedisConnection@2122101942 [redisClient=[addr=redis://57.190.12.72:6399], channel=[id: 0xa05ade45, L:0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:53834 !

Thanks for the follow up @thomas-dee  I tested on Chrome, IE, Edge and Firefox: same result.  No idea if it is related but you must know that my jenkins setup has a tiny issue. I have this error message in Configuration pane: "It appears that your reverse proxy set up is broken."  It has no effect on my intense usage of jenkins though. My jenkins server is hosted on a Tomcat started on port 8443, then I use an iptable rule to connect external port 443 to internal 8443.
Users do not appear to be able to start workspaces inside or outside of an organisation. I tried on a completely new setup and connected to a different A.D. setup just incase but this is the same result.  The admin **can** start workspaces inside or outside of an organisation.  The only difference I can see is the users are LDAP users and the Che admin user is created on keycloak directly. I will create a user account on keycloak directly and see if this works for creating workspaces (but this will have to wait until tomorrow!)
Yeah it does
There's a newpipe.db database file and a newpipe.settings file

No I did nothing to the Manifest.MF and I believe I downloaded it from curse 
Yes, it was another plugin. Thank you. Could you also look at [this](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/bentobox/issues/297) issue? Its really annoying and problematic, when players are not fully added to island :/
I have not yet checked why exactly the CXF-Servlet is reading after the exception, it is used to provide a SOAP webservice and wants to convert all exceptions into a SOAP-fault to send to the client.  As to reproducing:  The first read throws the IllegalStateException for me as well but I do not get the following ones you posted, I use putty in RAW-Mode as "HTTP-Client" in my tests and there is one more detail I did not realize:  If I just paste the short invalid POST request and do nothing more I get a timeout after 30sec and all is fine, however if I send some more content afterwards (eg pressing ENTER) the threads starts looping and there is no more timeout. Even when the socket is closed there are no more exceptions.  I can also trigger this by sending a larger amount of data, my guess is that there has to be more data than some internal buffer-size (8k?) so that there is still something to read for the second call. 
We actually encountered this bug in a workshop where people had empty spacer columns; they would all have the same name (the empty string!)  People have the weirdest CSV files so we can't expect every file to be in the perfect format. It's more a question of how to handle this.  To solve this: - We could ignore the second column and simply not import them, although that seems rude. - We could add suffixes to the column names when we encounter them more than once (e.g. "2012a").

I'm using a Nexus 4 running Android 4.4.4. I haven't tested it with the sample apps yet, will try that and let you know if it happens there too. Thanks for the quick responses. 
> `pSync` was renamed to `mSync`  Which means that the test is totally broken now.... I would consider to fix it ASAP.  And yes, it would be good to add some regression logic to the test as well. But may be it should be a different ticket.
@maggiolo00 , I'm talking about the Web Front end to Orient DB, which you call Studio. In Studio there's a "Graph" tab, which allows one to visualize a graph returned by a query and also to manipulate it. In that view you can click on an verticy and get then click on a "link" icon which then allows you to connect an arrow (edge) to another verticy on the graph and by clicking on it. Once you click on the second verticy you get a dialog to choose the type of edge you want to create, then it asks you to enter rids for verticies, but it should already know which verticies I clicked on. This si not a question, its a bug in the UI.
I'm on Nougat.
Alright, sorry for the long delay. so I did some testing:  **1. Fortunately without any shaders and resourcepacks it works just fine.**  **_NO RESOURCEPACKS_** 2.

No matter. 
No, I do not know what else to say @bl4ckscor3 
Well, the name is "browser" and it's not helping because I can't find an apk somewhere. I can send you a backup version of mine but it's not a great thing to do...  I don't know if default apps use a custom share button or not... but other apps I use are in (like skype, kde connect, ...), so Shaarlier shoud work too. 
Both notepad and word-pad give me only blank characters, no text. What do you use to open them? 
I mean a sticky header (apparently a bit too sticky :)) 
I've found out that `app:recyclerView="@+id/recyclerView"` attribute in `com.turingtechnologies.materialscrollbar.DragScrollBar` is the cause of the error. It might work well in an Activity of only 1 RecyclerView with id `recyclerView`. However, in an Activity with multiple fragments of which each fragment contains RecyclerView with the same ids, `DragScrollBar` could not determine which RecyclerView to bind.  My immediate solution is to give unique id to the particular RecyclerView with `DragScrollBar`. 
Yes, they destroying arena blocks 
Hi @NoNews,  I mean, scenario: the app is showing the permission request dialog to the user and, in this moment, the user clicks the button in the middle (https://i.stack.imgur.com/RPdkA.png) to move the app to background. If the user moves the app back to foreground (by clicking the third button), the dialog does not show again (as would be expected) and the onResume executes method onRequestPermissionsResult passing an empty array. Current NoPermission code moves the flow to the onSuccess Runnable and allows the user to pass without having accepted the permission.  Later I paste some code at home.
When I look at the logs I get the following table create in the first case:  ``` CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messagesync.messages_by_user (jid text, msgId timeuuid,  PRIMARY KEY(jid,msgId)) ```  but the create in the second case produces:  ``` CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messagesync.messages_by_conversation (msgId timeuuid,  PRIMARY KEY(msgId)) ```  the first field in the compont key definition is not added as part of the table

Stephan- thanks for so many good suggestions so quickly! I will definitely try those breakpoints. At the moment, the EAR is working perfectly (of course!), so I will have to wait until it fails again. As to EAR- Tom's project is a WAR and he is seeing the same behavior, so I don't think it's likely to be a packaging issue.   One other thing I do notice is that when the app is failing, the screen comes back very very fast. Much faster than when it is working correctly. The difference is only a second or two, but it seems like the speed may be because the renderer is skipping things. Just one more piece of the puzzle to mull over... Thanks again!!
Im using [this](http://mods.curse.com/modpacks/minecraft/241720-enlight) modpack... Last time I checked, curse didn't show any updates. I can look up the version later... 
You can give a lamp object a wire by right clicking it. This won't cause the block to update if the only wire is another lamp with a wire in it, the two won't connect. It works fine if you feed it wire next to an ordinary cable on the ground because the other cable block updates the lamp but if the other cable is a lamp with a phantom wire, neither will connect.

Thanks @vietj for getting back quickly, I shall upgrade and test. Will let you know the result shortly.  EDIT: Yes, it's executed by a worker verticle
Yes, I have auto upload on both. I want to have them both, as idea is to test beta. No point in testing beta, if I turn off auto upload:) What is annoying me is this error message. Maybe I am wrong, but I am hoping if we can backoff for the time of upload, we can avoid this error message (never sure if it is real error, or locking error). Other options that came to my mind is: * can we delay beta version for 15min/2 during scheduling (scheduleFilesSyncIfNeeded), so jobs are "somewhat" interleaved? Using setExact() maybe? Or just checking inside job if we are started on round number of minutes (00,15,30,45 for prod, 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5 for beta) and sleep a bit. I am not expert on any of this, so I might be very wrong:) * why tryLock cannot take shared lock? I don't see need for exclusive lock, if we are just reading/uploading file? I guess, if lock can be promoted to shared, we can have multiple jobs work on it:)
i thought i pasted pastebin link here.. wait lol
Just use the flexiblelogin-0.17.3
OpenJDK 8. I will, thanks ^^ 
At least the BlueMana(1) part is a call to a method that returns a Mana object. https://github.com/magefree/mage/blob/master/Mage/src/mage/Mana.java Names were defined a long time ago and they are ok in my opinion. 
Oh, I've using this module many weeks now, and I miss this things: - When [we fail a catch](http://i.imgur.com/suWV1xp.png) or [the mon flees](http://i.imgur.com/KQfA1lH.png), show the percentage of the probability we had of that to happen. - Show the IVs inside circles, [using this Unicodes](http://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_2460.html). That makes the IVs more visible and uses a lot less characters. - Grade perfection: Add a format to sum up the IV percentage to a letter. (A:100%-91%, B:89%-80%...) Example of the last two features: [Snorlax](http://i.imgur.com/7veyqoV.png), [Pokemon GO direct MitM](http://i.imgur.com/FFilOCz.png) - Show Pokéstop spin information & number of items in bag. Useful to see the chain Pokéstop you are, and to check the items when you spin and exit the stop too fast and it seems that failed. [Heads-up notification](http://i.imgur.com/eMY6qI3.png), [notification](http://i.imgur.com/Rl7APXP.png). - When an egg is hatched, show info about the mon hatched (name, CP, IV, candies and dust received), even when the hatch animation has not played yet. - Gym info. PoGoIV did this with a scrollable notification when you entered a gim, with CP, moves and IV of each mon. - Not related to the other modules, because this feature is exclusive of this one, but if you have the **Enable dismiss notifications** enabled, the notification dismiss immediately, as intended. I would like the notification to be dismissed when the animation ends, because when I'm waiting to end I like to see the stats of what I just catched. Maybe adding some delay to dismiss it?  Here you have the GitHubs of the another modules, maybe you can cherrypick stuff from there: [PoGoIV](https://github.com/chuparCh0pper/PoGoIV_xposed) and [Pokemon GO direct MitM](https://github.com/ELynx/pokemon-go-xposed-mitm).

I'm in process to find witch mod it is and in half of disabled mod is something which did the water bug. But the fire is still there. 
The 1.0.2 version have fixed the issue.  Thanks!

It happens when the server stops, my script was very small when this happened, and I modified it alot from then. This error happens Randomly and doesn't seem to be compared with what ever script I have.
Most likely not before next week, in the meantime you can disable the Display Stand, this should allow you to start without crashing. 
Java 9.0.1 ![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20823126/37045438-fd760078-2176-11e8-9e09-f96bea5ed53c.png) Message: "Not a valid window handle."
Yeah **Optifine** was the issue! Thanks a lot you just saved me. _You can close the case....._   
Hi, sorry for the delay.  Clicking true or false on the types I mentioned don't work all the time, but I haven't been able to determine the pattern in which they work or don't work. Additionally, I have noticed these errors in console:  [SEVERE] Could not pass event InventoryClickEvent to EchoPet v2.0.5 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -999   [SEVERE] Could not pass event CreatureSpawnEvent to Prism v1.6.3 java.lang.ClassCastException: com.github.dsh105.echopet.entity.pet.CraftPet cannot be cast to org.bukkit.entity.Sheep  I am running build #2020.  Thanks. 
OK, yeah I think it would be useful. I will try to fix at some point - probably not for a few days.
It used to be implemented here: https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/blob/develop/plugins/de.ovgu.featureide.core/src/de/ovgu/featureide/core/internal/FeatureProject.java  @skrieter Was this functionality moved to the feature model analyzer?
I don't know whether it will be better or even possible if we are talking about codding, but I think it would be correct if blue crystals would only drops from mature plants, because this is the only way we "create" something new. So, maybe, it will be even easier to implement.

Ok, i write code for functions some of these days. 
yes just did same in the version **0.12.0** got `localhost` and in **0.13.3** got `${HOST:localhost}`
@eivantsov  i am using bellow command to run Che instance.  sudo docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \       -e CHE_ASSEMBLY=/home/alethea/che/assembly/assembly-main/target/eclipse-che-5.0.0-SNAPSHOT/eclipse-che-5.0.0-SNAPSHOT eclipse/che-launcher start  **syntax** sudo docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \       -e CHE_ASSEMBLY=<path to che local binaries> eclipse/che-launcher start  How can i check whether service is deployed as agent or ws-master? 
dennisoelkers: sure, next time it hangs I'll produce the stack dumps and send them here. Thanks for your time ;-) 
yes, I have already build the libbridge.so, and put it into the bin directary
The weekly release seems fine on Windows. I did notice that I when I tried it on my Mac for work, the graphics were displayed a bit oddly.  ![zap_weekly_mac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22101253/31105035-d45cf24c-a795-11e7-8820-27cf090e9b53.png) 
Yes, this Issue still persists with WIP-Internal v0.1.24-alpha-b6. And maybe it's because I switched from Dalvik to ART-runtine, but AFAIK the next Android "L" will be ART only. 
@rpappalax It's more related to the Android version of the device rather than the actual device, as I've mentioned, Android 8 and Android 9 devices do not seem to be affected by this issue, only managed to reproduce it on devices with Android version < 8.
Hmmm, it doesn't occur anymore or atm. So I will close it for now. I'll have an eye on it though and reopen in case it happens again. 
The latest, version 1.1.2 
I will try that later then (currently at school) 
I can confirm it is still happening in latest build (2.15.0.1): http://prntscr.com/j3iptz
Yes. I don't know exactly what mod does it (no special mods installed for it). I tried to reproduce it on new map by just emptying oil bucket in nether. But it just exploded. Seems that oil generated in nether somehow o_O I know it is nether because crash can be reproduced on spoiled map by entering nether portal 
well it didn’t work and I was doing it right but it seemed to fix itself when I overloaded my game with other mods.so it kind’ove works only the food doesn't go down in the feeder still also my velocorapters keep spawning out of the cage.

Ahh, I had just checked that branch out after posting this. My confusion was in knowing what methods were fired after a screen orientation change occurred. I'll check out those libs and look over the v3 branch sometime today/tomorrow.  Happy holidays! 
thanks relay.  I try flv and mp3 not crash.  recorder2.setFormat("flv"); recorder2.setFormat("mp3");  sadly, only hls is crash @saudet 
Hi terrymanu,  It's 4.0.0. I just cloned the master branch. As mentioned, only _select_ statements can be performed.  Thanks, Parsa
@yegor256 I'm not ready now to answer that question. Let's return to this when I have the answer.
Thanks @timpokorny , The locale is English (United States).  I just want to emphasize that if I added portico to the class path, serviceloader works fine.
I only used the following lines of code to set webLaF:  `WebLookAndFeel.install(); WebLookAndFeel.setDecorateAllWindows(true);`  in try-catch block before my showing the ui by-  `new TestMyUI().setVisible(this);`  Edit: After looking at the propertise from palette, I can see the opaque of my JFrame in UI is checked so it is set to `true`. You are pointing at that, right? 
Which tool: diamond knife. Enchantements: 32 redstone + 12 lapis + 3 obsidian + 16 sugar (I don't remember... worst memory ever). Singleplayer. Diamond knife in the center, required items around (like it was show). 
i just placed the autoworkbench, so there was no initial recipe. will try to make a setup with only buildcraft.

@tasiek Nice, it's good to know the root of the problem. Could yo help me? By providing me a link to the TV App 1.4 release's source code, just to try to fix it by my self, I've been modifying the latests development versiones but they're crashing randomnly. I'd like to try the last release version. Thanks 
latest (0.3.3) 
java version "1.8.0_60" 
You're right. In a hurry to finish this along with other stuff and didn't give relevant info:  * Environment: Ubuntu 16.04, three kafka clusters connected * Local version (non-docker) * Java version... ``` :~# dpkg -l | grep jdk ii  adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot               11.0.3+7-1                                 amd64        OpenJDK Development Kit 11 (JDK) by AdoptOpenJDK ``` * KafkaHQ version: 0.8.0  And it appears to begin after I use the UI once or twice.

@Tora-B Apologies, first time using github for this purpose. The issue is that after the initial death loop, the server was attempting to synchronize hundreds of times a second with that player, even after a full reboot, and managing to get the player out of the Dimension. This persisted from the time the player logged in after a server reboot, until a crash or hard Kill command. The server, as a result, was hitting upwards of 200% CPU usage, making it unplayable for all other players.   @Electroblob77 I'm afraid the log was nothing but thousands upon thousands of lines of "[Server] Server thread/INFO [ebwizardry]: Synchronising spell emitters for Playername" with no variation. I honestly wish I had more information for you.   A solution was found, however much less than ideal, in deleting the player's playerdata from the server.
@snicoll please see my demo https://github.com/brucelwl/demo You just need to run the main method and look at `spring-configuration-metadata.json` in the `target` directory, There are two descriptions of `my.application.architecture`

@alexanderhudym issue updated
Can't reproduce. Thanks @intrications  
Good to hear. No problem at the meantime I use those without WITH_ACK_RECEIPT. But although without such ack, if I send it with RELIABLE, I have no need and it's alright to operate with _WITH_ACK_RECEIPT if I don't do anything after another end ACK back?  On a side, could you please point me out to JRakNet documentation? I can find only simple demo code that client/server connects with each other but not send/receive any packets. I might miss something. Thank you Marf!
Yes, it works nicely now. 
Yes
I downloaded it from the official Site https://cryptomator.org/. And i checked the sha256 Hashcodes, its all correct. 
Sure, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13109154/41300680-575e9366-6e34-11e8-9c21-8a02475f1a3a.png)  I don't see any errors (now) in Graylog, should I remove and re-add to dashboard tosee if I get any errors? At no point I do see errors in the browser.  An interesting note: If I select time period of 1 day, I see all entries including the top most (top 5 values instead of top 200) 7 day or 30 day time period and the top entry is missing, (top 4 values)  Thanks 
Hello, if I have the latest version (1.0.0) and the same happens every time I open eclipse and when I finish working on eclipse and close it, the discord status and the eclipse process remain open in the task manager in windows 7 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17212107/48917813-7eba9780-ee67-11e8-9785-5bd9376580cf.png) 
DavDroid doesn't support VTODO right now. the caldav sync adapter that I linked does support VTODO..so let's start with this adapter and perhaps implement the DavDroid version when/if they added VTODO/VJOURNAL support in a future version...I'd love to help out but I'm currently writing my second Bachelor thesis and am drowned in work...So no time for the time being (october and november) 
No, go for it! I made another slight modification to the script since it wasn't showing the last item in certain cases. However, I've noticed that the RTL stuff is still broken, particularly on larger screens and I haven't yet been able to determine why. 
Basically i am getting this for my Spring related tests. I have defined one step def as below- @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:spring/api/application-context.xml") public class SpringSystemTestSteps {     @Before     public void SetupCucumberSpringContext() {         //dummy method so cucumber will recognize this class as glue         //and use its context configuration     }  }  The other step definitions doesn't have the - @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:spring/api/application-context.xml") defined anymore. Its just the tests. I am getting this error.  I also have other stepdefinitions where Before and After hooks defined for all step defs. This error is even present there.  Please let me know, if i need to do something different now.  
I debugged the code. No matter if I write `write*` or `write+`, the state machines are the same and match the pattern `write+` and not `write*`, see output below ``` Name: 2 (accepting) Name: -1 Name: 1 Name: 0 Left: -1 ====[java.io.FileOutputStream.FileOutputStream( file);]====> Right:0 Left: 0 ====[java.io.FileOutputStream.write( _);]====> Right:1 Left: 1 ====[java.io.FileOutputStream.write( _);]====> Right:1 Left: 1 ====[java.io.FileOutputStream.close();]====> Right:2 ```

Hi Danesfeder, Thanks for your response.  Are you asking to provide you error logs with simulation enabled?  Also, just want to inform you that this issue has been reported by client and I don't have Samsung Galaxy >= S8 device. In rest of the devices functionality works as aspected.  So it would be great if you test on that device please.  Thank you. 
> Maybe the http session should not be taken from the context, but as a spring mvc parameter on the function with the RequestMapping?  But it's a Jeeves service, so I don't think we can have it as function parameter. Is there any difference between the context.getUserSession().getsHttpSession() and the session set as function parameter in a spring service ? 
@Fabrice-TIERCELIN I am using the AutoRefactor plugin from the command line (https://github.com/cal101/AutoRefactor). I added support for delta debugging https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/dd/. This reduces test cases but that does destroy formatting. Everything is done from the command line withoud the eclipse GUI involved. What I need is some CODE snippet how to call the eclipse API to do formatting. 
Using EnderIO 2.2.6.317 and Forge 1277, and v1.14 of Ex Astris (which has this method incorrectly returning null in the Auto Hammer). Hoppers, transfer pipes etc will not insert, but EnderIO conduits will.  What I expect (admittedly without searching too deeply) is that the conduit is checking canInsertItem, but not isItemValidForSlot (as this is what I was doing in Ex Astris).  It actually appears as though the Filing Cabinet thing is not the fault of EnderIO, so ignore that one.

FYI @keithc-ca:  /usr/bin/make -w -j8 --jobserver-auth=5,6 -C omr 
Yep, documentation is in place. I tested with both scripted routes and MVC (both in Kotlin). The problem is present in both.
Thanks to Rogério for trying to reproduce. A `SUPER<GENERIC>` example is `HashMap<Object,Collection<Object>[][]>`. In order to simplify regression reproducing & any fix verification, here's a simplified Test Case and could you remove "could not reproduce" tag please:  ``` public class Regression {   @Test  //  jUnit 4.12   public void works1_24() {     new MockUp<HashMap<Object,Collection<Object>[][]>>(){};   } } ``` 
URL will keep changing, this is not fixed element, different client will use different urls. URL is where client has installed Faveo online. This is not something we can control or know off 
"oll" works :)
@qwerty4030 the parsing happens on the coordinating node (the node that receives the request from the client) but `Aggregator`s are created on the shard so we can't create the `Aggregator`s during the parsing phase and perform the validation with them. I think we will need to create code to do the validation using the `AggregatorBuilder` objects instead since this is what we have available on the coordinating node at parse time.  As for the discrepancy between order in the terms aggregation and the histogram aggregations, it would be nice to have them consistent. Maybe we could have both use the same `Order` classes rather than having separate implementations but I fear that this will be fairly tricky. 
Enabling Material Design Components does fix the issue. But I'm not a fan of MD in general. I installed the plugin just for the darker theme.

``` #include "includes\enterprisekassa.hpp" // Comment/Comment ``` @kayler-renslow  I made sure to include it in the screenshot. It contains another "/" in the comment, my guess is it's that. Screenshot shows a breakpoint and selected line.
@tobiasKaminsky Thank you for your reply! I use Swift as my owncloud primary back-end storage while demo account uses Database. I test it works when using Database.  
It looks like it is fixed now.
Nope. If you looked this up in your log - I'm currently in heavy development, so the server restarts are very often.
well a solution may be to use ONE variable witch is increased until you find the first letter and the index of the number of letter matched is > 0 (in my example the first value should be the index 2). That way we keep track of where it COULD start the next recursive sequence. if the match fail, instead of continuing from the current position, as you do now, you'll have to fall back to that stored value.  do you like it?i'm planning to write down some code when i'll have time  whoops, seems like we don't have a way to call a reset on the stream, or to do a peek() of multiple position.  In that case a buffer is the solution, start to save it when you would had set the possible start of recursive sequence. 
Ok downloaded 0.17.4  -  Going to try it later when I get home. I was using the previous version 
With updated library version I was still unable to enter date manually. There were no visible changes to keyboard. Only numbers, delete and done buttons.  Material Library version: 1.2.0-alpha04 
I"m not sure what you need - I included the error message I got back.  I'll add the statements used to create the objects, is that what you mean?

Change `UfsSyncPathCache` to a map from <path, isRecursive> to timestamp. We only record the top level path in the cache, and during file access time, we check if its parent, its parent of parent ... has been recursively synced in the last time interval. This add some overhead in file access time. >  > We are still debating which route to take to improve this. > @liuzx32 will let you know as soon as we decide and have a fix for this.  @yuzhu I think that it's a problem about the longest prefix match, and only cache the parent dir can solve the last time interval case. Only cache dir not every recursive files can also save memory for master. 
@MineSAT  Well it started happening after I updated authme. What do you mean by "Spawn server"? There are many diverse spawns.

Here is [`--debug`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/patrykpoborca/0917881a92bb77957b3bdf03b681e4c2/raw/4222523a1145994e3a0809535c3e4bad56c8a7b9/log.txt) and here is the [`--stacktrace`](https://gist.github.com/patrykpoborca/30fa5c53f0cbe760e576509d5fbfb68f) and here is [`--info`](https://gist.github.com/patrykpoborca/eacc30253038ea4ae4c09835431afe73)  Can APT write into the generated files of a library module that doesn't have that APT running though? And if not, is there a way to get around it? 
### Clarification  Ah, sorry let me clarify. So when I generate and run tests either with  - Intellij w/ default coverage reporting and the EvoSuite plugin  or by - Generating tests using [evosuite-1.0.3.jar](https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite/releases/download/v1.0.3/evosuite-1.0.3.jar) and running Maven w/ cobertura: `mvn cobertura:cobertura`  It gives me 0% when such an empty test case is in the suite.  ---  ### Versions  **Intellij Idea Ultimate Edition**  ``` IntelliJ IDEA 2016.1 Build #IU-145.258, built on March 17, 2016 JRE: 1.8.0_40-release-b132 x86_64 JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o ```  **EvoSuite 1.0.3** using [evosuite-1.0.3.jar](https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite/releases/download/v1.0.3/evosuite-1.0.3.jar) 
Correct, after opening via the widget 
It was working in a earlier version of the private "modpack", but now it isn't: http://imgur.com/a/sRNiJ I will try it with less mods. 
Latest 1.10 version from Curse Forge. 
There is, but I'll need to revisit to remember what it was...  
I did actually. Now that you mention it. From 1387 to 1388, which completely removed the edited .jar file after installing forge prior 1387. As in there's no .jar anymore.   Guess it's back to 1387 again. 
Definitely the latter - I had a 'wound slaver' with 28 burn who just wasn't taking damage or having it tick down
How can i check if i am using the native Google Keyboard? Yesterday I installed GPS Logger in three different smartphones (sony & samsung). I could delete alphanumeric characters, but backspace didn't work when found special chars (% : /) from variables and protocol (http://). Finally I wrote the URL in another app, I copied the URL and pasted in GPS Logger.  Now, in the original phone I tried to select all text and write something, it worked fine, but same problem with backspace key and the new text.

made some tests today, probably it's my fault how to reproduce it 1 in creative gamemode create a new portal far away from the first and go in 2 hold "w" to run forward while loading(as you are in creative mode you will immediately tp) so after appiring in overworld, befor all chunks normaly loaded, you will tp back to Betweenlands(continue holding "w") after tp back to overworld this happening ![2017-12-19_15 58 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34198111/34160479-cd974ab6-e4d5-11e7-8b81-f6a174df3727.png) ![2017-12-19_16 09 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34198111/34161222-9cacd5c6-e4d8-11e7-877d-c62459d294f1.png)  maybe need to make a bit more tests, but you should turn on delay between tp in creative mode  ps few time after tp to overworld, i appeared without "portal tree" once in ocean and second in forest(probably because"the space is not large enough")
@paulKra Sure, go ahead! I haven't started this yet. Let me know if you have any questions.

recreate is a method from Android Framework  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#recreate%28%29
"9 von 10 Zeichen" (bottom right, depending on maxlength and number of inputted characters) 
Yes it does. I was able to open the same in a browser.

As said with 0.90.0 this never happens ... I use graylog2 0.91.1 with no special configuration ... just untar, launch and start a gelf http input...   Those are the same messages with different ids ... every message I sent is marked with an incremental value ... both of them have the 85950 value but different ids ...  
what about Sounds? 
No render bounds
methodName_args are the defaults as defined in the thrift file, right? That's mainly for programming convenience, and especially for supporting optional parameters but not useful for populating a debug form I think - for example, imagine a user_id field, no one's going to put a default user id in the thrift file.

I am running a modified version of the code (only change is DATALIMIT = 32768 instead of DATALIMIT = 8192) so that I can perform a 100*100 matrix multiplication. The program runs correctly in the graphical version but because it takes about 5 hours to complete execution and allocates more than 3GB of RAM I was trying to get the CLI version to work. I am attaching the program in this post [naive.zip](https://github.com/lupino3/edumips64/files/4064129/naive.zip)  
i'll get one up for you.

@greenrobot Yes, it is reproducible. And objectbox version is v1.3.4. More info:  1. I have delete my default.json file by mistake at first. 2. The objectbox rebuild default.json file, but its IDs also reset, so I follow steps （https://docs.objectbox.io/advanced/meta-model-ids-and-uids）to increase IDs and test it to upgrade my recent app, the result is OK.  3. But some app users report that it would crash when upgrade app, the logcat show me that nativeCreate crash.
Hello @danglotb ,  There has been in those past 2 weeks lots of updates on Sat4j, you should use this version to reproduce the issue:  https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j/tree/ec652dcd90e7277ff373ad073bed9fffa556d867 This is the state of the project at the time I did my experimentation.  Thanks for your help.
You mean that the extension will not work with all the recent eclipse che versions, right? So only with 4.0.0-RCs (4.0.0-RC4-SNAPSHOT being the last commit on this repo) ? Are the releases versions synchronized?

updated to include that (I'd thought It obvious with the Forge version.)
I've found a work around for the issue by not registering the gpdsc files to fGeneratedPacks unless it actually exist. This will also solve the issue with the listener which then is activated when the .gpdsc actually exist on disc. However, saving the rteconfig before the gpdsc will leave the GUI red for the CubeOption until a new selection event occurs. For this I've found no solution.
This is a dup of #85 and we've got some work on this integrated already for the next beta
@adrianmo I'm trying to deploy on PKS w/ NSX-T, and the LoadBalancer Services are not getting external IPs for some reason (I suspect it to be a separate non-related PKS issue).  
confirmed. Can we change that so that we can sort by any of the rank files available.  Use case: a geneset is significant in one dataset and not significant in another but very close.  Might want to compare the ranked list of the two datasets to see how they differ.
I didn't disable anything from Evilcraft.  I have a mod that lets you change the vanilla ender chest into a color coded ender chest. But it changes nothing of the recipe, and is done by shift right clicking with an Item on the chest.  I think I have no mod, which changes potions, but i'm not 100% sure of that. 
6.1.5 from https://dbeaver.io/files/ea seems to have solved the problem!

@RunsWithShovels   5 minutes ago. Same error. 
I also added the legacy permission (authme.unregister false) to try and see if it was because of this.  About the debug perm:  https://i.imgur.com/gUg225e.png  The perm is negated in the default group (and the player was in the default group).  Do you think this is a bug with LuckPerms?  Thanks.
Yes I agree, but I see in the example at https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/handcraft.html, which I report here: In [127]: input_ = {    .....:     'fulfillment': output['condition']['details'],    .....:     'fulfills': {    .....:         'output_index': output_index,    .....:         'transaction_id': signed_car_creation_tx['id'],    .....:     },    .....:     'owners_before': output['public_keys'],    .....: }    .....:  Or perhaps is my misunderstanding.

Thanks for looking into it @rohanKanojia, I'll double check soon, when I have a moment.
We try without parameters and we catch the exception above. We don't try it with valid args, only with null args. @csokol told us that this was working without parameters. 
My mistake; I've corrected the bug report. 
 Sorry just saw this. I will try to get you some.  
I'm sorry, no. I'm pretty new to xmage. I got dumped from the game very quickly so maybe I missed a detail, I could be wrong about this. Appreciate you following up though!

@skabashnyuk  Yes i am using 5.4.0-SNAPSHOT. I can get the full log to you once i get back to my dev machine
Thanks for your answer! Now I know how to get thread dump so I cann't reproduce this permanent behavior as it was before. Tomorrow I will try to reproduce it on Windows. On Windows behavior is same as that on Linux but on Windows system sends information about crash to Microsoft after I close the DBeaver window by click to Window Close button.
I can't. Because it was an immediate situation. So, I changed the iap package. Now there are no crashes in +3k users. But, thank you. I will try it in my next project.
Yes, I still get bug reports on this one. Look at the stack trace on first post. It is a IllegalStateException.

I'm not sure now, I don't get it yet, but it seems like HaxeReferenceExpression, has bindToElement, which create new reference to file/package, not sure about class  I think it might be close, basically it changes reference to point to certain file or package, but should it do it for class

Thank you very much my friend. I will check it out and if there are any further issues I will let ya know :D 
Nope it doesn't work even using the jar manually.  The problem is that when the **TaskManager** has the focus it doesn't work , but when it is unfocused then it works .  ---  Example code:  ``` import org.jnativehook.GlobalScreen; import org.jnativehook.NativeHookException; import org.jnativehook.keyboard.NativeKeyEvent; import org.jnativehook.keyboard.NativeKeyListener;  public class GlobalKeyListenerExample implements NativeKeyListener {          public void nativeKeyPressed(NativeKeyEvent e) {         System.out.println("Key Pressed: " + NativeKeyEvent.getKeyText(e.getKeyCode()));       }      public void nativeKeyReleased(NativeKeyEvent e) {         System.out.println("Key Released: " + NativeKeyEvent.getKeyText(e.getKeyCode()));     }      public void nativeKeyTyped(NativeKeyEvent e) {         System.out.println("Key Typed: " + NativeKeyEvent.getKeyText(e.getKeyCode()));     }           public static void main(String[] args) {         try {             GlobalScreen.registerNativeHook();         }         catch (NativeHookException ex) {             System.err.println("There was a problem registering the native hook.");             System.err.println(ex.getMessage());              System.exit(1);         }          GlobalScreen.addNativeKeyListener(new GlobalKeyListenerExample());     } } ```
Hi Nick, I get this with any dataset we've tried; different base layer, different POI data, even no POI data present at all but a couple of forms/points already surveyed. But for example, try https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx3_hrMYdNwLY3VGaXZrOVRwUDQ 
It happened with quite a few of my schematics. Here's one of them where it occurred. https://www.dropbox.com/s/1rm2r10s18gzhvr/tdm_1.schematic?dl=0  Error occurs on both paste and redo. 
Great idea. I'd love to add APIs to HeldCertificate to encode and decode so this doesn't feel one-off.  The manual decoding for this gist was unpleasant.  https://gist.github.com/swankjesse/589e3e1c4a566e4a9aaec66f0f3a6223
I tried **Java 1.7 (update 60) 32bit** and **64bit**, **Java 1.8 (update 5) 64bit** and it's same behavior on all of them, _none of them works correctly_.   I spend few hours by debugging JDK and WebLaF code and I manage to narrow down the problem.  When propertyChange listener is called `line 251 WebFileChooserUI class` and condition `prop.equals ( JFileChooser.ACCEPT_ALL_FILE_FILTER_USED_CHANGED_PROPERTY )` is fulfilled then `filter` and `filters` values are obtained.  `filter` value contains **selected filter** (`setFileFilter` method) and `filters` contains **choosable filters**. Then the method evaluate `colected` filters and set them to the dialog (if none found, accept all file filter is set as default). **That's completely fine**.  But, there is difference in creation of `JFileChooser` with WebLaF installed and `WebFileChooser` itself.   When `JFileChooser` is created, it's called its own method `updateUI()` which on `line 1838` calls   ``` Java if(isAcceptAllFileFilterUsed()) {     addChoosableFileFilter(getAcceptAllFileFilter()); } ```  and adds accept all file filter as **choosable** file **filter** (that means, when property change listener is called the accept all file filter will be in `filters` variable).   When `WebFileChooser` is created, `updateUI()` method on `line 302 WebFileChooser class` is called, and this method creates `WebFileChooserUI` instance, which creates `WebFileChoosePanel` on `line 109 WebFileChooserUI class` and this class on `line 306 WebFileChooserPanel class` call method `setFileFilter()`. This method though sets accept all files filter as file **filter not as choosable** file **filter**.    Then property change listener contains accept all files filter in `filter` variable (instead of `filters`) and acts differently :smiley:   
The command that I run was the following:  docker run -it -e CHE_MULTIUSER=true -e CHE_HOST=${EXTERNAL_IP} -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ~/.che-multiuser:/data eclipse/che start

Hi again :) It's a testnet. I slightly modified your code and truncated the number to fit the ushort - changed this.setRefBlockNum(UShort.valueOf(blockId.getNumberFromHash())) to this.setRefBlockNum(UShort.valueOf(blockId.getNumberFromHash() & 0xffff)) and it works, but I don't know, if it is a legitimate :)

Yes @jeremylong   sorry for the delay  [package.zip](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/files/4152640/package.zip) 
Hi.  I m unable to recollect exactly what the errors where. But it was something like this:  Cannot create home/(username)/.local/...../(filename).(extension) No such file of directory.  I think, in the script, you would have written where the files have to be copied relative to the current directory from where the ./install.sh was run. This caused an error(Maybe my system problem) as it couldn't 'cd' into proper directories and copy the main files  On Mon, May 28, 2018, 6:07 PM Matthijs Kooijman <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Can you please be more explicit what errors you are seeing?

Yes, it can work. But it seem that it just write one vcf to another vcf without any change. So does it mean maybe it is the problem of my pedigree-file?
``` @Configuration public class ConsumerConfig {      @Bean     RSocket rSocket() {         return RSocketFactory                 .connect()                 .dataMimeType(MimeTypeUtils.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)                 .frameDecoder(PayloadDecoder.ZERO_COPY)                 .transport(TcpClientTransport.create(7000))                 .start()                 .block();     }      @Bean     RSocketRequester rSocketRequester() {         return RSocketRequester.wrap(this.rSocket(), MimeTypeUtils.APPLICATION_JSON, MimeTypeUtils.APPLICATION_JSON, RSocketStrategies.builder().build());     } } ``` @rstoyanchev   what do you mean ?this is my configuration   is`s not error
I checked and there is nothing in the "Regular Expression Pattern Remover" configuration. I also did some further testing.  The script appears to run fine when I send it to the machine.  It is only when I attempt to test the code using the $C option that I get the errors.  Usually it is either error code 20 or error code 1. (see below) The UGS program then hangs up and I have to disconnect and reconnect to the router to get the UGS program to respond again. The problem does not always occur at the same place in the code, and (rarely, perhaps once or twice) the script has completed successfully in test mode.    Example: (error:20) Unsupported or invalid g-code command found in block. **** Pausing file transfer. ****  (error:20) Unsupported or invalid g-code command found in block. (error:1) G-code words consist of a letter and a value. Letter was not found. **** Pausing file transfer. ****  (error:1) G-code words consist of a letter and a value. Letter was not found. ok 
@wilkinsona Correct. The pathingJar was used to avoid issues with the command line on Windows. It is a option that can be enabled since grails 3.1.2 and seems to be using the jar tasks.   Let me work on a sample project and will let you know shortly. 
The problem is in new-metadata.html if the user has only 1 group:  ```     <div class="col-sm-3" data-ng-show="groups && groups.length > 1"> ```  should be:  ```     <div class="col-sm-3" data-ng-show="groups && groups.length >= 1"> ```  Going to commit the fix.

On the ichisel's GUI when gold block is selected. Only the top line of options work. All the other types of gold block below the first line won't chisel. Clicking them does nothing.
I wish I could - however it is an **intermittent** problem - so much so that re-running the command **without any changes** usually succeeds (which indicates some non-deterministic order...). Furthermore, it happens relative rarely (especially since we added `-Djava.util.Array.legacySort=true`) so I could try it 100 times and **maybe** have it fail once. And even if it does not fail, it does not mean that bug is fixed - it may just be harder to time it correctly...  I have not had enough time to really dwell into the comparison logic, but it seems quite complex. Perhaps one should first brainstorm from scratch (as if writing it for the 1st time), decide on the **exact** list of the comparison "tie-breakers" and then implement them - e.g.:  * Ranked comes before/after un-ranked - if both ranked, then rank decides order * Versioned before non-versioned - if both versioned then version decides order * Repeatable before/after whatever other, etc. * State X comes before state Y (if state is an _enum_ than **exact** order of **all** states) * Finally, if both of same type then description decides order
I suspect you are correct. Odds are this is not a common occurrance, but rather something that happens under a small set of circumstances... It should more likely be noted for future reference in case another user asks for help solving the same issue.

Agreed. seems likely.
> merging your branches into master is now quite critical as people are starting to do PRs on out of date code which may conflict.  `master` now has the gradle build and all tests are passing in CI.  This bug (unable to build without Android SDK installed) is also resolved, so I'm closing this issue.

Hi Florian, Yep, this is the update site I'm using. Here are my Installation Details: ![screen shot 2014-09-15 at 19 20 15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/608862/4276401/f92c7a9c-3d04-11e4-8837-4ae63dd4f6b6.png)  I re-installed both the plugin and the line fixer just this morning, they both are fresh. I also ran `./Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse -clean` after the re-installation.   Hope this helps. What other details would you like to know?

Sure, just pushed them to this repo: https://github.com/felixfbecker/PowerShellXSD  `Format.xsd` is the the schema (I autogenerated it from the XML, so pretty sure it's valid) `TestFormat.xml` is a schema instance. Try hovering over any tag, or triggering autocompletion, and you should see the above exceptions logged (and no hover/completion results).

I can see other players' messages and /tb tools works, but changing the userPrint value to the suggested values does not change the fact that the tools do not display messages. Also, the only plugins I'm using are the Essentials plugins, VoxelSniper, WorldEdit, Mobdisguise, and Tim the Enchanter. All of them can display text, but only essentials alters chat in any way. 
Ah good point, although why pick one? Ideally an enterprise system should be a hybrid of competing platform philosophies of past Enterprise Architects.   I'm liking that this is turning into a design by committee project. It's on the right track.  
> Ideally, non-String classes should not be reaching in and accessing that field - there should be a getter method so we can have a divergent internal representation that achieves the same behavior.  Agreed. Such a thing already exists here:  https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/02fdf14c71fb83f76deaa4f264b5c6748afc820b/jcl/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java#L87-L93  Although I think I've encountered at least one place in OpenJDK where they reach into String via reflection and extract the field. It should instead be calling this getter.

It's fairly simple to test... just create a web worker.js file with the following...  ``` importScripts(   '{rootpath}/sbt.dojo180/dojo/dojo.js',   '{rootpath}/test/library?lib=dojo&ver=1.8.0'); ```  where {rootpath} is whatever your context root is....  Then, in an html page, do  ``` <script>   var w = new Worker('worker.js'); </script> ```  Watch the javascript console to see the errors.  Essentially, Dojo and Jquery both attempt to use items that are not available to Web Worker scripts (window, document, etc). The likely correct answer is to use an alternative Library implementation designed specifically for use within the limited Web Worker environment, with the acknowledgement that doing so might mean limiting some of the SDK features (authentication might get a bit weird, for instance).   This would not necessarily be a simple fix, unfortunately.

Yes, you are right. The screenshot with Pixelcopy does reflect what's on screen, but when ARCore is running, i dont see any black dots on screen, however the screenshot has black dots. I run the test on Samsung Galaxy S8, Android 7.0. ![003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14886798/44387720-da1f7580-a558-11e8-851f-5a4c67fc3bab.png) 
Hello :)  I didn't solve the issue, but figured out the problem was also occuring with the Java examples. I tried on another PC, and looks like the combo: latest Java version + latest IntelliJ version with Quarkus 1.1.1.Final leads to tests failing in IntelliJ (but not in Maven).  Since it's apparently not related to Kotlin, I thought I'd close the issue to avoid misleading report.
I'm using a Nexus 4 running Android 4.4.4. I haven't tested it with the sample apps yet, will try that and let you know if it happens there too. Thanks for the quick responses.

Maybe I was to short in description. My concer is whitespace/newline control in if/else block.  Here is updated test:  ``` package com.github.jknack.handlebars;  import org.junit.Test;  public class WhitespaceElse extends AbstractTest {      @Test     public void parseElse() throws Exception {         shouldCompileTo("\n{{~#if bold~}}\n<b>\n{{else}}\n<i>\n{{~/if~}}\n", $("bold", true), "<b>\n");         shouldCompileTo("\n{{~#if bold~}}\n<b>\n{{else}}\n<i>\n{{~/if~}}\n", $("bold", false), "\n<i>");          shouldCompileTo("\n{{~#if bold~}}\n<b>\n{{~else~}}\n<i>\n{{~/if~}}\n", $("bold", true), "<b>");         shouldCompileTo("\n{{~#if bold~}}\n<b>\n{{~else~}}\n<i>\n{{~/if~}}\n", $("bold", false), "<i>");     } } ```  two last statements will fail.

So far, no 403 errors. I'm kind of busy right now, but I will check again in the next few days and test out some users with gfys to see if I get any 403s.  I know this is for RipMe, but any idea why 403 errors coming up for Gonewilder as well? It's also having trouble with vidme videos. Downloading very slow or not at all. I'm wondering if it's similar issues that seem to have just been fixed in the latest RipMe patch you committed.

I think I've accounted for the cold start, but I made only about a 100 requests in sequence. I might have hit it on a particularly 'cold' day, though, will try again. Also Google's definition of an active store probably has a lot more 0s on the requests/second count.  I measured by turning on the HTTP logger that's included in the Ruby example and looking at the output for sequential runs - definitely not a well thought out benchmark, but enough to show what's going on.  
I have tried to debug the using 'mvn wisdom:run -Ddebug=5005'. And in fact in some cases, the resource given to ok() is null. That's why in consequence getMimeTypeForFile() receives null. Perhaps this could be protected.

Tested on a clean machine - you're right - that does not happen there (so there must be an error with another script)  But the issue with canceling the click is there, too.
@bjansen so, i tried again and Im able to reproduce 100% with these steps: - In same project create module Foo and module Bar - In Foo create a package and class: foo.testimport.Foo - in module Bar import module Foo - In run.ceylon of module Bar type: `import { foo.testimpor` and autocomplete with option `{...}`  - Now module.ceylon is with import of Foo duplicated

sometimes I need insert array with null values because length of an array is important for me and I want to get back an array of the same length as the insert  when I insert record [#-1:-1,#5:0] that DB returns [null,#5:0]. it is OK for me why I cannot insert record [null,#5:0] at once

With the latest changes on the ZTE Racer the map is no longer corrupted, however it still doesn't draw correctly, it's drawn with a blue/green tint, furthermore two copies of the map are drawn, one at the top left and one at the top right.  ---  |    BLUE     |   |    GREEN   | |    MAP       |   |      MAP      | |                   |   |                   | |_________|   |__________| |                                          | |                                          | |_____________________|   It would appear that the only PixelFormat that renders the map correctly on this device is PixelFormat.RGB_565, not sure about other devices pre Jelly Bean though.  On a Samsung Galaxy S4 the change from using 0x00000000 to android.R.color.transparent re-introduces the black map background on load.

Hi @pbzdyl   I've just pushed the source code. https://github.com/anolivetree/gradle-clojure-samples  Following is the exact command I used.  On first build, created jar contains httpkit. However, 2nd build doesn't include httpkit.  ``` sakurai@envyhome ~/project/olive/clojure/gradle-clojure-samples $ ps ax |grep gradle 27257 pts/5    T      0:00 vim build.gradle 29253 pts/2    S+     0:00 grep --color=auto gradle sakurai@envyhome ~/project/olive/clojure/gradle-clojure-samples $ ./gradlew clean Starting a Gradle Daemon, 1 incompatible and 5 stopped Daemons could not be reused, use --status for details  BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s 1 actionable task: 1 up-to-date sakurai@envyhome ~/project/olive/clojure/gradle-clojure-samples $ ps ax |grep gradle 27257 pts/5    T      0:00 vim build.gradle 29287 ?

Thanks for your feedback. I fixed the read button as well.
Oh forgot, we are using a PostgreSql database
Sorry, I have no one right now, but error happens here: http://www.grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.mysema.querydsl/querydsl-core/3.3.1/com/mysema/util/ClassPathUtils.java#54  It happens because wildfly uses its own virtual filesystem and its' classloader returns urls in form vfs:_something_ 
Yeah creative. When experimenting with a mod I like to create what amounts to a void world so my laptop doesn't have to render more than it needs to. I tend to like building ridiculous setups that make placing a block in the chunk the setup is in cause something like half a second to a second of lag as it rerenders the chunk. 
something like  > CREATE VIEW `retail_demo.newview_1` AS > SELECT >     `email_addresses_dim_hive`.`customer_id` > FROM >     `retail_demo`.`email_addresses_dim_hive`  so i try to edit existing view (e.g. newview_1) and save it
That works, but it starts crashing once i add the metals package.
I see this issue occurs every time in android(I didn't see IOS). So I think when you know this problem, you can fix it easily.  here is simple example.  let callDetector; componentDidMount() {         callDetector = new CallDetectorManager((event)=> {             if (event === 'Disconnected') {                 // Do something call got disconnected             }         }) } componentWillUnmount() {             callDetector.dispose(); } 
I meet this issue again. And I will keep my current env. If what I can do for this issue, please let me know.

> This sounds like jvm bug and not something we can or should be fixing. What if you try with JRE 8? That is the officially supported version  Thanks for the reply, and adding the jvm label. I really wasn't sure where to put this...  I now changed my default java configuration to `java-8-openjdk-amd64` but the issue still persists, exactly as before.
I think this problem appears because I am using M&B: Battlegear 2,  in which melee weapons can't block completely 
I saw this on both Linux and Windows.  Now I'm matching on this which should be fine for almost all cases:  `    p.getProcessID() + "|" + p.getName() + "|" + p.getPath()`  In fact, I'm only using this for calculating per-process CPU usage, so any errors in this logic will iron themselves out after the next calculation anyway.  Thanks :)
The chart was filled with data, I do not remember which one it was though. It happened a couple of times also when pinch zooming, so it seems to be indeed an MPAndroidChart bug.

I am sorry, but I needed to take a little pause from MC. Let's go for details.  I originally had FE build 1146, where it worked. But then I updated for later builds and it stopped working. I had my spawn position in other dimension than basic overworld, but first it took the coords where I setted it up and then teleported me to overworld on those coords, totally ignoring that I was setting it up in another dimension. Dunno if I updated or so after that, but it did not worked with more versions, I tried those ones: 1187, 1234, 1256, 1265.  For checks if it is not just by messing in perms, I also deleted it all and recreated, but nothing worked, only reverting back to (quite a lot) old version.  Still I might have messed something really badly, but I don't know what would be a thing that would overwrite FE's spawn thingie for good until downgrade.  PS: I actually in that bad times did some amateur video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jv9yod5zz8fbdmy/2016-08-29-1901-49.flv I had suspicions for that I messed dimensions, but then I deleted all FE datas and it was still there, even when I tried only FE command and even when I tried it just in overworld few blocks away..., that was really bad time heh. 
> how about `supportsExecutionContext()` and `providesExecutionContext()`?  That's unfortunately just as ambiguous as the status quo since the method signatures already reference the execution context as method parameters.  To keep matters simple, I am going to assign this task to myself, which I probably should have done in the first place.  Rationale: I already know the direction we want to go, and I will have to review any proposals in detail anyway. So, in the end, it will go faster if I just tackle this one.  Cheers!    
so far i understand githud (never used it before) i can only edit i file at a time. but many changes require more than one file to alter. 
GraphHopper should not produce corrupt shortcuts anymore (as #980 should fix this) but in case of a new bug it would load such broken files without reporting a problem or stopping. To reproduce this, the following should work: create a graph with multiple CH profiles in parallel via an old version and provide too few RAM and then some CH preparations will stop with OutOfMemory errors or similar and then load these files with a recent version.
@jgcmarins  I just implemented the instructions as mentioned here for sharingpdf https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share  But while adding File provider in manifest, having merge issues the android defailt file providing already iusing other package called react-native-image-crop-picker. So I created a File provider same as Android ones. Build errors are fixes but can't share the pdf  The below line is not working while i had logs within the method await Share.open({ url: base64Data }); 
If the fullscreen button is pressed on FullscreenVideoView then our device will be error all the useless device functions
okay will try that and let you know the result 
fine with the title changing.. but the only reason I restart the docker desktop is because the che stops working. if i go: http://che-che.161.44.255.0.nip.io, browser will try load the page and eventually timeout, then retry again, and again...
6 parallel downloads 
Sorry for the delay: I used the rightclick add file for adding the pdf.

From what I tried until now, yes.
@sormuras with which release will this change be published
Both versions
Because it could be problematic in the future for servers that are taking longer to update, it would prevent players from playing entirely for a period of time, so I prefer to still inform, in case the bug isn't fixed by the update itself ^^
That would be helpful indeed! The ADQL is as follows:  `SELECT ivoid, short_name, res_title, reference_url, base_role, role_name, email, intf_index, access_url, standard_id, cap_type, cap_description, std_version, res_subjects FROM rr.resource AS res NATURAL JOIN rr.interface NATURAL JOIN rr.capability NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN rr.res_role NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT ivoid,  ivo_string_agg(res_subject, ', ') AS res_subjects FROM rr.res_subject GROUP BY ivoid) AS sbj WHERE (base_role='contact' OR base_role='publisher' OR base_role IS NULL) AND standard_id='ivo://ivoa.net/std/conesearch' AND intf_type='vs:paramhttp'` 
Both are the latest version. Mobile app from Google store. Server from apt-get.

Hi @marvin-we  I found what happens.  The reason of this bug is https://github.com/marvin-we/steem-java-api-wrapper/blob/f10795fa6fceac9d96ae725679173ac02b6dca19/src/main/java/eu/bittrade/libs/steemj/communication/CommunicationHandler.java#L73  Websockets library enables ssl if there is SSL_ENGINE_CONFIGURATOR property. Here https://github.com/tyrus-project/tyrus/blob/70d844a08e77e64ef8a0e3e1b1d0035ca7076d22/containers/grizzly-client/src/main/java/org/glassfish/tyrus/container/grizzly/client/GrizzlyClientSocket.java#L373  For reproduce this issue just disable ssl verification and try any ws:// url.
havent bothered to find their github yet, and i dont know enough about the API to know if returning null is valid or not

This function is executed multiple times by 8 concurrent threads.  After some time (about 10000 runs), the server hangs with the following thread dump: https://gist.github.com/gerdhub/7459ddda0565d2104892 (Server + Client)  As the server is running on a remote server, I cannot take a complete memory dump at the moment.  I meanwhile also updated to Version 2.1.13...  Does this help? 
May I send files to you by email?
@p works with the nearest player, the mots time the player that pushes the button. also at that time only one player was there. It shouldremove 100 Gold from the nearest player @p, but it only worked with all player, @a 
Ah, I see. Does it really look that asymmetrical to have it on the top left? I guess we can leave it for the time being, and change in the future if users complain. Maybe it is just me who always accidentally rotates maps. :)
Thank you @xinyuan-liu  The problem was related to Java. Actually, I had installed java; nonetheless, I had not set JAVA_HOME. I think it makes sense to note that users should set JAVA_HOME before using the tool.

However, is it possible to do it in a way that is similar to what you are already doing (and the way that JAX-RS does it in general): i.e., by allowing the user to define a `@Provider` that implements an interface that is _specifically_ for initialization? E.g., something like JAX-RS's `ContextResolver` interface.  
Can't get a TestGame situation to mimic it. Try a mirror match with this deck:  ``` # 3 creatures 4 Howling Wolf 4 Skyshroud Sentinel 4 Vampire Hounds  # 4 spells 4 Exhume 4 Golgari Cluestone 2 Rishadan Pawnshop 2 Soldevi Digger  # 3 lands 4 Bayou 6 Forest 6 Swamp ```  I find it rarely stays on the battlefield (MCTS 8)

@PhotoNomad0 The url to the project is at the top of the first comment
after giving Z their plg reads that I have a different range. I do not know if it's the fault of luck perms (sorry for my eng)
Verified on Master 9.0, with GV 65 that this is fixed. devices: HTC Desire 820 (Android 6.0.1), Samsung Galaxy S8 (Android 8.0)
Hi, Thanks for your replies, with the last version of F-Droid (0.95.1), the download of v0.1.34-alpha-b00  works! 
Here it is:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <XDF name="TopHelloOrc"/> ``` 
I tried, but I can't replicate it because the URL has been fixed by the owners of that URL and I don't know another example.  Hopefully it works. 
Yes. good idea. and I need some help.   It's find-sec-bugs not recognized in find bugs.  then I had merge this find-sec-bugs class in the find bugs's jar. and messages.xml content too.  It's working but incompletely.  report.xml was not closed at last element.  ㅡㅡ;; 
Hi Simon!  Hmmm, total docs is only 1,595,704 across two doc types. I have lots of shards in other indices with way more docs than that. 
Dear Ron, 1. Same Windows 7 build as you 2. I'm actually using the French (Canada) Keyboard. I see the same expected behavior as you (press twice to have the "hat" accent in French) in any other application, but RStudio IDE.   Actually, I found that the bug is happening more cleanly when I switched from English to French keyboard : 1. Using Windows Language Bar, I've mapped the sequence "Ctrl + 1" to get English keyboard, and "Ctrl + 2" to get French (Canada) keyboard (quick way to change between language when programming)  2. The freeze happened systematically when I pressed the "hat" key AFTER switching from English to French keyboard using the ctrl keys. 3. If I switched between keyboards using the mouse, there is no freeze when typing the hat key.  I've downgraded to RStudio 1.1.463 and everything working as expected (there is no interference between switching keyboard using Ctrl keys and the hat key)  Thanks for your help,  Hans

I am running Android 2.3.7 (Cyanogenmod 7) on a Motorola Defy. It has an SD Card.  I have many other feeds on my list and all of them work. This one used to work but some months ago it stopped. I think it is something related to AntennaPod because I have another Android device (an Acer tablet) and I installed AntennaPod and inserted this same feed and it worked fine. I have already tried to remove the feed and add it again but the problem remained. I still have not tried to uninstall AntennaPod and reinstall it because I have a lot of downloaded podcast episodes.  I saved a logfile with aLogcat and posted on http://pastebin.com/KeUVdnJ4  In this log, I tried to update the feeds, and after that, to download an episode. I think this caused the errors on lines 907 and 938 of the log.  Thank you,  Renato. 
we are using Greenwich.SR2 as the cloud release train.  We dont have an issue upgrading but will require a lot more testing. based on the bit of debugging that I have done, I am not sure the Spring Boot 2.2.x redistemplate implementation is any different than 2.1.x for ValueOperations. 
Although jvisualvm does not detect deadlock the bug is still here: both threads (inserter and deleter) got stuck. checked with ''develop'' and ''2.2.x'' branches  ``` "Thread-7" #20 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x0000000018986000 nid=0x196f4 waiting on condition [0x000000005b51e000]    java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (parking)     at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)     -

Does not seem to be based upon speed, but what's being searched for. I got it to crash three times out of four. The one time it didn't crash I was searching for a vanilla 'Hopper'.  Import [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/20cfomin7yya8vh/Coop%20Life-0.9-Twitch.zip?dl=0) pack into the Twitch Launcher, and add your latest file versions.. test for yourself.
No, as stated, delete data only. Version is the master. 
If all things are equal for all countries, should GDP not increase either?   I think the trend prior to Kyoto was that for countries who's GDP increased more, their CO2 emissions increased more too.   I think it might be worth trying to model reality a little closer on this as it's not a particularly tricky issue, and it also shows quite nicely what would've happend without kyoto.

Hi Igrignon,  Thanks for fixing this. I will check it out when it is available. As a workaround I am doing the following now :)  ```         Object obj = $("#myMenu");         JQuery jq = (JQuery) obj;         jq.menu(); ```  As far as Eclipse or Maven Plugin , I normally use Maven Plugin. I do use eclipse as my IDE though.   Thanks

Actually the engine-tests bit was originally split out from (also) IntelliJ not handling it too well either, something about the mixture of source and test compilation dependencies and getting the order right :-(  Will have to look at it more closely when an opportunity presents itself - thanks for the intel :-)

sorry, but the key is not the array. In my example, OValues is just a property value not a key. 
You're right, I forgot that Completions used the Scanner and from other IDE's I guess comments dont need highlighting. Ill update this.
As a matter of fact, it is. However, in theory, shouldn't the `Recombinator` work for any population size greater than or equal to 2? I noticed that even with a population size of 50 and an offspring fraction of 0.5, it sometimes still produced one such instance every generation where an individual is recombined with itself. It seems that with the current implementation, there is always a chance (smaller as the population size is increased), this situation occurs. At [Retest](https://retest.de/) we use Jenetics to implement our genetic algorithm with the goal of optimizing test suites for multiple objectives. The population we currently deal with is relatively small. The altered offsprings are evaluated each time which is expensive. Hence, we would like to avoid this situation.  Can the current selection mechanism within the `Recombinator` class be improved? We would be glad to help.
Hi! Just tested it; passing `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1` as a second parameter for `LoopingMediaSource` worked. Thank you!

My humble apologies for taking so long to come back to you, especially as you responded so promptly.  We’ve been trying various tests within our Jenkins build set up to try and isolate the problem.  We are definitely going ahead with an order for the Enterprise version (it should come through as Deutsche Post / DHL) but we can not get the Oracle Apex applications to load without the “&” placeholder error.  We have set sqlplus enabled, but it looks like the set define off is still being ignored.  We use placeholders elsewhere, so we can not globally turn placeholders off.   It looks like Flyway is still setting define on – see highlighted line below:-   public String replacePlaceholders(String input) /*     */   { /* 130 */     String result = this.placeholderReplacer.replacePlaceholders(input); /* 131 */     if ((this.oracleSqlplus) && (this.defineOn)) { /* 132 */       boolean replaced = false; /*     */ /* 134 */       Map<String, String> placeholders = getPlaceholderReplacements(); /* 135 */       Set<String> unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions = new TreeSet(); /*     */       for (;;) { /* 137 */         Matcher matcher = this.anyPlaceholderPattern.matcher(result); /* 138 */         if (!matcher.find()) break; /* 139 */         String searchTerm = matcher.group(3).toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH); /* 140 */         if (!placeholders.containsKey(searchTerm)) { /* 141 */           unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions.add(matcher.group(1)); /* 142 */           result = StringUtils.replace(result, matcher.group(1), ""); /*     */         } else { /* 144 */           result = StringUtils.replace(result, matcher.group(2), (String)placeholders.get(searchTerm)); /* 145 */           replaced = true; /*     */         } /*     */       } /*     */ /*     */ /*     */ /*     */ /* 152 */       if (!unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions.isEmpty()) /*     */       { /* 154 */         throw new FlywayException("No value provided for placeholder expressions: " + StringUtils.collectionToCommaDelimitedString(unmatchedPlaceHolderExpressions) + ".

Any ideas?
Sorry for the late reply. I just try open my project on VS Code (with flutter plugin). => It worked well. So I don't think the problem is about the dartfmt.  My project is private, so I can't share. But you can try to create a new project with two classes then import those files. Like: ```dart import './entity/file1.dart';    import './entity/file2.dart'; ``` Please note that there are some spaces between the two imports. Then you press `CMD + S` many times -> the format may be wrong.  I think the problem is about concurrency problem (guess). 
"Does the (real) test actually need to execute the real code of some methods, while others are mocked?" correct  "null is the default result for any method returning a reference type, so recording "result = null" for them is redundant. Or is there something I missed?" yeah, that's just for this test code - not null in the real code 
@Malinskiy I've now tried to reproduce the issues. I didn't succeed. However, it was quite a long time ago that I've tried, so maybe I'm not doing it well.

@no2chem I think so.  I wanted to refactor some code to, the way the layout future is leaked all over the place is not good.  I'll just submit a patch to make invalidateLayout synchronized and then w can revisit this problem later  
nope. I use now version 2.0 and its work 3.0 doesnt work 
@itolisto sorry for not replying.  I will remind @tcard to look into this.
I don't have any extra information since I don't use this mod myself or actually play much MC at all atm, I've only seen it several times in nps files sent to me for analysis. The issues mentioned appear to be not just minor oversights but more in depth implementation issues, thus it's unlikely to be fixed. I quickly verified that issue part 1 is still there by looking at the source code.  From experience a good guess for the cause of the redstone conduit problems would be having much less than vanilla's 1 loss/block, which is required to reach a steady state from omnidirectional propagation quickly if the propagation algorithm works similar to vanilla's. Low or no loss requires significant extra care, which is easy to get wrong as soon as there's a connection back to some vanilla redstone for example.  This report may be the first of its kind due to the various issues being very difficult to track down to EnderIO although those performance problems are likely quite widespread. The spike heavy nature of the slowdowns combined with heavy inlining by the JVM makes it practically impossible to see in Opis and difficult to spot in Sampler while sampling normally. The lag spikes can usually be observed with Sampler's spike trigger, assuming there's a problematic setup in the world, which I don't know the conditions for. It may be required to disable the JVM's inlining or even run in interpreter only mode to see more, which of course has significant influence on the unit under test. 
I left the instance running and came back to reconnect the next day, and this happens. I don't see it today but will try to see if it happens again.

I was working with MarkLogic 9 and I think DataHub v4.0.3, though now I use MLCP and ml-gradle directly without DataHub. For database configurations that require a database restart timeout you can try to deploy ml-config/root/task-servers/TaskServer.json with {"threads": "32"}. For token replacement you can use a token in a module (e.g. if mlContentDatabaseName=eds-nosql-rdl property is in gradle.properties then use "%%mlContentDatabaseName%%" in a modules.xqy module, deploy it, and observe that the token isn't replaced. For mlLoadModules/mlReloadModules only works properly with deployments from scratch, just deploy from scratch (i.e. with a blank MarkLogic/Data folder), then change a module, remove a different module, and add a new module, and rename an existing module, then run mlLoadModules/mlReloadModules and observe the results. ml-gradle by itself behaves properly in all these cases. DataHub does not.
I Would prefer to stay at app instead of going back to previous page. I don't like this behaviour when I am on RIA, but for web pages is ok. Maybe this behaviour should be configurable?
> you want to override the default size (as computed by the underlying stream)  Wrapping the stream without setting the max initial ended up showing question marks (unknown file size) and a messed up progress bar: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12547785/73212587-8be2ae80-411c-11ea-8a56-e4157ae64588.png)    So I set the max initial to the file size (correctly shown at the right side of the `/`) but the total bytes downloaded (at the left of `/`) is off by one even though the actual file is downloaded in full and my OS shows the file size correctly.
Sorry I wasn't exactly clear. I was not able to get ffmpeg working correctly, but I was able to use the java only .bat from 0.2.1-alpha without issues.
So I can see a pattern, basically when you install the second app in a row, the first one gets sorted although you did not actually leave the current app (say Google Play store) and the frecency should not (yet) be influenced.  When the third app is installed the second one goes down the list 2 or 3 items, while the first one already ended up the 8 or 9-th position.  Not sure how to handle this though.

Hey  I have installed from download section here. Seems to be working fine.   I often have less apps to choose from from the the marketplace simply because developers forgets to mark a app as "compatible with small screen" (or similar) I think this needs to be done implicit.

I do have Biomes O' Plenty (the large mushrooms in the backround didn't give that away?), but the biome around the Nether portal is "Hell": ![2018-04-28_07 37 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8942955/39397665-0f5f0a54-4ab8-11e8-9ad1-b135f5303126.png) I turned off spawning, and there is a Dynamic Surroundings dust storm going on in that screenshot.  Biomes O Plenty uses a "wrapped" version of the Hell biome, but as far as I can tell, it doesn't change the biome dictionary registration.  If you look at https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.12.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/common/BiomeDictionary.java#L417 you can see that Forge registers the biome as Hot, Dry, and Nether.  Looking at your code, it seems there are a few species that spawn in "dry" biomes: ``` EntityRegistry.addSpawn(EntityHamster.class, AnimaniaConfig.spawn.spawnProbabilityHamsters, 1, 2, EnumCreatureType.CREATURE, getBiomes(BiomeDictionary.Type.DRY)); ... RegistryHelper.Entities.addSpawn(EntityDoeNigerianDwarf.class, AnimaniaConfig.spawn.spawnProbabilityGoats, 1, maxFam, EnumCreatureType.CREATURE, getBiomes(BiomeDictionary.Type.DRY)); ... RegistryHelper.Entities.addSpawn(EntityEweMerino.class, AnimaniaConfig.spawn.spawnProbabilitySheep, 1, maxFam, EnumCreatureType.CREATURE, getBiomes(BiomeDictionary.Type.DRY)); ... RegistryHelper.Entities.addSpawn(EntityRabbitDoeJack.class, AnimaniaConfig.spawn.spawnProbabilityRabbits, 1, maxFam, EnumCreatureType.CREATURE, getBiomes(BiomeDictionary.Type.DRY)); ```  Also, I can think of a couple of dimensions added by mods that players might want to blacklist Animania animals from spawning in even though the biomes there are otherwise favorable for them: Mining World (from Aroma1997s Dimensional Worlds) and Twilight Forest.  Galacticraft dimensions would definitely be a bad place for Animania animals to automatically spawn in, but they are registered in a way that would make this possible once grass was imported - e.g. the moon is Cold, Dry, and Dead; Mars is Cold, Dry, Dead, and Sandy; Venus flat biome is Hot, Dry, Dead, and Sandy.
My mistake to use `https://localhost:8761/`, and now this test is ok when change it to `http://localhost:8761/`. The other test is to use Eureka and `@Client` to request, and this test is failed, and the exception trace is on above. @graemerocher 
There was a typo. I was trying to say that the `ImportOrder` finding is unnecessary, since the list of imports is sorted.
No, other keybindings 'stick' like normal. I just tried it in a new instance with only Dynamic Surroundings, and there it also happens. Something else I just notice;, is that the keybindings do not show up in the list (options > controls) when I am not in a world. So going to controls from the main menu does not allow me to set the keybindings, I can only do this with Esc inside a world. I also updated to latest forge (2479) but this didn't help either.
I use dbeaver 6.2.1.201909221630.  It is easy to reproduce this problem.  You can create two table and then create virtual foreign keys between the two table.Save it,Then reopen the project and you can find the virtual foreign keys lost.
It may be the problem of some vendor issue. I also can not reproduce in other devices which version also is 4.4.4  
@Bananeweizen  I agree, that this OOM is basically the same memory leak as mentioned in #3778. Shall we close this issue then?

Ive reset the spigot.yml and updated the 1.14.4 jar and all seems to be good now, not sure which was at fault but .. thanks for your help though :)
Thanks Phillip, I have moved to 3.0.3 GA .. now there is no issue. Thanks again.

Commit 4d680abed3793dc2a003185e538123952ea591b0 renames the request parameters from ``<something>`` to ``pt.<something>``.  But the web client can't handle that.  Commit 4828b13815e4cd5a9f9ee89aad55519d015929b1 wanted to tell the web client about the new parameter names, but it wouldn't work for anything but the first request (move one of the markers: crash). Reason seems to be that the web client does something with the parameter strings which doesn't like ``.``.
As a test I changed to the default cookie spec providers and had no substantive change in my one test case. Changing the version solved my issue. I don't know what the more wideranging side effects of changing that will be. I think a check to see if a cookie value contains whitespace and then setting it to version 1 might help some future compatibility issues.  On Mar 22, 2017 11:17 PM, "D. Hollingsworth" <notifications@github.com> wrote:  Does this need to be hardcoded? Can the CookieSpec implementations not figure out when cookies need to be sent as Version 0 or Version 1?  Not sure on this. We do set the HttpComponents cookie handling policy to a custom one defined in the project by the class LaxCookieSpecProvider. I figured that was mostly responsible for how cookies are parsed but it might also be affecting how cookies get sent too. Apache does allow for cookies to be explicitly set too rather than rely on these manager/spec classes.  — You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

I was in a custome biome where I don't use any newTreeDecoration at the moment. Let me disable the other biome.cfg and I'll try agian.  These are the two tree setups I used for my other test Biome.  ``` lushDesertFoliage.set("minHeight", 2) lushDesertFoliage.set("heightVariation", 1) --- lushDesertFoliageShort.set("minHeight", 1) lushDesertFoliageShort.set("heightVariation", 0) <-- This not okay? ```

Hi @ISchwarz23 ,  To reproduce, we just need to add those two lines into `build.gradle`, then perform sync with gradle files.  ``` groovy compile 'com.android.support:gridlayout-v7:23.2.1' compile 'de.codecrafters.tableview:tableview:1.0.1' ```  Here is the message from `:app:processDebugResources`:  ``` logcat ~/temp/App/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/debug/values/values.xml:129 : AAPT: Attribute "columnCount" has already been defined :app:processDebugResources FAILED ```  And following is the stacktrace for `./gradlew build --stacktrace`  ``` org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskExecutionException: Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.executeActions(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:69)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.execute(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:46)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.PostExecutionAnalysisTaskExecuter.execute(PostExecutionAnalysisTaskExecuter.java:35)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.execute(SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.java:64)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ValidatingTaskExecuter.execute(ValidatingTaskExecuter.java:58)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipEmptySourceFilesTaskExecuter.execute(SkipEmptySourceFilesTaskExecuter.java:52)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipTaskWithNoActionsExecuter.execute(SkipTaskWithNoActionsExecuter.java:52)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipOnlyIfTaskExecuter.execute(SkipOnlyIfTaskExecuter.java:53)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteAtMostOnceTaskExecuter.execute(ExecuteAtMostOnceTaskExecuter.java:43)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.DefaultTaskGraphExecuter$EventFiringTaskWorker.execute(DefaultTaskGraphExecuter.java:203)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.DefaultTaskGraphExecuter$EventFiringTaskWorker.execute(DefaultTaskGraphExecuter.java:185)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.AbstractTaskPlanExecutor$TaskExecutorWorker.processTask(AbstractTaskPlanExecutor.java:62)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.AbstractTaskPlanExecutor$TaskExecutorWorker.run(AbstractTaskPlanExecutor.java:50)     at org.gradle.internal.concurrent.ExecutorPolicy$CatchAndRecordFailures.onExecute(ExecutorPolicy.java:54)     at org.gradle.internal.concurrent.StoppableExecutorImpl$1.run(StoppableExecutorImpl.java:40) Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/home/letientai299/Software/Installed/Android/sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt'' finished with non-zero exit value 1     at com.android.build.gradle.tasks.ProcessAndroidResources.doFullTaskAction(ProcessAndroidResources.java:147)     at com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.IncrementalTask.taskAction(IncrementalTask.java:98)     at org.gradle.internal.reflect.JavaMethod.invoke(JavaMethod.java:75)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$IncrementalTaskAction.doExecute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:244)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$StandardTaskAction.execute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:220)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$IncrementalTaskAction.execute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:231)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$StandardTaskAction.execute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:209)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.executeAction(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:80)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.executeActions(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:61)     ... 14 more Caused by: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/home/letientai299/Software/Installed/Android/sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt'' finished with non-zero exit value 1     at com.android.build.gradle.internal.process.GradleProcessResult.assertNormalExitValue(GradleProcessResult.java:42)     at com.android.builder.core.AndroidBuilder.processResources(AndroidBuilder.java:919)     at com.android.build.gradle.tasks.ProcessAndroidResources.doFullTaskAction(ProcessAndroidResources.java:138)     ... 22 more Caused by: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/home/letientai299/Software/Installed/Android/sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt'' finished with non-zero exit value 1     at org.gradle.process.internal.DefaultExecHandle$ExecResultImpl.assertNormalExitValue(DefaultExecHandle.java:367)     at com.android.build.gradle.internal.process.GradleProcessResult.assertNormalExitValue(GradleProcessResult.java:40)     ... 24 more ```  Thanks. 
Sorry, I see that point 2 is not covered. I meant the new widget debugging tool. 
I managed to start activity more than once in both cases, using freshly built project from SDK, you got to tap real fast though, maybe this is low priority.  android version 6.0.1, samsung note 4
I will check those test cases. In the mean time here is the link, if you want to check my class which throws these errors [https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva/blob/master/src/main/java/org/ssatguru/babylonjs/Vishva.java#L2356](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva/blob/master/src/main/java/org/ssatguru/babylonjs/Vishva.java#L2356) If your run "mvn generate-sources" on this project you will see exactly where the errors are happening  [https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva) 
The wheel? Is that the hold R thing because i cant even get that up. For me im trying to bind it to alt 2.

Phil,  Thanks for getting back to me on this.  Sorry, I did not grab the error message, trying to get ready for a course delivery next week.  But one diagram would not open and the other was fragmented (could not make out any structure or interact with it).  However, I have tried to repeat the error but have not had it reoccur.  I did the rename with the pull down menu not when I created the diagram.  I will let you know if occurs again and will capture the error message/log.  By-the-way, I think you have done a very good job with the editor. This is one of the first issues I have had with it.  Thanks again,  Dave  From: philip-alldredge [mailto:notifications@github.com] Sent: Wednesday, February 28, 2018 4:43 PM To: osate/osate-ge <osate-ge@noreply.github.com> Cc: David Gluch <dpg@sei.cmu.edu>; Author <author@noreply.github.com> Subject: Re: [osate/osate-ge] Renaming Diagrams (#310)   What do you mean, "the latter two diagrams became unreadable"?

The server is running Spigot 1.12.2.
after sync with master, update the server config and test again, the first issue is gone, but the 2nd issue is not fixed.

Server can no longer run for more then 2-5 minutes before crash.  Even running it locally no longer works.
It does, sadly. Recalculating didn't do anything.
Nothing, really... The opening screen (with the Bitcoin logo) shows for a second, then disappears...
Updating to the newest version BetterQuesting-3.5.274 worked. Although I had to type bq_admin edit true to get it to update. Thank you.
Thanks for the hints. I wasn't aware that we have our own Log class. Searching for reference of `Settings.isDebug()` didn't show anything. 
When I launch a test on chrome, this is the result :  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44800518/48191365-2fdc1080-e345-11e8-8583-9659915c581d.png)  When I lauch the same test on firefox :  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44800518/48191436-5e59eb80-e345-11e8-8548-e37c5d2b6f7a.png)  I made some tries and firefox can't see xpath outside of the screen. In chrome, the action "ScrollTo" is automatic. Then I tried mouseOver action in my firefox test and I can only use mouseOver in a element displayed on the screen, not outside. And the action ScrollTo  is not supported for application type 'GUI'. 
Unfortunately, at least on my device (Nexus 6 running Android Nougat), I don't have that information. Here are some details, screenshots, and suggestions:  The AP list shows the primary channel and frequency. However, you're right that it shows 80 MHz next to the primary channel in the AP list. That being said, It would be more clear if it did state "CH 155 5775MHz" along with the primary channel. The width indicates the same thing, but unless you already know that an 80 MHz network using a primary channel between 149-161 is always centered on channel 155, then you'd be confused as to why the channel rating page shows all those channels as occupied.  With 40 MHz networks, it also shows the primary channels 5 and 11 (center is 3 and 9, respectively). In this case, even if it did show the center channel, you don't have enough information to know what frequencies are occupied. For example, if it stated "CH 3 2422MHz (40 MHz), you don't know if your primary channel is 1 or 5, since 2422 MHz is the center either way.  As I stated above, showing primary and center or primary and auxiliary is more useful. "CH 5(3)" would make the most sense. Showing auxiliary channels is probably unnecessary. You could have "CH 5+1" although with 5 GHz channels you'd have some monstrosity like "CH 149+153+157+161" for an AP with primary channel 149. "CH 149(155)" shows you the primary and center, which is enough to deduce the rest and it looks cleaner. You could also include a frequency range like "5735 MHz - 5815 MHz" or the center frequency "5775 MHz" along with the width. These are just some possibilities.  It is important to know your primary channel because you can reduce interference if your primary channels are farther apart and the auxiliary channels are overlapping, compared to the opposite situation (1(3) and 11(9) > 5(3) and 7(9)). There are many 20 MHz clients that will not utilize the auxiliary channel (most smartphones will only utilize 20 MHz on a 2.4 GHz network). For them, it's better that APs appear to be on channels 1 and 11 rather than channels 5 and 7.  ![screenshot_20160926-220810](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18857909/c15db250-8435-11e6-8270-da07ea36e5df.png) ![screenshot_20160926-223315](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858348/6965f04a-8439-11e6-90b9-b5740e6b0a3a.png)  The Channel Rating page should show the same number of APs on all 4 channels. Channel 149 should be equivalent to channel 161 because the nearby channel 161 AP is blasting across channel 149 as well. I don't know why channel 165 has a low rating since no AP is interfering with that channel.  The channel ratings for 40 MHz should show the most interference on channels 5-7 because the 5(3) AP blocks channels 1-7 and the 11(9) AP blocks channels 5-13. Channels 5-7 should be derated slightly relative to channels 1-4 because of the additive interference from the distant AP and channels 8 and 9 should be rated equally to 10 and 11 since the distant AP interferes equally on those channels.   ![screenshot_20160926-222427](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858187/1bb2015a-8438-11e6-9e69-e5e62c726f29.png) ![screenshot_20160926-223352](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858347/6964c864-8439-11e6-98ce-ce1936731090.png)  On the Channel Graph, all 5 GHz networks should completely overlap because they are all 80 MHz wide with the only difference being whether they're on channel 149(155) or channel 161(155) (ie. they all occupy the exact same frequencies so the bars should all be going across 149-161).  With 40 MHz networks, the graph appears to be more accurate. However, the bars should be centered over channels 3 and 9 in this case, because those are the center channels.   ![screenshot_20160926-220355](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18857849/3c31c2e2-8435-11e6-8334-5858f4874237.png) ![screenshot_20160926-223403](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18858346/696389fe-8439-11e6-9d98-fe9281472e90.png)  I'm basing some of my expectations on wavemon. Wavemon has a lot of information, but obviously it is a CLI program intended for PCs. Maybe tapping on an AP or SSID in the AP List could provide increased details similar to wavemon output. There could also be some advanced display options in the settings menu.  ![screenshot_20160926_231230](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7505951/18859062/c5b39ae6-843e-11e6-8898-fa9699502fb5.png)  Hopefully, my suggestions are helpful. I know that some of the non-FOSS WiFi utilities are also lacking in regards to HT/VHT networks. Thanks for taking the time and looking into this.

I mean using maven-git-versioning-extension with maven-3.3.9.
How do I update to 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT? Just change the build.gradle and reload project? 
Hmm, yes, that's a bug. And it's harder than it looks like. This `Range` class was completely dependent on the order of the list. Now, I made the algorithm a bit smarter in there.  Can you check the PR #36, @nascimentolwtn, @sandervdo ? If you say it's ok, I'll merge it!

Renaming rules -> `%a%y - %t`; do not lowercase; do not replace blanks; do truncate after punctuation; max length of title is 50; max number of authors is 1; do not add suffix for omitted authors 3. Add any old thing, let ZotFile rename it appropriately. 4. Re-select the file, do Rename attachments manually, via right-click.  If that's not enough to do it, the bug may be more subtle than that; let me know and I can try to tweak around to reproduce more precisely.

before creating the issue I did `git pull` and rechecked the problem   ``` git hist  * d96528f 2018-10-03 | [Java]: make sure to remove MDC control param from URI for live destination. Aded tests for bringing back clean followers. (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) [Todd L.

Montgomery] * 5a1f9f1 2018-10-03 | [Java]: use replayId from follower when stopping replay for catchup. [Todd L. Montgomery] ```  the branch is `master` of course.
I figured out the problem. I'd thought I'd left the multifarm without one block so it could be copied. I hadn't. 
Hi Simo!  I will commit the fix soon (hopefully in some minutes). Github recognizes the comment and adds it automatically to the issue. 
according to FMD it is 1.4 (1.5.2_1.4.2.1) 
for persistent queries - so it deletes all the repartition topics and changelogs. This is racy, which might explain why we don't hit this in dev environments. Adding some details now.
1.First use, Mono-Directional Connector works fine ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35490649/75598116-758d9100-5ad4-11ea-9b2d-dc95756a73aa.png) 2.When I uninstalled and installed the Mono-Directional Connector, it didn't work properly. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35490649/75598227-2005b400-5ad5-11ea-9362-81c1f1c0ff80.png)  In my understanding, as long as two Mono-Directional Connectors are facing each other, it should work.
Sorry, I forgot the most important thing and confused DD with DW yesterday. This is the example i wanted to show you:  ``` miau: DD 0x1234  PUSH miau ```  miau in `PUSH miau` should be replaced by a 32-bit address, right? but jasmin complains that the operand is too short ("error: operand must be at least two bytes large")!  If I insert a DWORD before miau, like `PUSH DWORD miau`, it works. Shouldn't it also work without the DWORD thing? 
I have the same behavior (the conversion is done but the program hangs). I also tried to remove my ~/.umlet folder.  is there some logs/backtrace I can provide?

I've only tested it with Spruce so far
No it started occurring with the version you released yesterday titled "Plenty of bug fixes." Last night I updated to your latest version and it is still occurring. 
Hi @jakubklimek , Thank you for your prompt answer.   The file I send is used by Pipeline input component.   I made the changes as you suggested. The lowercase boolean values raised an error in Python as was recognised as variables. So I capitalised the first letter to be an eligible python dictionary.   Then the json=payload as long as I undestand serializes this as json data to post with the request.   However the pipeline still runs with the debug data on. It seems to somehow been ignored. Is there somehow logged what was received as request on LP? Maybe this is a python related issue. 
Not really. Its saying "Next:tap Camera, Search, or Call.". Btw I got it from F-droid as V1.1.1 .  I personally think there should be a button there regardless of the existence of hardware buttons or not, since that would be more convenient from a finger tap perspective. Plus the QR code is always square, and most screens are rectangular.   Btw, the receive QR code only receives for clipboard? or is it also for files? I wonder if there is some protocol behind it. Before I discovered your project, I was trying a bit on my side with https://github.com/mofosyne/tagdrop , where I transferred files as if it was a "datauri" string. But admittedly that is horribly inefficient, still I think there is some things we can merge together in terms of concept at least. (Oh you might find it interesting that I am also listening for "data:" intent from zxing, so you can launch the datauri viewer from zxing official barcode reading app)  To keep it short, it would be nice if we can come to a futureproof agreement on a way to store/retrieve binary files on printed QR codes, that everyone can stick to (especially barcode readers). As in, it should encode the mediatype, compression, filename etc... which would inform the receiving device on how to treat the incoming stream of data (or more specifically for me, a sequence of barcodes on paper). This would be aimed at stuff like "paper pgp keys", or tiny "html javascript games" for geo-cache . Maybe the first QR code is the 'metadata'? 
Yes, I'll test the 0.27 StartTime AddLiveStream workaround.  I can't test for #3 in the 0.27 version (I've only got it running on 1 host.) But I can test it on 0.28-pre. Maybe just using curl as a proof of concept would be a good idea. It should fail because the MBE won't find the file (even though it's in the Storage Group, the Storage Directory doesn't  exist on the MBE, e.g. it's not cross mounted.) 
Manufacturer ID is 154 Device ID is 1 Device Type is 3  I think it might be mislabeled as "Outdoor". 
the filter is invokded, but the response is not expected. it seem the setting of zuul.debug.host is not valid. how do it should be configed.  actually, I want to use it as the blue/green deployment. 
Now I am using the latest version - 4.2.0

Thank you for the quick reply!   Yes, there are TestNG dependencies on the classpath.  One we explicitly provide (6.4), the other is from powermock-modue-testng (which transitively brings in 6.2).  I cannot remove these from our POM for two reasons.  First, it breaks Eclipse.  There are a number of "type org.testNg.IHookable cannot be resolved.  It is indirectly referenced from required .class files."  (I launched with -clean for Eclipse and did a Maven refresh project configuration and clean build just for paranoia sake).  Second, it breaks the Maven command line build, which uses TestNG for both unit and integration tests.  The plugin did appear to work fine before this last upgrade. (Sorry, I do not remember my prior version, which I know is notably unhelpful).  Invoking a test via run rather than debug works fine. - Saish 
I'm not sure it is the same as #3374. Nothing relevant in the log. I do notice that there don't seem to be any icons in any of my menus right now.
The whole child graph seems to be offset. Note how the edge connects not to the centre point of the right side of `a_port1`, but to a corner. There may be problems with paddings or some such.
For the hook registration, if I understand what you're speaking about, I add this in my _orientdb-server-config.xml_ :   ``` json <hooks>     <hook class="bescribdb.hooks.CounterHook" position="REGULAR"/> </hooks>     ```  ---  And for getting database, OK, I've changed my hook in this way ( like it's written in Lucene Hook, for example) :   ``` java package bescribdb.hooks; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileNotFoundException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.io.StringReader; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.hook.ODocumentHookAbstract; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.hook.ORecordHook; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.hook.ORecordHookAbstract; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.db.ODatabaseLifecycleListener; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.db.ODatabaseDocumentInternal; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.db.ODatabaseRecordThreadLocal; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.db.document.ODatabaseDocument; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.db.ODatabase; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.ORecord; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.sql.OCommandSQL; import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.impl.ODocument;  public class CounterHook extends ODocumentHookAbstract {     public CounterHook() {         setExcludeClasses("Log"); //if comment out this one line or leave off the constructor entirely then OrientDB fails on every command     }      @Override     public DISTRIBUTED_EXECUTION_MODE getDistributedExecutionMode() {         return DISTRIBUTED_EXECUTION_MODE.BOTH;     }      @Override     public void onRecordAfterCreate( ODocument iDocument ) {          if(iDocument.getClassName().equals("HAS_COMMENT")){              ODocument feedItem = iDocument.field("out");              ODatabaseDocumentInternal currentDatabase = getDatabase();              if (currentDatabase != null && !currentDatabase.isClosed()){                 System.out.println(currentDatabase.command(new OCommandSQL("UPDATE " + feedItem.getIdentity() + " INCREMENT comm_cnt = 1")).execute());             }         }     }       private ODatabaseDocumentInternal getDatabase() {         return ODatabaseRecordThreadLocal.INSTANCE.get();     }  } ```

The code here: https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube/blob/master/openshift/openshift/src/main/java/org/arquillian/cube/openshift/impl/client/GitServer.java#L91 defines a hostPort on the pod.   This is something that is generally considered a bad practice (see [1]). Also its something that is not supported on all environments (e.g. Openshift dedicated). But even with plain Openshift, it requires certain configuration on the user side in order for that to work (more specifically it requires that the user is associated with a security context constraint that allows host ports).   So what I am suggesting, is to remove the hostPort definition from the pod and use a service instead. So that we access the git server through the service. Ideally we should also expose the service as a route (if possible) so that its easier to consume externally.  [1] http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/config-best-practices 
Thanks for your fast answer. There is no firewall running. I do use filevault however. Is there a way that I can see if I have something besides a firewall that interferes with http?  In addition my /etc/hosts  ``` ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost ```

Yes, TFC requires two ingots to make a single sheet, 2 sheets are welded together to make a double sheet. The single sheet is not a large issue, as IE makes its own versions of those sheets, which cannot be melted down, thus avoiding the dupe bug. Double sheets, however, are TFC, and can be melted for 4 ingots 
I'm running JDK 8u121 on Debian Jessie with Spring-Boot 1.5.9 (Spring Framework 4.3.13). As far as the idle-timeout concerns (and I understood SharedBlockingCallback correctly) it indefinetily blocks due to `-1` as a timeout for WebSockets, hence the WAITING instead of TIMED_WAITING status of the threads. The idle timeout for the QueuedThreadPool is on 5000ms seconds, though. 
Hi,  hmm, I could not find a configuration file for the karaf stuff. However, I checked out https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public and modified https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-public/blob/master/assemblies/nexus-base-template/src/main/resources/overlay/etc/karaf/config.properties I added `co.elastic.apm.agent.*` to the boot delegation. Hmm, funny thing is, that with any agent below version 1, it works without modifying the sources from nexus oss.  What I am not understanding is, why is the javaagent since version 1 impacting booting with `bootdelegation`. To be fair, I am not a Java developer, so there is a lot of things I won't understand ;) 
Apparently it was my phone.....chrome gave a similar error when I tried to download the debug build so I did a hard reset and now it works >_>`  So, for now I'm closing this bug, awesome response time though, and I like what I see of the new changes 
No, I don't have a way to reliably trigger the crash now.

Dear Yusuke Sugomori,  Thanks for your reply. I'm a novice of deep learing and read your C code very carefully as a guidence for my studying.   May I ask you some more questions? 1. In your demonstration example, the training samples are all binary, like (1,0,1,...), does the code deal with the real-valued input(like (0.2,0.5,1.4,...))? If not, how should I adjust the code? 2. During the fine-tuning phase, you only update the parameters of the Logistic Regression classifier with parameters of the prevous levels     fixed, is this a popular way? or you just implement it for simplicity? If I want to update all the parameters together in the fine-tuning phase,  any good suggestions?  Thanks again, hope to get your reply soon.

Various errors occur, some while creating an NPC with the template. Some while creating the template itself and some while making an NPC with a template. And the skins never carry on to the NPCs created using the template.  This is my template file. the bandit2 template works in all ways but the others all give various errors.  I hope this is helpful [templates.txt](https://github.com/CitizensDev/Citizens2/files/504464/templates.txt)

I think you're right, @jgfidelis . I just checked and sharing directly from Spotify to stories (Spotify has a direct IG share feature) has a similar issue. It brings me to a login screen, and I never end up being able to share the song even after logging in (no "unable to share, must be logged in" message in this case though).  You can bet that if it's breaking Spotify's sharing that it's a bug. 
I do not think it is related to Buycraft per se, as I seem to get it with other scheduling mods and plugins - Pixelmon seems to suffer similarly. Here's the log from one of these crashes. [2018-07-12-1.log](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/files/2191499/2018-07-12-1.log)

The content of the annotation @ConditionalOnClass is wrong.  I pushed already a fix, but we need new jars.
My bad, the problem was caused by having both redhat.vscode-xml and gorkem.vscode-xml extensions installed. VSCode couldn't know one was the evolution of the other. Closing
That is exactly what I expected - appendices should behave pretty much like part. I have a long book, and the bookmarks look weird if chapters are wrapped and appendices are not. But so far, at least with DITA OT 1.5.3, I couldn't get an extra heading. The appendices element either caused the transformation to fail or it didn't change the output at all (neither the TOC nor the bookmarks).. Is there anything I can do right now to just get a heading from the transformation (currently I'm adding a bookmark in Acrobat)? 
My Scala version is 2.10.4 - but thanks @Databean, the commit solves the problem indeed. vgrevendo

**whrwhr446**  Download or clone project using git desktop instead of downloading zip file. The exported  zip file cause errors while building project.
It does seem to be short articles that get skipped, now that you mention that.  It also seems to happen when the current article is long enough that it goes off the length of the browser window.  If I can see the article in the window, it doesn't seem to get skipped.   
Sorry, I put it wrong. My idea is not to crash the app when Non-IOException occurred inside interceptor. 
There might be legitimate reasons why a user might keep a property unselected in their map? Maybe the current source documents don’t have all the data to fit the canonical model?  We can call attention to the unselected properties in the map if we think the user really might not want this, perhaps before they harmonize.  If we think users may prefer the system making default mapping choices for them, we can give them the opportunity to choose that behavior, or at a minimum make it clear that it is happening in the generated code.  Right now the user is making one choice in the UI (don’t map these properties) and the system is doing another (we’re going to map these unmapped properties automatically). That doesn’t seem right.  @bsrikan, I assumed the "Unassigned or Unmatched Mappings" section was for mappings that, for whatever reason, were disconnected from an entity. 
It actually happens during any code, even when using $h to home the machine. I'll make a video and write in my settings if that helps.

Hi,  I tested using the latest SNAPSHOT, same issue (wether with spring boot 2.0.0 or 2.0.1). Also, the case appears each time (for the first as for the following).  What do you want to say when you say "Does it affect your WebFluxes" ?  I can take some time to prepare a reproducible case to give you more facilities to figure out the problem if you need it ?  Thank you for your help.
Mmmm I cannot reproduce it so let's say this is fix (the copied value are now the right one)
I dont seem to have that file in my neo4j setup 
@eivantsov I'm running Docker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40.  Part of the issue is that this machine is attached to a corporate network, and IT has linked /home to be part of an LDAP configuration. Based off of ongoing discussions, it's possible we will not be given permissions to /home.   I had figured that the reason Docker was throwing that error was because it's trying to use the on-disk `/home/user/eclipse-che` as a volume, which I was trying to configure to be elsewhere, perhaps `/usr/local/home/user/eclipse-che`. 
Should I put a video of text shaking on hover ?

@joeygrover - Sure, Steps are basic RPC communication. Our automation test suite sends RPCs and performs some actions on HeadUnit like button presses, app startup/transition which would trigger some `onHMIStatus` updates as well. But i am fairly confident that this issue would be visible even without any HMI action.   Important step to reproduce this issue is to prolong app(RPCs request/response) usage to about 2-3 hours with a mix of RPCs.   This issue does have an occurrence of about 5-10 % and occurs randomly. So I understand that it can be a little tricky to identify the issue, but we can run the tests as per specific steps which might help isolate the issue for you. Do you have any recommendations on that?
All my tests were successful. Thanks for fixing it!

1) For example, dependencies of `cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview` such as the android support library.  See:  https://github.com/crosswalk-project/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview/issues/207 https://github.com/crosswalk-project/cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview/issues/205#issuecomment-371669478  2) Not sure.  3) In your `config.xml`, add:  ```     <plugin name="cordova-plugin-device" spec="^2.0.2">         <variable name="android-minSdkVersion" value="19" />         <variable name="android-targetSdkVersion" value="28" />     </plugin> ```  Then `cordova add platform android`.  Build files are generated for an `android-27` compile target.

I updated my little test project to 6.0.0-beta2 and it still fails. Have you cloned it and ran 'gradlew test', or do you have any other test case?

In that case we should add some error. Looks like the best option 
If I remember correctly the main problem was that there was use on a stack variable after it went out of scope.  These functions are where it occurred.  5: RuleContext* ParserRuleContext::addChild(RuleContext *ruleInvocation) { children.push_back(ruleInvocation); return ruleInvocation; }  6: void Parser::unrollRecursionContexts(ParserRuleContext *parentctx) { _precedenceStack.pop_back(); _ctx->stop = _input->LT(-1); ParserRuleContext *retctx = _ctx; // save current ctx (return value)  // unroll so ctx is as it was before call to recursive method if (_parseListeners.size() > 0) { while (_ctx != parentctx) { triggerExitRuleEvent(); _ctx = dynamic_cast<ParserRuleContext *>(_ctx->parent); } } else { _ctx = parentctx; }  // hook into tree retctx->parent = parentctx;  if (_buildParseTrees && parentctx != nullptr) { // add return ctx into invoking rule's tree parentctx->addChild(retctx); } }  I believe somehow child went out of scope during the recursion process.
challenges.yml as its no longer in config.yml :P

We encountered if when we used it continuously for half an hour. This cannot be consistently reproduced. Please try using studio continuously and it might get reproduced.   
I don't see that option anywhere? 
What crazypants? I do not know a mod or similiar called crazypants.  
Ah, there is the error log. Was looking at 'adb logcat', but that didn't show anything. It is some kind of authorisation error. If I disable authorisation on the /RPC2 mount, it works without a problem. The password is correct. If I uninstall everything, install 2.0.1, do the configuration, it works. Upgrading to 2.1 with the same configuration, and it does not work.  I'm running a Debian 7 system, with rTorrent from the Debian repositories (rTorrent 0.9.2/0.13.2). Web daemon is with lighttpd. The webserver is using plain authentication with method 'digest'.  lighttpd config:  ```     auth.backend = "plain"     auth.backend.plain.userfile = "/home/www/rutorrent/rtorrent.pass"     auth.require = (         "/RPC2" => (             "method" => "digest",             "realm" => "",             "require" => "user=daniel",         ), ```  Webserver log:  188.90.XXX.XXX ***\* - [19/Nov/2013:12:10:24 +0100] "POST /RPC2 HTTP/1.1" 401 351 "-" "aXMLRPC"  Transdroid log:  Transdroid 2.1.0 (209) rTorrent settings: http://daniel@****:80  Connection and error log: 29 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:07 CET 2013 -- 3 -- Boot signal received, starting server and rss checker background services 30 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:07 CET 2013 -- 3 -- rTorrent daemon: Calling d.multicall with params [ main d.get_hash= d.get_name= d.get_state= d.get_down_rate= d.get_up_rate= d.get_peers_connected= d.... ] 31 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:07 CET 2013 -- 3 -- Boot signal received, starting app update checker service 32 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:08 CET 2013 -- 3 -- rTorrent daemon: de.timroes.axmlrpc.XMLRPCException: Invalid status code '401' returned from server. 33 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:08 CET 2013 -- 4 -- ConnectionError exception: Error making call to d.multicall with params [ main d.get_hash= d.get_name= d.get_state= d.get_down_rate= d.get_up_rate= d.get_peers_connected= d.... ]: de.timroes.axmlrpc.XMLRPCException: Invalid status code '401' returned from server. 34 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:17 CET 2013 -- 3 -- rTorrent daemon: Calling d.multicall with params [ main d.get_hash= d.get_name= d.get_state= d.get_down_rate= d.get_up_rate= d.get_peers_connected= d.... ] 35 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:17 CET 2013 -- 3 -- Ship the update service, as we already checked the last 24 hours (or to be exact at Tue Nov 19 11:13:54 CET 2013). 36 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:18 CET 2013 -- 3 -- rTorrent daemon: de.timroes.axmlrpc.XMLRPCException: Invalid status code '401' returned from server. 37 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:26 CET 2013 -- 3 -- rTorrent daemon: Calling d.multicall with params [ main d.get_hash= d.get_name= d.get_state= d.get_down_rate= d.get_up_rate= d.get_peers_connected= d.... ] 38 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:26 CET 2013 -- 3 -- rTorrent daemon: de.timroes.axmlrpc.XMLRPCException: Invalid status code '401' returned from server. 39 -- Tue Nov 19 12:00:26 CET 2013 -- 4 -- ConnectionError exception: Error making call to d.multicall with params [ main d.get_hash= d.get_name= d.get_state= d.get_down_rate= d.get_up_rate= d.get_peers_connected= d.... ]: de.timroes.axmlrpc.XMLRPCException: Invalid status code '401' returned from server. 
I have tested this in my emulator and actual device. So far, I have tested it in 7.0, 6.0. I am going to try to reproduce the problem in the app where the toast padding is correct to see if my theory that the activity theme has something to do with the padding. 
how do i get the log? 
@spencergibb  Attached the projects to replicate the issue, In this zuul routing order is not consistent for the same routes defined in embedded config (in zuul app) and config server yml configuration. ``` spring:   cloud:     config:       enabled: false ``` Toggling the above property in zuul, provides different routing order.  Please check and let us know how retain the routing order when the routes are served from config server.

I definitely didn't hold down the shift key when it happened. Also, during the AADL course it happened to almost everybody at some time. I have the impression that it happens after making many edits without closing the graphical editor. 
Yes, in my case, the remote address would be a duplicate. So it could have looked like: ``` "x-forwarded-proto": "https,https", "x-forwarded-port": "443,8443", "x-forwarded-for": "10.124.0.1,10.124.0.1", "forwarded": "proto=https;host=gw1.com;for=\"10.124.0.1:60520\"", "x-forwarded-host": "gw1.com,gw2.com:8443", "host": "msnext-108-service:8080" ``` I tried to find something that says that duplicates should be prevented, but I cannot find any spec or other implementation that mentions it. Can we tell why this behavior was implemented in Zuul?
Yes I get it work. You should change the description of the task `gwtDev` saying that it runs Super Dev Mode. 
I haven't been able to. The message "Processing " does appear, but around number 540, it simply hangs and stops checking. I've checked the file it hangs on, and the does not seem to have any issues (not corrupt, not 0B etc.).  The folders are located on a Samba share, perhaps that could be the issue? I'll try to check with a local folder some time later today. 
A number of small glitches, due to the fact that the blueprints changed - and blueprints were at the basis of the first stage of Quarry building. It's a bit fuzzy at the moment, I'll take care of it.

Yes, it shows the plugin but only a small part of the first comment and not the bottom link to see the rest of the comments. And the loading animation won't disappear.

Because I tried to reproduce on a VM and I can only reproduce with remote caching. The same failure happened before, it was green for a while after I updated the cache key https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/commit/2e04e41a934a64e69473d2e80899d8c11958083f, now it appears again.
Yes we did. In the ISWC paper we (i) defined the notion of matching triples for a given triple pattern and (ii) formalized triple pattern selectors in terms of this notion. By these definitions, a triple (ex:Bob,foaf:knows,ex:Alice) is _not_ a matching triple for the triple pattern (?x,foaf:knows,?x) and, thus, this triple must not be included in the data of the TPF of that triple pattern.  BTW, what we did not capture formally is the possibility of omitting elements of a triple pattern in a request.  @RubenVerborgh  
> @k7aravind 1.8.1 is the latest production release (1.7.x should be considered deprecated). Can you tell us what error you are getting?  Can you please tell me how can i see the logs. This is what happens, when I try to open the jnlp file through command prompt using 'javaws abc.jnlp', it works. But if I try to open using windows 'Open With' option, it doesn't. It does not even open any command prompt to  logs things that are happening. This happens only in 1.8 version. Whereas in 1.7.x, even when I open jnlp with 'Open With' option, it immediately opens command prompt where I can see the logs and icedtea-web looks to be working fine.
Thanks @farodin91 I try to build Janusgraph on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS which is hosted on an Azure VM. Maven 3.6.0 and OpenJDK 1.8.0_191 were used. I don't have docker installed on that machine.
@mattrjacobs yeah, just fired a build... I'l report in like half a hour... 
No, that's what I want to avoid.  I thought the "Could not find common ancestor for..." comes from some inconsistency between Mirakel and taskd database. So I tried a fresh download for Mirakel.  
SonarQube: Version 7.9.2 esql-sonar-plugin: Version 3.0.0  I will try out version 3.0.1

It happens with any block I think (Coal generator, Double Crasher, Double Furnace, Atomic Reconstructor confirmed). Here's the crashlog (player tried to place ExUtil thing): http://pastebin.com/gTjGNxJ2 
Would we have to bump the grpc version in google-cloud-cpp?
Apparently it was my phone.....chrome gave a similar error when I tried to download the debug build so I did a hard reset and now it works >_>`  So, for now I'm closing this bug, awesome response time though, and I like what I see of the new changes 
@steve-bate Yes, this solves the issue for me. Many thanks.  However, I also consider the substring-check a bug :-)
Blackview BV6000
Both clusters: source and destination have 0 counts, I will check again if they are in V, but certainly the move didn't work as expected and I tried twice in freshly imported db. I will import the database again to see what is exactly happening. Then I can provide the dump that I am using so you can find why this is happening.

The server: OS: Ubuntu server with no GUI/desktop CPU: Intel quad-core i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz Memory: 24 GB RAM, 10 of which are given to the MC server in the launch script  I am currently running a build without naturally spawning dinosaurs, and so far it does seem much improved. I will have to wait to confirm, as oftentimes the performance doesn't drop until we've played for a day or two (again, leading me to suspect over-spawn).
oh.sorry, the url must be used with a token which will be expired,and the app still in the developing state..... i think just find a gif url instead as well. 
Since I update to version 4.0.
Yes, I think something like this is the right thing to do. Definitely the first part, as we discussed with @shiffman, it should start like Java mode menu. And it makes sense to only have the "debug" console there when a user wants it. I'm not sure about opening a separate window, but I don't have a good alternative right now.  
No, I don't have the phone in my hands (I'm just talking to my girlfriend who is experiencing the bug), so adb can't be used. Will alogcat be useful? 
Sample emailed.  Thanks.
 Yes, I had diddled with "Customize the entry types."  And by mistake, I had "pubstate" twice in the Book entry type (as is seen in my screenshot above).  When I deleted the extra "pubstate", the display looks correct, and the shorthand displays correctly in the Shorthand field.   So, it's a recondite buglet.  If you have a field twice in your data entry tab, then you may see artefacts.  Thanks, Dominik  JabRef 4.0-dev--snapshot--2017-07-19--master--2f12fecfb Linux 4.8.0-58-generic amd64  Java 1.8.0_131   ![screenshot from 2017-07-24 20-50-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/762246/28539371-b41f5a3a-70b1-11e7-81dc-e0dfaa1c80a8.png)

Still the same error. But maybe now the world is corrupt... 
Hi. Yes sorry I couldn't remember the exact name for the "entity exporter" I was reffering to the "World Item Exporter".  I'm glad that you have been able to reproduce the bug and I hope you will find a way to correct it because your mod is really cool and usefull.  Cheers
Maybe Better with mods changes it.
I just tested and now it works perfectly now. It would be great to see a new release with this fix in maven central soon. Thanks for fixing it !

@jameskleeh I got it working by removing the annotation processor path for `micronaut-validation` from the `maven-compiler-plugin` and all my validations still work.

Mmm I cannot reproduce it, I download the last release and it's not there anymore.   Yesterday I noticed a switch between arcball and freefly even if I didn't trigger it. And then if you double clicked (to reset the view with a top view) it stayed in an already oriented configuration  Let's assume it was a very weird configuration. I close the issue and I will double check if it rehappens.
I haven't tested this but I think this bug appears in following code: ` IFE 0, 1   SET a, [SP + 100] ` In that case emulator is skipping and tick()->tick_skip()->getInstructionLength() will return wrong instruction length. I suppose it would next try to use 100 as instruction opcode and do something evil. 
Minecraft: 1.12 EvilCraft: 1.12-0.10.30
Restlet JSE 2.3.0 from the maven repo. I'm also including (using gradle):     compile group: "org.restlet.jse", name: "org.restlet.ext.json", version: "2.3.0"     compile group: "org.restlet.jse", name: "org.restlet.ext.fileupload", version: "2.3.0"     compile group: "org.restlet.jse", name: "org.restlet.ext.guice", version: "2.3.0"     compile group: "com.google.inject", name: "guice", version: "3.0"  Also, using the internal server, although this is a testcase, so I'm connecting right into the Application instance. The test cases (client) are in the same source tree as the server, so it's all the same version. 
4.0.80 works fine so permissions shouldn't be the issue. Sponge config is set to `config-dir=plugins` and `plugins-dir=plugins`

Yeah it happens with only TR and JEI! But I also found sth: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12701912/26840839-cdfc5042-4ae7-11e7-9225-234f38204f88.png) There is the same problem but with a subscript 9 in this recipe.
I don't think this is a BigQuery client issue.  The BigQuery client simply tripped over the underlying issue that StringEnumValue isn't safe.
Thank you both for responding. Happy to hear that a fix may be in the works. (My current dubious work-around is to unequip the backpack (which **doesn't** pop into my inventory, incidentally) then teleport to the RF Dimension using the Matter Transmitter)  Anyhow, love your mods guys. 
Found it, simple cause: if the map difficulty name is empty string, then it didn't create a new list because the if condition checked against an empty string. So whenever you select a map with no difficulty name, it would throw a null pointer. I made some maps to test the slider things I did, and didn't bother giving it names so I had such maps in the list. (I didn't realise version meant difficulty.)
Reproduce steps: 1. Do packet capture with `wireshark` or `tcpdump`; 2. Client connect to web socket server implemented by vertx; 3. On client web socket side, call `close` which would trigger a `CLOSE` type frame to server. 4. Stop packet capture 5. From packet capture, vertx server didn't echo `CLOSE` type frame back to client as expected. It just finished the tcp connection.  From code side, change Line 699 to the following debug code.    ```java ChannelFuture future = conn.channel().writeAndFlush(wsFrame); future.addListener(ChannelFutureListener.CLOSE); if(!future.isSuccess()) {   future.cause().printStackTrace(); } ```  After a client side close the web socket and a `CLOSE` frame was received. The `future.cause().printStackTrace();` would always output the following exception:  ``` java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: unsupported message type: WebSocketFrameImpl (expected: ByteBuf, FileRegion) 	at io.netty.channel.nio.AbstractNioByteChannel.filterOutboundMessage(AbstractNioByteChannel.java:266) 	at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AbstractUnsafe.write(AbstractChannel.java:877) 	at io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline$HeadContext.write(DefaultChannelPipeline.java:1371) ```  Hope this would help. 
Yes I get normal drops from zombies and skeletons, (bones, arrows, flesh, etc) just no heads.  I have custom mods installed, quite a few really, they include Solar Flux, buildcraft, villager trade tables, extra utils, elevator mod, enderstorage, forestry, autopickup, JEI and JER, minecolonies, weirding gadget, waystones, tech expansion and torcherino, and of course, woot.  I build the T4 factory and add Tier 3 upgrades for Rate, XP, Mass and Decapitate, as i said before I know power is no problem (High Tier solar panels) and I get Creeper Heads and Wither Skulls fine, but not the other 2.
[Example](https://feeds.betterfeeds.org/LinuxAndWhatnot.atom)  Atom is by far the better standard, but It will never take over RSS. It would just be nice for something to support it properly.

E.g. OpenShift Explorer view ASSERT: Have connection in OpenShift Explorer EXEC: Open context menu of the given connection  ASSERT: There is menu item with submenu called "New" EXEC: Click some menu item (e.g. Manage SSH Keys...) EXEC: Open context menu again ASSERT: There is not any menu item New, which was in the context menu before looking up in context menu for the previous menu item (that Manage SSH Keys...).  It probably seems to be eclipse problem bcs. of comment in SWTBot source code: "in e4, if the context menu contains submenus it appears as disposed after detection, so we use the contextMenuHelper" but their solution seems to be ineffective. 
@SubhrajyotiSen If I recall correctly, we implemented “Erase from notification” because Android didn’t support app actions.  Furthermore, notifications are supposed to be highly contextual (ie. they should appear after a certain conditions have been met and can easily be dismissed), rather than appearing permanently. So our original use of the notification seems hacky.

Just got a similar crash with a different mod set after adding environmental tech and base metals (and their dependencies).  Might be an issue with one of those two mods (I'd guess environmental tech... maybe a conflict with their basalt?).  I'll try a couple tests.

  I still have the problem. For sure it come from the GIS file (that I did not control and that was made "by hand") but it used to work like one month ago. There is one specific building that gives a problem.   Run AndorraABM.gaml and Display Experiment  Note 1: No problem to open this GIS in QGIS Note 2:  Please don't share those data  
I would think making the default level to only log WARN and above be more appropriate. That may need us to add logback configuration for the UI code:  https://www.baeldung.com/logback open to see what others think.,.... ? @mandy-chessell 
The game seems to be loading without Thermal Foundation. But obviously it show that this mod could not be found. On another note the dev build is been buling for 18 hours . I assume thats not normal?  
Just import a GPX file with lots of caches (I had 130 from the bug about the Texas challenge GPX file). I let it parse and store all 130 caches and cancelled the map import after 2/130. Nevertheless the map download would continue all the time in the logcat view and after several maps the 403 Forbidden errors by Google occured. I then had to kill the app to stop the download.  Yes, you can see it on an emulator. 
Well I can't seem to even replicate my issue in the DW20 pack anymore. After a few server restarts the labels are working fine. I'll be messing around a lot with the mod still, see if I can figure out what I did..
I don't know if this is the only bug in Proposition class but yes, i fixed that bug. I'm familiar with option for commiting+closing an issue but i thought (for some reason) that it will close it with this message too.

I can't reproduce it, unfortunately. I see this error coming from a few of my app users. They all have Android API 16.  Can something be build in the library, or do I have to check it in my app and show a normal dialog for API 16?

I knew I wasn't going to get around to it yesterday and I figured you were the most likely to care.  I can assign it to myself.  Keeping the build green is miserable enough as it is, I think flakes should be P1s (they are internally).  
Hi,  Thanks for investigating this issue. I tried it using EA last week, and today I tried CE 4.0.6 and the issue was the same.  The stacktrace hasn't changed. I also noticed that on loading DBeaver I get the following error: `Unable to retrieve the bundle from the URI: bundleclass://org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.application.addons.ModelCleanupAddon`  This occurs on all installations where I run the error (EA 4.0.5, CE 4.0.5, CE 4.0.6). However, I am running EE 3.8.5 and there is no such error, and I can also export to CSV just fine.  Thanks a lot.

Nope. I just had to deal with the issue yesterday and I used the workaround of changing all my sha256s in all my repositories, which works if github doesn't change their code again.
I have tried this before. As soon as I deactivate `reformat file` the issue is resolved
Sorry, forgot important details: OS: Debian Stretch (kernel 4.9.110-1) Diagram is open in DBeaver full window (screen size: 1280x1024)  trying to attach screenshot   
Yes, that would work - detect the illegal argument sooner. 
The shift-rightclick issue only seems to be happening with the Copper, Iron and Silver variant. Gold, Diamond and Obsidian works for me.  The items not dropping was a mistake of mine. They drop just fine. Sorry.
If PicoCli doesn't support us in this event, I suggest we update the documentation to show that the framework doesn't support trailing back slashes and ensure that they do not appear.  We should check if this is a product of the shell or java/picocli itself. I.e. running `java -jar .... "C:\temp\"` in the windows command prompt vs via intelliJ.
The `AppCompatApplication` (full source below) is what I'm using right now, so the bug is no a blocker for me. However, the provided `Context`can be in fact some custom instance of `ContextWrapper`, so getting resources from it directly would be a more bulletproof solution.  ``` java /**  * Based on {@link android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity}  */ public class AppCompatApplication extends MultiDexApplication {      private Resources resources;      @Override     public void onConfigurationChanged(Configuration newConfig) {         super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig);         if (resources != null) {             DisplayMetrics newMetrics = super.getResources().getDisplayMetrics();             resources.updateConfiguration(newConfig, newMetrics);         }     }      @Override     public Resources getResources() {         if (resources == null && VectorEnabledTintResources.shouldBeUsed()) {             resources = new VectorEnabledTintResources(this, super.getResources());         }         return resources == null ? super.getResources() : resources;     } } ```

Hi @johnscancella - many thanks for the quick response. My D: drive is a partition on a hard disk. I wasn't aware that the zip functionality has problems associated with it so this information is extremely useful as we're using zipped bags to add data into our digital preservation system (Archivematica) and I don't believe that our vendor is aware of these issues. If you could elaborate more on them I would be most grateful (or point me to somewhere I can find more information). Thanks for the workaround, I will share it with my colleagues.

@vRallev i'll do it tomorrow morning , no problem.
The issue should be resolved in Weatherlib 1.5.2. The test i made confirmed it anyway if you have time it would be nice if you can confirm it. Thx 
This is consistently reproducing the problem on my windows machine:  1) Open the CardiovascularDynamics model into a Project tab, click the Dependencies view. 2) Select the following codewords using the node selection tool: VrestRAd, VrestRAs, EminRA and EmaxRA (note these are all constitutive codewords) 3) Right click on one of the selected nodes and select "Extract Selected" 4) Name the new model and attempt to visualize its contents.   Hope that reproduces it on your end.  Might have something to do with all the nodes being constitutive.
For the Nether world, I just have it to be default.  I ran "/mv create skyworld_nether nether" and used that. 
No,they are different. When i remove an item from a RecyclerView the method of convert called then the gifDrawable set to gifImageView again and GIF stopped.when i  postDelayed set  gifDrawable set to gifImageView it works
@vmi ... thank you for looking into this! I tweaked the same test and increased the timeout for the popup...  [www-select-parent-window-1.zip](https://github.com/vmi/selenese-runner-java/files/300574/www-select-parent-window-1.zip) I have also included a screenshot of the IDE test output for your reference. Please let me know if this serves the purpose. 
My device are HTC One 801e (M7) phone, Android 5.0.2. and Nexus 5.0 emulator (Genymotion), Android 5.0.0. All the text is not styled correctly in my all devices. 
Seems to be fixed. Can no longer reproduce this in the current dev.
1 - My app should not show the counter of the characters 2 - Initially, the counter is not visible 3 - I start the mention view and displaySuggestions is called with display = true in RichEditorView.class 4 - I click at an item of in the mentionlist 5 - Again displaySuggestions gets called, however now the boolean of display = false 6 - Finally lineNumber 381 is called: mTextCounterView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);  I tried fixing this issue with a textwatcher and setting the visibility off myself. But that didnt work, because after clicking an item in the mentionlist the methods of the watcher do not get called    
Yes, will try. Will be back in a few hours. Thank you. 
> Yeah, we should definite have a consistent declaration and therefore change it to lowercase.  I would like to vote for this approach i.e. data type unification. Let's say that built-in types will be: camelCase. In this way, we have a clear separation from the custom types where they are forced to start with an uppercase letter.
Version of the runner is 2.4.1 and version of SonarQube is 6.0.   I have a feeling I need to update the runner and see how I go.

Sorry if my explanation wasn't clear enough. I use swift_library rule in my own project which is located in a different workspace than Bazel. I build it with pre-built bazel 0.4.0 from Homebrew. To load the rule I use: ``` load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/apple:swift.bzl", "swift_library") ``` but when I use it the build fails with error from the first post. If I add `xcrunwrapper` binding to my project's WORKSPACE file the build succeeds. I'm not sure if it's the intended behaviour that user should provide the binding or just using `load` should be enough.
StringType.Type.fromJson assumes that you have string data in json.  To get the value from a JSON doc, use:  Object value=fieldType.fromJson();  Then, you can translate 'value' to a LDAP compliant string.

If you are testing this through the Twitch Launcher, Twitch has the tendency to enable/disable other mods related or at least dependent on the one you disable/enable. An example is disabling JEI will disable Just Enough Resources and Twilight Forest (theres more too, but that's not important). Re-enabling JER will re-enable JEI, but re-enabling Twilight Forest does not.

Hey Thanks. I used onDestroy() in initState() working fine.
@vreixo Ok, I'll hold on release.  To reproduce: 1) I installed the current Google Play version of OTP Android as a new install 2) Planned a trip 3) Installed the new v2.1.0 APK (download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vzb24f4mqrg5hx4/opentripplanner-android-release-v2.1.0.apk)) over the Google Play version 4) Open the app  I don't believe I even planned a trip - if I did, it was by long-pressing and holding on map and setting End Location (start was My Location at USF).  Let me know if you're not able to re-produce it. 
Yeap, it's really working on 8.1. I'll add `index.html` again and close here. Thanks 
Strange, indeed.  Actually, Downloads is even better, because we have more things to be downloaded there.  Thanks!

Whenever I put the link as "Download" it forces the d to lowercase, but if I use "Downloads" it shows up just fine as uppercase. Can I put "Downloads" for now or should I keep investigating the bug?  — Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/kframework/k/issues/1033#issuecomment-57870178. 
classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:1.2.5.RELEASE")  So, yes it's 1.2.5.RELESE. Will check in few mins 1.3.0.M5 (how stable is it btw?) 
I now switched on version 4.3.61 and it it doesn't occur currently on that version. Maybe it fixed itself?
Hi. 1) Create a default Flutter 1.12.13 project. 2) Install the package ^0.1.7. 3) When running a dialog appears on the Android screen saying that my app has stopped. 4) if I remove the package the app runs normally. Only that.
With /omdebug on - after first trusted player add = Sucessfully added Name - second trusted player nothing happens and no message in chat or in console
I checked on the RR wiki and it states, that it added support for the IC2 mining laser. Therfore the bug can't really be on your side, it's probatly because your and IC2 exps laser apis differ. 
Cannot reproduce this either, so possibly it has been fixed by fbc723b58d73386d8deae9da66d8bdb1c6f6344f.
I have no clue... I played with constraints then I got this. I cannot seem to be able to reproduce it... :(
Yes I just tested it with commit `10ff2945f7` . It happens with any AppBuilder application (for example the Blank template). The debugging session starts and it instantly ends. Internally we get exception that the socket was closed on the other end. 
Don't have the span but if you see the implementation of memory storage in all-in-one (https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/master/plugin/storage/memory/memory.go#L74), we can see that when parent == span, no dependencies is counted so we must do the same here.
I've sent an email with all the requested details. Current situation is that the same issue occurrs with different users and from different devices. 
How do I get such _latest dev release_? 
Yeah sure:  ``` <?php declare(strict_types=1);  require_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';  abstract class AbstractTest {}  class Issue1057 extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase {     /**      * @throws ReflectionException      */     public function test()     {         // throws the error "Perhaps it was intended to mock it with getMockForAbstractClass method."         $this->getMockBuilder(AbstractTest::class)->getMockForAbstractClass();         // throws no error or warning         $this->getMockForAbstractClass(AbstractTest::class);          // why getMockForAbstractClass sucks          $this->getMockForAbstractClass(AbstractTest::class, ['a'], '', false, false, false, [], true);         // vs.         $this->getMockBuilder(AbstractTest::class)             ->setMethods(['a'])             ->disableOriginalConstructor()             ->disableOriginalClone()             ->disableAutoload()             ->enableArgumentCloning()             ->getMockForAbstractClass();     } } ```  The bottom part is just an addition to represent why enforcing getMockForAbstractClass is not always a good idea. It is really hard to recognize what each flag does. (without the show argument name feature of phpstorm)
Sorry, been busy, hopefully we will get to this today or tomorrow.  Thanks!
It works quite good Thanks a lot and sorry for the delay, Katja

> have you tried waiting a bit longer? There should be a timeout on this operation 30 or 60 seconds if I remember correctly.  Yes, I’ve tried leaving it alone for about 15 minutes – none of the dialogs change or go away.  > Do you have the exceptions logged into <workspace>/metadata/.log file? Can you show them?  There do not seem to be any related entries in the log. i have attached anyway [eclipse log extracts.log](https://github.com/nokia/RED/files/3454742/eclipse.log.extracts.log)  > Does this problem still occur after restart and resolving Git conflicts?  No – even just restarting eclipse is enough to not get any popups. After restarting eclipse, there are errors, but those do not seem to result in popups. I can reproduce the issue, using an external editor (Notepad++) instead of the GIT conflicts: 1.	Start with Eclipse open, no errors  2.	In external editor, modify one of the libraries (.py file) – adding an invalid line. After saving that, popups (“Progress Information” “generating libdoc…”) and (“Problem Occurred”  “Library specification generation problem”) are displayed. (if 2 libraries are modified at the same time, using editor’s ‘Save All’ function, the second popup title is “Multiple problems have occurred”) At this stage, the popups can be closed fine (I’m not sure why it needs to be a popup, instead of showing in eclipse problems view)  3.	Back in the external editor, make another change. Another “Progress Information” popup is displayed (modal, preventing user from interacting with other popups). At this point, I can’t find any way to recover without killing eclipse. Step 3 can be repeated, resulting in more and more modal popups.    Our eclipse project contains robot test suites as well as python libraries (supplying keywords that are used within the tests).  
If I use email and password instead, I get this by the way: ``` java.lang.NullPointerException 	at de.btobastian.javacord.entities.impl.ImplServer.<init>(ImplServer.java:187) 	at de.btobastian.javacord.utils.handler.ReadyHandler.handle(ReadyHandler.java:53) 	at de.btobastian.javacord.utils.PacketHandler.handlePacket(PacketHandler.java:80) 	at de.btobastian.javacord.utils.DiscordWebsocketAdapter.onTextMessage(DiscordWebsocketAdapter.java:182) 	at de.btobastian.javacord.utils.DiscordWebsocketAdapter.onBinaryMessage(DiscordWebsocketAdapter.java:273) 	at com.neovisionaries.ws.client.ListenerManager.callOnBinaryMessage(ListenerManager.java:259) 	at com.neovisionaries.ws.client.ReadingThread.callOnBinaryMessage(ReadingThread.java:241) 	at com.neovisionaries.ws.client.ReadingThread.handleBinaryFrame(ReadingThread.java:767) 	at com.neovisionaries.ws.client.ReadingThread.handleFrame(ReadingThread.java:607) 	at com.neovisionaries.ws.client.ReadingThread.main(ReadingThread.java:100) 	at com.neovisionaries.ws.client.ReadingThread.run(ReadingThread.java:59) ```

They are all there when you open the schematic but when you print, it prints everything around them but not the conduits themselves. If I turn off the schematic then all that's left are spaces. So it's replaced by space. Same thing for AE2 cables. Should they be rendering?
I will try some more tests to determine. I noticed it on the one I posted, so I mentioned it. I will follow up with some simpler test projects to demonstrate this.
I'd be ok with it as a stopgap - I'm a little unclear as to when the .sh file would be written though?  would it be part of the rpm install process?  in that case, we could probably just keep the old way of doing things (static file thats checked in with full set of commands)  and it would have the same effect on the user.  The issue that comes into play if we consider the cli truly pluggable is the idea of if the user drops additional libraries in they will not be part of the commandline completion, or if the user removes libraries the commandline completion will still have them.  My only thought is that as part of GeoWaveMain, it could write the file, but I think then it would be kinda weird in that the first time you run it you wouldn't have completion, it would only take effect after running.  Perhaps it comes down to, is commandline completion important to us, and is pluggable components important to us (how static are we willing to consider the components)? 
This looks like it has been fixed 
Hi @cbellone   I've checked and it seems that now the VAT mechanism does not fail, so the user can continue asking for their ticket while paying and requesting the invoice.   The only problem that I've seen is that what will happen if the lambda does not return proper information. For example, I've tried with an existing company with a confirmed valid VAT number, and the result we received it is not correct, because it is retrieved an empty address (----). Here you can see an screenshot:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2370634/36175156-d4aee54c-110e-11e8-9ee8-413319177fd4.png)  Of course the invoice created does not include info about the company, so from the legal point of view it is not correct :-/ Do you think it make more sense to have the field of the retrieved information enabled just in case if the user wants to change some data received from the lambda function?  Best,  
Re-tested on:   webOS Build: Afro 68 : "Send JSON" & "Send Message" tabs are enabled.  Note# I will keep this bug open to verify on latest master build once issue is fixed. 
Further testing, issue happens only when assigning (mech) techs to protomechs (not Battlemechs, or Aero Techs to Aerospace, BA Techs to Battle Armor or Mechanics to Tanks) in the Hanger tab.

Yes it does. Also, with DS installed, rain droplets appear under trees in the savanna biome when it should be raining. Is there some override for the savanna's weather in the code or in one of the json files perhaps?
@barbeau I agree, it's an unfortunate situation and it's specially not good because the app is failing completely on every device that it's installed because the Android geocoder does return results, although they're incorrect, not allowing the fallback geocoders to get triggered (now this is worked out but, as you know, this was not released yet).  I didn't have any time to investigate the issue because I'm on the final days to deliver my thesis (if I have still time to do it). So, I don't know about others. I just have read on stack overflow about one guy that had some kind of concerns about what were the limits and wrote to Google and had a reply describing the limits, was on the previous closed issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8218764/android-geocoder-quota-limits.  It's quite difficult to estimate the number of requests per second, I suppose that could be really a lot. There was one moment of the development that each walking/biking subdirection leg of each itinerary were queried when they had auto-generated names. If on each leg they were like 3 or 4 for example, with 2 or 3 walking subdirections by itinerary and 3 itineraries, 36 queries that are going to be in the same second if the app is so quick to do it (a new asynctask it's created and processed for each query) and for some trips may be more perhaps till 70-80 I guess, all depends on the number of unnamed points and with bike trips in Coruña, there were many.   Also in the first moment this queries were not cached and each time that the directions were generated  (each time this screen was opened or app restarted) the queries were sent again.  The good point is that this situation was less than 48 hours that I have dedicated to the development of   this feature.  The code is still on this branch https://github.com/vreixo/OpenTripPlanner-for-Android/tree/issue357 if you want to prove that this was not with bad intentions.

2.0.1-b354 I downgraded to an older version and /ci worked, then re-upgraded and now it's working oddly. 
Thank you @izeye , can't really provide a minimal project right now. In the meantime, not sure if thats related but I am still on Spring Boot 1.5 instead of 2.1.
Yeah, I know. Since app does not continue further, this logs are all we can get. Then log cat stops. Do you have any advise to be able to gel more logs.
 Surely!  Please view the attached. I included screen shots of what I'm seeing, as well  as showing it's the most recent. I believe it might be important to note that this is running Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) (which I dearly LOVE about this program, it's cross-platform awesomeness), but I think I saw the code that might be the issue in github.  I haven't taken the time to confirm, though. Seriously love this program.  Keep up the good work! Which reminds me...is there a place I can donate to support this great app? Thanks!

I think I cancelled it, but not sure at this point (was on vacation and not paying close attention), sorry.  I think the main thing I would have expected is for the size reporting to have a reasonable value, or switch to showing just bytes transferred if it can no longer calculate percentage. Since it appears to be tolerant of deletion (this is good I think) - at least the display should be corrected.  (There's also something to be said for having it only check size once -- does OC actually tolerate the file size increasing DURING the upload process?)  However, I can also see some justification for: If it's going to continuously check the size - it might be worthwhile to note the deletion and abort the transfer. (I can also see the opposite - OC could protect against an accidental deletion if the upload was already in progress...) No strong opinion on the behavior choice - but the UI shouldn't display a gibberish percentage when it doesn't know the file size any more.   Another option - grab the file size continuously as you are now, but cache the last successful one. If you can no longer determine the size, use the cached value going forward, but highlight that it's out of date in the progress UI in some manner.

It was encountered when connecting a new provider (a local instance of the Fusion Registry) web service.  The data was World Bank WDI.  I have encountered this issue before with the SDMX specification, where in a URL .. is treated as back up one level, so for instance https://www.google.co.uk/fish/../and/../chips/../search?q=test Is the same as https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=test  This was raised as a potential issue with the REST API, the work around was to use the all keyword.  I don't know why some fail and some pass - I have looked at the ABS and this query is written as: RES_DWELL/+.+.+/ABS?format=compact_v2  So this is why the '..' problem is not encountered.  The ISTAT fails as the query: data/IT1,18_114,1.0/..?detail=serieskeysonly  Is rewritten as  data/?detail=serieskeysonly  I'm not sure how the Eurostat query passes: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/SDMX/diss-web/rest/data/ESTAT,aact_ali01,1.0/..?detail=serieskeysonly

That's the example I'm trying to run. Don't you have any integration tests in your project? Why don't you put examples as integration tests into it and make sure they actually work? I couldn't find anything meaningful that's actually working regarding JavaCPP yet. You can run your github project in the travis integration test system for free simply by putting a one-line .travis.yml file at the top of your github project and activating the project on the travis service (see https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL/example-maven-project-setups). 
Doesn't get truncated, and doesn't _seem_ to break anything. Just weird because we have a limit and it's not enforced.

@maskit yes. that is the issue.
Yes it is a combined grammar that should generate a lexer.   It has been relatively easy to create this target. Dart e Java have a close semantic and syntax. Yes I'm simply manually translating from Java. The idea is to make the translate version work and then cleanup/dartfy the code. Now I'm working on various grammar tests. 
If I understand you correctly, telling AP to only use wifi (disable mobile data connection), but that you don't care for particular ones (no filter), would be rather complicated.  I think there should be a "Use mobile data connection" preferences. The summary tells the user that this allows mobile data to be used when wifi is not enabled and that it cannot be used together with the wifi filter (just to prevent confusion). When activated, this disables the wifi filter (because we cannot restrict android in that, then; android uses whatever connection it wants). 
- Yes, it was a clean install. - LineageOS: lineage-14.1-20171109-nightly - I tried two things: Clean install and a Titanium backup. Both failed to import or to restore the entries. - To my knowledge, I set the correct password, yes.  However! I did a complete reinstall of the app again in the mean time and manually purged the andOTP folder. This time, it seems like the import worked.  Closing the ticket and thank you for your time and the product. 😃 
I just realized in the screenshot that Erk's range for Physic is wrong. (_EDIT: But how can that be, this is from Duffle's broadcast, so wouldn't Duffle if he was using v1.4.0 see the correct range even if the opponent had the wrong version? Now I'm REALLY confused._) That clue leads me to believe that NeoFire99 was using v1.3 still (_gotta get cracking on #61 , my friend_) while Sarah was using v1.4.0 unless there's a regression in v1.4.0 (_which I'll be checking tonight_).  ~~Sarah doesn't have any error logs according to her but I'll double check.~~ I don't know the other player, and thus have no means of contacting them to harvest logs, someone else from the sub invited 'em via advertising on /r/fireemblem  We'll have to make due with what we have, I'm afraid.

The only thing I can recover from it is the following:  > -- Entity being rendered -- > Details: >     Entity Type: evilcraft.vengeanceSpirit (org.cyclops.evilcraft.entity.monster.VengeanceSpirit) >     Entity ID: 1423424 >     Entity Name: Vengeance Spirit >     Entity's Exact location: 133,50, 65,00, 338,50 >     Entity's Block location: World: (133,65,338), Chunk: (at 5,4,2 in 8,21; contains blocks 128,0,336 to 143,255,351), Region: (0,0; contains chunks 0,0 to 31,31, blocks 0,0,0 to 511,255,511) >     Entity's Momentum: 0,00, 0,00, 0,00 >     Entity's Passengers: [] >     Entity's Vehicle: ERROR NullPointerException: null > Stacktrace: >     at net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.RenderManager.func_188391_a(RenderManager.java:413) >     at net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.RenderManager.func_188388_a(RenderManager.java:362) >     at net.minecraft.client.renderer.RenderGlobal.func_180446_a(RenderGlobal.java:800) >     at net.minecraft.client.renderer.EntityRenderer.func_175068_a(EntityRenderer.java:1726) >     at net.minecraft.client.renderer.EntityRenderer.func_78471_a(EntityRenderer.java:1555) >     at net.minecraft.client.renderer.EntityRenderer.func_181560_a(EntityRenderer.java:1334) >     at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.func_71411_J(Minecraft.java:1077)  I will make sure to update the report if it happens again.

Hi Mahmoud,  I've done almost the same thing here, and it worked fine. 
https://gist.github.com/bjon/6d1737a42beab7362636  Hope gist works (only one test file + pom) 
I have added following extensions - GD Library - XDebug - Phar - Wddx - gmp 
    private void startAnimation(){         final Subscription animateSubscription = RxAnimations.enterWithRotation(mLoading, 1000, 200, 200, 100, 80).subscribe();      }      buildToolsVersion "25.0.3"     compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.4.0'     compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:1.2.5'     compile 'io.reactivex:rxandroid:1.2.1'  
Doesn't change anything, same exception. 
I added for 3.0.0.RC1 version. But you can try it for 3.0.0 and 3.0.1. [pom.zip](https://github.com/joinfaces/joinfaces/files/1799559/pom.zip)

Seems to be impersonation issue.

Hi, I've reset my local repository to ` * |   1909d80 (HEAD -> master, tag: 2.2.0, origin/master) Merge branch 'release/2.2.0'`  and rebuild. I don't get any NPE exceptions this time and analysis run fine.  The sample project is now on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/mresetar/monitoring-sample).   Previously I did get some NPEs which I was trying to fix wit the following fixes. - [This one](https://github.com/mresetar/sonar-esql-plugin/commit/9b6e16ba15e4172ef50830f2512019361d9bee89) was caused by parentFile being null. I'm curious why the pattern `parentFile.getName().matches("^[a-zA-Z]*(_App_v|_Lib_v)[0-9]")` is used? In my case there is no App_v or Lib_v ending in project name. Because parntFile was null I added the fix to look for .project file. I don't know was that fine or not. But fix is not working as expected with multimodule projects.  - [Second one](https://github.com/mresetar/sonar-esql-plugin/commit/9a595e2e6fe76e553ebd300684dfeb53da9241b0) is probably connected with first fix not working as expected.  I guess you can ignore this ones for now.  I've made also 2 changes to gitignore and gitattributes you may want to check out.  Thanks for the plugin!  Miro
As pictured, yes, you're right. Perhaps we should only check for blocks that cause suffocation.
Try using app with a Russian IP. It would then become "Тренды", even though the Android locale is English.
No, I don't even have americium yet. Both controller and casings are MK2. Maybe the recipe is registered as mk1 by mistake? 
@igarashitm  So - there's definitely an issue with custom field actions - could be the example is just out of whack. Look at these two files:  https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/atlasmap-maven-plugin/src/test/java/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActions.java https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/atlasmap-maven-plugin/src/test/java/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActionsModel.java  They are built automatically - mine are in:  /home/pleacu/git-clone/atlasmap/atlasmap-maven-plugin/target/test-classes/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActions.class  /home/pleacu/git-clone/atlasmap/atlasmap-maven-plugin/target/test-classes/io/atlasmap/maven/test/PaulsFieldActionsModel.class  I can copy them to a local empty directory and simply: ` jar cvf ../PaulsFieldActions.jar * ` I can successfully import them and enable them (io.atlasmap.service.my.PaulsFieldActions).  My custom transform appears in the 'Add Transformations' pulldown but I get this when I use it: ` Couldn't find a metadata for transformation 'Expression' ` which is weird.   The good news is that I can build/ import/ enable/ use Bicycle.jar  https://github.com/atlasmap/atlasmap/tree/master/atlasmap-maven-plugin/src/test/java/io/atlasmap/maven/test/Bicycle.java   If you can take a look at the PaulsFieldAction java files to see if they're wrong that would be great. :)
Sorry for the confusion.   When selecting double slab as a building material, the preview shows Double (smooth) Stone Slabs, even if the original block was Double Cobblestone Slab or Double Stone Brick Slab. Not quite sure what the tool expects in player's inventory, but in creative mode it actually places Double Stone Slabs.  Will post a screenshot later.
@DoNotSpamPls this happens, if someone sets OP status asynchronously. This is purely bukkit implementation issue. Solutions: 1. Don't use that asynchronously 2. Replace PermissibleBase internal HashMap with ConcurrentHashMap So...
Ews Java has two Base64 classes (Base64EncoderStream and Base64) for reasons unknown. Base64 seems to work just fine, but a third party library may do the trick as well. I haven't used Guava, but I've heard good things. Apache Commons would be a candidate as well. I don't think Java 8 is viable. It's too new and isn't widely used.

@opticod  yes sure :) 
It does break there too. If it helps at all, here's the code that triggers the error: https://github.com/bensku/Skript/blob/31995d1b5d613a7567176c513a64d6286c55120c/src/main/java/ch/njol/skript/lang/SkriptParser.java#L1095-L1099
@ctron That emulator does work better, but there are two issues. One, it appears the "org.eclipse.kura.example.beacon.scanner" is selected to run, this should be deselected. Two, the persistent directories (snapshots/ and data/) are created in the kura/distrib folder. I am not sure they belong there. Historically these were kept in the workspace directory.  I also think we should clean up the existing launch configurations. There are too many and likely confusing to new comers.  @pgufAtIBM It would be interesting to get your feedback on using Oomph on a Windows platform. We have only tested on OSX/Linux. I would start with a clean install as I think Problem 1 could be causing a lot of the errors. To get around the error, you need to set the "Eclipse Kura Git repository:" variable to "HTTPS (read/write)". The "Git (read/write)" option only works if you have entered your git credentials in the Eclipse IDE previously.   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1392274/22265648/89ef4eee-e242-11e6-98b3-e415a69b069a.png) 
So, I think that `X 1 hour or less before Y` _would_ be `true` if `X` is at the exact same time as `Y` (because I said an hour or less, and 0 hours is less than 1 hour). The more that I think about this case, the more that I think it overrides the exclusive definition of the before. In fact, I think it's even broader than I initially proposed above; consider `X 1 hour before Y`. Intuitively, if `X` is exactly 1 hour before `Y`, it should return true, but based on the exclusive definition of before, it should return false.  In other words, I think the relative qualifiers should override the exclusivity of the before/after comparison operator in all cases, not just where the two boundaries meet. Thoughts?
Eric, thanks for checking this. My environment is Firefox 62 on Ubuntu 16.04.  The steps to reproduce: 1. Install and run an instance locally, following the instructions from here: https://www.apicur.io/download/ 2. Open https://localhost:8443/studio/, create an API, open it (https://localhost:8443/studio/apis/1/editor) and create some paths 3. Open the Source tab, make some change that should be visible in the Design view without switching the views, open the Design tab. ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22968420/46124288-ba900280-c212-11e8-9e21-1f5ee8de678c.png) 4.

Sorry - I found a workaround: save the SQL file in the editor under a different name and the issue went away. It it happens again I will for sure make a video.
Thanks for the fast fix! Do you want me to test any specific snapshot build or shall I build it from the latest source?   
i removed all other mods, and made a whole new mc directory to install it in, but still crashes, ill reinstall jei to see if that fixes it.
forge 14.23.5.2847 DankNull  1.6.80 we are playing minecraft 1.12.2
I've found the bug : it's the worldguard lock.   Before (in 15.7 DXL version) the players could interact with locked DXL sign, not now :(   Have you change anything in this behaviour? :p 
Sorry, I tried to use the 1.7.10 dual wielding system, but it not work in 1.12.2 version because the mod use the minecraft native dual wielding system.
Hi @Micks29 no worries, I have just created it so we won't forget about those strings. The terms are exactly the ones used by Google for the Palette class. 
Mech & Magic.  Im almost willing to bet sponge I just want sure of your position on sponge support.  
It occurs on both dev-37c and dev-36.
Thanks! Name of run configuration is "testmain" or "test" because of checking function right now.  <img width="1075" alt="screenshot" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/301692/10992711/e6f6f4b6-84ab-11e5-9dfb-1eb15d5ac8ea.png"> 
I'd have to ask, I know the capsules are supposed to be consumable, they're only made of wax after all. I want to say I remember getting the cans back a long time ago, but this was 1.6.4, could've just been other mods assuming to give back empties.
Yup. 
Unfortunately, I can't give you the real file I worked with. Instead I will give you a modified version where I set all pixel values to 1 and then cropped the image to a reasonable size, you can find it here: https://gist.github.com/burgerga/db94e602aa67b93bcc3d#file-synthetic_small-ome  Steps to reproduce: - Open in Fiji - Image > Color > Split channel - Analyze > Colocalization -> Coloc 2   - Unselect all algorithms except "Costes' Significance Test"   - Press OK 
@ronblum I'm seeing the same thing you are, previously run & not cleared chunks can be queued, while not previously run chunks & run but cleared can't be queued.
Moving this to https://github.com/ConchordanceProject/ConchordanceWeb/issues/54 
OK, apologies for being vague. In order to invoke the issue, in my pom I specify:  gwtquery 1.4.3-SNAPSHOT enhance-plugin 1.0.5  The issue is that when I drag an element, in IOS I just see RETTT in the console many times. This console message is generated in com.google.gwt.query.client.plugins.events.EventsListener, in it's onBrowserEvent() method.  I tried it on my Nexus 7 and no issue, but on my old ipad IOS 8.1.1, the drag doesn't work, and when I attach the ipad to my IMac, I see the RETTT in the console.  **\* What is quite interesting is that this issue even shows up when I test in SDM mode in Chrome with Touch emulation enabled. When I select Nexus 7 emulation, no problem, but if I select iphone6 or ipad 1/2, I have the issue.  So is it related to my .gwt.xml ?

It can be usefull. We received some informations about your problem.  I have no crash on Android 6.0, I'm going to check on your version to see if I have the same problem. Have you tried to uninstall/install the app in beta2 ? 
Thanks for your reply! I am using openstack4j-core-2.0.2-SNAPSHOT. Below are the function calls.   ``` public OSClient OSAuthentication() { os = OSFactory.builder().useNonStrictSSLClient(true)             .endpoint("https://xxxxxxxxxxx/v2.0")             .credentials("xxx","xxxx")             .tenantName("xxxxxxxxx")             .authenticate();      return os; } public List<? extends SwiftObject> getAllObjects(String containerName) {     List<? extends SwiftObject> objects = os.objectStorage().objects().list(containerName);     return objects; }  public void addContainer (String containerName){     os.objectStorage().containers().create(containerName); }  public String addObject(String containerName, String objectName, File  file ){     String etag = os.objectStorage().objects().put(containerName, objectName, Payloads.create(file));     return etag; } ```  Maven dependency   ```     <dependency>         <groupId>org.pacesys</groupId>         <artifactId>openstack4j-core</artifactId>         <version>2.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>     </dependency>      <dependency>         <groupId>org.pacesys.openstack4j.connectors</groupId>         <artifactId>openstack4j-httpclient</artifactId>         <version>2.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>     </dependency> ```  Thanks Taj 
Hi,  Great. Thanks for taking this issue in account.  For the first crash, it is complicated because the Galaxy S5 is on LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2).   This is the only device with which I have this issue.
I had this plugin on my server previously, and it worked fine. I had an NPC going from one city to another, it has to be a recent change. 
No, the issue is on our side :) 
Yes it does! I just tested it with a new Server: _Minecraft: 1.8.9 SpongeAPI: 4.2.0-SNAPSHOT-79f9c8e SpongeVanilla: 1.8.9-4.2.0-BETA-348_  Should i close it here then and create a new issue it in the Common Repo? 
Yes of course.  It was during a game of EDH with 3 players. One of the players casted his Gonti Lord of Luxury targeting me. He got the wurm and then casted it. When the wurm died and went to my graveyard, I then returned it to my hand. After this was done, the wurm was not castable. It did not appear as a castable option as the rest of the creatures in my hand for the rest of the game.
Unfortunately stack trace seems to be not logged by jenkins-control-plugin - it just displays error message in red "balloon". It seems to be when parsing xml from Jenkins (but I don't know which, the main one looks "normal" for me). The same problem occurred in an alternative hudson monitor - and I attach stack trace from it.  ``` e = Error on line 1: White spaces are required between publicId and systemId.

@ns1123  Hi, I still not to start worker or any setting for worker. I am trying to run master with this config and encounter this error. Thanks.
> Which flag are you using? speed or cruiseSpeed?  Speed  I have it on 0.5 
Thx for pointing me to the calculation function. I'll try hunting the bug ;)  It's somehow strange only on the Nvidia Shield K1 (7" / 2015 / 7.0) there is this problem.  I'll send you a merge request or a sample project if I can't find the issue.  Thx!
Ok, I came up with this: ``` command /test [<text>]:  	trigger: 		if arg-1 is "get": 			give player a diamond sword #Sword 1 			give player a diamond sword named "<reset>Useless sword" #Sword 2 			give player a diamond sword named "<reset>Useless sword" with lore "test" #Sword 3 			give player a diamond sword named "<reset>Lightningsword" #Sword 4 			give player a diamond sword named "<reset>Lightningsword" with lore "test" #Sword 5 			give player a wooden sword #Sword 1 			give player a wooden sword with lore "Test" #Sword 2 			give player a wooden sword named "test" with lore "Test" #Sword 3 			stop 		if arg-1 is "a": 			remove all diamond swords named "<reset>Lightningsword" from player's inventory 			message "Done!" 			stop 		if arg-1 is "b": 			remove all wood swords with lore "Test" from player's inventory 			message "Done!" 			stop 		if arg-1 is "a2": 			loop all items in player's inventory: 				loop-item is a diamond sword named "<reset>Lightningsword" 				remove loop-item from player's inventory 			stop 		if arg-1 is "b2": 			loop all items in player's inventory: 				loop-item is a wooden sword with lore "Test" 				remove loop-item from player's inventory 			stop ```  When I executed "/test a",  Sword #1 and #4 were removed (should be Sword #4 and #5)  When I executed "/test a2",  Sword #1 was removed (should be Sword #4 and #5)    When I executed "/test b", Sword #1 and #2 were removed (should be Sword #2 and #3)  When I executed "/test b2",  Sword #1 was removed (should be Sword #2 and #3)    - I tested this on Paper 1.14.4 (Skript 2.4) and Paper 1.15.1 (Skript 2.4.1).
I tried with both upgrade and doing a fresh install on the Nextcloud app. It could be to do with the odd file-system layout on the original fairphones. The internal nand is partitioned into a 1GB "Internal Storage" and a 13GB "Phone storage" (this is before you add an SD card).  https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/201327645-What-is-the-storage-layout-of-the-Fairphone-1-  I previously had the Nextcloud app on the "Phone storage" internal partition.
No additional information, it's easy to reproduce. Steps are provided above. 
Correct, these are simple queries without GROUP BY.  The query looks something like this:  ``` SELECT * FROM test WHERE name = 'joe' AND active = 'YES' ORDER BY _id LIMIT 60; ```  I tried with CLUSTERED INTO 5 SHARDS and CLUSTERED INTO 1 SHARDS and hit the problem both ways.  Here's the CREATE TABLE with the fields taken out:  ```  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "doc"."test" ... CLUSTERED INTO 5 SHARDS PARTITIONED BY ("testfield") WITH ( "blocks.metadata" = false, "blocks.read" = false, "blocks.read_only" = false, "blocks.write" = false, column_policy = 'dynamic', "gateway.local.sync" = 5000, number_of_replicas = '1', "recovery.initial_shards" = 'quorum', refresh_interval = 1000, "routing.allocation.enable" = 'all', "routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node" = -1, "translog.disable_flush" = false, "translog.flush_threshold_ops" = 2147483647, "translog.flush_threshold_period" = 1800000, "translog.flush_threshold_size" = 209715200, "translog.interval" = 5000, "unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout" = 60000, "warmer.enabled" = true )  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "doc"."test" ... CLUSTERED INTO 1 SHARDS PARTITIONED BY ("testfield") ... // everything else the same ```  And here is the TRACE from io.crate.operation.collect:  ``` [2016-02-18 23:36:36,234][TRACE][io.crate.operation.collect.ShardCollectService] [aF5NXC6GRnOey1yGLS2h9A][[.partitioned.test.0424ihi1][0]] creating OrderedDocCollector.

As mentioned above this is happening on the master branch at the moment, so post 3.1 beta.
@ibuziuk Our goal is to achieve multiple users. The current phenomenon is that the Workspace Status changes directly from starting to stopped in which workspaces failed to start
whoops, forgot to mention.  1.7.10-1.8.2a, so I guess I'm a little behind now. Is that what's causing the multiplayer issue as well? 
1600x900. It's an arena game so it doesn't tell me at the start. At the end it says null. 
**Additional UX comments from others** - For short answer/essay items, it might not be immediately obvious to contestants that they must click the `Answer` button before answering. Suggestion: add placeholder text for the textbox e.g. "klik tombol Answer untuk mengisi jawaban", or make clicking the disable textbox activate the textbox - Suggestion: immediately set focus to the short answer/essay item textbox when clicking the `Answer` button - Display the input format restriction (e.g. "jawaban hanya boleh terdiri dari angka") to the contestant. Suggestion: we can put the input format description in the problem statement manually as a workaround for now - Make it clear to the contestant that he/she can still change the answer after clicking the `Submit` button. Suggestion: display a small help text - Suggestion: use Indonesian for the UI text, as some contestants may not be comfortable with English 
This doesn't work because offset and speed are part of the visual effect object. And it throws the same error as before.
I use the Apache one.  
As per specification https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662#section-2.3 I think, In this case, we should return with HTTP-200 active=false.  ```    Note that a properly formed and authorized query for an inactive or    otherwise invalid token (or a token the protected resource is not    allowed to know about) is not considered an error response by this    specification.  In these cases, the authorization server MUST instead    respond with an introspection response with the "active" field set to    "false" as described in Section 2.2. ``` 
Yes, switching to random mode results in two cases: _ nothing happen (almost the time) _ a message of retry appears (It's not a network problem as it works fine)  Now I use "Bing for Muzei"... could this means that is this plugin that cause my issue?  I have android KitKat (4.4.2)  Thanks
it is in #281 - can also be shipped with 1.3.1 if we want to (I vote yes). I'll leave the decision with you :) 
Hi @karldahlgren  it's working like charm , thank you so much .  but i found another issue , which is related to response Unicode . if the response is coming in languages like Arabic,China,Herdaw    it's coming like rubbish data.  can you please provide fix for this issue or it's related to Spring boot configuration?  Thank you.  
**what happens exactly?**  The app crashes if you search for a video a second time. (if search history is enabled)  **Describe step-by-step**  1. Go to the privacy session in the settings. 2. Uncheck "Disable Search History". 3. Restart the application. 4. Click on the "Search Video" button 5. Perform search of any video normally. 6. Click the "Search Video" button again.   Do it will crash, with (or without) Internet, because of Searsh History. If disable the resource of "Search History" will not crash.  **What is the version of your app?**  My Smartphone is um LG E470f with android OS version 4.1.2 kernel 3.4.0 The version of instaled Skytube is 2.964 (of 2019-09-09), downloaded per F-Droid per link [ https://f-droid.org/packages/free.rm.skytube.oss/ ]   This time I tried to improve my English essay post with the help of google translate to improve your understanding of this crash.
It's requiring me to mount them. And my bad I didn't use full paths.  
Android  version 4.0.3 and 4.0.4, 4.1.1 devices MB865,ADR6425LVW,C5170,SPH-D710, TrendMicroMarsAndroidSandbox and others.. I am using support-V4, but I am not sure it is the latest, it may be 3 months old or so. Even so, mixpanel project does not use support-V4, so I don't think is related to that.

Sorry for the delay Serge, I didn't get notified when you commented. My OS is Windows 10 (Enterprise) 64-bit.  
Yes that's right. I send them via TS Push Service.  
Yea, only for X seconds.. After some while, we can see him. It seems to Clientside problem.. I can't see him but my friend yes.. (and conversely) 
@clintongormley  - My apologies  , it was not _size , it was doc.score.  My concern was that , with scripting disabled , doc.score is working , but _score is giving "scripting disabled error". 
The reason I'm removing / adding back the scrollbar from the viewgroup is because I never was able to just hide it (neither setVisibility(GONE) nor setScrollBarHidden(false) works for me). So the crash occurs after I removed the view once, then simply try to add it back to the same parent. Simple call to View.remove() and View.add(). Nothing fancy here.
Cool, yeah that is indeed the call that I'm trying to make...
No, I died during daytime in the same chunk my spawn is (by falling from a high place).
Oh yes, that's a much more plausible theory indeed.  Did you push out a new version to the Play Store recently? I don't know how I can tell whether an update has happened recently - there's a notification about 5 updates having been installed but all different ones.  I have a 1.2MB backlog of adb logs, sadly first mention of k9 there is the exact crash above.  I'm trying to remember whether this was the first time I tried to use K9 today but don't know. My mailserver doesn't seem to log logins so I can't find out there either. :-/ 
Many thanks @MichaelRoeder , your suggestion fixed it. But I'm still having problems running gerbil. I want to add an annotator as a service through the web ui. This annotator is running locally on localhost, but when I add it I get a 405 error even though I can connect to it normally via standard web interfaces (e.g. the browser). Is there any documentation on how to add an annotator (via uri or in some other way)
I catch more info before exception. It may help you. I can see just one document to be pulled, but two tries to insert revision.   It happens, if i create document on a remote couchdb through REST API and this remote endpoint is continually replicated with CBL Android.   06-04 20:45:39.780

Thanks for your response, but I think there is no method of "setText()" in Bootstrap button plugin. In this case, I've tried to call "reset()" after "setText()", but thrown the same exception. 
I will do so later today and post it in the GitHub.

I´ve switched to one-request-per-layer now (at least for the geowebcache-layers). Had to extend the OpenLayers.WMSGetFeatureInfo-control for this a bit cause by default it only allows to either request only one layer or request multiple layers via drilldown (while the latter case leads to grouping of layers with the same URL).  Are there any plans for GeoWebCache to be able to handle GetFeatureInfo-requests for multiple layers in the future? I understand that this is not trivial when the layers are from different sources. This would mean that GeoWebCache would have to trigger separate requests instead of just cascading the request to a single source. In addition the responses from the separate sources would have to be combined into one response by GeoWebCache to send it back to the client. 
Hey,  The latest version of SyncThing has fixed this issue for me. It's got an uptime of 19 hours now, which is way more than it ever got before.  Just thought you should know, though, that the update completely wiped my Syncthing configuration. I'll be making backups from now on! :) 
Tested without EssentialsX on, the spawner still turns into a pig. Tested with latest experimental builds, spawner now places correctly! Thank you for fixing.
Appears to have been a problem with some changes I was making in appengine-plugins-core in the same workspace.  
Somebody touched MemoryStatusBar.java and made a change to how the value was being saved but didn't notice that there was a public method used to access it.  ;)  No worries.  Easy fix. 
Hi, I've run jProfiler and YourKit. This is where it gets weird, I cannot find any threads that are chewing CPU. Everything appears ok and EHCache doesn't appear in any of the dumps I've taken. But the presence of EHCache is all that is required to max out the CPUs. If I swap to JDK or Guava caches, the system stops chewing CPU. I'll give JTop a try. Thanks. 
Just leaked again. Don't know what i'm doing wrong. Seems like some times it stops to free the memory. I can see how it rises in steps of 100-300 MB.  I'm always multitasking because of slow opponents. Perhaps it can affect your tool? I'll try to debug the error. Can you recommand a debugger for java?

In fact I do not know exactly which one in the 2 following one returns a not so good result:         list<geometry> skeletons <- skeletonize(region_move);         list<geometry> skeletons_split  <- split_lines(skeletons);  On the screenshot, we can observe some missing edges...

Yes, TFC requires two ingots to make a single sheet, 2 sheets are welded together to make a double sheet. The single sheet is not a large issue, as IE makes its own versions of those sheets, which cannot be melted down, thus avoiding the dupe bug. Double sheets, however, are TFC, and can be melted for 4 ingots

Hi @milosmns   I've tried with the numbers you can see in the code, 2000 - 2016 with 2008 as selected. The value that I get is 4016, obviously it is rounding up to 1 with the percentage. Are you sure mMinValue should be added to mMaxValue * percent? I would say it should be a subtract ^_^  Didn't review the logic too much so maybe I'm completely being a fool. If I have time next weekend I will play a bit overriding the method.

@shobhitic Thank you! Please send pull request when it is ready.
PaperSpigot 1.11.2 Build 1058, also tried latest spigot dev build but same results.
This specific Jar, https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-hadoop/2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/elasticsearch-hadoop-2.1.0.BUILD-20150427.213847-382.jar, is what I'm using at the moment (because we need the conf change to use spark.es.nodes, etc.).  Are the snapshots not built for 1.3.1? 
Paper (Spigot) with the universal SLP jar. 
@Timer Only happened once and it was solved by restarting the client.  
Yes, the solution would be to remove the `/display`, but I have no time at the moment.

No, they just get attacked. They only get 1 damage per attack, but the mobs never fight back. They're in open spaces, and the damage only occurs near a potential pet.

The program is jEdit.  It is not a big problem for us, but we were just curious what is going on here. 
Same problem with 2.0.11-beta (in fact, I started with that version, and then decremented one by one till the problem was gone).

Yes, I removed the old files in tomcat and redeployed the new war file.  Hmm this is odd. I realize now I was wrong when I said it was showing the wrong colours and styling.  It is actually just applying the default Bootstrap css. I have been using a bootstrap css theme (http://bootswatch.com/superhero/) and it worked properly with version 2.0.2.0. However with 2.0.3.0, it seems like it's not picking up everything from the new bootstrap.css file, and the elements on webpage are from the basic bootstrap css  (with some parts from the new css, like the brand in the navbar).  Could this be a solution? http://gwtbootstrap.github.com/gwt-bootstrap/apidocs/com/github/gwtbootstrap/client/ui/config/Configurator.html I will try this later, missed this earlier because all was working with version 2.0.2.0 
It's my own pack, it's still in alpha and not published in Curse.

Hi Jurgen, according to the Eclipse updater I'm already on the latest release (0.5.3.201211132019) and the problem still occurs. 
@fpj I was expecting the data to be stored as last znode in hierarchy. @bhargav-gulavani Yes, missed observing the property values. Not a bug.  Closing it.
Yes. Freestyle jobs work.
Verified. Thanks!
Same behaviour with JabRef 4.0.0-dev--snapshot--2017-02-16--master--ebbeb1d24. (I had to use the the jar version, as the exe threw some errors).
When testing on the Demo it works fine - Interesting. What can I do to debug the problem? What is weird is images and videos download fine - but files that don't have extensions (my ssh public and private keys) fail and PDF's say "2147483647% Downloading <filename>" and hangs at that crazy percentage amount, then says failed after a minute or two. Also, txt files fail - It would appear only videos and images load fine :(  Like I said, images and videos work fine in the app - Everything works fine from the web interface. Any suggestions? 
The client does not return any error. Unfortunately, there are also no entries retrieved from the davical server.

As stated by the others it is the recommended build. I had to stop using ForgeEssentials though because after some time it made it impossible to login to the server even after restart. No errors were popping up, but as soon as I removed it everything went back to normal.

I've called Stage.show(), but that stage has been closed. The app is still running in the background and another stage may be shown in the future....but when the notification needs to be shown, there may or may not be a Stage present.
After checking it a few times, with several restarts, it still seems to be ignoring the fast-xp-pickup being set to false. Therefore I'm ruling out Hotloading issues :c
Nope! I do /time set 16000 (the time I saw their sleep triggers) The Trike and Edmontos have the slow idle animation playing like all dinosaurs, instead of lying asleep. For some reason this has not affected the Therizinosaurus though... It's so strange 
Hi @laxersaz, sure i will do it.  Can you please add me to contributors?
The job is scheduled on a different task executor so only that thread will get blocked and vertx event loop should be running.
Hi,   Thanks for the quick response. I can get this done for you. It will probably be sometime tomorrow before I can give some feedback on if it's working or not.  Regards, Dan

I haven't tried the camera application yet (need to be sideloaded). I tried webex, hangout, tellybean. All of them are able to pick up the camera. I understand it's not a standard case. Thanks!
I could not recreate this.  I tried a new world, same seed, with Beta 3, ran around and found five villages all as they should be.  The only thing I can figure is that when I got your mod and added it to my world, the current villages were devoid of villagers.  New villages were fine, the others were all empty.  Not killed off, as I started that world the day before, not enough time, only day 3.  So I started a new world, with the same seed, and the same name, but I deleted the old game from the client.  Deleted the old worlds, started again, same seed, Beta 3, completely different world name, no issues.  All villages I had investigated are there.  Could there have been an artifact in the game that associated the old save with the new world?  I assume I can avoid that by not using the same world name.   I assume it had something to do with the names of the worlds being the same.  I know little about mods, but it seems logical to me.  Interesting mod, thanks for developing it.  Glad to be of help, even if it appears to be a rare issue.  Cheers!

1. Using latest commit on branch master. 2. Commit f2f6bdd3 says: "Full IN+OUT: Tank, Reservoir, XP Obelisk, Soul Binder". Since "IN" is not working, I think it's better to mention it regardless of the reservoir common usage. 3. The multiblock is formed correctly (hard to do it wrong since the visual changes when it's complete). I have tried all 3 possible setups: 2x2x1, 2x1x2, 1x2x2. Same issue on all. 
I am still slightly confused as to why the breakpoint I set did not hit  As it happens (and I don't expect anyone else to) I have my own tile server.   The differences showing the maplink stuff ![mykonos1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/861631/55570120-ae718a00-56fa-11e9-8976-2fdf5bbd6cfb.gif) and ![mykonos2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/861631/55570141-b92c1f00-56fa-11e9-80cf-2d7e7f4bc98f.gif)  so relatively minor - its just I like to see as little difference between xowa and mediawiki (it could just be text and no link)
The argument for user-feedback is not quite correct with existing optimization (rewrite expressions into 0 = 0 or 0 = 1).  I will move the optimization to later phase (planner or optimizer) and post a PR to discuss more around the code, if needed.

@trustin thanks for your quick response. First, the issue is happen intermittently, after I restart the client service, it will come into normally OR after while it also will work again. in my case, the java process runs a few hours later, this problem will happen.  I'll try to change the code to asynchronous and see what will happend. once I have clue, I will post it here.
I have updated RED plugin to the latest. It's working fine now. I can run test cases with Jython interpreter and custom classpath defined in OS.  Thanks guys for your immediate action :)

the list function does get as expression: new DummyDTO(entityA.id, entityA.name) (which looks correkt)  But createQuery does return: select entityA.id, entityA.name from EntityA entityA as queryString  This query does not really seem to work with openJPA 2.2.2, i'm getting the same NoClassDefFoundError   Is my queryDSL Syntax ok? 
Test Case is simple (Database is Postgres):  ID class:  ``` public class IdObject {     private Long id;     private UUID uuid;     public Long getId() {         return id;     }     public void setId(Long id) {         this.id = id;     }     public UUID getUuid() {         return uuid;     }     public void setUuid(UUID uuid) {         this.uuid = uuid;     } } ```  and then just use it on a update statement like:  ```  @SqlUpdate("INSERT into ...")     @GetGeneratedKeys(value=IdObjectMapper.class)     IdObject insertObject ```  with IdObjectMapper:  ``` public class IdObjectMapper implements ResultSetMapper<IdObject> {     public IdObject map(int index, ResultSet rs, StatementContext ctx) throws SQLException     {         IdObject idObject = new IdObject();         idObject.setUuid((UUID) rs.getObject("uuid"));         idObject.setId(rs.getLong("id"));         return idObject;     } } ```

Well, it just got strange. Apparently if I exit the game with fuel in the reactor, it will properly add it to the system when I start it up again. Reactor Layout: ![2017-04-24_21 14 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7060121/25364843/341e8ed4-2933-11e7-9c67-cf767b30e5f3.png) 
Unfortunately, I don't think there is a general rule.  German writers would likely simply avoid ending a sentence with a digit.  There are too many: 1. Platz, 1. Preis, 1. Mannschaft, 1. Bundesliga, 1. Liga, 1. Rang, 1. Kategorie, 1. Reise, 1. Tag, 52. Woche, 3. Monat, 1. Jahrhundert, 1. Buch Samuel, 42. Kongress, "1. Simmeringer Sport-Club", "1. FC Nürnberg" - these are all grammatical correct use. It's not specific to dates, that was just where I first noticed that this is really a major problem. Once you look out for them, they are literally everywhere. Just go to http://de.wikipedia.org/ and type "1." into the search box. Even with "42." you get many suggestions.  So I believe my workaround is doing the best heuristic - assume that digits followed by a dot does not end a sentence (it could, but it usually won't).  There are other cases where the assumption that a dot always ends a sentence is incorrect - in particular abbreviations may or may not end a sentence. "Äpfel, Bananen, usw. sind Obst." is another example that is incorrectly split by CoreNLP. (usw. = etc.; Apples, bananas, etc. are fruit.) But these are hard to define without already having POS tags and without massive learning/dictionary. To get some samples, you could look at Wikipedia page titles: https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Usw.&redirect=no  For the digits+(no space)+dot rule, I  guess that not splitting the sentence is correct in over 90% of cases; but that is a wild guess. Linguists might be able to come up with a number, though.
Every class in N4JS has a constructor, at least an implicit one. And that is required to invoke the super class's constructor. But if the super constructor is not accessible, this is impossible.  To disallow instantiation while allowing subclassing, a protected constructor should be sufficient. Don't you think so?

@garagatyi you referring to an old description of the issue. I've updated it some time ago with correct usage of .devfile in che repository. I and @sleshchenko are able to reproduce in on nightly images. Now we testing master.
The advanced Oxygen Compressor allows air to be pumped into it. (Extraplanets) The electronic Compress allows items to but piped into it. (Galacticraft Core) The refinery allows fluids to be pumped into it. (Galacticraft Core) If you need me to test more I can.   Also while troubleshooting this myself I stumbled across anther bug. If you put any Mek tank with fluids into the fluid purifier, it only gives you 1 bucket full and changes the item into the pink and black block and renames it Bucket 325:11 and becomes useless.

oh yes, i'm using an ancient version of BossBarAPI.  1.0.6.  I'll update and report back.

Version 1.0.0
Sure, I should be able to do this tomorrow  
The complete code is:  ``` cpp #pragma once #include <functional> #include <memory> #include <string>  namespace AuthService { class IAuthService {   public:      ~IAuthService(); virtual void login(const std::string& user) = 0; }; } ```  Java code:  ``` java import org.bytedeco.javacpp.*; import org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;  @Platform(include="AuthService.h") @Namespace("AuthService") public class AuthService {     public static class IAuthService extends Pointer {         static {             Loader.load();         }          public IAuthService() {             allocate();         }          private native void allocate();          @Virtual(true) public native void login(@StdString String user);     }     public static void main(String[] args) {         IAuthService service =new IAuthService();         service.login("aaa");         System.out.println("Callback success");     } } ```  The first example Java code is a reference. Of course, I eventually code is:  ``` cpp     virtual int64 login(const std::string& user, const std::string& pwd, const std::string& server,                          std::function<void(ErrorInfo, int64)> cb) = 0; ``` 
I tested with coming 3.2.1 release and it works fine for me. Maybe there is other issue related to multilingual records ?
Yes, can try that. I can reproduce this in both computers. May be it is a Windows thing. The dropdown drops down momentarily before the sync starts. 
1. disabling coremod.optimizedBlockInf fixes the high cpu usage, **so far** no chunks showed the not-loading issue. I will keep observing this. 2. Here's the mod list: https://share.dsix.tech/modlist.txt
@SevaSafris no particular reason, we saw it in the README and felt it was more appropriate to use it because we use Spring Boot.
hello Ryan, I've created this [project](https://github.com/adrianbrad/cloud-gateway-websockets-ping-message-bug) for reproducing the problem. Looking forward to your feedback.
Blu R1+ and android version 6.0.
I'm running `openjdk-8.u92` that is, to be more precise:  > [mattia@arch-xps ~]$ java -version > openjdk version "1.8.0_92" > OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_92-b14) > OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.92-b14, mixed mode) 
I have only found Mermaid and Sahuagin yet. So it is possible both.
Its my own theme that I modified using [this editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) I have read/write rights for ~/.R/rstudio/themes and I can manually delete the theme from that folder, and then add my new theme as usual in the R studio app (ie he problem is fixed if I do this). But the remove button still doesn't work for me. It also doesn't work with the preview. Thanks
Yeah, can't reproduce it also anymore. Either is was fixed by some other PR or it is some exceptional case. Close it for now.
I haven't used that plugin; this is what I've tried:  ```java @Listener public void onCooldownSet(final CooldownEvent.Set event) {     if (event.getItemType().equals(ItemTypes.ENDER_PEARL)) {         event.setNewCooldown(1);     } } ``` ```java @Listener public void onCooldownSet(final CooldownEvent.Set event) {     if (event.getItemType().equals(ItemTypes.ENDER_PEARL)) {         event.setCancelled(true);     } } ``` Second one throws an error. First one doesn't work.
Yes, but it happens only on my phone. This behavior is not happening on my tablet. May be it is something initiated by the phone itself.
@jexp In our use case we have 2000 nodes.  Query example:  ``` CREATE (n1), (n2), (n3) ... (n1999), (n2000) ```  Exploring Cypher parser code, looks like that in some places "recursive"-ish algorithms are used to modify/check AST.  **Example:**  Instead of:  ``` java while (iterator.hasNext()) {   doStuff(iterator.next()); }  ```  It looks like this:  ``` java public void doStuff(iterator) {   obj = iterator.next();   if (iterator.hasNext()) {     doStuff(iterator);          }    } ```  So. For each iterator object new frame is created. And when we have `Pattern` node with 2000 `PatternPart` child nodes we end up with `StackOverflowError`. 
Sure, I've reproduced it numerous times just now (v1.1.6 on windows10 pc, v1.6.4 on oneplus3t smartphone).  Write this on a new note on PC, and let it sync with the phone.  ``` test  Le Lorem Ipsum est simplement du faux texte employé dans la composition et la mise en page avant impression. Le Lorem Ipsum est le faux texte standard de l'imprimerie depuis les années 1500, quand un imprimeur anonyme assembla ensemble des morceaux de texte pour réaliser un livre spécimen de polices de texte. Il n'a pas fait que survivre cinq siècles, mais s'est aussi adapté à la bureautique informatique, sans que son contenu n'en soit modifié. Il a été popularisé dans les années 1960 grâce à la vente de feuilles Letraset contenant des passages du Lorem Ipsum, et, plus récemment, par son inclusion dans des applications de mise en page de texte, comme Aldus PageMaker.  On sait depuis longtemps que travailler avec du texte lisible et contenant du sens est source de distractions, et empêche de se concentrer sur la mise en page elle-même. L'avantage du Lorem Ipsum sur un texte générique comme 'Du texte. Du texte. Du texte.' est qu'il possède une distribution de lettres plus ou moins normale, et en tout cas comparable avec celle du français standard. De nombreuses suites logicielles de mise en page ou éditeurs de sites Web ont fait du Lorem Ipsum leur faux texte par défaut, et une recherche pour 'Lorem Ipsum' vous conduira vers de nombreux sites qui n'en sont encore qu'à leur phase de construction. Plusieurs versions sont apparues avec le temps, parfois par accident, souvent intentionnellement (histoire d'y rajouter de petits clins d'oeil, voire des phrases embarassantes). ```  Then put the phone in "plane mode".  Delete the last paragraph on PC, put a short sentence INSTEAD at its place, and let the note sync with servers  Add sentences BEFORE and AFTER that last paragraph on the phone (no sync is possible due to airplane mode) ; also remove a word from said last paragraph (I dunno if it changes anything).  Then remove airplane mode from phone. Sync occurs.  The big last paragraph (although edited on phone) disappears from phone, replaced by the sentences BEFORE and INSTEAD above. **The AFTER sentence has disappeared.**  As a side note, I've never seen "merge conflicts" or the likes on simplenote, whereas like Git it should encounter such unsolvable situations, and let users deal with them. 
I can confirm that this is still an issue for me. I tried changing the folder and also downloading it to another drive, but I am still getting stuck.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54046061/66438572-1763f280-e9fb-11e9-9a04-6ce38e4ebee9.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54046061/66438599-2b0f5900-e9fb-11e9-9a11-c7609a3d0e4b.png)

This seems to occur 100% of time when I launch GAMA and choose to create a new workspace.  But I never faced it in other cases (no problem with workspace with or without user models and even no issue when I choose a workspace than made GAMA freezed in the previous launch). 
i have send the pull request #2260
@MatzElectronics @AndyLindsay and I spoke about the options. We prefer the "then a carriage return" checkbox at the end of all blocks for consistency. Please make that addition to both blocks. 
Sure, I  reproduced the case in a small project. You can find it here, into my github account : [sixrandanes/error-redirection-actuator](https://github.com/sixrandanes/error-redirection-actuator)  I also use spring-data-rest & spring-data-rest-hal-browser.  Hope it helps, Sylvain

Hi,  I tested it again and assert, that the bug only occurs when I put the b:radiobutton into a composite component!  Then the radioButton doesn't change the value in Version 1.0.2!  In Version 1.0.1 everythings works fine!   Outside a composite component it also works in Version 1.0.2!   Here my code (radioButtonBean identical like showcase)!  example.xhtml: ```xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE html> <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" 	xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html" 	xmlns:stala="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/composite/component"> <body> 	<h:form id="form"> 		<stala:editPanel /> 	</h:form> </body> </html> ```  editPanel.xhtml: ```xml <ui:composition xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" 	xmlns:composite="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/composite" 	xmlns:b="http://bootsfaces.net/ui" 	xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core"         xmlns:ui="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/facelets"> 	<composite:interface> 	</composite:interface> 	<composite:implementation> 	       <b:panel title="Survey" look="primary">                    <p>What's your favorite band?</p>                    <b:radiobutton value="#{benutzerController.favoriteBand}">                          <f:selectItems value="#{benutzerController.bands}" />                          <f:selectItem itemValue="" itemLabel="None of the above" />                    </b:radiobutton>                    <b:commandButton value="submit your choice"                             action="#{benutzerController.submitBand}" look="primary"                             update="@form" />                     <b:message for="@form:@property(benutzerController.favoriteBand)" />                 </b:panel> 	</composite:implementation> </ui:composition> ```   Thanks in advance, knoppT  
It's like the 2nd one (`/home/user/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/00LOCK-<package>`). I'm not doing any such customization and the computer where this happens doesn't even have an `.Rprofile`.

@petebankhead in this particular case I am not attempting to use saved training objects from multiple images. These training points that I have saved are from this image but just during a different training session, therefore I do think this is a bug.  I would like to be able to combine multiple training objects from different images in the future, is the best way to go about this the script you gave in https://github.com/qupath/qupath/issues/256 ?

Latest securitycraft for latest stable forge 1.12.2
Build 1344 
Gerrit version is 2.8.1, I use password authentication using https. 
Here is a link to a session with two networks.  One is called "How the network looks" and the other is "How it should look"  https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m74365hgamt2bb/example_session_bug216.cys?dl=0  Genesets that have significant and postivie NES values are showing up but if the same geneset has a negative NES in a different dataset the negative value is showing up in the pie heatmap chart.  If users have selected NES positive values only they there should be no negative values.
I have made a screenshot: http://imgur.com/a/j0W5s  You can finde the log here: https://paste.ee/p/DGsdY
Sorry just figured i would report this bug and then create a quick fix. Let me know if you want more detail, but the PR should hopefully explain the issue. 
It looks like the right side only does that on larger screen sizes, if I shrink my window size, jei moves back to the correct position.  Favorites side of jei does seem to be working.  As to why the curios button isn't there, I'm not sure why. It's in the top right corner, but invisible. I can still click on it too.
No, not reproducable with either TPCH, nor MySQL connector.  Problem is with HIVE it seems.
Yes, I can join any server, build, talk, etc. When I relog, however, I instantly crash before I can join back on the server. I can relaunch minecraft and forge to join again, but once I get back on, no blocks were registered.  I tried it again and the same result happened. 
I have no idea, maybe it's something that maven surefire does? But how would the debugger know to open that file? What might I do to debug it further? 
Hi! Thanks for the reply. Looking at the javadoc it says: `If this pathname denotes a directory, then the directory must be empty in order to be deleted.` I guess this is the problem, being the directory full with decompiled sources. Thanks Luca
I put them so close, cause of the bug they have to be activated at the same time
This is in a git repo - this is from a single pom.xml at the module root.  I'm trying to follow this guide: https://www.alooma.com/blog/building-dockers  Apparently they reference both plugins in the same pom.xml, but I can't seem to get the latter plugin to resolve the ${git.commit.id.abbrev} properly.  I can see the git.properties created and it has the correct values.  It's just Maven itself doesn't seem to know what to do with that particular variable.  Thanks for the edit/tip on the md style, was trying to figure that out... 
Only happened once so far just after startup.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/279528/44438782-0fcd6880-a604-11e8-9f3b-5de8a48329a1.png)  Unfortunately I don't have a reproducible app, I assume it's a concurrency issue on initialization.
Hi @odrotbohm , sorry for the delay. I am working on trying to debug and dig deeper of where the object mapper changes from my custom one to a new one. Not quite there yet but will work on making the sample project today to show you the behavior.   Thanks
The question is how "rootPath" is defined as a LSP term in Che?  Moreover, how should I deal with it:   > Thus, because of the lack of information for LS about when modules will be resolved, I have to define such kind of Che's behavior as non-deterministic.  I expect that Che will send the root path (e.g. /projects/milti-module) also when all sub-modules are resolved.

In the benchmark repo, run;  `mvn clean install -Dbuild-native-image -pl '!testingFramework'`  run the insurance service;  `./insurance-service/target/insurance-service-1.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT-runner`  You don't need a db running, it doesn't get that far
I will do that. It will be a little bit tricky because the refresh has to be executed exactly while shutting down of OH2 - but it should be reproducible with a very small refresh interval.
The newest.
Hi @filiphr   Please see my pull request. I have tested locally with my custom builder provider. I am happy to provide the builder provider and some unit tests if you like, but I'll need your guidance on where to put them.

Ok, I've looked a lil bit closer. If you use https for admin, then link will point to proper https orientdb address. The strange thing is that this address still is somehow "autoredirected" to http version. So, link shows https, but browser (FF, Chrome) on both Windows and Linux opens http version, and I still have to change address manually.   Even stranger: when I "copy link address", and paste it it goes to wrong url, but when I change url manually, and copy it again, then pasting it causes it to go to correct url.  But this is probably browser fault, and probably can't be fixed from here. In fact I'm gonna ask stackoverflow of this peculiar behavior.  Second scenario: when orientdb is using https, while dropwizard is using http, link explicitly shows http version, but that's really uncommon configuration and I understand that it is not worth supporting.  Feel free to close.
Meaning that it behaves like it is waiting for me to advance past a breakpoint, but there is no UI for me to do so.  Example: I start up the app, when there are breakpoints, and the first output for the app is:  Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8000  Once I connect the debugger, Codenvy switches the perspective to show my breakpoints, etc. but nothing more happens--it doesn't reach my breakpoint. If I try and send a curl command to my application in another terminal window, the command hangs.  Then, if I click "Run -> End Debug Session", then, the rest of the startup output for my application is displayed, and my command on the other terminal window completes.  Another example with this same setup is, while the debugger is connected, I run a kill -3 in another terminal window and the output is not shown in my app; however, once I do "Run -> End Debug Session", I subsequently see all the thread dump output to my app.  I will get you a screenshot shortly.
As the new parser was merged today you probably have not seen this yet, unless you built yourself a version from master... 
Deadly World generates a lot more spawners that do a bunch of things; one of them, for instance, will shot tons of arrows all around the place, and another one has got a "ghost zombie" standing on it. When you get near enough, the zombie "comes alive" and gets a primed TNT head to blow you up. That's how I died the second time ç_ç it also adds a crapton of silverfish nests everywhere, and that's how I died the first time...the pro to all this is that you get a reward, usually there's an interesting block in every silverfish nest and a chest under every spawner. Maybe I lost it in the darkness of the cavern, or in an adiacent cavern hidden by a wall. I'll test this further, although I'd rather not die (lol). 
Window appeared on my upkeep, and no matter which button I pressed it'd only quicky refresh. 
doesn't batfish_build_all do that?

I'm sorry that I didn't pay much attention to heap size and cache size cause I only care where the problem comes from (your expression to calculate segmentMaxFill) and how to fix it. May be it's redundant, but I would like to attach an explanation here with hashLoadPercent = 64 and LOCK_SEGMENTS = 64 too (my case). ![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9496595/56404898-91f55600-6293-11e9-9d79-417a5565b2f2.PNG) When segmentMaxFill becomes negative or zero, the 'entries' array is doubled whenever a new element is added and the size of the array rockets to be a negative value (1.073.741.824 -> -2.147.483.648) because of Integer Overflow. In my case, the number of element is around 20 millions, but the exception occurs when 10.674.603 elements are added. Hope this helpful for you.  
I can change item 0x2 to something Leif can inherit and see what happens when I get to that point. Or are you wanting me to check item 0x67?
The login with Thunderbird and the AquaMail android app works flawlessly. For thunderbird the setting is SSL/TLS+Normal password, for AquaMail it's SSL+Prefer compatibility.  I tried the Maildroid android app without success, too.  I'm using the latest K-9-app that is available on the google app store. The server only supports SSL so I've always set security in K9 to SSL/TLS and authentication to "Normal password" since that is the setting that also works in Thunderbird. "Encrytped password" does not work either - but that did not surprise since it also does not work in thunderbird.

Dear Joanna, 2.3.2 was released on October 13th. Notice of the release was sent to the IPT mailing list: http://lists.gbif.org/pipermail/ipt/2015-October/000631.html I can see that you are signed up to the list using your flmnh.ufl.edu email address.  
I have the latest code. Even with `setShouldUpdateDetailLevelWhileZooming` set to false I have issues with tiles not rendering and tiles being display at the wrong zoom level. So #252 doesn't seem to be fixed. 
im fine with protocol lib even my anti cheat uses protocol lib EVEN NOCHEATPLUS uses protocol lib so yeah 50% or more servers uses protocol lib XD

@gunterze, the problem still seems to persist when accessed from a private window. The specific installation I'm currently working with is running on a Vagrant VM, but I've also experienced the issue with installations not running on VMs. For the time being, I've still just gone through all Web Applications and removed the property, which seems to work.  ![Screenshot from 2020-03-03 08-15-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28839674/75751657-4a4eb000-5d27-11ea-8735-6de5cf950da3.png)

It did solve the problem, thanks.  It might be a good idea to add a descriptive error instead of just failing, tho. 
@hideki  Sorry missed my logs..will update once i have new logs.. 
Ok great, they render fine when on crop sticks. I don't know if this is caused by agricraft or rotarycraft or if I should submit it as another bug but when harvested the canola plants drop canola seed husks rather than canola seeds which are the item they are farmed for.

Thanks for looking into this! I had a big argument with Eclipse IDE trying to start your test and eventually gave up (sorry, I'm an IntelliJ guy).  However, I cloned my openHAB VM, messed around with my config and found a big clue: the issue does not occur with a single items file. When adding a second file, the items in the first file are 'added' to the listeners again. When adding a third items file, the items in the first and second file are repeated.  Can you verify this? I hope this would make it easier to pinpoint the bug.

Hi @bsideup   Yes, I'm able to reproduce each time.  Here is the [repo](https://github.com/jgrandja/oauth2-client-nonblock).  Run this [test](https://github.com/jgrandja/oauth2-client-nonblock/blob/master/ui-app/src/test/java/sample/Tests.java) in debug mode and put a break point [here](https://github.com/jgrandja/oauth2-client-nonblock/blob/master/ui-app/src/test/java/sample/Tests.java#L144).  This will reproduce - at least with the JVM version I have. 
The exception is thrown when retrieving column names from metadata. No sql request is used. 
Sure. 1. At 30 Hz, things run okay but once in a while you'll notice erroneous values come through. For example a variable that has the same value written to it all the time (zero), will once in a while have 15, 23 or some random number written to it. At 50 - 80 Hz it becomes more common, the value set to zero will spike in value every 5 seconds or so, and above 80 Hz, the connection will break and data will cease to be sent to the phone. 2. The gibberish in the serial monitor only happens when the connection never initialized, or after it breaks. So at 1 - 80 Hz, the serial monitor is accurate, but there will be random inaccuracies in the data transmitted. 3. AltSoftSerial is the current choice as it uses the high resolution 16 bit timer. There's another one out there, but it isn't packaged as a library, but as a sketch and it uses an 8 bit timer. It will have the same issues AltSoftSerial will have with no clear advantages.  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujzE3Q5ouqW-ZQgrlPGH9eMvqKJAiWSmGBGrKPW7fVCT/Screenshot_2014-10-12-15-11-53.png)  @ 75 Hz. The gold spike to the left is at the value that 0 is supposed to be written to all the time.  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pushbullet-uploads/ujzE3Q5ouqW-BhkSVdwZKeIrbbNXk10Rb1ujfIrbpnEs/Screenshot_2014-10-12-15-11-29.png) @ 50 Hz. Random spikes. 
My proposal without community input would be as follows: Given we find with further investigation that replacing the current metrics files histograms with histograms with empty bins doesn't negatively effect any known uses of these histograms, I think this would be the best solution and I would implement that option, along with any other changes for histogram sizes that come up with further testing. So far, we have not found an issue with putting in the properly sized histograms.  @nh13 The use case where we ran into this was in the MetricsFileTest. There were previously no tests for getHistogram and upon implementing them, and continuing with its current test format of a function that 'writesThenReadsBack' the metrics file to a file, then reads it back into a new metrics file object and tests to see if these metrics files are equal, it fails on any metrics file containing multiple histograms of different sizes because of the 0s that get filled into the histograms upon writing to a file. 
Ok, here is updated test case: 1) Index first document with "avatars": {} 2) Then index document with "avatars": null and get java.lang.NullPointerException  curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/contacts3/'  curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/contacts3/'  curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/contacts3/contact3/_mapping' -d ' {"contact3": {"properties": {"serialized_object": {"index": "not_analyzed", "type": "object", "properties": {"fields": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dates": {"type": "object", "properties": {"value": {"type": "string"}}}}}}, "store": "yes"}, "fields": {"type": "object", "properties": {"dates": {"type": "string"}}, "store": "yes"}, "company_id": {"index": "not_analyzed", "type": "string", "store": "yes"}, "is_account": {"type": "boolean", "store": "yes"}, "id": {"type": "string", "store": "yes"}, "owner_id": {"index": "not_analyzed", "type": "string", "store": "yes"}}}}'  curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/contacts3/contact3/4bf571e8304e747bb9000081' -d ' {"serialized_object": { "account_id": null, "tags": [], "fields": {"website": [], "dates": [], "last_name": [], "description": [], "title": [], "first_name": [{"note": "", "modificator": "", "value": "sergei", "sequenc ": 0}], "phone": [], "company_name": [], "address": [], "email": [{"note": "", "modificator": "other", "value": "sergei@kovbasyuk.com.ua", "sequence": 0}, {"note": "", "modificator": "home", "value": "webmans2@gmail.com", "sequence": 1}]}, "updated": "2010-08-30 15:43:06+0000", "object_type": "contact", "avatars": {}, "is_account": false, "company_id": "4bec433c304e745ad3000009", "id": "4bf571e8304e747bb9000081", "owner_id": " bec433c304e745ad3000007"}, "account_id": null, "fields": {"website": [], "dates": [], "last_name": [], "description": [], "title": [], "first_name": ["sergei", "1ZjHE5vngEUsRvj0J"], "phone": [], "company_name": [], "address": [], "email": ["sergei@kovbasyuk.com.ua", "webmans2@gmail.com", "1ZjHE5vngEUsRvj0J"], "name": ["sergei", "1ZjHE5vngEUsRvj0J"], "avatars": {}}, "company_id": "4bec433c304e745ad3000009", "is_account": false, "id": "4bf571e8304e747bb9000081", "owner_id": "4bec433c304e745ad3000007", "updated": "2010-08-30 15:43:06+0000"} '  curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/contacts3/contact3/4bf571e8304e747bb9000082' -d ' {"serialized_object": { "account_id": null, "tags": [], "fields": {"website": [], "dates": [], "last_name": [], "description": [], "title": [], "first_name": [{"note": "", "modificator": "", "value": "sergei", "sequenc ": 0}], "phone": [], "company_name": [], "address": [], "email": [{"note": "", "modificator": "other", "value": "sergei@kovbasyuk.com.ua", "sequence": 0}, {"note": "", "modificator": "home", "value": "webmans2@gmail.com", "sequence": 1}]}, "updated": "2010-08-30 15:43:06+0000", "object_type": "contact", "avatars": null, "is_account": false, "company_id": "4bec433c304e745ad3000009", "id": "4bf571e8304e747bb9000082", "owner_id": " bec433c304e745ad3000007"}, "account_id": null, "fields": {"website": [], "dates": [], "last_name": [], "description": [], "title": [], "first_name": ["sergei", "1ZjHE5vngEUsRvj0J"], "phone": [], "company_name": [], "address": [], "email": ["sergei@kovbasyuk.com.ua", "webmans2@gmail.com", "1ZjHE5vngEUsRvj0J"], "name": ["sergei", "1ZjHE5vngEUsRvj0J"], "avatars": null}, "company_id": "4bec433c304e745ad3000009", "is_account": false, "id": "4bf571e8304e747bb9000082", "owner_id": "4bec433c304e745ad3000007", "updated": "2010-08-30 15:43:06+0000"} '  On last command I get {"error":"ReplicationShardOperationFailedException[[contacts3][1] ]; nested: "} in console and traceback in logs 
Certainly, here's my config file: http://cl.ly/code/3w1h1R0f0l2M (It contains some configs for the new features, but they will just be ignored in earlier versions.) 
@rwinch Yes I'll try to do that tomorrow :)
The list of projects is still there in the dropdown. But the 'selected' value remains empty no matter which project is loaded. 
This is how I include the library: `    implementation 'com.github.nextcloud:android-library:master'` That should give me the latest version?  As for a test: after letting the user enter server and username + pwd there's an ASyncTask started that does this - there's not much more to it that just that. You can even enter the credential in source:  ``` 		@Override 		protected RemoteOperationResult doInBackground(Void... params) { 			OwnCloudCredentials credentials = new OwnCloudBasicCredentials(_authData.username, _authData.password); 			Uri uri = Uri.parse(_authData.server); 			OwnCloudClient client = OwnCloudClientFactory.createOwnCloudClient(uri, SimpleMindApp.getAppContext(), true); 			client.setCredentials(credentials); 			if (true) { 				ReadRemoteFolderOperation refreshOperation = new ReadRemoteFolderOperation("/"); 				return refreshOperation.execute(client); 			} 			else { 				ExistenceCheckRemoteOperation operation = new ExistenceCheckRemoteOperation(NextcloudProvider.WebDAVRootFolder,  // I pass a reference to the app context in the constructor Application.getAppContext(), false); 				return operation.execute(client); 			} 		} ```     
In the 1.61, the second solution was working well, so I'm more up to stick into this solution. 
@gwenneg that worked!  I had to pass it without the `=enabled` though as it complained that `Command-line option '--enable-http-url-handler' does not take an argument`
Asked him via twitter, can check the spreadsheet, atm I always get servers are busy...  Edit I can log into G-Spreadsheet but can't open the sheet anymore... "Servers are busy" 
Dear Marc,  I can gladly share the fasta. It's a mix of UniProt entries from various species and entries from HOMD (Human Oral Microbiome Database). I've created custom headers a la searchGUI style (e.g. ">generic|001R_FRG3G") since they were not uniform. There are some redundant amino acid sequences in the fasta, but unique accession numbers. The file is 1.3 GB in size. I can send you a "wetransfer" unless you have a better way!?  I've also been having trouble with searchGUI (which might be due to the file storage solution on the server), but I double checked and used an mgf / comet.pep.xml file that had no issues completing.  Thank you for your support!!  Best, David   
I configured those ip according to the OVH docs: https://docs.ovh.com/es/dedicated/network-ipaliasing/ And the error logs are in the spigot servers https://imgur.com/a/31Hud
Use andropilot to connect to the drone, and while connected, try to connect with droidplanner. Unless we solve the issue along the recent fixes, droidplanner should crash.

@intrications Thanks for your quick answer.  I can confirm that the server used is the regular Librelio server.  @Ageleswari Did you change something in the Android code?

Thanks.  I tried just a minute ago and it works now. 
I am currently using 1.2.1 and I am not using optifine. It is most definitely a lighting problem because when I put a torch right next to it it goes away  but then comes back when i remove it. also if i place a channel on top of the dark one seen in the pic, the one on top is just fine.

@lulf yes youre right service catalog works, it was problem with my deployment. So Im going to close this issue, all bugs are fixed in branch.
But the point is not only that we do or do not do the check ... What bothers me and the student here is that the warning message regarding the name of the module and the program extension makes no sense, and that we should not see any Maude errors.  Maybe all these are related in some way, but our users do not know that.

The version is 0.6.0, and line 248 cannot generate a CCE, so it must be the type.cast call, but then the exception seen should have been a  MalformedClaimException:  ```java     public <T> T getClaimValue(String claimName, Class<T> type) throws MalformedClaimException     {         Object o = claimsMap.get(claimName); // Line 248         try         {             return type.cast(o);         }         catch (ClassCastException e)         {             throw new MalformedClaimException("The value of the '" + claimName + "' claim is not the expected type " + classCastMsg(e, o), e);         }     } ````

I'm not, I'm setting `max-tries`. I just noticed that there's also `max-tries,` and included that in case that has something to do with it.
sorry, i was talking about "wallcorner3" in the fortress tree. the rack issue happens in every building where more than 2 racks are placed next to each other. the shadow varies from level. at level 1 it didn't occur whereas at level 3 it does (builder hut). probably it depends on what blocks are near to it. the shigle have the same problem only when placed next to a wood block. also i forgot to mention, in the barracks (fortress type) the barracks tower blocks are placed rotated and not in the right spot. i had to destroy the block and replace it myself.  ![2020-02-22_12 25 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41806417/75091607-71f78880-556f-11ea-8a6c-a6d07c4367f3.png) ![2020-02-22_12 31 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41806417/75091608-7328b580-556f-11ea-9e70-5cceaec39d3a.png) 
You are right; quick-fix (alt-space) suggests changing the signature in the interface, which is not under my control. So either close this issue, or suggest quick-fix like in non-inherited methods ("Add return type hint")
@ivankelly I think we should two changes here:  1) disable initializing /managed-ledgers in managed ledgers. 2) handle /managed-ledgers exists situtation on initializing metadata.  > Why is managed-ledgers an exception?  I guess `managed-ledgers` code exists before other components in pulsar
ANE does not show all leaderboards. It is show only ANEs that listed by IDs. If I use method LeaderBoards.showAll() - nothing happened. I checked android log and it says that there is no leaderboards ids to display. Something like "No extra achievememnt ids..." 
Hi jpwsutton,  I agree with you that myClient is null which leads to the NPE. Unfortunately, I could not reproduce this crash on my test environment. If the NPE is thrown back to the application level, the application can do a fresh connect again as a workaround.

Hey, thanks for the new release, but unfortunately, the bug remains. Same message as previously in the console (with "Error: BDX BUILD FAILED" at the end).

Thank you for the answer. This bug is available if you call stop after a track with mMediaPlayer.setForegroundMode(true); It took me a long time to figure out what was going on, but then I found an instruction in the depths of the code explaining that I don't need to call a stop in this case. Now it works correctly.
I have a mod that when opening a specific GUI will freeze the game for a few seconds. However I later found out that this was not the cause, it is a simple nullpointer, because the items displayed are ghost items without a real ItemStack. Adding a null-check fixes the problem immediately.

Apache Jena Riot locates the error at line: 5585903, col: 77, which seems off. `grep` is better and locates the error at line 5586299 of the labels_en.ttl file extracted via t-unpack.

yes the time of the day in the game  it make that only when i turn on light and wait a little time  after turn it off time work great  i try it on a fresh server and fresh map 1.5.2 forge 738 with the same effect  thanks 
"This defect is quite old, but I was not able to deterministically reproduce this error. It does not seem to happen always, right? Do you know how to reproduce it?" I can always reproduce it.

im not sure... it just does it all the time... in the beginning it had time periods where it randomly did this for like 5 min then it stopped for a while then it started and so on... but now its all the time... Im using something called spigot the latest version 1.6.2

@kaikreuzer I thought you probably know best about last refactorings. The code isn’t so alien to me because the thing type migration has actually created by me 4 years ago :) but the mentioned code about `registerHandlerLock` was added later (and removed again a little later... 
Yes - most recently it happened to me with https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b04902
At the moment, 5 since the latest Factions update reset a bunch of them :/ As far as power goes, one Faction called VHAAH has 51. 
Please excuse the delayed response. To answer your questions... I have actually attempted many different versions in an attempt to fix this issue but I am positive that I have tried the top three hybrid modems and can confirm that I have restarted the device each time. I have even attempted to manually switch the radio to every option related to my device in terms of what band to use through the "info" screen.   To recap - this problem only happens when I have WiFi and the Cell Radio on at the same time. If I place it in airplane mode and/or turn off WiFi I don't have any issues. Further more... When both radios are turned on and any of the top 3 hybrid modems are used my wifi signal will typically show 4 bars and my LTE signal will have 0-2 bars. I am in an area where I have a week LTE signal from one tower and a strong signal from a non-LTE tower.  In any case - I definitely believe there is some type of key issue which specifically show how does not tell my device to use my WiFi radio as the primary when it has a strong connection resulting in every request from any app which uses the internet having a long delay before (and sometimes times out) it completes its requests.  Please advise if there is any way for you to look into this for a fix or if you know of some app which would allow me to force specific applications to use WiFi if its available.  Thanks in advance,  Chris H. 
Yep , i have more mods installed do you want the list?
No idea what he tried to say :S   Config folder has all config files, but no sub folders for me. 
It would be a good idea to switch all of them eventually, at least for the ones that already have their own `toXContent`, unless we find a good reason to do otherwise (omitting sensitive data or something), but we can do one PR for each to split up the work, rather than having to do it all as a single chunk. Thanks for finding the other places where we duplicate this logic!  For the ones that don't already have a `toXContent`, it might be a good idea to add one and use it in ClusterState, just so that each class owns its own serialization logic, but I think that's a lower priority than the ones that have duplicated logic.
Unfortunately no
http://www.sendspace.com/file/gqo6x1  Here is the new code. The same error. This is an android LWP app. 
It would be better to hide the icons or show at least valid selection values (instead of wrong ones). Hiding the features could be counter intuitive. That issue is not that important, go for the fastest solution. 
@kavithaenair I've reviewed your patch on the pending Pull request. It now has 2 commits solving 2 seperate issues which is totally fine. But please remember from next time onwards send a pull request from a branch that you create than from the `development` branch itself.
On a "normal" jar packing build I would expect only the one jar artifact to be in there. And I am pretty sure it was working like that before (with maven2?).  What's the difference between `project.getArtifacts()` and `project.getAttachedArtifacts()`? 
Unfortunately this issue is different from the one that we have already discussed on the ML: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rdf4j-users/eER3QQwoPOw/HpcYfadYAgAJ  Let me explain.  The issue on the ML concerns the project `rdf4j-runtime`, which is no longer available as a JAR artifact. This problem affects dependency management by Maven (which I use to build my projects).  This issue concerns the project `rdf4j-runtime-osgi` that should build an OSGi bundle containing all classes and resources corresponding to RDF4J's runtime: you can think of this bundle as a sort of fat JAR aggregating all RDF4J's jars (without the dependencies) plus some metadata (in `MANIFEST.MF`) of interest for an OSGi framework. I use this bundle when deploying my OSGi-based applications that use RDF4J.  I think that some change in the build process of  `rdf4j-runtime-osgi` has erroneously excluded most classes and resources from the aggregate. 
I made it a bit more hackish.  The hack that is in place turns paths like "foo/bar" into "file://C|some/absolute/path/foo/bar" which is not what we want because the CMR only understand file paths or remote repository URLs (of the form "http://", "mvn:" etc, not "file://")  A nicer solution might be to introduce our own `PathOrURI` class that encapsulates this behaviour, but for now this works. 
I am on the road now. When I get back home I can do that.   > On Jun 21, 2019, at 2:21 AM, Bastien Jansen <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > Could you go to Help > Show Logs in explorer and attach idea.log please? >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/antlr/intellij-plugin-v4/issues/358?email_source=notifications&email_token=ACCDGVUXLNZHCGWK5S2V5CLP3SFRNA5CNFSM4HWHSIWKYY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGODYHZQFI#issuecomment-504338453>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACCDGVX5NJGKZTTBJDE3GL3P3SFRNANCNFSM4HWHSIWA>. >

Yes I think that is the problem I have had

Okay so we've rolled out the updated version onto the server, and all the things I _was_ losing.. are now found!  Trouble is now other things are being lost periodically.  At present I will occasionally search for "Copper" and see 3 types of Copper Ingots (as in .. from 3 different mods) in my system despite the fact that I know I only have 1 type in my system. So I pull out the 2nd and 3rd ones with smaller amounts and once on my cursor they magically transform into say.. Copper Wiring. Or Copper Plates.  If I put these items back into the system.. they transform back into copper ingots from other mods again. Really strange.  Please let me know if you need anymore testing. I would love to give you a map download so you could test it but unfortunately I don't have access to do that. I can do testing however. 
Hello,  I check my project and see some issues. So, i will correct it and return to you, as soon as possible.  thanks

I've found a work around for the issue by not registering the gpdsc files to fGeneratedPacks unless it actually exist. This will also solve the issue with the listener which then is activated when the .gpdsc actually exist on disc. However, saving the rteconfig before the gpdsc will leave the GUI red for the CubeOption until a new selection event occurs. For this I've found no solution.

Ok i'm sorry, i need to clarify this issue, apparently.  It's not that /back isn't doing the correct thing, it is?  What's doing the wrong thing is the respawn location when you have backondeath permission.  I'm being told the respawn location after death is somewhat random?  Not sure why that would be  https://pastebin.com/J8bzr7Yu  My recent experience has been to respawn in the last location I had tped to before I'd died last instead of the death location, that... is not very helpful.  I don't know if my configuration needs to be updated for changes in a later build to deal with a change or what.   Death doesn't have to happen, I'm having similar issues just logging back on... and being taken back to the last place I tped to instead of the place I logged out from.  This didn't used to happen so... thinking it may be a recent thing.

Yeah, it looks like it does use less fuel as well as cooking faster.
@michaelzangl Yes, definitely. It's not high terrain, like in #215 . It's steep terrain, probably the maximum amount of height difference. 
Bug didnt fix the issue,  vnc still blank , For ssh no error during ssh installation but i executed "etc/init.d/sshd start" and thats whtve got :  bash: /etc/init.d/sshd: No such file or directory But the wierd thing that ssh is working from inside tried to ssh my linux server and was ok ,but from outside(my lap or localhost)  it rejects  , i have ssh tested with debian and centos also reject.   Note:  vnc worked fine with debian Note:  i had same results from 2 mobile phones , samsung s7 edge and huawei nova 3i 
Hi, @danieldietrich ,  Thank you for your quick response!  I see and agree with that storing the hash lazily _can_ have a significant memory overhead. Maybe it would make sense in Scala, a language that has native support for lazy fields, where most of the overhead (the `Lazy` instance, the lambda for the supplier, the `Integer` instance, and thus the implications on GC) would not be present. The fact that Scala's immutable collections don't do this is a good sign that, even in Scala, it still doesn't worth it _generally_.  When the benefits do outweigh the above overhead, such a wrapper class that you proposed seems perfectly feasible to me. We'll consider implementing that class given that our measurements confirm that it worths doing so. As a wise man once said: "Measure, don't premature!"  The fix for this issue in master is perfectly fine by me, and I'm looking forward towards your next release. :) Until then, we'll stick to your snapshot builds.  Keep up the good work! 
Sorry, I thought the title would be sufficient  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc5 it is p/o manual installation, 5 lines from the bottom

It would straight up crash the app. Once I restarted the app, it wouldn't have saved any changes.  I can reproduce it again, if you want a crash dump.
Yeah I know, it's difficult to say... I have so many mods that mess with rendering and I'm just gonna hope that the issue goes away if I update some of them...
@ctron  Please read #586  for the different directories. 
Turned out to be a generally rare circumstance that wouldn't affect a server operating "normally"  If you loaded the plugin while the server is up and you are logged in at the time the plugin is loaded, you are not added to the actors internal database, and any database insertions that require a non-null actor throw an exception. Logging out and back in again fixes the issue.
I took some logs with the inbuilt logger. For Alice, who creates the group, i got: ```E/MessagesProvider: unable to update thread metadata (threadId not found)```  And for Bob, who doesn't get a notification: ```W/MessageCenterService: invalid or unauthorized group command```  Thats all interesting I've got.  edit: Are you able to reproduce the problem? Or am I the only one experiencing this issue? I've built Kontalk with my smiley converter added. Actually that didn't made any problem for me so far. Or is it a problem caused by localization? I'm on a german build...   2nd edit: It looks like the ```unable to update thread metadata (threadId not found)``` problem is directly occuring after Alice removes the group. I'll get a logcat tomorrow.

Hi. I've used another framework but to help you figure out the problem, I was using the latest SDK 0.5.2. I was also using SmartTab layout library (https://github.com/ogaclejapan/SmartTabLayout ) And I believe that was having some problems (Just guessing because of sliding_tabs).

> Could you share your .jar? I tried a few versions and all of them work fine.  I downloaded the game from this site and none work. [http://dedomil.net/games/2750/screens](http://dedomil.net/games/2750/screens)  Vídeo [https://youtu.be/8X8ecv4jFf8](https://youtu.be/8X8ecv4jFf8)
well, we test it several times and fps droping to 1 from 60 only when ability being charge. And yes its flushing console
We have several threads running, some are related to audio processing, some to streaming, some to REST requests.. We're not using RxJava, just plain old Threads, wrapped in our own wrapper. 
Not every time. Its a one time thing for this upcoming update. I've written most of the code and will probably be making the change within the next day or two, so people(me included) will have to click the clear _clear database_ button, and rescan their libraries.  > Also, storing IPs doesn't seem like a good idea from a privacy perspective.  I just did some thinking about this, and you're right. But I still need a way to uniquely link an uploader's computer to the songs they've chosen to share though.   I think I'm going to go with the uploader's MAC Address. That'd uniquely identify the uploader, without compromising their network location.  > And what if multiple people are seeding the same song?  That's not an issue here; The original uploader is the person who creates the .torrent file, no one else can, because song's are unique. When another person clicks play, they're just grabbing the torrent file that the original uploader made.

No luck. Better exception though  Release build with 8.6.0 results in this on the emulator:  ``` 2020-01-07 13:19:04.839 7031-7031/?

From the point of the gist, it doesn't matter. It's just simple java application based on lsp4j which starts as language server for yaml file types and send notification to the client on didSave event. It works fine, but sometimes initializing is going forever. It's also true for JSON language server. 
I actually used a factory: https://github.com/ctron/hono-example-demo-gauge/blob/master/.factory.json
Hi, It must have been some error introduced during updates of the Nextcloud app - I deleted cache & storage in Android app settings of Nextcloud and now it works. Let's consider this for a "closed" issue.
Adding the timeout indeed improved the response time to recovery. It's still a bit longer than I'd like, but considerably better.  Thanks!
Here is the expected behavior  ```         Factory factory = TestUtils.createFactory();         CtClass<?> clazz = factory                 .Code()                 .createCodeSnippetStatement(                         "" + "class X {" + "public void foo() {"                                 + " Class klass=null;"                                 + "  boolean x= (klass == short.class);"                                 + "}};")                 .compile();         CtMethod<?> foo = (CtMethod<?>) clazz.getMethods().toArray()[0];          CtBlock<?> body = foo.getBody();         CtLocalVariable<?> ass = body.getStatement(1);         CtBinaryOperator<?> op = (CtBinaryOperator<?>) ass.getDefaultExpression();               assertEquals("Class", op.getLeftHandOperand().getType().getSimpleName());         assertFalse(op.getLeftHandOperand().getType().isPrimitive());         assertEquals("Class", op.getRightHandOperand().getType().getSimpleName());         assertFalse(op.getRightHandOperand().getType().isPrimitive());  ``` 
Great contribution @snirs90. For my project I ended up using another solution: https://github.com/kennyki/angular-thumbnail. 
http://www.mkint.net/heap.bin i might be wrong, and this might be general behavior, but I don't see that handles are being destroyed here ?  Also I have replicated the same thing without any of my classes. I have setup on message received for the server to send "eventtest" string. Memory still builds up until eventually it gets outofmemory. So, here is the relevant code:         ServerBootstrap bootstrap = new ServerBootstrap(         new NioServerSocketChannelFactory(Executors.newCachedThreadPool(), Executors.newCachedThreadPool()));         bootstrap.setPipelineFactory(new AlphaPipeline());  pipeline:     public ChannelPipeline getPipeline() throws Exception {         ChannelPipeline pipeline = pipeline();                 SSLEngine engine = AlphaSSLContextFactory.getServerContext().createSSLEngine();         engine.setUseClientMode(false);     pipeline.addLast("ssl", new SslHandler(engine));     pipeline.addLast("framer", new DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder(8192, Delimiters.lineDelimiter()));     pipeline.addLast("decoder", new StringDecoder());     pipeline.addLast("encoder", new StringEncoder());     pipeline.addLast("handler", new AlphaHandle());     return pipeline;  handle:  ``` public void messageReceived(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e) {     e.getChannel().write("eventtest\n"); } ```  I also have ssl part of the app, but i don't know if it's relevant for this problem. 
I am also not fully sure. Is the check ``isEncryptedFile()`` done after obtaining the permission?
I'm test it. No error message. But why 2 equal folders are created?  > \userdata\mapdb\  > \userdata\persistence\mapdb\
@xcaspar OK， honored to do.
Here is a demo project using TextMeshPro. I think it will be already in the project, but if not, in Unity, you should go to Window -> Package Manager -> Select "All" tab, search for TextMesh Pro and install it (in the right panel).  [TextMeshProConsuloBug.zip](https://github.com/consulo/consulo-unity3d/files/2374231/TextMeshProConsuloBug.zip)  For the AVPro plugin, I can't upload a demo project because it is a paid plugin. I'll look a way to send you the demo for this.

Hey, I made a repository with a sample app with which I have managed to reproduce the issue 100% of times provided I follow these **exact steps**.  https://github.com/AndreiHarasemiuc/Android-Job-Rescheduling-Issue-sample  1. Launch the app 2. App will wait 10 seconds (Handler.postDelayed) and schedule an exact job with a delay of 20 seconds. 3. At the moment you see in the logs that the job has been scheduled, close off the app from recent tasks. 4. In 20 seconds the job will run. The job will do 2 things. Show a notification & schedule another job with a delay of 1 minute. 5. When the job runs and the notification is displayed, immediately click the notification. Clicking the notification will take you to an empty activity. As soon as that activity opens, background the app.  Result: The second job that you just scheduled (with a delay of 1 minute) will run with a delay of 0 seconds soon after you background the app.  Please note that the sample app does not use _1.2.0-alpha3_ because I had some weird errors and couldn't buld the project and didn't have time to see what they were about. so I used _1.1.11_ **However**, I succesfully added _1.2.0-alpha3_ in my main project and I could still reproduce the issue just like before.  > 
Hi Luca,  I was able to observe this in the current 1.6.3 release and also 1.5.1 releases. If any folder in the path $ORIENTDB_HOME has any spaces in it, it is not able to find the orietndb-client-log.properties. 
It looks perfectly reasonable from that log output and when I select that line in particular (granted, after I've added the index back in) it looks fine.  I count 10 columns.  I dug into this before I figured out the index fix. I don't know why it's expecting 8 (apparently it thinks `header == null`) or getting 9 (apparently that's what `condenseTrailingTokens` does)  If I pad that site to get the VC above and below they all look well behaved, whitespace and everything: ``` chr14^I24736867^Irs854413^IT^IC^I.^IPASS^IAC=2;AF=1.00;AN=2;DB;DP=31;ExcessHet=0.5837;FS=0.000;InbreedingCoeff=0.0411;MQ=59.97;MQRankSum=-1.800e-02;MQ_DP=24250;POSITIVE_TRAIN_SITE;QD=25.91;QUALapprox=616134;ReadPosRankSum=0.576;SOR=0.704;VQSLOD=2.30;VarDP=23778;culprit=MQRankSum^IGT:AD:DP:GQ:PGT:PID:PL:SB^I1/1:0,31:31:93:0|1:24736864_A_G:1036,93,0:0,0,15,16$ chr14^I24737838^Irs1101636^IC^IT^I.^IPASS^IAC=2;AF=1.00;AN=2;DB;DP=38;ExcessHet=0.7420;FS=0.000;InbreedingCoeff=0.0357;MQ=59.98;MQRankSum=0.026;MQ_DP=24332;POSITIVE_TRAIN_SITE;QD=22.41;QUALapprox=537499;ReadPosRankSum=0.567;SOR=0.685;VQSLOD=2.09;VarDP=23982;culprit=DP^IGT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:SB^I1/1:1,37:38:79:1150,79,0:0,1,17,20$ chr14^I24739444^Irs12435407^IA^IT^I.^IPASS^IAC=2;AF=1.00;AN=2;DB;DP=30;ExcessHet=0.4770;FS=0.000;InbreedingCoeff=0.0430;MQ=59.99;MQRankSum=-6.000e-02;MQ_DP=17420;POSITIVE_TRAIN_SITE;QD=27.90;QUALapprox=478116;ReadPosRankSum=0.293;SOR=0.698;VQSLOD=2.27;VarDP=17137;culprit=MQRankSum^IGT:AD:DP:GQ:PGT:PID:PL:SB^I1/1:1,29:30:21:0|1:24739444_A_T:1167,21,0:1,0,15,14$ ```
Hmm, most warnings aren't decorated with a stack trace. And it does say NullRefException... It does restart the new version, but this seems to be an error in some progress monitoring code?

Everything starts from `HttpRequest` that contains `EofException` as it's request failure.  ``` java         @Override         public void onComplete(Result result)         {             HttpRequest request = (HttpRequest)result.getRequest();             ContentResponse response = new HttpContentResponse(result.getResponse(), getContent(), getMediaType(), getEncoding());             if (result.isFailed())             {                 Throwable failure = result.getFailure();                 if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())                     LOG.debug("Authentication challenge failed {}", failure);                 forwardFailureComplete(request, result.getRequestFailure(), response, result.getResponseFailure());                 return;             } ... ```  then the problem is forwarded to a response notifier ...  ``` java         private void forwardFailureComplete(HttpRequest request, Throwable requestFailure, Response response, Throwable responseFailure)         {             HttpConversation conversation = request.getConversation();             conversation.updateResponseListeners(null);             notifier.forwardFailureComplete(conversation.getResponseListeners(), request, requestFailure, response, responseFailure);         } ```  .. that in turn it's calls `forwardFailure`  ``` java     public void forwardFailureComplete(List<Response.ResponseListener> listeners, Request request, Throwable requestFailure, Response response, Throwable responseFailure)     {         forwardFailure(listeners, response, responseFailure);         notifyComplete(listeners, new Result(request, requestFailure, response, responseFailure));     } ```  My problem was the missing response failure that eventually caused an NPE in my listener. It's missing because the original cause of `HttpRequest.isFailed` was actually a request failure.  ``` java     public void notifyFailure(List<Response.ResponseListener> listeners, Response response, Throwable failure)     {         // Optimized to avoid allocations of iterator instances         for (int i = 0; i < listeners.size(); ++i)         {             Response.ResponseListener listener = listeners.get(i);             if (listener instanceof Response.FailureListener)                 notifyFailure((Response.FailureListener)listener, response, failure);         }     } ```  I was thinking that shouldn't request failures be given to `org.eclipse.jetty.client.RequestNotifier` instead?

Hey @ilayaperumalg Let me clarify a little bit.   When viewing the Job Executions via the UI or via the shell it shows a `Step Executions Count`. So when I create a composed task and launch it, for example : ``` task create foo --definition "AAA && BBB" task launch foo ``` The `Step Executions Count` is 2. However when I launch `foo` again, for example: ``` task launch foo --arguments "a=1" ``` The `Step Executions Count` for both job executions will be 4. Hope that clarifies it a bit.  
I can't tell whether it's a regression, since I'm using it for about one month. Project uses Eclipse's `.classpth`. There are several maven and gradle projects in working tree, but maven and gradle support is disabled.  Project consists of 220 jar dependencies (`<classpathentry kind="lib"` in .classpath) and 80 source entries  grepped all sources and calculated number of srcs ```sh cat .classpath | grep 'kind="src"' | awk '{print $3}' | sed -rne 's_path="(.+)".+_\1_p' > flds cat flds | while read fl; do echo -n "$fl ";  { find $fl -name '*.java' | wc -l ; }; done ```  Most projects consist of about 10 source files, 10 projects about 100 files and one of more than thousand.

You are correct Tom, currently remote debugging is not allowed by default in Java 11+. Allowing it all the time would be a security concern, which Alasdair also raised on PR #7834.  Right now I've gone with a solution that leaves the default behavior as is, and if the user wants to enable remote debugging on their server they will be able to set the `WLP_DEBUG_REMOTE=y` env var.
actually with the samples that you given, but i just change the data and add some function to do multiple delete.

@fortninja It causes extra stress on the mechanical components. Running that motor at -1 while it is spinning at 5000RPM is worse than stall conditions.

I don't know. Just executing them, I guess? 😉   The problem with these tests for sure is that they actually are integration tests, not only testing the binding, but indirectly also the complete ESH framework. That's why the are hit by asynchronous behavior, automated magic like autoupdate if item states, auto linking and all that. If some of these things change in a slight aspect (e.g. timing, implemented in a different way), then these tests also suffer.  I think if you want to really get rid of this stuff, then it would make sense to reduce the test scope to the binding itself, just making sure it uses the ESH APIs correctly. I.e. if you want to test if a certain action leads to an item update, just take the standalone ThingHandler, feed it with a mocked ThingHandlerCallback and ensure it's calling `stateUpdated(...)`. Don't care what happens afterwards.   The new [testing documentation](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/blob/master/docs/documentation/development/testing.md#mockito) gives a pretty good example of how this can be done using plain Java 8 (hooray) with Mockito. For the majority of binding tests, this suffices and there is hardly any need for OSGiTests.
Oh blast it, sorry about that, 2.1 RC5.

Yes. So basically, when user tried to join the room in a freshly installed app, this crash occurs as soon as he joins the room after giving the camera permission. It does not occur after that

@Yongyao I don't see how the changes in that commit would affect searching. The only Java file that changed seems unrelated to searching.
Oh, I forgot to mention that I had already checked that file. It saves the user what I created and the odd part is, that the file remains unaffected after reboot (it doesn't remove the user or change it's password hash). I also use Windows so there shouldn't be problem with the write/read permissions.
This seems to compile properly now. Please let me know when it goes live and I will follow up with the customer.

Sorry, for the bauble method, it is not offered when i am in lua for testing purposes and when i try to call it I get nill error, so i pressume it doesnt exist. I get nill error for the group method as well.
Don’t know exactly will have him tell me once he is back. Or send him here directly so he can provide the information as this one happened to him.
Hello,  Perhaps, I have made a mistake. In fact, I have Android Studio 3.4.2 The version is not very old, so many developers can't open your project.  I have found another project :  https://github.com/AlexandreLouisnard/android-compass   which work well for me .

Compass implementation providing azimuth (East of the magnetic North, counterclockwise), pitch (vertical inclination) and roll (horizontal inclination) of the device, in degrees. github.com  If the problem does not come from the version of Android Studio, perhaps, you have modified the configuration of your android studio, and users haven't the same.

I will try to make a patch. I'm not sure of the appropriate fix. My first thought was to throw exception when end-of-stream is detected in the decodeNext method, but I have not looked back at all the callers to see how everyone handles the null response it currently emits. If that's not the right place, then providing a specific fix for the decodeInfinitiveLength method seems straightforward enough.   @c-rack If you have any insight as to where I should focus the fix, please advise. Otherwise I will fork, fix, and send you a pull request as my work schedule allows .
@fbiville yeah, i think it makes sense now.

yes 
I can confirm that interpolated value is `null` now (as opposed to `"null"` string), however `required = true` is still not respected. In other words, I expect `MissingParameterException` if the option value was not provided, I don't expect `null`.  And to reiterate, I don't specifically want to use `defaultValue` attribute. I am looking for a way to define an option that will check explicit command line arg (`--mypath=...`) first, then check environment variable (`$MYPATH`), then fail with clear error message if neither is available (and obviously use  `--mypath=...` or `$MYPATH` value if available). Do you consider this a reasonable usecase or this isn't something picocli is meant to do? 
The comment is "future thoughts". When we restructure, it may be easier if we know that a function is just a pure function, as in 234319, nothing like `toBe()` of Hamlet. A function is pure roughly when it has no side effects, and when it does not depend on external values.  
I am also using 2.0.2 version but still facing the issue. 
@big-andy-coates just catching up on this - it is the same issue, we both logged it :) If it works on master, then we can close this 👍 
The `ImmutableList` is from Google Guava. I tried running my code with the PR, but the problem still persists.  By experimenting, I found out that this code is enough to provoke the stack overflow: ```java @Mapper public abstract class StackOverflowMapper {  	protected ImmutableList<AElement> mapImmutableList(ImmutableList<BElement> test) { 		return null; 	}  } ```  
Hi David, Thanks for the information. I will check and let you know about network errors. Regarding Java dump file, it seems so big 260 MB even after ZIP.I am not able to attach here or send through email. Can you please let me know the way to attach the big files.  
For some reason if I enable the HCChickens option in the better with mods config it works. If it's disabled it crashes.

This happens when I enter a server that has the latest build of this mod installed, and the clientside has it too.

Thanks for your reply, divadsn, I tried so far: - turn the notifications off/on - I have the Google Dialer set as a default phone app - turn on the priority notifications for the Dialer  Unfortunately, still no luck.
Sorry for the late response. So when I tried doing the changes on the workspace , the workspace wasn't starting. The changes were very minimal like adding the environment variables, or updating some files in project workspace. This happened when I was doing on the cloud account. However when I have the eclipse che on my local host, i am not facing this issue. Looks like only in the cloud ee are having this limitations while on the local host it works absolutely fine.

> The implementation seems to have gone away from this plan and made the false assumption that it can somehow 'fence' the data being written so it can use the same file.  It doesn't reuse the file. It marks it as read-only and then it gets its length so it can compute the starting offset of the next file. If that (older) file's length changes afterwards due to a concurrent write finishing off, then the offsets will not match the sum of lengths before that.  There is, however, a way by which the file is indeed used. After a successful open-write (fencing), the Segment's files are auto-compacted. This means that empty files are deleted (except last one, since it was just created), and multiple files are concatenated into the first file, to avoid having an excessive number of smaller files sitting around.  > use the appropriate naming scheme so that the ambiguity does not exist in the first place.  We are using the naming scheme we originally agreed upon. But it gets very hairy in some cases. Suppose you have this, for segment "a" (this assumes no auto-compaction is done, to explain how the very very original proposal would've worked): ``` a_0_1 (read-only, length 100) a_100_2 (read-only, length 0) a_100_3 (read-only, length 50) a_100_4 (read-write, variable length) ``` This gets very confusing. If you want to read byte 100, do you read from third or fourth file?  With auto-compaction still off, *and the changes proposed in this issue on* , we'd have this situation  ``` a_0_1 (read-only, length 100) a_100_2 (read-only, length 0) a_100_3 (read-only, length 50) a_150_4 (read-write, variable length) ``` This makes it very clear where we want to read byte 101 (it's the third file).  With auto-compaction on (again, auto-compaction is already in the code), it looks like this: ``` a_0_1 (read-only, length 150) a_150_4 (read-write, variable length) ```
@stephanrauh Actually, OmniFaces is not part of my WEB-INF/lib folder. I was just investigating OmniFaces's solution as you advised me in a previous post.  Before moving to BootsFaces I was using PrimeFaces and never got such warning. Do you think it is maybe be due to the blend of BootsFaces and PrimeFaces? 
Can't reproduce it now either.

I can't duplicate your success using the same json document, so something else must be the issue.

Yes, item rendering is correct, see the screenshot. ![2018-01-01_11 04 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11092555/34466915-9c44da24-eee3-11e7-85b8-c8ed5f8905bb.png) 
Yeah i use jobsreborn
Yes I select "Without Site Skeleton", in that case, the categories are synchronized even if I don't check the "Include taxonomy" option. I will check that again. 
I agree that would be best to match transit. Transit has an index with the time departure and after that says the line and more things in the map view, but in the itineraries fragment it just says "1. takes 5 min".  So, we can add the index and always say "1. 3400m - 5 min" instead of  "1. Ride 751m takes 2 min", in the map view, to have information about the distance. I think that is good to avoid the use of Ride or Walk here to have the same output for all the bike routes even if they start with a little leg of walking, also matches better the idea of the transit part. In the itineraries fragment we can just say "1. takes 4 min" if it is OK, as it is in transit, being this way more verbose in this part than in the map view.  I have tested Netherlands server and it happens the same failure with `itinerary` fields, so I will report the bug.  2014-01-29 Sean Barbeau notifications@github.com  > @vreixo https://github.com/vreixo Thanks for looking into this! For the > text, how about we just match what is shown for transit "xxxx - 4 min"? > This is simple and understandable, I think, and avoids translation issues. > This would apply to both walk and bike trips. >  > Could you please report the above server-side bug on the main OTP repo? > Once this is fixed, I do like splitting out bike and walk time.

I know courser does not allow that, both me and my opponent were confused when I couldn't play the land, neither of us knew why it didn't work. However it is now several games ago so the details are getting blurry. How I recall it, I was playing U/B control, the board was empty except for lands and ashiok, last turn I exiled a courser from my opponent with her, so first thing I do this turn is put it on the battlefield with her minus ability. Subsequently an Urborg was revealed from the top of my deck, but I could not play it (I clicked it multiple times while stack was empty and I had priority etc but nothing happened). When trying to cast something else from my hand, the game immediately responded after the first click (so it was not stuck or lag or anything). Maybe I did play a land from my hand and I don't remember it, however I don't see myself being surprised at that moment.. :/ 
Server response is fine since i can use it with other accounts. But with some specific accounts, it takes 10s from i click "Connect" until the message appears. And if i give a wrong password, i get an error immediately while using the correct password it times out.

Yeah, the /NPC name command toggles it on or completely off. What I mean is the name plate showing only when the NPC is being looked at instead of showing all the time. It used to be like that before 1.9. Currently name tags used on regular mobs give the effect I'm talking about

@atiqsayyed Generic fix is better. You need to read the [CSS specs](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) to ensure that other elements are not adversely affected. (Fortunately we have the automated tests now, as a safety net). [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is also a good resource. 
I tested Hellbark, Willow, and Pine (both from BoP) Irrigation Channels, and the same still occurred.  They are unable to be broken.  I then tested vanilla Oak and Spruce Irrigation Channels, and the same occurred.  It appears none of the channels are able to be broken.  ![2016-12-26_07 48 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13632484/21482899/b9ab9350-cb3f-11e6-87c1-482fc5a5ed8b.png) 
@jikuja  I compiled the launcher with only comment out:  arguments.add("-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"); in File src/main/java/net/ftb/minecraft/MCLauncher.java  and im able to play modpack direwolf20 1.10.2 on my server wich has only a IPv6 address. Before with the unmodified launcher i wasn't able to play and got PROTOCOL FAMILY UNAVAILABLE error while try to connect.   System.setProperty("java.net.preferIPv4Stack", "true"); https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.11.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/fml/common/launcher/FMLTweaker.java#L50  I think this dosen't affect the connection. the same line is also in the Main here: System.setProperty("java.net.preferIPv4Stack", "true"); https://github.com/Slowpoke101/FTBLaunch/blob/master/src/main/java/net/ftb/main/Main.java#L128  So i think this is for the launcher to download updates and i think forge does this too to download missing libraries ore something, but i'm not sure.
Yes, problem exists on both android mobile chrome browser and desktop browser accessing the mobile UI. Here is the only output from the javascript console:   Consider using 'dppx' units, as in CSS 'dpi' means dots-per-CSS-inch, not dots-per-physical-inch, so does not correspond to the actual 'dpi' of a screen. In media query expression: (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio: 1), (max-resolution: 120dpi)  I believe you are correct that it is related to #126 because I have, on some occasions, opened the mobile UI on my phone and did not see one or two devices, even after waiting for a while, they never showed up. 
Sure !   Use this model, and when the model pauses, look at the simulated time, it should be the last day of the year, 23:50. The following step should add 10 more minutes, making it to one year simulated. You will see that the time simulated is not correct.  <img width="380" alt="screenshot 2019-02-23 at 7 22 33 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15722750/53285823-7a708400-37a0-11e9-9e3f-0d41e8bffbe5.png">  <img width="402" alt="screenshot 2019-02-23 at 7 22 42 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15722750/53285825-7b091a80-37a0-11e9-8710-7f51121b6bd9.png">  ^here it should be 1y 00m 00d 00:00  ``` /*** * Name: Show_Bug_Year * Author: Damien * Description:  * Tags: Tag1, Tag2, TagN ***/  model Show_Bug_Year  /* Insert your model definition here */  global { 	int tmp <- 10; 	 	float step <- 10#minute; 	 	reflex pause_before_year when: cycle=365*24*6-2 	{ 		do pause; 	} }  experiment show_bug type:gui { 	 }  ```

Wouldn't that trigger the game's handle detectors? I mean its not opening any handles and modifying them, but it's certain that its modifying something it's injecting a dll.   I'm not exactly sure how to reproduce this problem, but I'm in Windows 7 so I think it's an OS exclusive problem. (I would move to Win10 soon just enjoying the 7's company till it ends in 2020) But it's exactly that download a beatmap on an actual browser that osu!mer is assigned in and try to exit the browser then play a multiplayer game then download a beatmap then osu!mer would download the beatmap but won't import it.

Apologies, I didn't explain my intention clearly. What I am proposing is that the default header pattern simply be "*" when constructing a SimpleKafkaHeaderMapper with the parameterless constructor, e.g. ``` public SimpleKafkaHeaderMapper() { 	super("*"); } ``` The user is free to pass in any set of patterns they wish via the alternative constructor, namely: ``` public SimpleKafkaHeaderMapper(String... patterns) { 	super(patterns); } ```
By "banned" I mean my SSH account gets suspended for a certain time like if there were to many connection attempts with wrong credentials. I cannot even ssh the server in a terminal and my present ssh connections get killed.  With the previous version of DBeaver (6.3.1 something), this hapenned only the first time I tested the tunnel configuration, I had no more possibilities to connect to that machine using SSH for a while which was the time to ask the sysadmin what was wrong with that machine ("nope, everything is fine"), when I got back to my desktop the SSH came back and I could use the SSH tunnel. I use exactly the same configuration that it was with DBeaver 6.3.1, I just updgraded to 6.3.2 and since then there is no way to connect via SSH tunnel.  I'm using the same private key file in Mysql-workbench and it' OK. RSA PRIVATE KEY Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED DEK-Info: AES-128-CB

[Here's the log](https://gist.github.com/doits/537176b4aa4be5eaa8233105e71b0590) I've taken while trying to upload multiple pictures to nextcloud, using beta-20161107.  It uploaded just one file, but in Photos I selected 11. The uploaded picture is neither the first or the last one of my selection, it is one in the middle.  The upload view only has the picture that was uploaded, others are missing. 
ok so after futher testing i noted that, if none of the items in a kit has a desiganted slot the items just dont appear, but once only one item has a slot everything works again, i also noticed that it only applies to items e.g. potion effects work all the time

Thanks for your reply, this problem has been solved, but this seems to be more complicated than the JsonLayout that comes with log4j2. Do you have any suggestions for this? [ ![捕获](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34642172/60679299-b8ea1e00-9eb9-11e9-890e-524948d00579.PNG) ](url)

Thanks for quick response. The custom header is visible in the traces. The name is `management-access-token`, we are using this header to secure access to management/actuator endpoints.
Issue Resolved: Apologies, I should have specified that I am also using the wonderful STOMP client on top of the OKHttp3Client websockets: https://github.com/NaikSoftware/StompProtocolAndroid by Nickolay Savchenko (Nickolay Savchenko NaikSoftware). This library does an exceptional job of implementing the STOMP protocol integrated with OKHttp3 websockets.  This is where I fell short by using the wrong StompClient.over method to provide my url, which will create a default websocket instance that has a default socket read timeout (30 seconds ?). The  solution for me was to use the alternative StompClient.over method, allowing for a reference to an application instance of the OKHttp3Client. This allows the application set it's desired timeouts beyond any defaults.  Thank you to all of you who did try to assist me.

Yes and yes. The process is simple  1. Install TaskBar https://f-droid.org/app/com.farmerbb.taskbar.  2. Launch it.  3. activate it in the upper right corner, any setting does not affect anything though you might want to go to the general settings and set position on top.

To Reproduce: 1) Click e.g. on a bestow enchantment creature card on your hand. 2) The ability picker window opens, with three choices. 3) Click now on any other card/permanent outside the ability picker window. Nothing happens, the ability picker window stays open. 4) Now try to pick an ability from ability picker window (that's still open). You click on a choice and the window closes. But no ability is picked, Nothing happens.  
@PhilJay sorry for not being more specific with the report. The issue is indeed that the first graph pictured does not start at 0. The reason I believe this is a bug is due to the fact that I am passing (0,0) as a value but it is not showing up in the graph that has large negative components. Even setting the last value to a positive number does not fix the issue. Is there perhaps some other value I need to set that I'm just not aware of? 
The function is our performance. Making for almost each http request additional http request that sometimes (not sure is it always or not ) make query to database   - is unacceptable solution. 
Yes, this is an HA setup (2.3.2). We use a rather weird setup (I can't even tell why, the decision has been made without my participation): one instance is embedded into Java app and the slave is in standalone mode + configured as `slave_only`. We restarted the application and this embedded instance's logs had these lines. I stopped the app again, configured a standalone neo4j distribution to use app's data directory and it reconfigured itself OK. Then I stopped the standalone neo4j, started the app with an embedded DB and everything seems fine.

@ronblum Thank you!  I am using Firefox 69.0 (64 bit). It seems like all customized shortcuts fail to work.
I normally change the type by right-clicking on the entry. Just to be clear, the entry does change types, but I am normally unable to use the entry editor again until I restart Jabref. The issue does not appear to be strictly tied to the entry type - sometimes just changing a random field will also cause the entry editor to fail. Sometimes it is the act of saving the record. Sometimes it is setting the quality indicator. I will attach the bib file (renamed to txt) [Mitrephanes.txt](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/files/1733657/Mitrephanes.txt)  I am trying to clean up - perhaps it is something in the file itself (the file was generated from Google Scholar) Also, I will attach the event log the next time it crashes - it should not take long because this morning it has been crashing on every entry. Thanks for your attention.

OK, now I understand the problem with my configuration... I clearly misunderstood what `quarkus.log.console.level` does. And honestly it makes absolute sense, has I think it's been very well thought out now that I read the guide properly!  And it worked properly for both `application.properties` and `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` so I am going to go ahead and close this.  Perhaps the various **minimum** levels that come into play should be more clear, since that's what I hadn't noticed initially 
Yes, I use mCropImageView.setImageUriAsync(Uri.parse(mUriStr)) to set the image. I guess It doesn't work because there's no ExifInfo available. To be honest, I never dig deeply into how Picasso works. But every time I use Picasso.with(context).load(uri).into(imageView), it will fix the problem automatically.

done ... you can read the result on attached image  ![mwsnap016 2015-07-25 09_33_19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13494003/8888504/53db985a-32b0-11e5-8c20-cf2c9a5a2e07.jpg) 
@digitalbuddha  Ah yes, I updated my reply above
I suspect this was mostly related to a permission problem, it resolved using the solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58076893/get-neo4j-version-from-dump)
Well, since I don't have any particular way I know to reproduce this, let's just close it. Thanks! 
@arimorty  sorry i not speak english very well T.T my explain   i use galaxys3 device left menu color white use -> but left arrow not white  so find source.... tint method drawable change drawable.mutate() so fixed.... 
@hazeliao yeah sure, I appreciate the help. If more information is required let me know.
I don't think so. The two layers that get mixed up are both of type 'span'.
I am always selecting trackables over inventory of a cache like this one: - Search for GC1EK7E - Open the cache data - Tap on Inventory - Select "I want to find the...." (TB3W6GY) - Select again - No logs shown  Same happens if i directly search and open the TB. Version: 2.26 RC3 
Wow! It is fixed in 1.5.3-SNAPSHOT. I will close this issue.

Looking at [os-platform-finder](https://github.com/aurbroszniowski/os-platform-finder/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoftbiz/utils/OS.java#L244) it actually uses `lsb-release` instead, which contains:  ``` LSB_VERSION=1.4 DISTRIB_ID=Arch DISTRIB_RELEASE=rolling DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Arch Linux" ```  Since Arch is a rolling distro, it doesn't have a version

@heiko-braun I was not sure if they are related or not, that's why I posted the sencond issue just as comment and that led to creation of #4848. Anyway, tried to reproduce this issue (#4791) with todays install of syndesis and the exception is no longer there. Edit: the server pod is exception free, but when I tried to edit the integration and edit the OData connection in it, it just loads the connector forever and the whole syndesis is broken from that point.
@TWiStErRob Thank you very much for your help. I tried 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT(glide-4.0.0-20151212.212519-126.jar)but it did not fix，the same  effect as above:( 
Oh my goodness I'm sorry! I forgot to add that. I'm using Stoneblock 2, Version: 1.0.1.  Also thank you!

Confirmed on 24a crash no longer happens. 
I opened the Quarry (as it now as a GUI in 8.0), and wondered if the new items are a filter. I couldn't put anything in, and tried shift-clicking, when it crashed.
I'm afraid I cannot justify the time to further edit videos that are intended for such a small audience.  If I am to spend the time cutting down the video (assuming this does not get my bug reports ignored because I could have faked the problem)  then I will have to release it to a wider audience to justify the time I spend on it.  Is that what you would prefer in future?  I have a 43 minute video about bins clipping through ceilings when harvested even if the ceiling is many blocks thick.  Currently it is private, but I would be willing to cut it down, but then I'd have to make it public to justify the extra time spent.

I am not sure there is a bug here at all, we are just a bit stuck on why we can't hear the user.  We don't have an Android Q device handy ATM to test with.  The audio is definitely making it out of the user's device as we get it in the recording on the Web/JS side.  The bandwidth on the audio stream is good and the level is not 0.  We do client side recording there by grabbing the streams and merging them using: https://github.com/t-mullen/video-stream-merger  It is possible that the recorder is interfering with playing the audio, but we don't see this show up other times (many, many calls).  I could certainly share our code, but I am not sure it is relevant here.  These were the rooms: RM309040c6fa19193b61e671d2f8b11966 RMdf681fe71dd64dbb6c202b4dba0e3a68  Since this happens on a user device we don't have logs.  If you add the ability for a custom logger we could provide lower level Twilio logs (I mentioned this in an iOS github issue as well).

I create the LinkedHashMap and then register the command with it while it has nothing in it. Afterwards I put a BooleanArgument in it and register the command again. ``` LinkedHashMap<String, Argument> arguments = new LinkedHashMap<>();         commandAPI.register("trample", new CommandPermission("wikiop.general.trampling"), arguments, (sender, args) -> {             if(sender instanceof Player) {                 Player player = (Player) sender;                 player.sendMessage("Triggered the command");             }         }); ```
Cant confirm becouse I cant run my server without TT, I think its TT becouse its also handeling network stuff.  If its not how would I be able to fix it?

Hello! It shows in preview. I'm not yet trying to run the app. Is it normal?
It does, sorry about my poor testing.
Google Pixel running Android 8.0.0  Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.0.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Focus/2.0 Chrome/61.0.3163.98 Mobile Safari/537.36
I used Firefox version 60.3.0.esr. I just tried with Internet Explorer version 11.09600. Again the incorrect input is accepted but this time without the brief red frame that I see with Firefox.  By the way:  I'd consider the bevaviour you described in your comment, i.e. replacing the incorrect value by a valid one, as a serious bug, too. It is as if the application said: "I don't like the value you submitted, so I'll take one I like instead." An incorrect value should neither be accepted nor replaced by a valid one.
@DragonRaider5   I used `react-native link` command and verified manually that it has linked correctly, according to the readme. Unfortunately I can't share the repo I'm working on right now, but I'll try to setup a clean app and reproduce the problem.
Yes you can. @luckyman20 sorry for not solving it in time.
I can't run our server without sponge, as it's a live (production) server which people play regularly.  Also, it is difficult to reproduce the bug on purpose, although the bug was happening multiple times per day (10 on the day I entered this bug).  We had to remove Astral Sorcery to stabilize the server.  I'd like to report an issue to [SpongeForge's github](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge/issues/), but was wondering if you guys could give me some insight on what exactly to report.
No man. Thanks for creating this awesome library.  What i mean is that, the FAB always requires 4 options in order not to look distorted
All I know is that I have three wooden Barrels generating dirt using hoppers to feed them rotten flesh. I also have some iron sieves standing around. I don’t have anymore Information, except it might be possible that the error appeared right as I was walking outside of chunk loaded chunks. I still was near my skyblock base, so i think i shouldn’t have unloaded them (only like 30 blocks away). Otherwise I can’t say you more, as the error appeared completley out of nowhere (ah yes, as it appeared it started lagging really badly), but restarting not only my world, but minecraft seemed to solve the Problem. Updating I propably will do, allthough I’m playing a modpack and I rather just update that to avoid Bugs.   Anyway, thank you for trying to help me. Von: SirLyle Gesendet: Donnerstag, 14.

The fix works fine. The proxy is returned by the ProxySelector object.  However there is another problem (might be worth to open another issue): The SOCKS proxy is registered for the protocol scheme `socks`. The protocol scheme in the selector reflects the protocol of the proxied connection, not the connection to the proxy server. That means if I want to get a proxy for an HTTP connection, I have to request a http/https URI which can never return the SOCKS proxy, because the selector expects a socks:// URI. I suppose a SOCKS proxy should be returned regardless of the URI used, because it is applicable to all TCP and UDP based connections.  Maybe the solution is to set the SOCKS proxy using the `setFallbackSelector` function in the `ProtocolDispatchSelector`. This time I attached the [patch](https://github.com/MarkusBernhardt/proxy-vole/files/603466/socks-fallback_patch.txt) directly.  Details on the intended meaning of the Java Proxy Variables can be found on the following link. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html
@mindforger “Reliable crystal” is not very suitable，I think……Do I tell other people the certus is “可信水晶” in Chinese？
yes the different cases I tested are working. You can even access the generated logger without any troubles. Apparently, only java8 or streaming API have issues 
@davsclaus indeed I have a version of ActiveMQ running in my Karaf instance. We use our own provisioned version of karaf 3.0.2, which boots with ActiveMQ, Apache Camel and some other things right off the bat.

Hi, Aliksander!  > were you using some custom attributes for this affected TR, btw?  No, I didn't use some custom attributes. Just attributes form [instruction](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/salesforce-sso/)  > Could you please write down all your configuration steps   I'm not sure that it will help you to reproduce this issue because I didn't do any special things. But there are steps that I did: 1. removed previous version of Gluu (2.4.2) (_apt-get remove ..._, then remove **/opt/gluu-server-2.4.2***) 2. apt-get install gluu-server-2.4.3 3. /etc/init.d/gluu-server-2.4.3 start 4. chroot into Gluu envirenment by _/etc/init.d/gluu-server-2.4.3 login_ 5. configure Gluu and setup components. All except CAS and Asimba 6. Create few users in OpenDJ for tests 7. Configure TR for TestShib2 step by step as decribed [there](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/test-shib2/) 8. Testing TestShib2 9. Configure Salesforce step by step from [there](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/salesforce-sso/)  At first time I used cert Custom Script for authentication. But in the second time after Gluu reinstallation I used default auth metod.  I tried to remove TestShib2 TR but the same result.

@igorbrigadir nope, all the configuration happens in code as above
Thanks @Cliffus , its not super urgent, just using this ExpandableTextView on a project I am working on. I'm pretty sure it has to do with m layout as it is a bit complex.   I've attached my jobcard layout file to this comment, as well the main layout that my activity uses. This activity combines the jobcard layout used by the custom adapter and the main layout. Please let me know if there is more I can provide to help you help me :)  [activity_main.txt](https://github.com/Blogcat/Android-ExpandableTextView/files/382821/activity_main.txt) [jobcard.txt](https://github.com/Blogcat/Android-ExpandableTextView/files/382822/jobcard.txt) 
Hi thanks for your reply. `git describe --tags --long --dirty` shows only the current tag which is exposed via git.closest.tag.name. I am using git command line. Git version is 1.9.5. I am using both lightweight tags and annotated tags
Job timeout still not getting honoured for different job instances (Resources and artifact upload for different job instances seems to be working). Raised a different issue for this-  #632.  
Thanks for the response. It's a home grown kms client that expects a configuration object. The configuration object is constructed from values that are read in from a .properties file and injected as parameters into the enclosing @Bean method. The issue is arising from the fact that one of the injected parameters is somehow null when @EnableSwagger2 is used, but non null when it's commented out. The code runs and builds fine in the absence of swagger.
I was using notepad++ on windows, set to uft-8. 
You're correct. I must have checked our latest development build and we have switched to a newer build and from All to Core.  Looks like our old version was using `2.4.6`. So when we release this new build that uses 2.5.3 Core we won't have the issue? 
Thanks @safris   I tested `opentracing-specialagent-1.5.3-20191209.144139-17.jar`; similar behavior. I tried a relative path (a.log) and an absolute one (/tmp/a.log). Log file is still empty. So the log file will be created, but without any content  would you say this is different in static attachment?   
It stops the simulation (like pause), but in addition the next step button made nothing (I was not able to do one more step, like I can do after a pause).

I created [this](https://github.com/jpsgamboa/VisTest2) test project using `VisTextArea` directly. Again, works well with VisUI provided font files, but breaks using the font files i generate with the provided `default.hiero`.  It only breaks when it finds a `\n` though, but works fine with long strings. This is also true for my lml test.  The error message is a bit different now:  ``` Exception in thread "LWJGL Application" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 28     at com.kotcrab.vis.ui.widget.VisTextField.calculateOffsets(VisTextField.java:277)     at com.kotcrab.vis.ui.widget.VisTextArea.calculateOffsets(VisTextArea.java:275)     at com.kotcrab.vis.ui.widget.VisTextField.draw(VisTextField.java:333)     at com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Group.drawChildren(Group.java:110)     at com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Group.draw(Group.java:57)     at com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Stage.draw(Stage.java:128)     at com.mygdx.vistest.Main.render(Main.java:43)     at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication.mainLoop(LwjglApplication.java:223)     at com.badlogic.gdx.backends.lwjgl.LwjglApplication$1.run(LwjglApplication.java:124) ```  All the raw font files are placed in `assets/raw-font-files`  Note: to run the attached project one must change the working directory to `core/assets`.

Yes, that's a good idea. 
Yes, probably it's the same. I have one PreferenceFragment that loads preferences that consists nested PrferenceScreens. 
you can see if the behavior reveals anything  join mc.intangir.org with 1.8 and walk down the expeditions hall, then go back towards the old worlds hall  you can see existing npcs disappear as new ones appear  its almost like its replacing them 
@KarlZeilhofer CvPipeline has a release method which calls release on any saved Mats. This frees up the memory used by the images that are stored as each stage processes. In general, it's not important to be called, because calling process() releases the previous data, but as @cri-s pointed out, since BottomVision uses a pipeline per part, it's possible this could use up a lot of memory during a job run. We need to change it to release after bottom vision is done. This is a pretty easy change, so I will probably do it right now :)

Upgraded Server to 17.0.1 and  Client to 3.9.0 – behavior is still the same.   Anything I can do to support / spot the error? @nextcloud/server-triage 
I'll check it in a new installation of Graylog 2.3.0
Sorry, hit the submit button accidentally.  Finishing my thought :  Only DELETE calls are failing.  We tested turning  off H2 support, and all was well again, and turned it back on,  and is failing again.   What can I do to help troubleshoot this issue?

Hi @diotto! Yes I have sent the Custom UI notification besides the other two and it seems to be okay.  In the main screen it shows the watch is connected (however after some time it disconnects, it is also an issue for me, but this no custom notification issue is present when it shown as connected). In the Stats I can see e.g the Gmail notifications twice. One of them has a record with GROUP comment, the other is with CONTINUE, but I can see only the standard notification on my watch.
Tried in multiple environments, on mac os, on centos 7 and on docker, same issue. Versions tested are 5.5.0.9 and 5.5.0.10
``` public KeystoneAuth(String tokenId, AuthScope scope) {         this.identity = AuthIdentity.createTokenType(tokenId);         this.scope = scope;         this.type = Type.TOKEN;     }      public KeystoneAuth(String userId, String password) {         this(userId, password, null, null);     }      public KeystoneAuth(String user, String password, Identifier domain, AuthScope scope) {         this.identity = AuthIdentity.createCredentialType(user, password, domain);         this.scope = scope;         this.type = Type.CREDENTIALS;     }      protected KeystoneAuth(Type type) {         this.type = type;     } ```  as we see above,there is no constructor with no parameters in the KeystoneAuth class. this may cause some problems when using jackson to handle  it 
yes it does 👍, I made exactly the same change, but I figured the other places also need  update since it will fail if master changes and so on.
Exactly, if I disable DiskSpaceMetrics (and only this one) the errors goes away. Currently I get the following message in Dynatrace: > Your custom metrics quota of 100 metrics has been reached.   I'm not sure if this quota is per day or in general, I haven't quite figured out yet how to make Micrometer visible in Dynatrace.
It looks like it is the lightwell. Going from a Seared Gauge->Portable tank with the same settings and 288mb of fluid worked as expected.
I am running version 0.3.3A so that would be the problem. I did manage to recover my world by pasting the region files into a new world. 
@QiuMM thanks for your reply, if  `resultsFuture.get()` has only one element and the element is `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, we should not assign segment on it,but now our processing logic as follows: >   if (server.lhs <= bestServers.get(0).lhs) { //eg. `<Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, node1>` >       if (server.lhs < bestServers.get(0).lhs) {// `but we can't get here` >      bestServers.clear(); >     } >     bestServers.add(server);//`so it will be added in bestServers` >   }
Agreed, changing the documentation would fit the bill. The app ended up in the default package in the first place as a quick prototype - and got forgotten there. 
In my sample, I tried to use `@PageableDefault(page = 0, size = 10, sort = "createdDate", direction = Direction.DESC) Pageable page` in request params, and return a `Page` object,  both did not work.  Please tried my sample, and reset the commented codes.  I have used these in before Spring projects for years. 
wow,thank you so much for replying me, yes ,that's right ,i was running Che as root,  but, how to solve this problem if i really need to run Che was root? 
I was looking for it, though it would be in 'details' -- where do I find it? 
Yes, it work. Thank you! :+1:

Yeah, because I am using the default `CollapsingToolbarLayout` somewhere else in my appllication... No issue detected 
Yeah, I've tried the example app and `Share Single Image` occurs the same error!
BoP, EBXL, Natura and Streams are the ones with a major influence.  ATG doing overworld terrain gen too, but that doesn't change anything with the decoration stage, and doesn't touch the nether (I'm the author) Others have smaller stuff like adding some trees, but they shouldn't be affecting this, and certainly not in the nether. All non-GT ores are disabled except the TC infused stone/amber and Pam's salt, though I noticed that the "disable default ores" thing doesn't take away vanilla nether quartz. Pam's clay spawn and deadly world add pockets of other blocks in the overworld (clay, sand and silverfish blocks). IHL adds some stones but they're all overworld too. 
I know might be take long time but if possible then please let me know approx time.
Another option would be to not even cache drawable at all, as presumably, they are already on disk locally.  The fixes is just a reference to the bug in my internal bug tracker so I can keep track when this is resolved 😎 
That reasoning is correct, but the behaviour does not follow that exactly. Sometimes the UI shows a panel as selected (e.g. the focus is in the filter box) but Ctrl+W wont close it unless an issue is selected in that panel. Yes, closing a panel should move focus to another panel. 
@eivantsov Yes Snapshotting is happening on local and I can see it from che logs   ``` 2017-02-13 05:04:11,511[aceSharedPool-1]  [INFO ] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceRuntimes 861]   - Creating snapshot of workspace 'workspacerqluqcbdjvl9d1fq', machines to snapshot: '1' 2017-02-13 05:04:13,860[aceSharedPool-1]  [INFO ] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceRuntimes 884]   - Saving new snapshots metadata, workspace id 'workspacerqluqcbdjvl9d1fq' 2017-02-13 05:04:14,828[aceSharedPool-1]  [INFO ] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceManager 818]    - Workspace 'che:wksp-u9t1' with id 'workspacerqluqcbdjvl9d1fq' stopped by user 'che'  ```  ``` root@10:~# docker images REPOSITORY                          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE machine_snapshot_cnuwsq7e8d2m08z4   latest              4a5ef2f0153d        3 hours ago         679.3 MB  ```  If CHE_DOCKER_REGISTRY__FOR__SNAPSHOTS is true then it should be pushed to registry right.

You're right, `./gradlew runIDE`.  I'm debugging a program within the plugin. If I run gdb session in terminal with the same args then gdb stops at the breakpoint.

Hi  @dennisoelkers. I don't think so. It does get appended to other commands like webpack and generally they run fine I'd say. Here is another excerpt, the failure in this is due to something else I think, considering the circumstances. It was working before(tm), minus the tests. The problem with checkProductionBuild is more like a side show event I wanted to get out of the equation.  ``` [INFO] --- frontend-maven-plugin:1.8.0:yarn (yarn install) @ graylog-plugin-aws --- [INFO] Found proxies: [optional{protocol='http', host='XXX', port=Y}] [INFO] Running 'yarn install --https-proxy=XXX:Y--proxy=XXX:Y' in /graylog-project-repos/graylog-plugin-aws [INFO] yarn install v1.19.2 [INFO] [1/4] Resolving packages...

@robertotru I tried within my project at first, I got the same NullPointerException on the location of the file. Then I cloned the Thymeleaf example from this project, adjusted the yml(gmail username and pwd) and got the same result. By the way, on line 58 of TestService.java.
I'm using 3.0.1 with Microsoft SQL server 2012 
I added some words to censor in the config under the "Words to be censored" region, then set censor to true. (it was false before) After a server reboot to put the changes in effect, everything typed into chat had the "censorSymbol" displayed before and after each word. 
Looks like LOG(float) is natural logarithm up to and including SQL Server 2008, from 2008R2 it is 10-base logarithm. The docs say that if base is omitted, it defaults to 10-base...  Edit: It might be a typo in the docs, because I tried SELECT LOG(10) on both SQL Server 2008 and 2012, and they both returned 2,3025.... If that is the case LOG(float) is natural logarithm on at least 2005 through 2014.

Indeed, "Always available" was not selected (I don't remember having activated it on my previous phone, but that might be my weak memory).  Sorry for the noise, closing the issue.
Avacyn's ability triggers when a non-angel is killed and then again at the next upkeep. A creature died during combat damage, Avacyn was removed with Karlov's exile ability in response to the first trigger, and recast next turn in response to the second trigger. 
@ywelsch Thanks for looking at this  - These are not master eligible nodes. There are 3 other master elegible nodes in the cluster (which don't store any data). While doing a rolling upgrade, the script processes all the master eligible nodes first and then moves to data nodes.  All data nodes (the kind which show failure) have similar config to one given below  ``` cluster.name: nemo-cluster   node.name: esnode1  bootstrap.memory_lock: true network.host: _site:ipv4_ discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts:      - 10.44.0.43     - 10.44.0.44     - 10.44.0.45      discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 1  # Fix 9201 for intra cluster comm transport.port: 9201  path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch path.data: /data/elasticsearch  # Settings related to node  node.master: false node.data: true node.ingest: true  # Monitoring settings (6.3+) xpack.monitoring.enabled: true  ```  The master elgible nodes are `10.44.0.43,44,45` which don't show any failure.  - Closed indices are mostly created on 7.x. For the latest issue, the indices mentioned in the logs above were created using 7.x

OK:  -No errors appears in the logcat -Android 6.0.1 Samsung galaxy S6 -Lib version 1.1.0 -compileSdkVersion 23 -buildToolsVersion "23.0.3" 
because this must be solved as fast as possible. Most of the users (or at least many of them) are using this feature and would complain if it's missing.  But this is the same issue as the two other ones, so we can close it.

Sheesh, has it been a month already? Sorry for taking so long.  As of the latest TiC build, this doesn't seem to occur. Thanks for keeping this mod maintained!  Now I just need to figure out why my modpack can't load a world on the newer Forge versions so I can update TiC. [Edit: Updating mods is important, the pack loads now]
I am fine with that too. However switching to live should work IMO in the following scenarios: - Search for a place/cache/keyword, open map for the results -> Enable live - Open map for cache including it waypoints -> Enable live

No, I didn't. This was as bare-bones a project as I could make (a single placeholder `@RestController`), using the copypasta Tomcat-exclude/Undertow-include, but I couldn't get it to work. Finally gave up and went back to Tomcat.

Which widget are you using?  I am using the 4 x 1 widget. Not sure if it is only happening for me but I just noticed it the other day. I cropped out the location but the time is not synced until I open the application and then it starts falling out again after a brief moment.   All the permissions are enabled as well. Currently on Android Pie on a Galaxy S8+ stock rom.  ![img_eggsif_1816279197550367820](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32280207/56858757-559ab780-696f-11e9-8538-d5fe51c75224.jpg)  
I am on Windows 7 Pro and using Eclipse 4.2.2. Attached is the screen shot. You can see how the selection highlighting has no padding on the right side.  ![ss](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/229913/820011/aec69adc-efbc-11e2-917f-0162bec2e11a.png) 
Yes, I do have xcode installed, along with the command line tools.  Running `bazel clean --expunge` first doesn't change the output.  The requested archive is attached.  [local_config_cc.zip](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/files/2264757/local_config_cc.zip)  Still curious about how this list gets generated; the docs don't have too much to say about it, but perhaps I'm missing something...
what about Sounds? 
minecraft v. 1.6.4, Mariculture 1.6.4-1.2.1e, I am using the FTB Monster pack (if that matters?) v 1.1.1... forge version 9.11.1.965 
My reasons to use Lux: - in lowlight conditions (mainly at night) the screen is too bright for me, the (black-transparent) overlay reduces the brightness further - i can create sensor-reading/screen-brightness pairs and control the auto-brightness this way  I understand the tap-jacking concerns. For me I found a solution now (~~actually I found two ...~~):  1. ~~In the Lux app there  is an option to use an "alternative overlay", which does not cause the unresponsiveness in the Owncloud-app. I dont know, if that alternative overlay works for me like the standard one, but I will see.~~ (Alternative overlay causes the same issue) 2. The Lux app has a list of apps, that cause the overlay to be deactivated while one of these apps is in the foreground (this list contains the android package installer per default, which seems to have a similar tap-jacking protection). So I added the Owncloud app to that list.  
I'm on vacation end of week and next.  I'll dig into it and see if can isolate the issue.  I've also posted it on the packs issue tracker.

HEllo  i have no eclipse on my pc. i have just install dbeaver 4.3 community edition.  i dowloaded all the sources files on https://dbeaver.jkiss.org/update/office/latest/ and create the same paths locally.   after i load the content.xml and i have the error,   see details in attachment   [office_dbeaver.docx](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/files/1588808/office_dbeaver.docx)  
I guess i should just stop reporting bugs until i update to 1.7.x seems like a lot of my bug posts are in the already fixed catagory 
"Did this happen while you didn't move to another app screen between sending transactions?" yes  ok, lets see in 0.1.32 :) thx

I don't really know how to explain this either, but I'll try my best.  It seems like Essentials only blocks commands by plugins who have registered it. Plugins like ChatControl or other others that lets you "create your own command" technically don't register the command. They just match what you type you chat and execute the command.  Take ChatControl for example, you can create your own command. However, those commands aren't registered, therefore Essentials can't even pick it up. 
I just change the quickbar keys to gravity=center. Hope this can help to reduce the user scenario. Thank you for the clue and if you can give more update after upgrading to v1.7, it will be great for me to track this issue 
sure thing. just uploaded test files to the google drive. 
It happens the same, in the video you can see the version 1.11.2 of spigot  https://gyazo.com/e3120837b7fc2df2f955334c55cba7c2  https://i.gyazo.com/cd79ed493a5e22ed40285b3df15f8bd9.png
No more false-positives. Seems like fixed. 
Liferay 6.2.x is bundled with tomcat7 so my hands are tied there really, hopefully I'll get time to try out your patch because I hate this delta manager because I have to specify the cluster in a static way and do nasty things like remove the local node from that cluster list:-  ``` {% for host in liferay_cluster_hosts %}   {% if host.name != inventory_hostname %}     <Member className="org.apache.catalina.tribes.membership.StaticMember" host="{{ host.name }}" port="4444" uniqueId="{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,{{ host.id}}}"/>   {% endif %} {% endfor %} ```  ``` liferay_cluster_hosts:   - name: devperf01a     id: 1   - name: devperf01e     id: 2 ``` 
Thanks. Missed the config. Forgot about the need for bungeecord support and ip forwarding. Sorry to bother you. Have a happy Valentines day
@sladomic I suspect this is because I have not yet copied `vgg_faces.pb` to the SD card.  Can you modify the code to show a descriptive message when the file is missing, and instructions on how to add it? To help future developers experiencing the same.

Hello,     The test case code I have created to provide is not duplicating the behavior like the application code. The only difference that i can determine at this time is the temporary HashMap that is used to store the bytes for the user before election to dump to a file.     Without changing anything other then the build jars, 3.8.10.1 to the current exempts the behavior described above. I will not be able to investigate further for a day or two. It may be a problem with the current code jar build created on my end. The environment is JRE 7.     I would not classify this as a BUG at this time without further work on my end.  danap.

There was no exception in the log. It didn't even show up under the correct log level.  Swift installier is a theme installer comparable to substratum and paid. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brit.swiftinstaller

Hi it does not happen everytime.  Here's a example. Just opened this testcase header ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1914659/37147119-c1a84658-22bd-11e8-821b-a39e2893a240.png)  Then click 'close' and edit testcase header again:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1914659/37147144-daa23fba-22bd-11e8-8549-2387d35a6fc6.png)  I didn't identified yeat any pattern for this behaviour. Thanks! 
After work I add the logcat. Also I send a crash report with the issue number. 
We've run into several bugs with it that do not inspire confidence, like throwing RuntimeExceptions that are not documented (see https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/3fa1e883acd14a208e7c70c6e9b627981fd86dd9/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/repository/GitCloner.java#L198-L200) and failing to set file permissions correctly on OS X in some cases (can't find the bug for that at the moment).  I'm not sure what we'd replace it with, though, and possibly we'd just deprecate these rule in favor of https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/build_defs/repo/git.bzl.

@minborg something like this: ```java UUID userId = user.getId(); // user is object retrieved from speedment stream ```
I use Linux desktop sync. This works perfectly. It's strange, it may fail even if I am at home in the sam local area network, where the server is. 
@MattCline-SL  can this ticket now be closed given its covered by #704 ad #705?
Yep, maxLength did it.  Man, I just realized you have released 0.8.5 yesterday. I am sorry IE exists :(. Thanks for the quick response. Your doing a great job with BootsFaces. 
Some "Präsenzaufgaben" in the PGdP course are of the type "File Upload", but explicitly rule out submissions in the task description (ex.: [here](https://artemis.ase.in.tum.de/#/overview/37/exercises/789)), as the solution will be discussed on campus in the relevant class.  Thus, file submission is ruled out/disabled by the description, and the file type for the upload is set to "NICHT/MÖGLICH" (see [screenshot](https://pasteboard.co/IFjy9JB.png)). However, the file selector and "Browse" button are still available; clicking that button triggers the crash.
no, the auto download is disabled ; I happen to download download them  manually once in a while ; (for that I go to Episodes > New > I click  the update button > I manually select the episodes I'd like to listen). Just in case it might solve the problem, right now I selected the option  "never erase episodes" in the cleanup option, even if I kept the auto  download option disabled ; for that I did > go to the preferences >  network > auto download > checked temporarily the auto download option >  selected "never erase episodes" in the cleanup option > unchecked the  auto download option. thanks  On 10/04/2019 18:49, Martin Fietz wrote: > > do you have auto download + cleanup enabled? > > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub  > <https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/3103#issuecomment-481771565>,  > or mute the thread  > <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AQAB_Z93o4V8a9jaRiIYpWgcIWH_ukvgks5vfhY1gaJpZM4cm076>. >  
Where can I find the log? 
You have to enable autocomplete in the main template. Then start typing and select one of the autocomplete items. Now it should focus that location on the map. But you get the exception.

Yes the command works, only the sign breaks

I am not sure,  I have seen it while posting it and my guess was, that I was near to the cache but without GPS-fix so it would be the shadowed circle around my position changing the colors. I will have a look if this could be the cause by comparing  
Yeah, that was #7454 .

Start is url not sitemap and only one domain. After adding referenceFilters that includes this domain it works as expected. 
I still have to generate the bug report for cytoscape tracker.    For future reference this occurs if you save a session that has filters.  When you reopen the session and try to add a new filter cytoscape left hand panel crashes.

Hey guys, thanks for checking this out. (I try to confirm issues in the master branch before reporting them.)  The geometry layers do seem to work fine when "null allowed" is true.  I can confirm the fid issue.  It you have a create-geometry tool active and switch to a different layer that also supports that geometry it often shows the fid exception until you choose a different tool.

I've tried to clean and rebuild with no luck. I've tried the latest build 17 as well as the previous 16.  The test device that i'm using is Nexus 6 
Here is the video of it working, it seems like it is an issue that only crops up just after install. Now (as you can see in the video it DOES update itself on the apt-get-update-periodic task.  https://erayan.com/shared/2016-02-08_17-53-33.mp4  So it seems something is off with the timing on time of install.

@yegor256 it seems that using an isolated repository for the integration tests (as far as I understand, this is the case) is the main concept of maven-invoker-plugin. But I see here an option to set `localRepositoryPath` outside of the project build directory, e.g.  ``` xml <localRepositoryPath>${project.basedir}/local-repo</localRepositoryPath> ```  In this case `maven` downloads (actually copies from the local repository) all the artifacts only once and reuse this new isolated repository in future even after `mvn clean`. 
Well according to docker my local image name *is* the repository. However, yes, that is in essence what I'm suggesting.

@pmlopes no problem, in my app I use my own auth class since I need digest authentication with database users and I fixed this issue  using a global static hash map of nonces with synchronized getter/setter.  I'm curious to see your implementation to learn how to proper use vertx shared data when concurrent access is needed (think about two different verticles/threads that add a nonce to the global map at the same time). Thanks!
How about something like this? http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4218871  They break down polygon into lines and do simple point-to-line distance calc. This would require converting lat/lon coordinates to a cartesian (UTM) first.   Is this better or worse than converting circle into 32..100 point polygon with getGeometryFrom(circle) ?  For the most part I need to compute intersections on the scale of 1m - 100m in the US and Alaska.  
Oh, it's a Scala project :)

@benas @PascalSchumacher Thank you, guys, for a quick fix!  I tried it and it works very well. Closing the issue.
Yup, it seems to work. So the code should be changed to the one you gave, yes? 
I will update, deploy and check. If it hapoens again I will provide the dump  Thanks.
 i modify the code，deal NUll return，and now can not reproduce it. original code： org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedLedgerImpl.java ``` PositionImpl startReadOperationOnLedger(PositionImpl position) {         long ledgerId = ledgers.ceilingKey(position.getLedgerId()); // ceilingKey return will null         if (ledgerId != position.getLedgerId()) {             // The ledger pointed by this position does not exist anymore. It was deleted because it was empty. We need             // to skip on the next available ledger             position = new PositionImpl(ledgerId, 0);         }          return position;     } ```
@ice1000 thank you very much for the reply   Sadly, still the same problem  code is now  ```         URL resource =  this.getClass().getResource("img.png");         String path = resource.getPath().substring(1);         System.err.println(path);         JImTextureID texture = JImTextureID.fromFile(path); ```   but the issue persists  ``` D:/Development/Projects/Java/GradleEditor/out/production/resources/img.png Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: cannot load D:/Development/Projects/Java/GradleEditor/out/production/resources/img.png 	at org.ice1000.jimgui.JImTextureID.fromFile(JImTextureID.java:41) 	at Application.init(Application.java:29) 	at Application.run(Application.java:22) 	at Application.main(Application.java:14) ```   
How to set max reg per IP if server use Bungee cord ? Yes I like max reg per Email ! 
The issue seems to be in our application. I am closing the issue.
here is some sample code I hope it helps  ServerResource (server-side)  import org.restlet.resource.Post; import org.restlet.resource.ServerResource;  public class AdminResourceOfGetDataRowsForDatasetTask extends ServerResource {  ``` @Post public PagingResultDTO getDataRowsForDatasetTask(     ParametersOfGetDataRowsForDatasetTask parameters ) throws     IncompatibleTaskTypeException,     TaskNotFoundException {     return RPCFunctions.getDataRowsForDatasetTask(         parameters.getTaskId(),         parameters.getParamValues(),         parameters.getStartRow(),         parameters.getPageSize(),         parameters.getColumnSorting()         ); } ```  }  ClientProxy (GWT client-side)  public interface ResourceProxyOfGetDataRowsForDatasetTask extends ClientProxy {  ``` @Post public void getDataRowsForDatasetTask(     ParametersOfGetDataRowsForDatasetTask parameters,     Result<PagingResultDTO> result ); ```  }  observe the use of ParametersOfGetDataRowsForDatasetTask it contains all the parameters (more than one) it is the only way to pass multiple parameters to a server function  initial problem was that for same pair (ServerResource/ClientProxy like above) only one method (like above) can be supported thus I was forced to use a separate pair (ServerResource/ClientProxy like above) for each server function

1) #259, Implementation-Version: 1.2.259 2) I don't have, but I think it can be created with use of attached logs.   3) debug log and net dump are  attached to the comment. 4) thx, but I don't have such opportunity.

I edited my post to include it, I'm using version 0.2 built on F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/io.homeassistant.android  If this has since been fixed feel free to ignore, just wanted to provide the info if it's helpful. I didn't see any entity that has a float in those fields.
I just tried. It crash like last time. 
Something like this in logging.yml:  ```   syslog:     type: syslog     sysloghost: 10.11.11.71     facility: local0     layout:       type: pattern       conversionPattern: "[%d{ISO8601}][%-5p][%-25c] %m%n" ```

That reading was from 30 minutes later. I didn't spawn at my bed and lost everything so I had to get home.  No it was definitely seconds, roughly 5, guarantee it was less than 10. I entered the room, was poisoned, was dead before I heard five "attacks" and was wearing diamond armor with either medium or heavy shielding. Happened twice.  Unfortunately I took the reactor down because I needed to run it so testing it again won't be as easy.   Here are steps I believe I took before this happened to me twice:  - Use compact machines with 1.12 - Make a large compact machine - Build a 3x3 reactor for TBU Oxide. I can try to send the build somehow. - Run 3 pellets while back in the overworld. Leave the depleted fuel in the fission controller overnight. - Come back

I don't understand what you mean by "it will collide with defaults for test run configuration".  Can you explain?  
Thanks for all the work! Well I'm trying to run my migrations without specifying database in url. Flyway itself runs migration smoothly but trips up on going back to original database. Checkout scenario https://gist.github.com/FlakM/2870a512093b085cba6490348eb9967a  I've also specified schema mydatabse in connection url (that did not exist at the point of migraiting) and it went ok (except for running create schema_version table 4 times)  I reported this mainly because the migration itself went well and the result seems strange to me. 
Actually it's not a "save" issue, I can't modify the content of the SQL editor. It's like the editor is locked, it shows the code, it shows a blinking cursor like it's expecting input, but doesn't let me change anything. 
Thanks to you. Indeed that line helped, although I had to find out first, that the order of these lines seem to be important. Got still a lot to learn about gradle...
I found that if we have "null" in the middle of those input parameters, it will cause the error. It won't happen if "null" is at the end:  ``` public class TestScreenFxScene : MonoBehavior {     void Start () {         TestInfiniteParams("1st param", null, "3rd param", null);    // red underline on this line         TestInfiniteParams("1st param", "2nd param", null);     // it's fine on this one     }      void TestInfiniteParams(params object[] items) {} } ``` 
On my emulator I am only doing fresh installations and there it works.  The problem is that the column is also added in db scheme 16 (with createSyncedFoldersTable). So if you upgrade from 15 to 23 (newest): - 16 -> add type column - ... - 23 -> add type column  (same for wifi and charging column). 
OK, thanks, will try. 
I assumed it was because while we now clean at most once, it is only if you use either pinning, or access the cleaned certs. We didn't previously clean if it was enough that the SSL handshake code (Android or JVM) found a valid chain to the known root CA.  And the root CA doesn't need to be in the list provided by the server IIUC.  I'll try to prove we use the same certs for verifying.  I hope it's not a new bug, prefer it to a broken assumption with self signed certs. :)
@yanokwa Please find attached a very simple form with which I'm facing the issue, and related screenshots.  [Issue 995 - example.zip](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/files/970489/Issue.995.-.example.zip)
@jesmrec Sorry, we've tried it on 2.9.1, it doesn't work. But as far as we know, it stopped working 2 days before I created the issue and that's why I expect the issue came in 2.9.0 as that was released 2 days before creating this issue.  I just edited my original post and changed "ownCloud app version" under "Environment data" to 2.9.1. I also tried it once more to make sure and it's not working in 2.9.1.
I didn't see OpenGL error. The loading of the graticule around the poles is too slow for my application to be useful. It would be good if the performance can be improved.  When running Graticule class (using LatLonGraticuleLayer), the program became unresponsive when the scale bar was 2000m. No Exception was observed.  When running GARSGraticule (using GARSGraticuleLayer), the program threw IllegalArgumentException when the scale bar was 20km. Below is the trace statement.

I have tried testing the issue again but I can't seem to reproduce the issue.  The steps I took were. 1. Launch app 2. Select any novel chapter 3. Move the page a bit 4. Open running app page (My Zenfone has a dedicated button to it) 5. Close Baka-Tsuki  6. Launch app 7. Open to previous chapter with "Resume Novel" or manually  At the time this issue was happening every time but now it doesn't. I am still using the same android and app version. Let me know if you need more details. 
I did some tests, and when I change my smartphone's language to English, dates are displayed as it supposed to. So it is something localization-related I guess.  Server 8.1.3, but it is down now, so no test account for 1-2 days. Anyway, I don't think it is server issue. Change your language to non-latin and check on your android device :) BTW, as I check randomly, date format in app is different in different languages...

I mean that 3 finger swipes to switch desktops is extremely laggy if it exists at all. 2 finger scrolling is almost unusable. As soon as I stop the hook thread all of those problems clear up.  
@wmathurin yes it is SalesforceDroidGAPActivity, updated the issue detail
I was playing my mod pack, and it had the twilight forest, better advancements, and other mods. The Twilight forest is a progression based mod, in a way that if you get an advancement, you can progress, but when I did the thing that was needed for the advancement, nothing happened, and then I realized that the whole twilight forest advancement section was missing, and when I gave myself an advancement from the mod with /advancement grant, I didn' t get it. But when I deleted the mod, everything worked, and I've got the advancement when I needed to.

@stevehu  I think implementing all 3 options is a good idea to keep it generic and satisfying various security/refresh flow requirements of different customers. Perhaps implementation option should be configurable via some sort of factory & pluggable implementation.  I suggest to have defined an interface for "a refresh flow plugin" and provide all 3 implementations "out of the box". Therefore users of the framework can select desired implementation and in some cases even provide its own implementation for the interface that satisfies their unique custom logic (in case its required)  Also regarding 3-rd solution to modify light-oauth2 service behaviour....this might open up some concerns for some of the customers IT security who don't want deviations from oauth2 standard flow rule - "refresh token can be used only once"
Sorry, saved prematurely. This is only in auto-upload. Pulling to refresh triggers upload, so I presume navigating to different screens will too.
Yes, all directly and indirected resources should be exported to the ZIP file.
In all clients and we have tried the past couple of versions, seems to be any version that has added the under ground sounds. I can try to turn on the debug if you think that might give some clue. 
Yes now its working, Thanx 
Please try this: http://stream.radio.co/s4360dbc20/low
This triggers an AERI/EPP report (#2220), so fixing this is higher priority.
Add the widget with the previous version.
@justacodefan  I would be able, but I do not have the necessary time right now, we are having an upcoming deadline for the project containing this issue and we still have a lot of other tasks to complete. The basic steps would be: 1.Create a project in android studio: “AndroidProject” 2.Create 2 flavor dimensions: “dimension1”, “dimension2” 3.Create 3 flavors: “flavor1” and set “dimension1” for it 		 “flavor2” and set “dimension1” for it 		 “flavor3” and set “dimension2” for it 4.Create 2 sentry projects: “SentryProject1” and “SentryProject2” 5.Set “SentryProject1” data in sentry.properties in the root folder of “AndroidProject” 6.Set “SentryProject2” data in sentry.properties in the source folder for one flavor/combination of flavors, ex: “..AndroidProject/app/src/flavor3” 7.Set build variant to something including flavor3(all of them should since we got only one flavor with “dimension2”), release variant. 8.Set autoupload for proguard mapping. 9.Compile 10.Notice that the mapping goes to “SentryProject1” instead of “SentryProject2”  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.  
Good morning all, I there some progress on this issue? kindly help. Thanks

Hey @HeshamMegid , thanks for your quick response. I didn't change the token, but it got fixed after I fixed a few other issues in the build. But unfortunately, I don't have a specific root cause. 
I have attached debug log, but there seems to be nothing related to the issue.  [dbeaver-debug.log.zip](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/files/244686/dbeaver-debug.log.zip)  What happens is: I log in to the database. Type "select \* from " and I get list of suggested tables. Then I select a table and give it an alias. Using this alias, I try to add fields that I am interested in -> select  t. SUGGESTION EXPECTED HERE from table_t t 
`/ess debug`, doesn't output any data for creeper explosions on the build im using.   Oddly enough, when i disable essentials using plugman, creepers do regular damage. I am fairly certain this is caused by essentials as i even went through all my plugins disabling them one by one and essentials was the cause. Is there any config option, that deals with this?
I am going to collect a wire log with wireshark today (if this is what you meant). Meanwhile, want to double check what permission you have used. Here is my bucket policy: ``` {     "Version": "2012-10-17",     "Statement": [         {             "Effect": "Allow",             "Principal": {                 "AWS": "*"             },             "Action": "*",             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::MY.BUCKET/*"         },         {             "Effect": "Allow",             "Principal": {                 "AWS": "*"             },             "Action": "*",             "Resource": "MY.BUCKET"         }     ] } ``` Also, for this test, make sure that you are using AWS credentials of someone other than bucket owner (lets say another account wants to access your bucket and pays himself).

Yes. The plane was able to move outside of the hangar. I had even thought that an aircraft can't move when standing on steel scaffolding slabs, I had replaced them with a vanilla wool, but this did not help.

@kfeinauer I retested on a different "clean" box and I'm seeing a little bit different results. On this RSP instance, I get the correct working directory in the console but the Files pane is in Home still. Is this what you are seeing? I'll try to find the old box I was working on to see what could be different. Tested on 1.2.666-2 RHEL 7.3

Thanks for testing. I can't reproduce the error for files on the internal storage. SD is still the same.  As a workaround copying the files back and forth works.   One weird behaviour though: I can't navigate to: Folders - root - storage - emulated - 0 and therefore I can't navigate to the files. Is there any other way to get to the internal storage?  My workaround was the "last added" playlist
WebStorm version 9.0.3.  The problem started after the last .gitignore update.  Currently it seems the .gitignore version is 1.0 but I am getting a message to do another update.  Now I have 1.0.2.  No startup error this time.  I'll let you know if I get the error again.  Thanks!

@jayrambhia When I set an image as cropped to center (or any other scale, except fit to center), then after cropping it crops wrong (it saves not the same area that was visible in preview). I assume this is because of the logic in the getCroppedBitmap() method. It should be changed to something like this: ``` if (doPreScaling) {             float currScaleX = getMatrixValue(matrix, Matrix.MSCALE_X);             float currScaleY = getMatrixValue(matrix, Matrix.MSCALE_Y);             matrix.postScale(1 / (mPreScale * currScaleX), 1 / (mPreScale * currScaleY)); } ``` As the scale is changed during the cropToCenter() and it's not 1.
switched to 13.1.6, thanks

I twice opened the inventory of both fillers, initially there were two items in both and at the end one item in both. But OK, I am going to create a new video. (Thank you for answer!)
It seems like it does only output that ore. I had a user complain they had got 4 stacks of an ore I had removed before they got even a single coal. I tested it and got 6 gold ore with the screen shot above before I made the report. 
I'm not sure what is wrong. The failures are intermittent and not always in the same test case. Possibly it is just a bug in the OpenJDK code.
the cmu-clt-hsmm voice.   I just used it from the GUI client in bin folder,  use the default sentence, choose the rate adjustment effect. it doesn't work. the volume adjustment can work

I did try the new version. Still did not work.
@tsmaeder hard to say for sure.
Thanks for reply :)  In my application too many sprites and (if I run it on my old "shitphone") phone memory is quickly filled with instances of objects. ![bullrampdump](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4895253/22746865/54352aee-ee36-11e6-847b-dd4adc0be959.jpg)  Happen very often calls the garbage collector. 
I tried Finchley.RC1 release but the behaviour is still the same. The Content-Encoding header gets removed and the content still remains compressed making it unreadable for the downstream service.  I think the issue comes from the fact that the ProxyRequestHelper#isIncludeHeader is used in ProxyRequestHelper#buildZuulRequestHeaders AND ProxyRequestHelper#setResponse methods. I think it should only be used in the ProxyRequestHelper#setResponse method so that the "Content-Encoding" header remains in the request forwarded to the downstream service. What do you think?
If "X-Header" has multiple values removeHeader("X-Header") will remove all "X-Header" values. I want to remove a specific header/value. For example if we have:  X-Header: value1 X-Header: value2  Say that I want to remove only "X-Header: value2". This isn't possible today?
I sync the latest the master branch(2.2.11-SNAPSHOT) and build it by myself. But it might have no improvement for the long latency issue. Is this issue caused by netty or is it possible that we have missed some configurations about netty? 
Hi,   Thank you for responding - looking forward to getting this resolved.   I'm assuming I should update with all the changes since 1.0.0 since GraphMLDemo references ComponentNameProvider and ComponentAttributeProvider (not present in 1.0.0)?

@DefinitlyEvil  I had tried MCPE 1.2.9 and 1.2.8. and both of them caused the same thing. DragonProxy compiled by me was from the lastest source code in https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy. Thank you! And sorry for my bad English again.
http://pastie.org/10919805 
I haven't tested this but I think this bug appears in following code: ` IFE 0, 1   SET a, [SP + 100] ` In that case emulator is skipping and tick()->tick_skip()->getInstructionLength() will return wrong instruction length. I suppose it would next try to use 100 as instruction opcode and do something evil. 
[Here is the modlist.](https://gist.github.com/Birgliss/8c492591a599bee584bc13a3e9c6aaeb)  It is worth mentioning that the issue persisted before I updated the pack past v1, however I will check if it persists in singleplayer, and with the mod by itself.
Simply a service with a configuration:  ``` micronaut:   http.services:     myservice:       urls:         - "https://someurl       path: "/mycontext" ```  will lose `/mycontext` if `@Client(id = "myservice")` will be annotated with `@JacksonFeatures`, as I wrote before I think the problem is how a new client is created in HttpClientIntroductionAdvice#getClient.      
Some more observations.  Platform.nextObjectId() is being generated as async, even though its content is just:  ``` public static int nextObjectId() {         return ((PlatformHelper)JS.getGlobal()).nextId();     } ```  The AsyncMethodFinder it adding it because it claims it makes a call to String.<init>(char[]), which it also considers to be async.   Perhaps I don't understand exactly how the async generation is supposed to work. It seems as though nearly everything is generated async even if the method clearly is sync (e.g. only returns a value).  Is this how it is supposed to work? 
Yes, the vallues 
Thanks doctor for your answer !  Today i also can't reproduce it :-(  1.) tried it local-> OK. also on samba -> OK. 2.) the German Word 'Schönheit' was Included. Yesterday i only changed it to 'Schoenheit'.       Thereafter the .nfo file was sucessfully written. 3.) i previously lost the Poster & Fanart files in the Directory.       .nfo was still available      Tried the Button 'Write File Data', but .nfo file was not rewritten 4.) yes v0.2.26 under win8.1; Samba from libreelec v7.02 5.) sorry i didn't look. If i will Report Ägäis a Problem, i Promille i will have a look at the Output Window       Today it locked Quote good to me   At the Moment i mostly work on a Windows Client. When i did my other Posts (also with Similar .nfo Write Problems) i wirkend under OS X. The Samba Server is the same.  Regards

I think building a minimal jar file and shipping the assets folder is good for a number of reasons.

I think it changes the javascript too.  Doesn't appear to be a treeshaking issue.
Here is the Sample https://github.com/liubaoyua/Example.  The debugger show that in MainActivity.java line 91,   ``` RequestManager manager = Glide.with(imageView); manager.load("https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/site/universe-logo.png")                     .into(imageView); ``` The manager come from  RequestManagerRetriever.get(android.app.Activity), but the imageView is a fragment view.
Thanks for your response.  Yes, it requires. Is there any workaround for that? I tried different VPN servers in different locations, including the country I'm currently in.
only if they spawn in the two block spaces in my branch mine they ignore me but near the entrance of the branch mine (a normal cave) they run in and attack me 
> Could you clarify what error you're referring to and what fixes it on master (if you know)?  This commit is the one that I believe fixes the PendingTrace cleanup: https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-java/commit/e51708023437b168b42e8592e4c12680016126b4#diff-28ebab7e0711a0924cd60c0e28ab0f06R253   If I've read and understood the code correctly, prior to this there were two span cleaners. One that was a static member of the PendingTraces class and another that was instanced in with the start of the scheduled thread. As PendingTraces were created, they were getting pushed into the class static member but, since that wasn't the one running in the thread, the traces were never getting cleaned up.   I see that it's built up using weakreferences. I can't explain why it's holding the memory or how exactly the JVM decides to clean those up. What we've found in practice is that we have a large number of PendingTraces on some of our production servers and it's not getting cleaned up even when forcing a GC via VisualVM. On a smaller scale, I see the same thing with the steps to reproduce I described before. I see the PendingTrace in VisualVM and forcing a GC run doesn't seem to clean it up.  >Meanwhile, you can disable the client instrumentation: -Ddd.integration.jax-rs-client.enabled=false  I'm looking at switching to HttpUrlConnection instead of disabling this. There's other advantages for us to make this switch as well.
@joschi VMware is just an example, I'll fetch some more. My suggesstion is more general. if you read RFC5424 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6) you will find this  ```       HEADER          = PRI VERSION SP TIMESTAMP SP HOSTNAME                         SP APP-NAME SP PROCID SP MSGID       PRI             = "<" PRIVAL ">"       PRIVAL          = 1*3DIGIT ; range 0 .. 191       VERSION         = NONZERO-DIGIT 0*2DIGIT ```  which means a RFC5424-Syslog message **must** start with the Priority followed by the version and a space character.  VERSION must be a number with one to three digits and must not start with zero. adjusting the static pattern to detect RFC5425 conform messages would automaticly stop applying wrong filters to vmware messages.  Examples:   ``` <166>2016-01-29T16:37:46.644Z srv01esx27.corp.local Hostd: --> } <166>2016-01-29T16:33:30.567Z srv01esx24.corp.local Hostd: --> "992" <166>2016-01-29T15:49:19.934Z srv01esx29.corp.local Vpxa: [6269EB70 verbose 'VpxaHalCnxHostagent' opID=WFU-bea1521f] [WaitForUpdatesDone] Received callback <166>2016-01-29T15:49:19.934Z srv01esx29.corp.local Vpxa: [6269EB70 verbose 'VpxaHalCnxHostagent' opID=WFU-bea1521f] [WaitForUpdatesDone] Received callback <166>2016-01-29T15:49:19.926Z srv01esx29.corp.local Vpxa: [6269EB70 verbose 'VpxaHalCnxHostagent' opID=WFU-c04d02e0] [VpxaHalCnxHostagent::ProcessUpdate] Applying updates from 7313825 to 7313826 (at 7313825) ```  Best Regards, Jörg

Subtasks are correctly executed; however, none of the PROPERTIES.txt files contain any information on subtasks. I don't know whether this is different from before the changes in DKPro Lab. 
Checking screen state is useful to exclude other logs that look like gameplay logs. By only logging during a game we don't get confusing messages displayed.   For example, immediately before a casual or ranked match you'll get logs like this:  ``` [Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=1 local=False [name=Gul'dan id=4 zone=PLAY zonePos=0 cardId=HERO_07 player=1] zone from  -> OPPOSING PLAY (Hero) [Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=1 local=False [name=Life Tap id=5 zone=PLAY zonePos=0 cardId=CS2_056 player=1] zone from  -> OPPOSING PLAY (Hero Power) [Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=1 local=False [id=6 cardId= type=INVALID zone=DECK zonePos=0 player=1] zone from  -> OPPOSING DECK ... [Zone] ZoneChangeList.ProcessChanges() - id=1 local=False [id=35 cardId= type=INVALID zone=DECK zonePos=0 player=1] zone from  -> OPPOSING DECK [LoadingScreen] LoadingScreen.OnSceneLoaded() - prevMode=TOURNAMENT nextMode=GAMEPLAY ```  These look the same as logs that occur during the game, so in my first version these messages were displayed as if each player had played their hero power when the game started... which wasn't true. The messages just indicate Hearthstone setting up the game. I stopped those misleading messages by checking the game state: when [LoadingScreen] identifies that the mode is TOURNAMENT the messages are ignored; once the mode changes to GAMEPLAY the logging starts. Is that going to be a problem when using RxScala? 
I have a feeling it’s because the `ceylon.ast` project is so big :-( 
I took JED out to see if it was causing problems, even in a standard overworld I was not getting any ore decoration.  But I found the issue, I MUST call `addBlockToReplace()` as part of my decoration setup, even though the docs say this is defaulted to stone.  Perhaps the default isn't correct or some other mod is messing with stone, but adding : `dec.addBlockToReplace("minecraft:stone")`  to each ore-gen decoration fixed the issue.
Heya - see instructions on the front page (scroll down a bit) - https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology  But please ask questions in the forum instead :)  http://board.movingblocks.net/viewforum.php?f=5 
was it merged?
@mario I got some errors related to "Upload failed". Do not know the reason for now. Will try to check the log. Unfortunately, the log cannot be sent when upload is already in progress. It would be nice to be able to force an upload for the Log file. Another error, and this was upon swiping the top of the screen downward, was about some "SSL initialization failed" I think. Will try to conduct some more testing later. My phone gets a bit warm when Video and Wifi seem to work concurrently. Both Video or Pictures get stored/recorded on external SD card when using the camera app. NC user data are also stored on external SD card. 
Similar to how a Train knows that it's being locked I suppose. Locomotives hook into the Train object to inspect the list of tracks locking the Train, the same concept could be applied to Tokens. Though I haven't decided yet how to prevent trains from the entering the block, whether you will need a track or if it "just knows". 
    > I had found out the reason, a PR will be later :)  ok    i will try again later
Then it works fine.

Maybe, if znc parts you when it disconnects from IRC. 
Client runs on Tomcat 7.0.65.
Sure, same way I did since 2.1 or so: drag old exist from ``Applications`` to trash (obviously its isn't running),  relog os-user,  drag new exist into ``Applications``, click on exist in ``Applications`` after its done copying from dmg, configure mem-settings, and confirm that the old data directory should be reused.

@tsmaeder what I mean with "builtins" is the vs-code built-in extensions as of this: https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14759  @ibuziuk what I mean is that there is more complexity to the theia API and builtin extensions so users may encounter known issues with builtins while trying to add a .vsix extension to the plugin registry.  In the case of html-language-features (which is a built-in required by the vuejs extension) it was enough just by adding the html-language-features.vsix prior to the loading of the vuejs extension but there may be cases in which built-ins conflict with each-other or .vsix versions of the ms-vscode builtins are outdated.  So this represents a blocker for a user trying to just make a sidecar container (and maybe a cli one too), and some extension's meta.yaml to add a ms-vscode extension to che. In this case maybe it would be nice to have P1 on this case to get help from che devs around it so users can continue their work
It's using TS 2.0.5, NetBeans 8.2 on Windows 7 x64.  Will try the updated build at work tomorrow :-) 
Yeah, I copied from the notifications on the library sample and it's still not working. I'm looking at my push logs on my Dashboard and I'm seeing `publishing the message failed with error: MismatchSenderId`, what could that possibly mean. Adding the device was successful

The reason might be this: For RN v59.x, it is given that we install the latest lottie-react-native, which might have the referenced libraries that have migrated to AndroidX. I upgraded the RN to v60.2 and then followed documentation. Also, automatic linking didn't work for me - I had to do it manually.  Be sure read the [upgrade help docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading) before upgrading.
I discussed it with Ben Jones in the group, he thinks it is the way this device initializes.  He plans on looking into it more when he gets back. 
Я даже хз с какой версии он был. Просто кто-то скинул эту ошибку в тему с моей сборки.  names. Это имя игроков из списка.  ```             String names = "null";             for (Player namePl : recipients) {                 if (namePl.getName().equals(sender.getName())) {                     continue;                 }                 if (names.startsWith("null")) {                     names = namePl.getName();                 } else {                     names += ", " +namePl.getName();                 } ``` Возможно это даже не связно с этим. Потому что в логах я не вижу никакой ошибки от этого плагина, и нету сообщения в логе, которое отправил игрок. Так что, наврятли причина в этом. Тот кто скинул ошибку не заходил на рубакит с четверга. Так что спросить у него подробностей я не могу. 
@jnioche Ok, I have tested and it is fixed. Thanks
I use the default config 
@galadril difficult as it's inside my home-LAN. The domoticz bug (mentioned above) contains a domoticz database you can play with.
Yes, I just did. Still doesn't work.   Now using the latest EssentialsX version (not the one before).  /ess version: https://gyazo.com/8e16bc7c42712209e7e9c185e1b28f26  Also, it's somewhat unrelated but it is still regarding sign shops: Oak sapling, birch sapling, acacia sapling, jungle sapling, and dark oak sapling buy & sell signs are broken. The buy signs will take money but not give any items. The only sapling signs that work are spruce  Sapling Sign Setups: https://gyazo.com/c3d6cd6b03b532ede9b5af7729fbcc27 https://gyazo.com/e7b90a4e8adb96c70068268834b6f895  Edit: When I try to sell saplings it says "Error: You do not have 4x potted_dark_oak_sapling." so the issue is with potted vs normal saplings.  Edit 2: /i OakSapling, for example, doesn't work either.  Edit 3: /i Oak_Sapling works though and Oak_Sapling on the shop sign.

It's not a same question,I've used SpringServicesInstrumentation in apm-spring-annotation-plugin,It's change the class which is used @Servcie. when com.alibaba.dubbo.common.bytecode.Wrapper.makeWrapper in javassist works, the error become.  就是我用了optional-plugins插件，里面对@Service增强的，到Dubbo用javassist动态生成class的时候就出错了，帮忙指点下是我用的不对，还是增强后动态生成的问题，谢谢。 @wu-sheng 
Treat as an empty list, no results would be expected. Think about not executing query or this condition(if its "or" query), to not waste cost querying on GAE 
What does ``` catch (TimeoutException e) {             e.printStackTrace();             fail();         } ``` do in `phoenicis-javafx/src/test/java/org/phoenicis/javafx/AppConfigurationInitialisationTest.java`? Maybe this is causing the issue.
Using latest build 172. Like with 156, the LEVEROFF (and other block changing executors) doesn't work when fired from a named trigger. I can 100% confirm there is a lever there, I have discovered the error is other. The code inside the try gets to the end and fails in the last statement, the BlockState.update(true);   #### Code inside try-catch ``` Block = location.getBlock(); BlockState = Block.getState(); Lever = BlockState.getData();  Lever.setPowered(false); BlockState.setData(Lever); BlockState.update(true); --> Fails in this sentence ```  If I print the error message, this is what I get: ``` Asynchronous Async Player Chunk Add! ```   It looks like the plugin is trying to change the world asynchronously and obviously bukkit api dones't allow that. It's weird this happens in a named trigger but dones't in a temp trigger.

Vanilla server, I was breaking a block aproximately 2-3 blocks above and 7 blocks both south and east. Happened several more times. The afk fishing room is below my storage room which I'm expanding, lol.
@Dev-Osmium This is a very interesting mod，this is its web site on curseforge https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minefantasy2
I deleted data for Lawnchair, but the issue persisted.
Sorry, i forgot this thread. Here's a Nokia 3410 pack with all B&W games with that resolution. [Full Games.zip](https://github.com/nikita36078/J2ME-Loader/files/4174093/Full.Games.zip)  
Hi @amit6663 , I think @Grandolf49 has already put up a pull request that solves the issue. But still you can discuss with @Grandolf49 if any further changes are required

Not sure how to install 1.7.6. I can only install from playstore on current phone and that is still at 1.7.5. Happy to do if guided. 
@snicoll outside of Docker everything works fine. @eddumelendez using 1.5.7.RELEASE I'm getting the same result.

Hmmm, doesn't work in 1.4.3 either, while this is the method that seems to not get called anymore  https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/src/main/java/com/owncloud/android/ui/activity/FolderPickerActivity.java#L174  Icon is ```ic_list_empty_create_folder```  cc also @tobiasKaminsky 
Are the `response` and `connect` timeouts undocumented API; the documentation only mentions `timeoutInSeconds`?  A timeout of more than 24 seconds does not work.  There is a hardcoded 24 second read timeout on the HTTP request calling the device method.  Instead of a "gateway timeout" after 30 seconds, there is a `SocketTimeoutException` with `Read timed out` after 24 seconds.
I'm using the latest ForgeEssentials beta7 release from curse.

it's in `MkGithub` 
@johspaeth you are right. `GeneralDigest` is added to the list `classes` and the [code](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis/blob/129c90dbd4d6f3c38523865d3bb792616f8755b8/CryptoAnalysis/src/main/java/crypto/typestate/CryptSLMethodToSootMethod.java#L72) adds `<org.bouncycastle.crypto.digests.GeneralDigest: void update(byte)>, <org.bouncycastle.crypto.digests.GeneralDigest: void update(byte[],int,int)>]` to the `res`
Nope, it only happens when a compile error occurs. You also do not see the compile error in the REPL
http://pastebin.com/7Nc5DNMK  Seems to be a problem with Sponge + RTG even after we deactivated that RTG generates these structures. 
For me it doesn't work for any abstract class.  ``` public abstract class AbstractLifecycle {     protected abstract void Start();     protected abstract void Stop();     protected abstract void Pause();     protected abstract void Resume(); }  public class MyLifecycle : AbstractLifecycle {  } ```  MyLifecycle is correctly highlighted in IDE saying it doesn't implement methods, but when I click "Implement methods" they are not added to the class as they should. 
ok. It was mentioned there. closing the issue
When the complex character is inputted, then a gray block box will be appeared at the below couple of lines from the current input line.

In the above attached picture: - I wrote 2 Korean characters and 1 white space consequently, then the last Korean character was disappeared. Actually the last Korean character was deleted. But at the below line, 2 gray block boxes were still existing(displayed).  
Wow, quick response! Old config file. I updated from 3.4.9.17. Good thing these logs get backed up... [debug-1.log](https://github.com/OreCruncher/DynamicSurroundings/files/2627659/debug-1.log)
Tried JDK 12, JDK 11, JDK 1.8.0
The same thing happens with the nightly.  A few things that might be helpful in tracking it down:  - It is reliably triggered when I start or stop moving my mouse. - There is sometimes a less-strong baseline level of flicker (not captured on the video) with a semi-constant frequency of about .5hz.  This flicker doesn't last as long as the big long flickers you see on the video.  I get a similar type of flicker when scrolling with the scroll bar.
I don't know, I'll check next time.
@leoek  Absolutely. As you can see from https://github.com/PSPDFKit/react-native/blob/fec925dcc83aeba9fe25e3658644d55cb1fe5629/windows/ReactNativePSPDFKit/ReactNativePSPDFKit/PSPDFKitViewManager.cs#L63-L105 we were creating a css file that can be passed to the PSPDFKit for Windows framework. This file would subsequently be passed to a `Webview` which drives the PSPDFKit for Windows framework. But because of file limitations within UWP, you cannot simply pass a file from a local path to the `WebView` to `fetch`, it has to be a file within the web context which is what https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-resources/uri-schemes#ms-appx-and-ms-appx-web explains. The issue here is that the files accessible from the web context is only from the install folder. In production mode, it is not possible to write or move into the install folder for security reasons (which is understandable). This is why previously it was working when debugging but not when deploying.  I hope this is understandable and just ask if you need any other clarification. 
It does not say, not in catalina.out and not in the user interface 
The error is happening in the constructor: `new PdfReader(inputStream)`.  I'm locating the file now to see if it can be shared.
It looks like the problem is classpath containing ";" not quoted.  I can reproduce it with following step:  * Create 2 maven projects as A and B * Add project B as project A's dependency * Add both projects into the same workspace * Debug on project A  Debugger may produce something likes this ```bash C:\\Users\\example\\.vscode\\extensions\\vscjava.vscode-java-debug-0.21.0\\scripts\\launcher.bat "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_211\\bin\\java" -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=n,suspend=y,address=l ocalhost:56959 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp D:\\opt\\mainapp\\target\\classes;D:\\opt\\shared\\target\\classes app.App ```  Sometimes debugger may decide bundle them all into single jar, in this case everything goes fine.
here are the scripts files from `zowe/1.0.1/api-mediation/scripts` [scripts.zip](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/files/3054259/scripts.zip) at first glance I think hostnames are fine. V
it basically crash when you pick the barrel that is filled with something.

I forgot to mention that we use Telegraf to pull the HTTP JSON metrics and write it to cloudwatch.  In our case telegraf not able to convert the measurements , which is the bug confirmed by telegraf. So here is what recommened by telegraf team as a quick workaround. So looking for some guidance on what needs to be implemented on server to adjust the values to 0  before they enter in telegraf?  Recommendations from Telegraf: "Update the server that your httpjson input uses as its source to adjust the values before they enter telegraf. We will try to get a fix done for this before the next release"  [[inputs.httpjson]] servers = [ "http://localhost:2960/metrics" ] 
@sewe : WDYT?
Yeah. Here's the arrangement that causes this error the most. (along with all its parts) https://www.dropbox.com/s/9whb3do1fy0p9kb/rubicon.rar?dl=0 It's not the only case where this happens but it _is_ the most common example of it. 
HttpServletRequest.getParts() returns null, and HttpServletRequest.getParameter() return null when multipart-data is posted, and the servlet has been added through ServletComponentScan.  If I remove the @WebServlet and @MultipartConfig annotation and add the servlet as a @Bean in my Application class, it works as expected.  tor. 18. aug. 2016 kl. 10.45 skrev Andy Wilkinson <notifications@github.com  > : >  > That sounds more than likely.

I don't know. I'll run a few tests to see if I can help. 
@psxlover Still nothing with redstone, and levers work fine on the same level as the engine. @SandGrainOne What would these configurations be? I've tried repeaters, but no luck. 
 No, the server had been online for some time before the console started to repeat the errors.
I've tested it and the diagnostics are now working when abstract rules are present.   Thanks for the quick response! Can I assume you are going to make a release with this fix?

Thanks for your answer. Refreshing the aspects seems to "repair" everything. That means, that everything is ok after the refresh? Or is there a possible problem for the future when consuming from the new channel?  I don't get a nullpointer-exception in the log-file.

That does not show the error with their default java (1.8.0.51), but does when the java version is updated to 1.8.0.201.
Hi,  I cleaned the project after I imported the 0.8.4 jars, but the error didn't change at all. Same as in my initial description. 
Yes, but I don't placed them into my world. (aka I placed it and destroyed it)  Forge said: 231 blocks/entrys to remove.
I am not aware of -PgenerareApps, how to set this profile, do you have any documentation on it including the later part?

**I originally configured the alert as follows:** Field content value condition Trigger Alert when a message arrives that has  the field "EventID" set to "4725" and then wait at least "1" minute until triggering a new alert. When sending an alert, include the last "1" messages of the stream evaluated for this alert condition.  **But then I changed the alert configuration to the following:** Trigger alert when there are "more" than "1" message in the last "1" minute and then wait at least "1" minute until triggering a new alert. When sending an alert, include the last "1" messages of the stream evaluated for this alert condition.  In both cases, I get the alert once and then all alerts stop, and if I restart the graylog services I can receive the one alert again. I'm not sure what else to look at.  Thanks for any suggestions or help you can provide.

Are you still experiencing this problem @adchilds or is your feedback based on something else?  Stacktrace from #1137 includes this line:  ``` at org.springframework.session.data.redis.RedisOperationsSessionRepository$RedisSession.saveChangeSessionId(RedisOperationsSessionRepository.java:815) ```  The issue was reported against `2.0.4.RELEASE` which handles the rename of `expiredKey` on line 815:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/2.0.4.RELEASE/spring-session-data-redis/src/main/java/org/springframework/session/data/redis/RedisOperationsSessionRepository.java#L815-L816  I believe you're considering the current state of `RedisOperationsSessionRepository` and not the one from the release against which #1137 was raised.
Issue started after i updated to consulo version  #1271. i think i was on #1268 before update but i don' t remember the c# version. Also never seen the issue before version #1268. example class bellow. http://prntscr.com/9orx3b Then when i try to call from other class it shows http://prntscr.com/9orzog Enums nothing special. Example public enum TimeOfDay{Day,Night}; Unity compiles ok but consulo says error. 
@Theobald93 Yes,I tried,it resoled #379 
Currently it's "if the existing file is in the database and the file does not exist, delete it". I'm proposing "if the file from the database is not in the file list, delete it" 
@kayler-renslow Tried with the latest TFAR build and spits out the same errors. I included a bunch of screenshots.

Sure this would work and be thread safe. My thought at initial look was that these classes were not intended to be threadsafe to begin with. And that it would be a requirement of the callers of pause() / resume() to ensure thread safety. On further review, the "compareAndSet" operation was making it thread safe to do. If maintaining thread safety of the Terminal implementations is the goal then we should merge in your change instead. While rare, I can think of cases an application would require multiple threads to handle the pause()/resume() methods.

I can confirm that the crash does *not* occur in single player when using a *blank, cheated in* biome crystal. Trying to get a non-cheated one is proving a little challenging, so a single-player crash log might take a little longer...
Works like a charm. Thanks a lot. :)

No I do not have antivirus stuff installed, can reproduce the bug consistenly. Performance monitor only shows "System" proccess accessing the file.  I'm using Administrator user profile and I have Full Control rights to the file. I tried opening Full Control rights to all users for the file and the folder, and the only thing that did, surprisingly, is deny the deleting of the original .jar file.  I think Windows won't let you rename the file that is open at the moment, maybe you need to make a small batch or command file to cleanup and run it after updating? 
The first issue is very weird. I discovered that there are actually 3 different "states" I can get it to be in: - Click/tap a file -> Nothing shows - Click/tap a file -> Go to a different app -> Go back -> Partly shown - Click/tap a file -> Swipe from bottom (up to around 1/5 of the screen height) -> Partly shown but misplaced  Attaching screenshots in the mentioned order: ![screenshot 2018-10-25 at 22 13 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5497761/47503062-2d3cde00-d8a4-11e8-8d21-d7deca8e7b49.png) ![screenshot 2018-10-25 at 22 14 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5497761/47503063-2dd57480-d8a4-11e8-9ae8-5ccc88ada7ec.png) ![screenshot 2018-10-25 at 22 14 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5497761/47503064-2dd57480-d8a4-11e8-8af0-b03837f47850.png)

I do not have docker on my path (and I'm not sure I ever did).  I thought it worked last week, but I still have this breakage when I reset back to the beginning of last week.  I arbitrarily reset to 5d72d4ea54fdcb6e963cacb7181fda847e01bc50 (commit from late June) and retried, and ran into no issues.  Do we require that users download docker to contribute to bazel?  
> computing a centroid point for each triangle, and then averaging them in some way  Isn't that basically what the current implementation is doing? :thinking:  I think, for these degenerate polygons, when using an algorithm intended for regular areas, you'll by definition end up with a point that can be *anywhere* since you're basically at some point dividinging zero by zero for the weighted average.  > I wonder if there is a way to rearrange the calculation to make it numerically stable?  I was wondering that as well. But as far as I know (me not being an expert in this field at all), when working with floating point numbers, the best one can do is to minimize such rounding/truncation errors (e.g. by using more clever [summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)).
Hey now its working... I think the problem was in my firewall, It was blocking to download some required repo. but I am still facing problem my browser says "No router defined."

I know that CUBA.platform has supported Java 8 date types since 7.x. I expect that the support of Java 8 Date type works in any part of platform (framework) without any restrictions. I think that it is slightly strange that I can use Java 8 Date types for fields in Entity but I can't access to the value of the field by JPQL query.

Hi David  No, I don't have a working xml file for this sensor. ozwcp also never worked reliably for me.  On the other hand, maybe I can help you with the bit fiddling (if this is your problem)? If you just want to have bit 3 enabled it should be a decimal 8 (2³)  and also a hex 8 (0x08).   Dieter 
Hey Harald,  so far it fails for all splitting of .mgf files. I generate them with progenesis QI by exporting the ms/ms spectra from there. I do a filtering where I exclude all hits that are ranked in the ms/ms spectra 10 or higher to make searches faster and still not losing IDs.  Unfortunately I need to split those big .mgf files (this file here has a size of around 1.7 gb) because somehow our mascot search engine cannot handle .mfg files which are bigger than 1gb.  The .mgf files are made from high resolution mass spec .raw files with a long gradient (5h).  Best regards Andreas     __________________________   Andreas Hentschel, M. Sc.

To be honest we pretty much stay away from the mgf splitting as it can have a minor impact on the results (as each mgf file is processed separately by the search engines). Can I ask you where the mgf files comes from and why it's so big? And how big is it btw?  I've just tested the splitting though, and it still works fine on my side. Does it fail for all files on your side or just this particular one?  Best regards,  Harald  — You are receiving this because you authored the thread.

@hsz Unfortunately I have not seen this error repeat itself again, but I will see if there's any way to trigger it reliably. 
@katre the most simple case is this: ```bash cat BUILD >java_binary( >  name = "main", >  srcs = glob(["*.java"]), >  main_class = "Main", >) ```  ```bash cat Main.java >public class Main{ >  public static void main(String[] args){ >    System.out.println("HelloWorld!"); >  } >} ```  and WORKSPACE file is empty.

I deleted my previous instance of pcms and reinstalled the project from scratch. Installed the latest from master. There is still no preview or refresh when editing. There are no JS errors or 404's. I tried Chrome and Firefox.  After an update, if I double click on the component I just edited, then the update renders,
Yeah creative. When experimenting with a mod I like to create what amounts to a void world so my laptop doesn't have to render more than it needs to. I tend to like building ridiculous setups that make placing a block in the chunk the setup is in cause something like half a second to a second of lag as it rerenders the chunk. 
me was told that a lot of files \* .mca is not good. and Slows down the generation of the presence of other mods if they are many. and if I use BT can not find the biomes BOP(using generation of RTG and no one biome not found ..), but the files \* .mca only 6 if I use the CC, it creates a lot of files *.mca and biomes BOP found  the problem itself that if I set a different mods, magic, Industrialna and more, creation of maps slow and even slower to gregtech. with version 04 it was not so  sorry for bad english)) 
That sounds like it would solve the problem. However I tend to like properties more than environment variables. This way it's easier to integrate with Jenkins and Maven, e. g. I can run a build like  > mvn clean install -Dtestcontainers.container.host=docker-machine-ip  And it doesn't pollute the build server's environment.  If such a feature is going to be integrated it may be a good idea to mark it  as experimental for some time since I am not exactly sure if it does really make sense that way. I mean: If it wasn't for the docker in docker setup, then socket->localhost, ip->someOtherHost holds true und is perfectly reasonable. The new feature may cause things to become more complicated (also more powerful) and it must be seen if similar situations do exist where it comes in handy. Maybe provisioning Jenkins Slaves with Docker or running a whole container as test would be another use case for this. 
Here is a client log from a brand new instance with just the latest versions of the mods in question. Last time I may have accidentally grabbed a crash report from an older version of JEI that I was testing with to see what version the bug first appeared along side.  fml-client-latest.log: https://gist.github.com/rockdemon696/49b6ba715c9baa3ba1af

This happens when running with TestNG framework too.
Sure! I started with a note with this content:  ``` Test note  Test content ```  I edited it so the note contained this content:  ``` Test note  Test content  Edit ```  I think this may also have to do with timing. I waited a couple seconds, switched to Preview, and immediately saw the preview with that new content. But when I closed and reopened the note it didn't include the added content.  However, if I added the content and then immediately switched to Preview, I had to wait a moment for the preview to update with that new content. It looks like in that case the change is saved when I close and reopen the note.
From GTFS:  "The block_id field identifies the block to which the trip belongs. A block consists of two or more sequential trips made using the same vehicle, where a passenger can transfer from one trip to the next just by staying in the vehicle. The block_id must be referenced by two or more trips in trips.txt."    Maybe it's not technically wrong according to the GTFS spec, depending on how you read "sequential trips".   I'd be pretty conservative with that and say "sequential trips" are where the trips share the same physical end/begin point.  If there's a gap between those points, and some dwell time along with them being different physical points, then there's an assumed dead-head trip between the two points, and thus they are not sequential.

I am using the Zotero addon for Firefox, not the standalone version. I have Zotfile setup to move all new attachments to a folder in my SpiderOak from the default Zotero location. The steps to reproduce are launching Firefox, navigating to a journal article with a pdf that I would like to save, and press the 'Save to Zotero'-icon in the browser toolbar.  I tried it more extensively now and notice that the error persists for all articles I download, until I open the Zotero pane and right click >> Manage Attachments >> Rename Attachments. This works without error messages and, curiously, makes Zotfile work automatically with all subsequently downloaded articles. So after I have done the manual renaming once, I can use the Zotero toolbar button to download article pdfs and Zotfile will automatically rename them.  I do use NoScript and some other addons, not sure if that would interfere somehow.

Yes we upgraded spring-boot (https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/issues/3917), this is spring-core. Any objections to go to 4.3.18 for this? I think we need to make sure the version of Camel we use in the meta and integration pods can handle this.
Hi Dennis, good hint! here are the values:  ``` rest_listen_uri = http://0.0.0.0:12900/ #rest_transport_uri = http://192.168.1.1:12900/ ```  However, I am using your official plain Docker image without any modification. So this is _wrong_ out of the box. In my opinion this would have to be adjusted by the `graylog-ctl reconfigure-*` script. 
@HelgeStenstrom  I am not sure how it can be measured but definitely there is . Well there is [JProfiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) and [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/)

Yep, it's the same error in the title of this issue.  > I have updated [the readme file in this repo](https://github.com/Instabug/Instabug-React-Native#using-cocoapods) with instruction on how to do that. Can you please check it out and let me know if it works for you?  Nice! Yes, those install steps appear to work. Two points of feedback on the docs: 1. It might be worth calling out that if you do those manual Pod steps you'll still have to setup Android manually. 2. I'm uncomfortable with the `post_install do |installer|` step since it appears to unlink the React base pod. What's the point of this step? Also, the project still builds if I remove that step.

DITA OT 2.5.2 but probably older versions have the same problem. I'm not sure how this usually works when running the DITA OT integrator from the command line using the "dita -install". Possibly because my DITA OT is installed in a folder which has French accents... we run our automated tests in such a folder.

It happens every time. I just reproduced it on the current develop branch using Windows and Eclipse Proton. But it happened to everyone in the team project with Linux and Oxygen.   ![missing_connection_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/47085653-8e671080-d217-11e8-809c-9ba58c0e9b14.png)  ![missing_connection_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/47085656-9030d400-d217-11e8-9a62-9144a87755e8.png)  There should be a connection between NewFeature1 and Priorities.

Not sure... I've only seen it in 0.4.0 and below and only very rarely.  I suspect it might have something to do with the 'Rolling Hills' terrain template I wrote, but that screenshot in the OP looks like it's happening in Ocean as well (unless the rolling hills are bleeding into Deep Ocean somehow, but that seems unlikely).

I don't think so unless you have changed anything. It was Java language, clean Sonar without additional plugins. Docker version with H2 database migrated into container.
So basically the problem is with the Grpc Server that is setup with Dagger (client initiating compression works fine). A very basic simple example would be a server, taken from the Dagger article (https://dagger.dev/grpc/servers.html): ```java public class CompressingGreeterServer {     private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(CompressingGreeterServer.class.getName());      @Module(includes = {             GreeterModule.class,     })     static abstract class GreeterGrpcModule {         @Binds         abstract GreeterServiceDefinition provideGreeterServiceDefinition(ServerComponent serverComponent);          @Provides         @ForGrpcService(GreeterGrpc.class)         static List<? extends ServerInterceptor> provideInterceptors() {             return Arrays.asList(new ServerInterceptor() {                 @Override                 public <ReqT, RespT> ServerCall.Listener<ReqT> interceptCall(ServerCall<ReqT, RespT> call, Metadata headers, ServerCallHandler<ReqT, RespT> next) {                     call.setCompression("gzip");                     return next.startCall(call, headers);                 }             });         }     }      @Singleton     @Component(modules = {             GreeterUnscopedGrpcServiceModule.class,             GreeterGrpcModule.class,             NettyServerModule.class,     })     interface ServerComponent extends GreeterServiceDefinition {         Server server();     }      private void start() throws IOException, InterruptedException {         int port = 50051;         ServerComponent component =                 DaggerCompressingGreeterServer_ServerComponent.builder()                         .nettyServerModule(NettyServerModule.bindingToPort(port))                         .build();         final Server server = component.server();         server.start();          Runtime.getRuntime()                 .addShutdownHook(                         new Thread(                                 () -> {                                     // Use stderr here since the logger may have been reset by its JVM shutdown hook.                                     System.err.println("*** shutting down Auth Server since JVM is shutting down");                                     server.shutdown();                                     System.err.println("*** server shut down");                                 }));         server.awaitTermination();         logger.info("Server started, listening on " + port);     }      public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {         CompressingGreeterServer server = new CompressingGreeterServer();         server.start();     } } ```  And the Greeter class: ```java @GrpcService(grpcClass = GreeterGrpc.class) public class Greeter extends GreeterGrpc.GreeterImplBase {     @Override     public void sayHello(HelloRequest request, StreamObserver<HelloReply> responseObserver) {         HelloReply reply = HelloReply.newBuilder().setMessage("Hello: " + request.getName()).build();         responseObserver.onNext(reply);         responseObserver.onCompleted();     } } ```  But because `dagger.grpc.server.ProxyServerCallHandler.ServerCallAdapter` is not delegating the `setCompression` call, compression never happens. Solution is simple: `delegate.setCompression(...)`

[example-project.zip](https://github.com/qoomon/maven-git-versioning-extension/files/3392737/example-project.zip) see attached file. I've tried to simplified the project as much as could and kept only the relevant information. As you can see, we have a <version> specified in the root pom.xml. This tag refers to a ${revision} property, defined in the same pom.xml. The maven module pom.xml inherits from this root pom.xml and also refers to the ${revision} property. At first, the ${version} from the extension didn't like the fact my version was referring to a property, so I've hard-coded the version directly in the version tag. But still didn't work for maven module that also refered to ${revision} property.  Anyway, let me know if you have enough information with the attached file. Maybe it's the way we are configured with the flatten plugin..
OK, fixed in the current build, thanks.

Yep, same problem using IDs.
Yes, I was using at the smallest size lengthwise. After making it a little larger and putting it back to the smaller size the text was pushed to the next line.  
OK, that solves the question about the uniqueness constraint, since it's only per property.  I'll have a look at the queries once I'm done with #58. 
It looks like a useful improvement but the problem is that information is only shown if **File > Preferences > Show verbose output during: > compilation** is checked. Compilation verbose output is not enabled by default and is rarely needed for troubleshooting the common issues reported on the forum. I usually have it turned off because it makes for more scrolling to read the warnings. Requesting the user to enable it adds an additional step to the support process and can make the output longer than the maximum character limit of the forum, forcing the user to add it as an attachment or dropbox link, etc. which adds yet another level of complication and makes it harder for the other forum users to view the output. Having verbose output during compilation turned off makes it less likely that the platform version can be determined from platform paths shown in the output as those paths will only be shown if the error involves one of the platform files.  I was referring the text added to the start of the output only when the "Copy error messages" button is used(not shown on the console). For example, changing:  ``` Arduino: 1.6.12 (Windows 7), Board: "Arduino/Genuino Uno" ```  to  ``` Arduino: 1.6.12 (Windows 7), Board: "Arduino/Genuino Uno", Platform version: 1.6.14 ```  Adding the platform name to this output would also be useful. 
Yeah, that true. I see it quite often and doesn't cause any problems under a certain treshold.  But after adding an extra imageview the shuttering began showing more. Here a movie to illustrate the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_ROgAjEfzg  As you can see, it looks like if the animation hasn't finished completely before the cards get refreshed which result in the stutter.  Below is the layout xml, it's just one RelativeLayout, the hierarchy can't get any flatter:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <RelativeLayout     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="wrap_content"     android:background="@drawable/card_border"     android:layout_margin="@dimen/card_margin"     android:padding="2dp">      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/profile"         android:layout_width="0dp"         android:layout_height="0dp"         android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"         />      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/background"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:adjustViewBounds="true"         android:src="@drawable/card_bg_techniek_female"/>      <View         android:id="@+id/content_area"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="200dp"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_margin="2dp"         android:background="@color/white"         android:alpha="0.8"/>      <TextView         android:id="@+id/title"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:text="OPERATIONS MANAGER"         android:layout_alignTop="@+id/content_area"         android:textColor="@color/white"         android:textSize="20sp"         android:textStyle="bold"         android:background="@color/black"         android:padding="3dp"         android:layout_margin="10dp"/>      <View         android:id="@+id/location_area"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="35dp"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_margin="1dp"         android:background="@color/orange"         />      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/job_cat_pin"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_below="@+id/title"         android:layout_alignLeft="@+id/title"         android:src="@drawable/job_cat_pin"         />      <TextView         android:id="@+id/category"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_below="@+id/title"         android:layout_toRightOf="@+id/job_cat_pin"         android:text="Bouw"         android:textColor="@color/black"/>      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/location_pin"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_marginBottom="2dp"         android:src="@drawable/location_pin_dark"/>      <TextView         android:id="@+id/location"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_toRightOf="@+id/location_pin"         android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"         android:text="GENT"         android:textSize="13sp"         android:textColor="@color/white"         />      <TextView         android:id="@+id/distance"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_alignParentRight="true"         android:layout_marginRight="4dp"         android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"         android:text="1KM"         android:textSize="12sp"         android:textColor="@color/white"         />      <TextView         android:id="@+id/from"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_alignParentRight="true"         android:layout_marginRight="4dp"         android:layout_marginBottom="4dp"         android:text="VAN GHENT"         android:textSize="9sp"         android:textColor="@color/white"         />  </RelativeLayout> ```

@fullwall ARM_SWING is so fast you can't necessarily see the effect. Try `start_use_offhand_item` while its holding a shield in offhand. That lasts varyingly between 0 seconds and half a second.

I make a check before any putToken if the zone is the correct zone for the token. If not remember the current zone renderer, change it to the one with the token (that will not change the UI), putToken with correct zone and restore the zone renderer.  Basically change every "putToken" to something like 3-4 lines, of course encapsulated in a nice method ;)
Here is the log file [log.txt](https://github.com/nokia/RED/files/398747/log.txt) 
So I took another look at it this evening, and I'm fairly sure it was an issue with the drive having its permissions changed somehow. The /data directory had been changed to be owned by root. I've no idea how, but changing it back fixed the issue. 
All I did was run it as a junit test case from within a mechanize project within eclipse using the code as show in #34. It does some redirects, not all - the agent.get(manageKindleUrl) does a redirect to the signin page, which happens correctly in mechanize, but the form.submit() from the sign in page does not follow the redirect 
It is ~2,650 testcases, across about 200 test classes.  Most are very fast-running, small/lightweight/low memory tests.  Just a handful of them use a lot more memory and run for several seconds.  The suite takes about 3 minutes to run when using gradle to run it across 4 JVM processes in parallel.  So really those numbers are sort of divided by 4 in the process that actually hits OutOfMemoryError.  (In my upcoming experiment to pare down the list to try to narrow down the problem, I'll be turning off parallel runs to help unmuddy the waters.)  I should also have mentioned that we are running everything using Java 8.  And I reproduced the same issue on both Linux and Windows.
That was the first thing I checked, and they were set correctly. The guest users are actually coming from another Azure AD Tenant which itself is configured to do single sign-on with an ADFS directory. I'm sure that I don't expect you to be able to fully support this, but wondering if there's a way that I can capture the claims coming back to send to you for investigation?
yes i can open it without any problems 
Version was the last up-to-date in PlayStore. (2014.11.04) 
this SNAPSHOT is from 09/06. I sent to support@orientdb.com 
I have sent in crash reports when it has allowed me, often kills everything, so no opportunity. I'll see what I can find next time it crashes. 
there is no crash, server just hang with zero tps. At now we do some tests to find a reason. May be its bug with multistructure of alveary
@ptrthomas Thanks! it is working fine 👍
@kaikramer Thank you for the response. Yep, I've checked importing key pair on all scenarios (incl. mentioned) with the valid private key of a previously mentioned format: ``` -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- ``` After googling around came across some information that this kind of a mark stands for PKCS8 stored in PEM?

after trying again and changed to 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:24.0.0' it's seems pretty normal, so I thinks the bug is on 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:24.1.0' sorry  
Yes, will raise a pr when I find the time 
That would require a migration or invalidation, but otherwise would be equivalent to the OSX route we employ.

After my latest attempt to fix this problem, I have been unable to reproduce the problem on two different platforms. I am closing this issue. If anyone else experiences this problem after Release 0 Update 0 (and I expect some other platforms will experience something like it anyway), open a new issue. 
Disabling it does fix it, but I would rather not allow offhand. :/
I used the option that you had to find an item, and as soon as you have it in your inventory it would complete the task. (It's the option with the commandblock as logo).
logfile0.txt: https://pastebin.com/pSLwniPZ  I've got a graphics tablet, but it isn't plugged in.  The VM option worked perfectly. Thanks!
Yes, i was able to do it as i mentioned in the issue both for Github as for internal Gitlab Repos 
Thanks for the explanation. I was wondering if `distance_error_pct` applied at search time, but I was not completely sure from the docs. Re-reading the geo_shape query documentation, I can see how the `distance_error_pct` configured in the mapping will be applied at search time as well.  > The geo_shape query uses the same grid square representation as the geo_shape mapping to find documents that have a shape that intersects with the query shape. It will also use the same PrefixTree configuration as defined for the field mapping.  Regarding the difference between using the `geohash` and `quadtree` tree implementation, I have a more specific example. If I use the default settings, I don't get the false positive with the following mapping: ``` {   "mappings": {     "test": {       "properties": {         "location": {           "type": "geo_shape",           "tree": "geohash"         }       }     }   } } ``` But I do get the false positive when I switch to the following: ``` {   "mappings": {     "test": {       "properties": {         "location": {           "type": "geo_shape",           "tree": "quadtree"         }       }     }   } } ``` I understand that this is a pretty outlandish case, but it was surprising to me that one tree implementation returns a false positive with the default precision settings while the other does not.  It seems like the behavior is indeed expected, and if I really need more accuracy for these huge MultiPoints, I can tune the parameters as you mentioned. Thanks again for the clarification.
{attr:level} display 0 and the {attr:cost} diplay 0 then {attr:cost} is equal to 5 and the {attr:level} is equal to 2 and i'm on spigot 1.11.2 for the Taunt
@costin Thanks for responding. This is an issue regarding the actual number of indexed documents in a fresh index in ES (0 documents, created just before the indexing job begins) being different than the number of documents that were given to ES (by spark) to create/index. So spark gives ES 929,660 json documents to index, however sometimes only 924,000 (roughly) are indexed. I have seen the actual number of documents in ES fluctuate between missing up to 5000 or missing as few as 3. On other instances it has had too many documents, up to almost double--still with a fresh index and the same number of documents input. There is no decipherable pattern and the same documents are used for every run. My last run: ES reports 1,409,124 documents, but spark submitted only 929,660 for indexing. The index contained 0 documents to start, nothing else is writing to it, it contains 1 shard and 0 replicas. The number of shards and replicas does seem to matter--the trend is with a higher number of shards, a lower number of replicas and a lower number of total documents attempting to be indexed, we will see the exactly correct number of documents under those conditions, but that is very difficult for me to verify and extrapolate those results in any significant way. I have also tried using both the new native RDD format for spark in the beta release, as well as the old output format based format inside of spark in both the beta and the 2.0.1 releases.  Although I don't think it is related to #268, as a side question, how can I see those metrics when using spark? From the documentation, it looked as if the metrics used the hadoop counter infrastructure, which to my knowledge would be independent of the spark job. Is it possible to see these when using the spark API?  ES version: 1.3.0 (9 data nodes, 3 masters, 1 load balancer) Spark version: 1.0.0 (1 master, 9 workers) Java version: 1.8.0_11  Spark and ES are running on the same nodes (spark on a subset or the ES nodes). Working on posting some logs.  Thanks again for your help and response.

OOPS, I want this on. Sorry, there is a mysterious bug I am hunting day and night, the removal was one way to battle it.  Something regarding #226.  So please enable it. And make it identical to the main Refacor/Spartanization menu. If possible, by not cut and paste, but if ain't possible, by real cut and paste.  So: Yes 
Well I since then removed those machines... But it is basically 2 columns of 3 vat's eacht.. 3 producing hooch and 3 producing fire water... With the correct filter settings (only export fire water), it still put water into the drum... Checking the filter settings, they only had firewater whitelisted.. Put down another new drum... Again, exported water into it. 
I think this was fixed in the dev build i have. I will check and confirm  On Wed, 13 Feb. 2019, 1:35 pm tastybento <notifications@github.com wrote:  > I can't replicate right now. Hmm.

I'll Check. Outside of that, I have morph installed and when I morph, if i have a block outlined my hand becomes solid. 
Ok, if I activate "Stay Animated", it's glitching only the first time, but then it's ok.  If it's desactivated, it's glitching each time I open it.  Do wou want the structure code with little exporter?
It seems to happen in the client and in the game. I got asked if I really want to join "that" game, because my rating is lower than 1000. I first thought this was just a bug with the rating check, but when I got listed with 365 games and 0 rating in the in-game lobby, I realized that it's not just a bug with the rating check.  I just tested it again. These are my stats in the profile: https://i.imgur.com/ZHUcvKt.png  This is what is displayed in the lobby: http://i.imgur.com/2xa0TJo.jpg  Achievements say, I have played 12 games.  Switching back to the standard faf client fixed my rating again. 
No, I'll load the game with Nihilite disabled and see what happens 
@colintheshots Yes, sorry, should've mentioned that the list of apps doesn't pop-up to choose the default. The toggle doesn't trigger anything, the screen does just a kind of refresh. It was reproduced on Monday, on the 2018-10-21 build.

I don't think this is enough. This enables scrolling with the keys (up & down), but not with a touch / mouse move.

Yeah, that true. I see it quite often and doesn't cause any problems under a certain treshold.  But after adding an extra imageview the shuttering began showing more. Here a movie to illustrate the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_ROgAjEfzg  As you can see, it looks like if the animation hasn't finished completely before the cards get refreshed which result in the stutter.  Below is the layout xml, it's just one RelativeLayout, the hierarchy can't get any flatter:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <RelativeLayout     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="wrap_content"     android:background="@drawable/card_border"     android:layout_margin="@dimen/card_margin"     android:padding="2dp">      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/profile"         android:layout_width="0dp"         android:layout_height="0dp"         android:layout_centerHorizontal="true"         />      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/background"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:adjustViewBounds="true"         android:src="@drawable/card_bg_techniek_female"/>      <View         android:id="@+id/content_area"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="200dp"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_margin="2dp"         android:background="@color/white"         android:alpha="0.8"/>      <TextView         android:id="@+id/title"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:text="OPERATIONS MANAGER"         android:layout_alignTop="@+id/content_area"         android:textColor="@color/white"         android:textSize="20sp"         android:textStyle="bold"         android:background="@color/black"         android:padding="3dp"         android:layout_margin="10dp"/>      <View         android:id="@+id/location_area"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="35dp"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_margin="1dp"         android:background="@color/orange"         />      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/job_cat_pin"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_below="@+id/title"         android:layout_alignLeft="@+id/title"         android:src="@drawable/job_cat_pin"         />      <TextView         android:id="@+id/category"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_below="@+id/title"         android:layout_toRightOf="@+id/job_cat_pin"         android:text="Bouw"         android:textColor="@color/black"/>      <ImageView         android:id="@+id/location_pin"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_marginBottom="2dp"         android:src="@drawable/location_pin_dark"/>      <TextView         android:id="@+id/location"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_toRightOf="@+id/location_pin"         android:layout_marginBottom="8dp"         android:text="GENT"         android:textSize="13sp"         android:textColor="@color/white"         />      <TextView         android:id="@+id/distance"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_alignParentRight="true"         android:layout_marginRight="4dp"         android:layout_marginBottom="15dp"         android:text="1KM"         android:textSize="12sp"         android:textColor="@color/white"         />      <TextView         android:id="@+id/from"         android:layout_width="wrap_content"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"         android:layout_alignBottom="@+id/background"         android:layout_alignParentRight="true"         android:layout_marginRight="4dp"         android:layout_marginBottom="4dp"         android:text="VAN GHENT"         android:textSize="9sp"         android:textColor="@color/white"         />  </RelativeLayout> ``` 
Now that I think of it that could be a possibility. That is the same dragon that was flying in the jerky flying video I put up. Maybe it happens when they land. 
Yes, this problem still appears in latest build.
Appreciate the quick review and response
With accurate you mean something like a warmroast? Unfortunatly I only have/had timings with paper. But these don't show exactly where the problem lies and instead just showed PlayerUpdateTask as cause.   Maybe I can organize a warmroast next week, but I can't promise it, as I never used it before and it seems at least somewhat complicated to make it run.   (PS: I do understand that the task is just calling some default minecraft code and is not really at fault, but it would be nonetheless nice to be able to disable it if the features needing it aren't even used. ) 
It should be STRING_LIST everywhere, I changed the name in between. Sorry about that, I fixed it now.  I was able to circumvent the problem by disabling statement caching in the connection pool. This is my connection pool now: ``` <jdbc-connection-pool name="ComparisonConnectionPool"                           datasource-classname="${db.driver}"                           res-type="javax.sql.DataSource"                           transaction-isolation-level="read-committed"                           non-transactional-connections="true"                           connection-validation-method="meta-data"                           statement-cache-size="0"                           steady-pool-size="2"                           max-pool-size="10"> ``` The exception is thrown for every statement-cache-size>=2. I am still puzzled why the exception was thrown only the second time.

@erdemguven no it isn't . yes i am using DemoDownloadService it sets to 1 not 2 . if it is 2 then can you please give me reference of file and line number.
[Here is the log](https://paste.ee/p/KNhT7)
I use owlapi-osgidistribution/4.1.3 
It's only sending text though, correct? I doubt the filesize can be an issue, otherwise I can only imagine games on a much larger scale, like MMOs being technologically impossible.  Honestly, I can't think of anything causing a timeout aside from a poor connection, temperamental firewall, or dropped packet. Is the timeout duration manually defined? Perhaps we should increase the time allowed before the application gives up?  This is only the second time I've heard of this particular error in the logs, the second one being on the sub earlier today. So I'm not sure how often this occurs in the wild. Sarah's internet has been so abominable that I haven't even attempted a game with her recently, though probably I should to see if the result is a similar log now that logs are more verbose.  I'm tagging @rayrobdod and @Purplemandown so we have all hands on deck for additional insight on this. These softlocks need to stop, ideally before the next tourney - I don't want a repeat of our 2nd tournament. 
I copyed sample code without changes from github readme to my project and run from my fragment. I tryed both getFragmentManager and getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager. I use latest support libs and build tools versions.

@ArihantJain456 , yes you can proceed.
http://hastebin.com/laquzamofu.sm I havent use hastebin so I can only hope that works I am still looking for the version  _Edit by TheE: I have removed the MySQL configuration from the config file. These must not be visible online for security reasons!_ 
@machi1990 cool!  To run the TCK tests you just need to add `-Dtcks` to your Maven command.  Then just take a look at `tck-suite.xml` and see the comments on the disabled tests to see which ones you should enable once you have the fix.  Let me know if you need anything else, although it should be pretty straightforward to tackle this one (I am guessing anyway since I haven't actually looked into the code that would need changing)
[modlist.txt](https://github.com/Aang23/UndergroundBiomesConstructs/files/3178130/modlist.txt)  I will provide screenshots later.
I figured it out from the error message last night.  "C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/VC/VCVARSALL.BAT" this was an older version of visual studio still operating on my computer and so when the installer went to look for Visual Studio it found this one, and the not the newly installed version which was 14.0   . 
I personally have seen it twice: One on Travis (as linked above) and once on my mac.
Hi, yes this is from the chrome browser if I don't mangle createOfeer SDP at all. I also were thinking about that, and did few more tests, even if I mangle all unused stuff from SDP and leaving only VP8 feedback and RTX, still issue apeers to be the same: https://pastebin.com/VH4byb7H. Only after i remove <payload-type xmlns="urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:rtp:1" name="rtx" at all, then it start to pass thru. 
Hi,  Turns out it was an eclipse bug as I uninstalled clean sheet and Eclipse still had the issue. Its actually an Eclipse feature which colours uncommitted changes in black text. To solve this I followed the instructions on comment 28: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=430741#c28   Thanks

We're using the HikariCP Play Plugin, which uses HikariCP 2.0.1.  My configuration is in Play format, but I think it will make sense.  ``` # Partitions as defined in the Play pooling plugin aren't used, # but are emulated by assuming a single partition/pool in the # updated Plugin. db.default.partitionCount=1 db.default.minConnectionsPerPartition=5 db.default.maxConnectionsPerPartition=50 # How long when trying to get a connection before we error out? db.default.connectionTimeout=7s # Throw away regardless of use after this time db.default.maxConnectionAge=120s # Ensure the newly created connection is valid before using it db.default.initSQL="SELECT 1" ```  I'm not sure what Codahale metrics are, so I'm guessing I'm not using them. 
@hayatbayramolsa Cause I like Kotlin more than Java ;)

i tried again and looks like it only happens when i swap the head with an existing tool.  In my case i started with an iron pickaxe head, made a pickaxe with it and then later swapped it with an agate head, i also double checked and it also happened with the second pickaxe.
@KostyaSha sure, within a day. 
Yes, both. It's using lucene 7.2.1 and handles the updating of the index fields. For every update index call i try to fetch the already indexed document from lucene and than add the new field to it. For that, i have to store (not only analyse and index) the fields into lucene. Creation of the document field will be with `Field contentField = new TextField(field, text, **Field.Store.YES**);`  The main issue is with `indexWriter.updateDocument(new Term(CONTENT_ID, jsonId), document);` because updateDocument will by first delete all documents containing the term and then adding the new one. (See lucene javadoc on updateDocument.) BTW.: i like nitrite very much...
Lovecraft.ro.Lt .3.
As i said about the plugins, It does not matter what for plugins are on the server. With an Fresh config where **only** the force login is turned off it workes fine. But after i also change other things to false the plugin decide to be annoying.   Servert version: Spigot 1.12.2  But sure. If you still wnna know the plugin list: https://pastebin.com/imfpuY6r  And so i tested it now. Even if you only have AuthMe and Protocolib, You have still the same issue.
Tested with NB0801 from today 
i'm using the 'modern' theme with 'Monokai' as the editor theme  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6893043/39042438-b8d8c674-4482-11e8-9f0e-a5277ce00b0b.png) 
Sure!  The command /minecraft:gamemode spectator has the same behaviour: The user falls into the void. It seems, there's no difference between the minecraft native command and the EssentialsX one, over this issue.  Furthermore, I have noticed that this bug seems to appear and disappear per player with no reason, the day I opened this ticket, Utrerano (_one of the users with "Moderador" rank that suffers this_) suffered this problem, and, for example, this morning he didn't experience it on the main world (worldcraft), but on the SkyBlock one. So I asked another player with "Moderador" rank, SancaVIP, to test it. He experienced it on the main world and on the Skyblock one as well. So I suspect it **may** be a permission-related / world-related conflict. I've uploaded the personal permissions of this players:  Utrerano's permissions: https://gist.github.com/MetalGearDaner/0778d4d4f70c05b5d6d5adf341deda2a SancaVIP's permissions: https://gist.github.com/MetalGearDaner/d367c30258d6cb31eb507d85e51eee7d  This is the list of user-accessible worlds: - worldcraft - worldcraft_nether - worldcraft_the_end - recursos - ASkyBlock - ASkyBlock_nether  Thanks for the help! :)
I run Wikivoyage offline, version 1.3, downloaded from FDroid. I forgot to mention that I removed some Google applications (maps, mail and 2~3 others), if there is a link.  Thanks for your work!

Thank you very much for your response. I installed the FROST Server before this commit and hence, was facing the issue. This issue is OK to be closed.  Just a basic beginner question, is there any way I can upgrade to the latest FROST Server without losing my data in the database? Any link or reference where I can learn that? As I mentioned, I used Docker (https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) for installing and running the FROST Server. I just want to upgrade the FROST keeping the same database.  Many thanks!

Seems to have fixed the problem using 1.1.4.RELEASE 
Indeed this is  NDK r14 and indeed aarch64 is the problem. Is it an issue with the NDK or bazel?
of course. Do you know a good tutorial to do so? I do not generate a adb log ever, is it easy?
https://rule34.paheal.net/post/list/Polyle/1 I am also using the latest version I think
Maybe I should not use the words "Hot Deployment". The application is a Swing GUI application and not a Web project.  We are frequently using the "Apply Code Changes" feature in NetBeans to load classes into a running application. This saves time because it takes a long time to start the application and to load needed data.   So I was wondering if this is possible (maybe I am missing something) or if this feature is planned for the future. 
I'll try the reset.  If that doesn't work, I'll see what info I can gather for you.

Issue: Sunforger does not work properly - Unable to target some spells, such as Tithe to cast from the library. - Unable to target spells such as Lightning Helix or Warleader's Helix resulting in fizzled spells.
I honestly have no idea, because I don't have any other mods installed that have different dimensions.

It's been affecting it since the version before the one now on F-Droid. 
Firefox Nightly 74.0a1 (2020-01-13) (64-bit)
I have tested with the latested, however I haven't reset my config as the server is in production right now, so resetting the config would require some downtime 
I can confirm this is fixed on the latest snapshot build. Thanks!
Yes, on my develop system I used this statements in `c3p0.properties` file but only with `c3p0.unreturnedConnectionTimeout` with value `800` instead of `32768`. The defined stacktrace `c3p0.debugUnreturnedConnectionStackTraces=true` was never be shown or logged in any log file.  
It's a Clojure project, using Pedestal (a web library).  The source is [here](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/master/service/bench/io/pedestal/niotooling/service.clj).  It seems like the NPE is being triggered at the first logging call (within Pedestal or JBoss itself), since the given application doesn't explicitly log at all.  The project file (pom) looks like this:  ``` clojure (defproject niotooling "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"   :description "FIXME: write description"   :url "http://example.com/FIXME"   :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"             :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}   :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]                  [io.pedestal/pedestal.service "0.3.2-SNAPSHOT" :exclusions [[com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core]]]                  [com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core "2.3.2"]                   ;; Remove this line and uncomment the next line to                  ;; use Tomcat instead of Jetty:                  [io.pedestal/pedestal.jetty "0.3.2-SNAPSHOT"]                  [io.pedestal/pedestal.immutant "0.3.2-SNAPSHOT"]                  ;; [io.pedestal/pedestal.tomcat "0.3.2-SNAPSHOT"]                   [ch.qos.logback/logback-classic "1.1.2" :exclusions [org.slf4j/slf4j-api]]                  [net.openhft/chronicle-logger-logback "1.0.2"]                  [org.slf4j/jul-to-slf4j "1.7.7"]                  [org.slf4j/jcl-over-slf4j "1.7.7"]                  [org.slf4j/log4j-over-slf4j "1.7.7"]                  [com.ning/async-http-client "1.8.13"]                  [clj-http "1.0.0"]]   :min-lein-version "2.0.0"   :resource-paths ["config", "resources"]   :profiles {:dev {:aliases {"run-dev" ["trampoline" "run" "-m" "niotooling.server/run-dev"]}                    :dependencies [[io.pedestal/pedestal.service-tools "0.3.2-SNAPSHOT" :exclusions [[org.clojure/java.classpath]]]]}}   :global-vars  {*warn-on-reflection* true                  *assert* true}   :pedantic? :abort   :main ^{:skip-aot true} niotooling.server) ```  `immutant` above is JBoss (packaged up with a Clojure API). 
I did some tests and seems its works correctly. Thanks

That was fast, thank you. It does not crash any longer.

i saw the commit but thought that didn't apply because `ENUM$VALUES` was not being accessed.  for now excluding one thing leads to another exception and so forth. im using [this apk](https://apkpure.com/grindr-gay-chat-meet-date/com.grindrapp.android) version [3.0.8](https://apkpure.com/grindr-gay-chat-meet-date/com.grindrapp.android/download?from=details%2Fversion&fid=c%2FAPK%2F3056%2F0353e63a57aaa5a2&version_code=14016) (because latest is multi-dex). i'm processing the packages of interest only `-it '^Lcom/grindrapp/'`.
Sure.   `BanManager/config.yml - onlineMode: false` `/server.properties - online-mode=false`  It also may be possible because I'm using dev build of EssentialsX, I'm using this right now https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX/792/

Thanks for the quick response.  The thing is I love muCommander, and trying to make it fit my needs.  Where is the Jira page? Clicking "Report a bug" from muCommander (nightly build) leads to [this broken page](http://www.mucommander.com/bugs/) which redirects to the broken trac subdomain.  I encountered several issues, not sure if bugs or misuse on my part, like: - I was unable to make anything in commands.xml work. For example I tried making F4 open Sublime Text as editor with many variations on this line `<command alias="edit" value="C:\Program\ Files\Sublime\ Text\ 2\sublime_text.exe $f" type="system"/>` - On my Windows machine, right clicking a file has "Open With" which is always grayed out. Wanted to know how to add commands to this submenu - SFTP does not work for me. Using a passphrase protected private key. I am easily able to login using another client (WinSCP) but with muCommander I get invalid credentials. - Wanted to read a little more about commands.xml in order to add more commands to it (since muCommander suppresses the native Windows right click menu) - for example, wanted to add `Ctrl+Shift+V = send to VirusTotal`, and `Ctrl+D = Dos Prompt Here` - Wanted to suggest to add a "Cut" operation on a file in addition to copy and move - Wanted to suggest a preferences setting to suppress the Move dialog (always move to the other panel). - Wanted to suggest a "Duplicate File" operation, or even better, simply allow `Ctrl+C then Ctrl+V` and paste the file as `Original Name - Copy` or `Original Name (1)` or similar. Right now, copy-then-paste results in an error dialog.  And some more...   Footnote:   For now, I have solved the hotkeys / commands.xml problems I have above by simply writing a AutoHotkey script that overrides the commands I want - so F4 sends Alt+Shift+C to muCommander to copy the selected file path, and then I handle it in AutoHotkey. 
ok, there is no point to do this...

Just a first hypothesis of what the cause might. Could very well be something else, as I haven't looked into it closely, yet.  
Looks like it's a (possibly windows-specific) chrome bug: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/sM6TTZDZNh0  I reported as well.  Guess no action necessary from us :)
@boaks I don't think I need to check the alert message after the exception has been serialized, so for me it won't be needed. But maybe others want to check the alert message even after it has been serialized. Is there any reason not to serialize the alert message as well?
Yes. Configuration is  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3930671/70162718-66a66680-16be-11ea-9349-ff7dc0b0fbac.png)    But opening a sql editor shows ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3930671/70162783-89387f80-16be-11ea-80e3-b305d900c3e1.png) 
Thanks for investigating. This is the ferry http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/3500103  Right now I cannot see any issues with the tags of the ferry. The only interesting part is the TMC.   
> Please try the latest build from http://builds.jabref.org/clean-regedit.  Thanks Stefan. I tested this version and this bug is fixed. BUT there is a regression: when installing as admin for all users of the PC, the registry entry HKLM\Software\JabRef is no longer there. But this is what I need, see my initial post. 
It looks as if the problem comes from a missing port in the defaultZone configuration. This was my configuration :   ``` yml eureka:   instance:     preferIpAddress: true   client:     serviceUrl:       defaultZone: http://172.17.0.2/eureka/ ```  when I added the port number to defaultZone the problem disappeared :   ``` yml eureka:   instance:     preferIpAddress: true   client:     serviceUrl:       defaultZone: http://172.17.0.2:80/eureka/ ```  I have a repro project here : https://github.com/snussbaumer/spring-cloud-netflix-issue-840  Without the port, the url is changed to http://172.17.0.2:-1/eureka, and later in `ApacheHttpClient4Handler.getHost` : request.getURI().getHost() returns null, it looks as if there is some parsing error somewhere, because the URI host is null, but the authority is OK and contains "172.17.0.2:-1"  I have a workaround, so I'm allright now, but I think if would be nice if this was corrected or documented somewhere. 
OK so i basically reinstalled vscode i think. It wanted to update then it did and i had to reinstall all extensions. So after I reinstalled the jdt.ls extension, this worked as you describe.  I think I might have pegged the v0.4.0 tag. Confirmed that with latest master and v0.6.0, it works.  Do you think using the tags is the right approach ? We're trying to pick a stable release as we head towards landing in ycmd.   I know there's a lot of movement on the project, so I think we can track master pretty closely if you recommend that instead. We're considering marking java support as "experimental" for the first 5-6 months or so.  Closing this as it is clearly fixed in later version. Sorry for the noise.
when  reconnected yes
Thanks for the quick response guys.

The right-click exclude from.., Proxy is being done from the Sites tree.  They vanish from the sites tree after I do this.
@AndyScherzinger Yeah, apparently I did. In instant-upload settings there's a "Camera"-entry and a "DCIM"-entry, and the "DCIM"-one is at the bottom of the list and, for some reason, it seems to have been turned back on even though I have disabled it already ages ago, and I hadn't noticed.  Chuck this issue in the "Should look harder before submitting issues" - bin.

I'm sorry, it was not because of the world change.  As you can see in my logs http://pastebin.com/eT2dgqkL I use "" in my title-message for _Adventuremap "The Dropper"_. It seems like that's the reason for my exception.
https://gist.github.com/MrSkittlesROTR/9f96fb3ea24fa5aa4554ed9e5572bfc3 on placing a clay soldier it just instantly disconnects all players on, cant rejoin the server until its restarted and the mod is taken out. No disconnect reason logged in the server logs and our player data is saved threw nucleus which just stores the uuid, name, logoff cords and effects on player at the time. 
I know that they haven't been moved, but for further information I have to ask the player for whom I reported it.  Another thing I know. In this case it has been only two blocks and can't be the same issue but: If you have two separated crates in the b-team modpack and you connect them together you run into the same issue. This should help to reproduce it. But in how it happend in this case with only 2 blocks I have no idea. 
Version 9.0.3 (11601.4.4) 
Since there most likely won't be visitors on kafdrop and in our case it is not even connected to the internet I guess no. But in general if you run a website and you use the link then you cannot guarantee that Google is not collecting visitors data and therefor you have to embed the fonts, so yes.
I have a warning:  ``` Reference table 39104 not found An exception stack trace is not available. ``` 
@vsch Surprisingly, I am now unable to reproduce this issue. I do not know what state was my IDE in that this occurred. And it has occurred multiple times. But this time I am not able to reproduce it. If I am able to then I will share the file with you.   Meanwhile, if you deem OK then please go ahead and close this bug or I can do it. Let me know what you want to do. 
@ronblum After spending some more time on this, I noticed the following more straightforward example better reflects on the issue. Please go through the following steps to reproduce the issue:  - Run the following code:  ``` testData = data.frame(logicalVar = sample(c(T,F), size = 10, replace = T), doubleVars = matrix(rnorm(500), 10)) View(testData) ``` It will create a data frame where the type of the first column is logical, and the type of the remaining columns is double.  - Adjust indices of columns to see only Columns 50-51 (A total of two columns). Then apply "Filter". You will notice that the type of Column 50 (the first column in the new two-column display) will be Logical, while it should be double.

It appears this is works in build 16.  Should we close this issue or should I reload build 15 on BBB and try to reproduce the problem?
I can try to recreate this. Unfortunately it happened on that device with Samsung's Android rom before I flashed Lineage OS on it for testing. Over weekend I'll try it on a few others and if not then next week try to reinstall samsung and run it again. 
@E3V3A Neighbour cells info works. Network Information is displayed in Device Details under SIM Information. Moreover apps like Netmonster display this info, no problem with RIL. 
fresco 0.5.0. No modifications.

I use non-aoe attacks when this happens, but it seem your right about the calling for help thing, wich i know existed but felt weird in the last version, but it's mostly due to 1: There are no way to tell if the other pokemon are targeting me like a "A wild ??? appeared" text (it feel like the other one attack me with no reason) and 2: My active pokemobs target ANOTHER pokemob than the one i was fighting, so if i attack magikarp A, and magikarp B come to help, my pokemob will sometimes target B instead of A, and it's even worse when there are more magikarp, so maybe the problem comes from the fact that there need a way to know if other pokemob are targeting me + my pokemobs need to attack the one i am targeting (it would be even better if i can target another pokemob while in battle with another one, like attacking magikarp A then using a move on B then going back to A for example, i think it worked at some point but dont anymore)
sure, I'll test it later today and provide an update on the results.  Thanks! -Steve
We upgraded from tcwebhooks 0.9.29.63. We're running TeamCity 9.1.1, on Windows 2008 R2. 
There are no proxies or other stuff that could drop the connection.  Is it correct to have TX and NOTX connections in the same pool? Should I create separate pools? 
Yes I am using Citizens2 and ShopKeepers. The error only started happening when I updated StackMob.  I understand that its not caused by StackMob, however, the error is. Hence, It would be good idea to handle it. I made a PR check it out let me know if its ok 🙂 #78 
@gashcrumb I have this trace from the Google Developer Tools console - https://gist.github.com/honghuac/6a8b87646100f2da3e377967d7d9fb1b  It does not seem to indicate anything useful, I think.
I agree! I could produce a little screencast. Would be nice to have a website for weblounge release notes... 
Hi @max-dev - thanks for looking into this. We finally realized the problem was our `@JsonIgnore` annotations! We didn't want our regular rest API including the complete referenced object, so we added that annotation. Finally we realized this was probably interfering with the reference!  Can you point me to the code you use to replace the referenced object in the JSON serialization with just the URL? I would like to apply something like that to our REST API as well. 
I found out what the problem was. It was on my side I had the server in peaceful mode. Sorry
Ok, I will switch to Waterfall tomorrow. Please give me a few days to observe, thank you
I just tried putting a jabba barrel under it and nothing happens. Also a chest cant be placed underneath since it then cant open because of full block above it. 
Yes perfectly. I have deleted the usage data even if I never used AOSP mode and the entry still there.   
Sorry， there is no unit tests。 just  debug code find it。 case 1 occurred in dataset is very small. case 2 occurred in  NaiveKMeans as base clusterer  in DivisiveGlobalClusterer
I think in tests we could check correctness of toString() return value and a request URL of the json() method. 
Many of the calls to `increaseStoredEnergyUnits` that I can see will all check the EU capacity, and only increase by the amount it can hold. The other ones are for things like the Magic Energy Absorber, which is probably fine because it eats an enchantment or something and produces a ton of energy all at once.
Yes, that's the point.   Many tools including check_jmx4perl (Nagios check using Jolokia) and j4psh (command line shell for Jolokia) use the encoded form for accessing the agent (and in fact plain Jetty works perfectly since it uses `org.eclipse.jetty.http.HttpURI#getDecodedPath()` for decoding the pathInfo).  
1. Using latest commit on branch master. 2. Commit f2f6bdd3 says: "Full IN+OUT: Tank, Reservoir, XP Obelisk, Soul Binder". Since "IN" is not working, I think it's better to mention it regardless of the reservoir common usage. 3. The multiblock is formed correctly (hard to do it wrong since the visual changes when it's complete). I have tried all 3 possible setups: 2x2x1, 2x1x2, 1x2x2. Same issue on all. 
The only way to change my name that I know of is going to Mojang's website and I only did that once. My name was not Gumball when I created my Minecraft account a long time ago. I changed it to Gumball a few months ago and never touched it again. Is this the only way to get this error? Because if it is, then I think there's a bug. 
No upgrades, I have seen it in three machines, have not tried more.
I think it doesn't exist. But the program shouldn't crash anyway ... 
I'd guess when you have no credentials at all (from a clean installation for example). 
Unsure. Just tried it and it worked.  
No 
Sorry, let me rephrase that. That line, which I referenced, is not able to find the `spring.jmx.default-domain: myDomain` property in my bootstrap.yml.  Just did a quick re-check, and it's not really a snakeYaml issue, it's that in the `environment.getProperty("spring.jmx.default-domain.")`, the name has an extra dot at the end.  The property is found if I use `environment.getProperty("spring.jmx.default-domain")`
app:items="@{MyModel.items}  public ObservableList<'Object'> getItems() 
This has fixed the issue @md678685  https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/commit/6baa472567a13c9ce2d7ef99e7d5722e99b1cdb5  If there is still something specific you would like shared from our startup log let me know (I cannot share the full log unfortunately.)
It's definitely a regression. Can't say exactly when it started happening, but it's been at least 2 or 3 months.
I’m playing [All the Mods 3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/all-the-mods-3), and I didn’t get a journal when I first spawned.
This happened on a Sony Z3 running Android 6.0.1 But I don't think it's related to the Android version or the phone.  Note that this is happening only on the first of the month. On the second I've checked and the display was normal.   Anyway this is really just a minor bug. 
I did not see that, I'll do it now thank you. 
Sorry thiz issue is caused because of my gallery app. Just a Zooming . 
Yeah, I'll file it over there too.

I checked strings of text to make sure that threading was not the issue.  I could not find them anywhere on my Gmail account.  Installed 1.0.11.   Started to send messages to contacts just to get a bunch of received SMS going.  After 10 minutes, I'm not seeing any auto back ups hitting Gmail (checking Gmail, don't know how to see the status on the phone).  I did a manual backup.  Checked Gmail and only sent SMS are seen.  None of the received ones were found (tried doing a search again just to make sure it was not threading).    By the way, does SMS Backup+ save a rotating log file anywhere on the phone? 
I was testing a few mods until I discovered it was the mod called "BetterSprinting++MC-1.7.10++v1.1.3.jar" causing the bug; which is kind of weird, considering this mod is to speed the creative flight up to 8 times more
Okay.  Only here I've used the library   ``` java     public static DatePickerDialog buildDatePickerDialog(Context context, final TextView             textView, int color) {            Calendar now = Calendar.getInstance();            DatePickerDialog dialog = DatePickerDialog                 .newInstance((DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener) context,                         now.get(Calendar.YEAR),                         now.get(Calendar.MONTH),                         now.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH));            dialog.setOnDateSetListener(new DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener() {                @Override                public void onDateSet(DatePickerDialog datePickerDialog, int year, int month, int                     date) {                    textView.setText(parseDate(date + "/" + (month + 1) + "/" + year));                }            });       //  dialog.setAccentColor(context.getResources().getColor(color));            return dialog;    } ```  I compile this version   ``` java      compile 'com.wdullaer:materialdatetimepicker:1.4.1' ```  I get this result on my screen. <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8149827/10185538/8689f3b4-6762-11e5-8e25-10b5ec3fad24.png" width="200"> As you can see Titles are visible. Everything is fine.   But later I wanted the multiple theme support, I can change accent color. I used this version.  ``` java       compile 'com.wdullaer:materialdatetimepicker:1.5.2'  ```  And the titles were gone. Result is shown below. <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8149827/10185556/ca5a9ce2-6762-11e5-8543-21fe03d8db13.png" width="200">  I dont know why this is effecting my ViewPager.

Thanks, that's a compelling argument you presented :) As for use case, I thought about analyzing CI build logs, but come to think of it if an operation is abnormally slow then that that'll show up on the second-precision too.
I see with VisualVM: the JVM old generation grows indefinitely with 'char[]' data. I'm sure! 
Just open a new cnd file, create one node type, add a property name, open a bracket for property type, ctrl-space for completion and there you got the exception in Event Log  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6814629/20830011/fc10518c-b87e-11e6-96b8-44dc3ef2c775.png) 
Huh... yeah, in the seed that Arvis had the Yewfelle, Sigurd also has the blood for it. Weird.  Same with the seed that Andre had no holy blood, but in that seed Arvis had a valid holy weapon.
yes 
The grid is a RecyclerView with a GridLayoutManager. I don't exactly remove the view, I merely hide it by animating the alpha of the RelativeLayout (that has the BlurView inside) to 0 and then setting the layout's visibility to gone.  
i just replicated the bug as described. and yes, it involved the return button the first time it happened. 
I believe so, I have the `TravellersBackpack-1.12.2-0.1.8a` file installed. I also have the latest versions of Gravity Gun, Portal Gun, and iChun Util.
Hello Stephane,  First of all, I would like to apologize for the late answer but I was a bit away from work :-)  Finally, I found where does this issue come from... And I am quite embarrassed because the problem was totally related to my fragments lifecycle and not to RS.  Indeed, on orientation change I misunderstood how Android worked and I was recreating my fragments whereas Android was already taking care of it. That's explained why everything was duplicated...  So, thanks for shedding some light on my issue and I feel deeply sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. 
@gkrasnow: Yes, it is releated to this issue. Though the fix above still doesn't fix all issues... 
@KnightMiner Singleplayer.  @TheQuadShot What I meant was that when a building block for the smeltery is placed in the smeltery multi-block while it is currently smelting items, the smeltery will then drop the items it is currently smelting in front of the controller. It dropped a set of real items and phantom items. For example, if it is currently smelting an iron ore block, placing a smeltery block in the smeltery causes the smeltery to drop the iron ore block, along with another one which is a phantom item.
Yeah, I didn't realize that you updated, but checked after I made the bug report, updated, and it did solve the problem, so I apologize for wasting your time, but thank you for fixing the problem and replying back to me :)  On Fri, Jun 9, 2017 at 5:50 PM, Sam Bassett <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > What version of cyclic are you using?

 In 1.14, config files are now saved per-world. To find the config for this mod go to your .minecraft folder (if using Windows, go to %appdata% to get there). Click on "saves", select the name of the world, and go into "serverconfig". There you will find a file named "golems-server.toml" which is the config file for this mod. Hope that helps

No it isn't, this is the simple second hard disk in the system. I'll try to configure docker manually, but it seems, that this won't help. 
yeah this is fixed 
Tried to reproduce in 7.0.0 and was not able to.
I'm new to this bug-reporting stuff, sorry for making it harder. I'll try and behave 0:)

sorry for the raging :P i tried to figure this out the whole day, bare with me. :)  yeah, so disabling achievements fixed the startup crash, however it produced a crash while trying to view the creative tab, i can't tell if a NEI search would let it crash.   let me test that version real quick.  
I am using Lg G6, do you thing that it is device related issue? I will check it tomorrow on other devices. Thanks for issue link, I will check it.
It seemed to work before we introdcued the own log to be included in the friends log. But I guess this new feature is not the culprit, but the parallel loading of it which was introduced shortafter. I think this would fit the explanation by @Bananeweizen  
I'm sorry, didn't get you. What did you mean? Expert mode is enabled in XPrivacy. SMS category in the app has no usage data.  
Hi @yaohaizh,  Please refer to [this document](https://docs.gauge.org/latest/installation.html#installation) for `Gauge` installation. In order to setup [Gauge java](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-java) with [Gauge VsCode extension ](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-vscode)we will have to build package from there respective branch `vscode_java_debug_support` as they are not released yet.  How about, if I build those packages and give them to you. Otherwise, I can explain how to build them locally.

Updated. MultiMC still displays it as .029.2 despite literally dragging 0.29.3 in. Drill breaks all the bedrock now instead of missing a corner. Still occasionally digs really slow even when spun to full speed, when otherwise it would cut through the rock like butter.

Hi guys,  just to let you know, perhaps it's related.  I got a similar problem but now using the quarkus-mailer.  In my properties file when I have ` quarkus.mailer.port=${MAIL_PORT}` the following exception is thrown:  ` email    | 13:27:52,628 ERROR [io.qua.dev.DevModeMain] Failed to start quarkus: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "${MAIL_PORT}" email    |     at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65) email    |     at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:569) email    |     at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:615) email    |     at io.smallrye.config.Converters.lambda$static$18960f11$1(Converters.java:75) email    |     at io.smallrye.config.SmallRyeConfig.convert(SmallRyeConfig.java:133) email    |     at io.smallrye.config.SmallRyeConfig.getOptionalValue(SmallRyeConfig.java:98) email    |     at io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ConfigUtils.getOptionalValue(ConfigUtils.java:92) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.configuration.ObjectConfigType.acceptConfigurationValueIntoGroup(ObjectConfigType.java:94) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.configuration.GroupConfigType.acceptConfigurationValueIntoLeaf(GroupConfigType.java:238) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.configuration.ObjectConfigType.acceptConfigurationValue(ObjectConfigType.java:76) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.configuration.ConfigDefinition.loadConfiguration(ConfigDefinition.java:492) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.ExtensionLoader.loadStepsFrom(ExtensionLoader.java:219) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.ExtensionLoader.loadStepsFrom(ExtensionLoader.java:137) email    |     at io.quarkus.deployment.QuarkusAugmentor.run(QuarkusAugmentor.java:75) email    |     at io.quarkus.runner.RuntimeRunner.run(RuntimeRunner.java:107) email    |     at io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain.doStart(DevModeMain.java:180) email    |     at io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain.start(DevModeMain.java:94) email    |     at io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain.main(DevModeMain.java:66) ` 
I wholeheartedly agree that using using Oracle databases (at least from Java) is best avoided.  However, I've run my tests with JDBI from HEAD against an Oracle database and everything looks good!

I haven't tried with Tomcat since other requirements require me to use Jetty.  I guess there are three sub points here I'd like answers to.  (1) Validation that my example is largely correct.  Under normal circumstances one should expect to use the code for embedded cases involving Jetty, etc.  And it should just work, right?  And choosing between WebSocket and Comet async strategy, etc is fine the way I have it (?)  (2) An explanation as to why the param init values seem to have no noticeable affect on runtime behaviour (?)  (3) Looking at some previous posts, jfarcand suggested that this problem might stem from not implementing WebSocketEventListener, or the init parameters are incomplete (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/atmosphere-framework/n7X4L67CPYw/w2A51m_fHlYJ).  But at other times the wiki is crystal clear (https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/onDisconnect-tricks) that disconnect is not supported on Jetty.  I'd just like to get a conclusive word one way or another on the subject, and know about any possible work arounds for Jetty in the event he feature is not supported.  Certainly from the client perspective, the clients get properly notified when the server shuts down since the curl (the command I use to test the atmosphere server process) properly shut down once the server process is killed.  Thanks! c 
I'll try and come with one but basically any code that's not compilable should do it:  ``` go package main  func main() {     println("demo) } ```  I'll test this soon.

1. I have seen this with two alerts, and their alert conditions were: - "Alert is triggered when there is more than one message in the last 6 minutes. Grace period: 60 minutes. Not including any messages in alert notification. Configured to repeat notifications."  This alert should have fired off after restarting it, but never did.   - "Alert is triggered when there is less than one message in the last 10 minutes. Grace period: 60 minutes. Not including any messages in alert notification. Configured to repeat notifications."  For this alert I made it more sensitive by changing the threshold to "less than 1111 messages", then it should have fired off straight away. It did not fire off until half an hour later.  2. I haven't found a reliable way to make the alert condition work again. My current workaround is to create an entire new stream, alert, and notification from scratch with the exact same configuration as the old one - and those new ones work.  3. I am not sure. The "unresolved alerts" list doesn't make sense to me - I can see a couple of alert in there listed as "still ongoing" when I know the corresponding stream does not have any messages anymore. May be a problem unto itself. 
Hi,  for the dictionary variable the following produces this error:  `Create Suite Dict Var     [Arguments]    ${var_name}    &{kwargs}     ${var_name}=    Get Variable Value    ${${var_name}}    ${var_name}     Set Suite Variable    &{${var_name}}    &{kwargs}`  produces: Invalid variable syntax '&{${var_name}}'	  For the list case:  `Path "${path}" XML "${file}" Matches "${table}"     @{table}=    Get Variable Value    @{${table}}    @{table}`  produces: Invalid variable syntax '@{${table}}'	
What would be the best way to change the log level?
I don't think it's a good idea to alter the index name automatically (e.g. to lower-case it), as it may be quite surprising to the user. Could you perhaps create the index upon first arrival of a source record from a given topic? Then you'd automatically apply whatever name transformations have been configured.  If that's not viable, I'd question the decision to deprecate the old mapping option and suggest to un-deprecate it, as it can safely be applied eagerly to create the index(es) as well as when handling individual source records.

I will capture the events of a day and report.
@Tora-B Apologies, first time using github for this purpose. The issue is that after the initial death loop, the server was attempting to synchronize hundreds of times a second with that player, even after a full reboot, and managing to get the player out of the Dimension. This persisted from the time the player logged in after a server reboot, until a crash or hard Kill command. The server, as a result, was hitting upwards of 200% CPU usage, making it unplayable for all other players.   @Electroblob77 I'm afraid the log was nothing but thousands upon thousands of lines of "[Server] Server thread/INFO [ebwizardry]: Synchronising spell emitters for Playername" with no variation. I honestly wish I had more information for you.   A solution was found, however much less than ideal, in deleting the player's playerdata from the server.
WIN7(X64)  and Windows server 2012，I use SystemInfoTest to track the problem, I want to get system time by  getSystemUptime，but majorVersion result is 0, so  the code will execute the following logic else {             // 32 bit rolls over at ~ 49 days             return Kernel32.INSTANCE.GetTickCount() / 1000L;

Yes, that's right, we initially discovered the issue in a setup with HAProxy, but we are able to reproduce it easily with just a standalone Jetty serving a static page and a remote browser (Chrome or Firefox).  For example accessing Jetty from a smartphone connected to the local WiFi.  As I explained in the mailing list, we can reproduce it also with JDK 1.8.0_72 and ALPN 8.1.7.v20160121.  I attach a log running Jetty with `--module=logging -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.http2.LEVEL=DEBUG`  The page load that fails (the second in the log I think) starts at 2016-02-29 19:20:13.985  In this case the visible symptoms were that page load halted while loading an image, and after many seconds page load finished leaving one of the images with the broken image icon in the display.

Thanks for this amazing fast response. I've just tried using the newly created `spring-data-webflux` from PR #938. My WebFlux application runs successfully but it seems that deserialization is broken for non entity view types when using `bodyToMono`. The deserialization done with all fields assigned to null.

I am using Orientdb-Enterprise 2.2.4.  
Today, the test is success passed on CI (https://ci.codenvycorp.com/view/qa-nightly/job/che-integration-tests-multiuser-master-ocp-all-tests/96/Selenium_20tests_20report/failsafe-report.html#org.eclipse.che.selenium.languageserverJsonFileEditingTest). Hence the bug is fixed.
Its most likely some kind of firewall, however I wouldnt know what plugin would cause it. I've gone trough the plugin list and asked to disable all the ones that I tought might change something about placing blocks but didnt come up with annything.
To clarify. The quaternion `q` I get above is: `(0.5207592020221827, -0.8259585968557868, 0.0, 0.21587554236)`. Also the `vExpected` I get above is: `(-0.22483835035103564, -0.4576197070184389, -0.8602510796039625)`.  I should not have called it `vExpected`, but `vResulted`. The expected value is actually `v`. Also there is a typo in the type of `vExpected` above, it's actually `Vector3` instead of `Vector`.

As stated above, DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable CASCADE; is enough to trigger the error. You however need to put ANY statement or text after this row and see that the parser continues without breaking on the statement.  The comment also contains details of where in the code the error resides. The pull-request also gives indications of where to start looking.
I was running 1.0.7f as I was unaware that you updated it 27h ago, now everything works as intended, I still would love a filter where I can actually enter the mod name though, so you could just take this as a suggestion instead of an issue. 
I'd vote for not closing it, but bringing it down to P2 and removing the release blocker.  It is quite annoying, because this happens during all Java builds with the released Bazel binary. We should make sure to compile zlib using a #define that disables these trace messages.
@leonard84 The original use case was using Grails' testing transformations aka `@TestFor(MyController)`  I found that `@Log` has the same behavior.  Putting that demo test in a grails app and using `@TestFor(..)` instead will reproduce the same results.   The weird part is that the compilation error only happens when you add an `assert` statement within a closure.   The stacktrace that I see when using `@TestFor` is very similar:   ```java /home/user/app/src/test/groovy/app/NimoyIssueSpec.groovy: -1: The current scope already contains a variable of the name

I simplified this a bit too much to get the stack trace, but if you look at the JSON output from calling http://localhost:8080/organizations first with the 1.3.5 then with the 1.4.0 you can see that @XmlTransient is not being honored. Just switch the comments on the spring-boot-version property and parent version in the top-level maven pom.xml.   Here's some SQL to create sample data:  ``` INSERT INTO `sample`.`organizations` (`id`, `name`) VALUES ('a', 'a'); INSERT INTO `sample`.`organizations` (`id`, `name`, `parent_id`) VALUES ('b', 'b', 'a'); INSERT INTO `sample`.`organizations` (`id`, `name`, `parent_id`) VALUES ('c', 'c', 'a'); INSERT INTO `sample`.`organizations` (`id`, `name`, `parent_id`) VALUES ('d', 'd', 'b'); INSERT INTO `sample`.`organizations` (`id`, `name`, `parent_id`) VALUES ('e', 'e', 'c'); ```  [api-sample.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/345103/api-sample.zip)

Threw IllegalArgumentException: " + exceptionNotToThrow.getMessage());         }     } ```  If parsing no longer fails, additional tests on semantics can be provided.
I didn't really understand your post but simply removing the light while drawing those 2 things does the trick. 
@badlogic in XCode (6.3.x) there's no way to see and select the iOS simulator version for running (thanks Apple) — but I also have Xamarin Studio and it can do this. And of course I have installed iOS 7 sims: ![screen shot 2015-04-30 at 12 27 05 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1442206/7410429/6f9eb5e8-ef37-11e4-8c73-10c93e99e0cb.png) 
I am currently running in Eclipse, but I believe this issue would happen in any OSGi container.  If I do something as simple as  ``` Flyway flyway = new Flyway(); flyway.setClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader()); // this tells Flyway to use my Bundle's ClassLoader, as opposed to Flyway's ClassLoader, because my SQL scripts are inside my Bundle, not Flyway's flyway.setDataSource(dataSource); flyway.migrate(); ```  Then Flyway will always fail because of https://github.com/flyway/flyway/blob/43ca80caebd3bd3ee8ddbd78bb4df25df8c66c51/flyway-core/src/main/java/org/flywaydb/core/Flyway.java#L1373 existing:  ``` Caused by: org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException: Unable to obtain inputstream for resource: org/flywaydb/core/internal/version.txt     at org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.scanner.classpath.ClassPathResource.loadAsString(ClassPathResource.java:84)     at org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.VersionPrinter.printVersion(VersionPrinter.java:44)     at org.flywaydb.core.Flyway.execute(Flyway.java:1373)     at org.flywaydb.core.Flyway.migrate(Flyway.java:1006) ```  This is because Flyway is expecting "org/flywaydb/core/internal/version.txt" to exist within the custom ClassLoader.  If I instead have Flyway use its own ClassLoader, then of course Flyway can find "org/flywaydb/core/internal/version.txt" within the Flyway JAR, but it will never find my SQL scripts in a different bundle. 
LOL no worries...I wish I had more information, but I haven't tried it again since that happened.  We've stuck to just the straight Hermitpack installation from Curse with no other mods added to the server.  On my end, I did add WAILA and it's associated mods (WAILA, -harvestability, and WAWLA).  As far as I can tell, we have only vanilla horses.  EnderZoo is part of the pack, but it doesn't add horses.  (I didn't even know there was a mod that added horses...I've seen the cow/pig mod, but that's it.)  I'll see if I can tame a horse I'm not attached to like I was to Bullseye.  She was an awesome horse, and I've setup a small memorial to her in my village that I've taken over.  BTW I love your mod...I seem to find some new toy every day to play with. 
I followed the README.md and set the security.provider list to that shown below in Corretto 11.0.4.11.1 under Ubuntu 18.04 Linux: ``` security.provider.1=com.amazon.corretto.crypto.provider.AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider security.provider.2=sun.security.provider.Sun security.provider.3=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSign security.provider.4=sun.security.ec.SunEC security.provider.5=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider security.provider.6=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE security.provider.7=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider security.provider.8=com.sun.security.sasl.Provider security.provider.9=org.jcp.xml.dsig.internal.dom.XMLDSigRI security.provider.10=sun.security.smartcardio security.provider.11=sun.security.provider.certpath.ldap.JdkLDAP security.provider.12=com.sun.security.sasl.gsskerb.JdkSASL security.provider.13=apple.security.AppleProvider security.provider.14=sun.security.mscapi.SunMSCAPI security.provider.15=sun.security.pkcs11SunPKCS11 ```  I had an issue connecting to a website that only accepted ECDHE key exchanges. The Java app  was not able to connect. It wasn't until I added the following to security.providers (they were the values that were previously there in the java.security file) ``` security.provider.16=SUN security.provider.17=SunRsaSign security.provider.18=SunEC security.provider.19=SunJSSE security.provider.20=SunJCE security.provider.21=SunJGSS security.provider.22=SunSASL security.provider.23=XMLDSig security.provider.24=SunPCSC security.provider.25=JdkLDAP security.provider.26=JdkSASL security.provider.27=SunPKCS11 ```   After the security.provider config was 27 long, the app could then connect via ECDHE.  The verification: ``` if (Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding").getProvider().getName().equals(AmazonCorrettoCryptoProvider.PROVIDER_NAME)) { 	// Successfully installed } ``` was successful whether the security.provider was the recommended 15 or the final 27 that I had. However, I do not know any more if it is using ACCP to connect via ECDHE. 
I have solved using almost the same workflow as in the tutorial.  The issue seems due to the different tasks that I was considering for the DAG generation (org.ietr.preesm.experiment.pimm2srdag.StaticPiMM2SrDAGTask) and for the scheduling (org.ietr.preesm.plugin.mapper.listschedulingfromdag).   Thank you very much for the availability 
Not sure. The fact that they are not valid XML leads to us "not seeing" a big part of the data in the GPX file. I'm not sure if there is any good workaround that we can apply to convert the invalid XML input to something valid, on the fly. 
I'm on Windows 7. But I don't get an error message (also nothing in the error log). It just doesn't open the declaration. 
Well. I'm not completely sure `pyramid` is actually necessary at all, but since we are offering it as a way to build 3D shapes, I would expect they are all treated the same way with respect to their various possibilities. And being textured in the display is one of them. So, yes. Either we remove `pyramid` altogether, or we implement its `textured` display...

The snapshot seems to be working, at least I couldn't get it to crash anymore. I'm not using SpiceList because I actually need to do two-step fetching, first fetch additional info for each list item, then fetch an image, and SpiceList doesn't give me that flexibility, it's useful only for loading images.

my project use mybatis and slf4j. when the slf4j print the log on the ide's console ,the Chinese condition param is showing well. ```log 2019-03-12 00:10:00.012  INFO 32363 --- [scheduling-1] c.y.sz.ytms.task.EnterprisePollTask      : Param:{"enterpriseName":"企业名称","country":"china"}  ``` the "enterpriseName" is readable.  but when I open /logfile endpoint.the log which is showing on browser which dont contains  ``` meta charset="UTF-8" ``` is   2019-03-12 00:10:00.012  INFO 32363 --- [scheduling-1] c.y.sz.ytms.task.EnterprisePollTask      : Param:{"enterpriseName":"浜胯仈缃戠粶","country":"china"}   which the chinese param "enterpriseName" has be corrupted.  By with the charset plugin,I convert /logfile page charset from default encoding to utf8. the Chinese param is readable.   As for sample,just a very simple mybatis-springboot project which used actuator and open /logfile endpoint. 
Oh, I am so sorry, my mistake. The problem was found in py2neo. The neo4j is a helpful and powerful product, thank you for your reply.
1. Start a session with recording on. 2. Close the session, recording quits after 2 minute(or whatever is the set time period) 3. Start  the session again, just after quit recording is send and  before recording docker container is killed. Error occurs because docker container for recording is already up(which is about to die ).  
@eivantsov Thanks for your try. I'll retry this within next weekend. 
Thanks for the quick reply! ... Woops. Turns out, all the changed I made actually do work. The problem seems to be with JEI, as it still shows no change at all. Removing/adding machine recipes isn't recognized by JEI, despite getting registered with the specific machine. That leaves the question open, on what mod's end the mistake lies. Maybe RT has to update the recipe in question in JEI?
@damienmg Florian wants me to ask you if I can just rollback this change.

The date was May 3 2019 ``` //Secondary gun AllowAllAmmo False AddAmmo ArtilleryHEShell ```  And I'll keep it in mind for the future to report bugs separately. In terms of the crash, again, it wasn't I who caught it, my staff reported it to me. I'll eventually go back to check the logs and find the error when it happened and paste it in full. Using the teams command to set despawn timer to 0 (never) fixed the issue.
The issue I have seems to be something totally different from what I initially thought--but there were still errors coming from this skript bizarrely.  The issues I'm having all have to do with using "offline player" and join and leave events. Here is the message I am receiving that crashes skript: "An error happened when trying to enably resolving offline players, so the feature has been turned off." 
@jiazhai Yeah, it seems to have some sort of issues about DNS but still can't fix by using various internet providers or proxies. anyway the command `mvn package` with option `-DskipTests` works and fixed the building failures. Thanks
It does, but even when I do a 10 x 10 to do a single tree the problem remains, and that was between 2 different drones, but it was after the first drone tried with the big area, as in 10 mins apart. Maybe the problem persists?   
> Do you have multiple PDF printers? Because you specify two different names in the configs, so it could be an issue of incorrect density on the second printer.

Hello,   We suggest to rely on the client version that can be defined in the Service class. Then we change the methods in TypeUtils (toEdm, toEdmDateTime) to pass the version as parameter, and finally introduce some logic to choose the date format based on the version (with the adding of the new format)  If you're fine with this solution we can submit it, we just wanted to check with you first as we're new to this framework, we wanted to be sure we got it right.   Cheers Antoine 
@mahikaw Sure! Just one thing to point out if the problem was in the data itself it would always give me a NullPointerException right? But I don't face the exception now. Its weird. I guess it is mostly a network related problem. Do check it out.
Hi, sorry for the delay.  Clicking true or false on the types I mentioned don't work all the time, but I haven't been able to determine the pattern in which they work or don't work. Additionally, I have noticed these errors in console:  [SEVERE] Could not pass event InventoryClickEvent to EchoPet v2.0.5 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -999   [SEVERE] Could not pass event CreatureSpawnEvent to Prism v1.6.3 java.lang.ClassCastException: com.github.dsh105.echopet.entity.pet.CraftPet cannot be cast to org.bukkit.entity.Sheep  I am running build #2020.  Thanks. 
We have a `RestTemplate` correctly configured for the app and want to use the other benefits of `TestRestTemplate` in tests.  I expect mutation methods, such as `addAuthentication`, to change it, but not a constructor.  If `RestTemplate` was immutable, the constructor couldn't alter it.  With accepting only `RestTemplateBuilder` instances, will it set objects on the builder only when null or the default, or always?  We need ability to specify something and not have it replaced (an unexpected replacement consumes time determining why something isn't working).  Since `RestTemplate` is mutable, a current workaround is to set it again afterwards. 
Yesterday it worked. 
The issue still happen for this version. I don't think sample data will cause this issue.  The issue is most likely related to concurrency.   you can try to run the following query with 50 or 100 times in concurrently. I'm sure you will have this issue.    BEGIN  LET user = INSERT INTO user SET about = "test"  COMMIT  RETURN $user 
`UPDATE company SET name = 'COOL' WHERE record# = 1234567` `/`  This statement failed. If I'm replacing the '/' by a ';', it's working as expected.

Oh. Maybe that's why it didn't work. I'll have to check it again. Let's hope it's a false positive!
> Maybe we should encourage any project that uses the framework to create their own context and therefor their own codec -> type mappings  This is an interesting concept. I think we should probably keep a default mapping, but perhaps add better documentation around customization so that a developer could do that trivially if the default doesn't satisfy their use-case?   I'm thinking that the change proposed by this ticket will allow us to support all use-cases though, although we'll know more once I finish the CCP codecs.

Yes, I have that in my settings.gradle file 
No, the DPI is default, but if i change size of interface elements in Settings/Display, problem will be resolved. On screen I show situation, when I have default settings.
It fixes it. And yes there was a trailing line.  Thank you very much !  Out of curiosity, how did you get that:  ``` 0x000000cc: 0d 0a 0d 0a 0a 4f 4b                         ^^ ```
I have only tested a couple of videos (as not all videos crash), but when using FFMPEG.exe direct it does not crash, it just cannot process the videos.  The behavior is strange, some corrupt videos will crash the JavaCV straight away, others crash when we use multiple videos/instances but do not crash if we load them as a single file.  It seems that when we pass the video and time to extract the frame from, it is after this point it crashes. It seems to be a crash with the codec used inside JavaCV. I have tried adding catch code (in a try-catch block) so that if for some reason JavaCV cannot extract a frame or a codec issue appears it then should return an error without crashing but this does not work and it still crashes.  I think we need to find a way to stop JavaCV from crashing (which then crashes the whole java application) when an exception like this occurs. Do you have any suggestion on how we can add code to stop JavaCV crashing, or if errors like these occur, then we get back some indication an error occurred, the process stops, but does not crash?  We have managed to stop some types of corrupt video crashing the application, but we have to get each video, look at the error, then try to add code for each error which is too bigger tasks as many videos crash in many different ways. We need to find a solution so that if JavaCV crashes or cannot work, it does not crash and returns an error.

it seems that they're ignored for the effect. At least I got a couple of times where I have the board with 3 metal blocks with [1] move left to dissappear and other tree that were more recent, and block smash+ activated and then there wasn't any more metal blocks in the board

It also have the issue. Btw, it seems have no problem generally if the chests in a blueprint are empty. So could you add a feature that we can make the blueprints not recording any items in all inventories ? 
Yea I'll take it for a spin at some point today
It's hard to clarify since English is not my primary language... but basically 1/ If a player knows the username of a player that is *rich* or got a lot of stuff 2/ That player still have to know the password to log in and do the bad things 3/ But before (2), they might need to know if that username is worth griefing or not by using this bug a/ If that username is worth griefing, then they will use some password leaking tools and waiting it to be cracked that is downloadable on the internet. b/ If that username is not worth griefing, they may stop do it at first glance in inventory. 4/ If they can't use this bug, they'll need to hack this account first. If it success but that username doesn't have the prize, it'll be their failure, every account in their glance should be hacked again and again. Why I want this bug to be fixed? Hacker is doing bad things, they should work harder to get the prize, or they will not get it. Not just knowing that username had a prize then spend 10 hours of breaking it easily without thousand hours. Of course there's a chance, that player is hidden their treasure before log out, but I want to make it impossible to exploit Or there's a big chance that I'll not use /authme reload anymore, but it's inconvenience that I have will to run it 24/7 *Speaking of the "/authme reload" command, is this bug related to "/reload" command or sort of AutoSaveWorld plugins? So each update might be recommended a full restart. I haven't tested it so I can't tell. If this bug exist it'll even more inconvenience.

@aQaTL  Concerning the approach, I think a simple JOptionPane is sufficient. I'd just extend the message to something along the lines: "You are about to close this file but have unsaved changes. Would you like to save the changes first?".  Concerning code, we should definitely not create some static methods in SaveFile nor in any classes that are registered via NetBeans Platform.  Moreover, there's no need to pass editor top component to SaveFile class, since it already retrieves one on its own (see TopComponentFactory that returns the singleton components). If there's some common logic that must be shared, I'd extract it to some separate util class.  Also, the code that will handle confirmation should also be as "standalone" as possible, so it can be easily used from other places in the application. I think in the future it will make sense to ask for the confirmation in more cases - for example when attempting to close the application or opening file from Dropbox. 
The second part of my example shows 'escape' format: `val c = cp.queryAwait("""set bytea_output to 'escape'; select E'\\001\\007'::bytea as b""").next().first().getBuffer(0).bytes` It changes format of select to 'escape' and tries to read it. This causes errors.  In my opinion best way is to give option to execute custom SQL on connection creation or option to handle event of connection creation (afterCreateEvent)
@jexp, this is a log of an embedded neo4j application. I did some traversal via the Traversal framework (the whole enclosing transaction is read-only). I don't have the storage files, but this very query succeeded the next time, so I believe, the storage was consistent. 
I'll check it out but I definitely think that will solve the issue.   Have you looked into DeferredRegistry<T> and RegistryObject<T>? It's a slightly more complex system but it automatically generates suppliers that are then automatically registered, allowing for static initialization of anything that has a Forge registry. I mostly based the code in MysticalWorld on [Tropicraft's system](https://github.com/Tropicraft/Tropicraft/blob/1.14/src/main/java/net/tropicraft/core/common/block/TropicraftBlocks.java). [My library for it in MysticalLib](https://github.com/MysticMods/MysticalLib/blob/1.14/src/main/java/epicsquid/mysticallib/registry/ModRegistry.java) is still fresh, [here's an example of it](https://github.com/MysticMods/MysticalWorld/blob/1.14/src/main/java/epicsquid/mysticalworld/init/ModBlocks.java).  I'm not sure if it would precisely resolve the issue in this case, but at the very you'll be able to tell if the serializer is being accessed *before* the actual registry event for the serializer.  (Just beware that it's better to do EntityTypes statically.)  Upon testing, there's now another error that appears to be shifting back to an optional failing, so ... I think it's fixed!
Alright! Thank you!
I haven't seen this issue so far (using it some minutes) 0.0.6-dev  
Hi, okay I understand, this makes sense. Thank your for this explanation...  Looking forward to remove those error lines as it pollutes a little bit those useful logs ;-)

I can reproduce it by changing these two lines in the example:  ``` int maxDepth = 10; int minLeafSize = 10; ```  to:  ``` int maxDepth = 5; int minLeafSize = 5; ```  I use the input data I posted at https://gist.github.com/Zero3/55963dcf14c87e439668 which can be deserialized from a file using something like this:  ``` try (ObjectInput input = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("algorithmfoundry-Foundry-issues-45.ser")))) {     Collection<InputOutputPair<Vector, String>> trainData = (Collection<InputOutputPair<Vector, String>>) input.readObject(); } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException ex) {     throw new RuntimeException(ex); } ```  (Note that my `OutputType` is `String` while the example uses `Boolean`)

I think it is not related, `bs-platform` was only migrated to 4.06 recently
> Only avoid the timeout or try to complete the call?  The call completes successfully, the issue is in the [waiting logic](https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/ff858dd492b3376e2b7374174b9c2a1fe68abc3f/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/jaxrs/resources/SubscriptionResource.java#L569-L594). We currently expects a subscription, invoice and payment event. If `autoPaymentOff` is set, we shouldn't wait on the payment event.  Does that make sense? 
5.0.5 
its the newest one that is automatically updated from within webstorm, but I can check later to retrieve the exact version number  The Version is 1.5.4 
I am sorry, but I needed to take a little pause from MC. Let's go for details.  I originally had FE build 1146, where it worked. But then I updated for later builds and it stopped working. I had my spawn position in other dimension than basic overworld, but first it took the coords where I setted it up and then teleported me to overworld on those coords, totally ignoring that I was setting it up in another dimension. Dunno if I updated or so after that, but it did not worked with more versions, I tried those ones: 1187, 1234, 1256, 1265.  For checks if it is not just by messing in perms, I also deleted it all and recreated, but nothing worked, only reverting back to (quite a lot) old version.  Still I might have messed something really badly, but I don't know what would be a thing that would overwrite FE's spawn thingie for good until downgrade.  PS: I actually in that bad times did some amateur video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jv9yod5zz8fbdmy/2016-08-29-1901-49.flv I had suspicions for that I messed dimensions, but then I deleted all FE datas and it was still there, even when I tried only FE command and even when I tried it just in overworld few blocks away..., that was really bad time heh.

@apemanzilla, did your PR fix the issue where the user was required to select an asset when the mod was being checked for an update?  I can't replicate that for EVE anymore. 
@DonBruce64 It could be dynamic surroundings or serene seasons changes to snow that is causing the bug then ill do further testing to nail down the cause and resubmit to the appropriate mod author for compatability fixes or you can give our private test modpack a try and see if you can nail down the issue https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/arise-populus.1340101
Hi, For those fonts I explained above, any string with Japanese characters fails. So I think it is a problem of the metadata of the fonts or something. You can take as an example: 私はたろうです。 As I said, a couple of very heavy fonts such as TakaoPGothic can do the job, but they are big and I am afraid of OutOfMemoryError. Actually at this moment I am programming a kind of music editor and with your framework I can only export the music file to PDF with the music file closed. If it is open, and the editor is showing many visual components, I get the OutOfMemoryError the second or 3rd time I export the file to PDF. 
Yes, in my case this loop get only URLs included in my "custom" classloader but URLs are included in parent classloader (AppClassloader) are ignored and compilation failed. 
No, the `autocorrect` feature is disabled. Just installing and enabling the detekt plugin is enough to break Save Actions.
Hi,  It’s the console. So the scenario is this:  1) have my model correctly type checked etc. if running in the console, all works fine 2) I now want to debug a feature and I set a BP before debugging; start console again. 3) type in some print statement that will trigger the BP. I do step in/over/out etc. 4) while the focus is on the editor window where the BP was at first, I add/remove a BP elsewhere in the same file 5) overture crashes.  It did happen on this model (on the semantics of a security language), but also on the models I use for students (on games).

Good question. Maybe an "Open file as new tab in current project" option is missing, too. 
I was talking to my colleague, Thurston (whom you've spoken with on the mailing lists), and he agreed with you.  Something like this in production would probably never happen and therefore is not entirely worth fixing.  I agree.  We should just close this issue. 
join `play.mcpz.net` i think  
okay, it's not a problem with `RemoteSpringApplication` itself, but if you have `spring-cloud-starter-config` on the classpath and configure `spring.cloud.config.failFast=true` in `bootstrap.yml` then autoreconfiguration of some other spring boot projects (in my case `spring-boot-starter-actuator` or `spring-boot-starter-ws`) will try to connect to the config server somewhere and crash the `RemoteSpringApplication` because of failFast=true  ```   .   ____          _                                              __ _ _  /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _          ___               _      \ \

I emailed you a test video. 
> (i.e. directory structure)  If someone has physical access to your device, the entire directory structure of all connected ownClouds will leak through the upload pane. Also, if #674 lands, filenames will leak too. This is why I called it a "security risk".  I should point out that Dropbox does this with their upload pane. 
Are you referring to the following example in the [ComplexAccessPoint.xml](https://github.com/iipc/openwayback/blob/master/wayback-webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ComplexAccessPoint.xml#L65-88)?  I have not tested it.  That is a database driven functionality, no?  That was my assumption, which is why I didn't test, as we don't have the database back-end.  If not, I could test it out, but am not sure what else would need to be configured for the Oracle features to work.  Also, we do know that this is not specific to StaticMapExclusionFilterFactory, as it is also an issue with StaticListExclusionFilterFactory, at least that's what my testing suggested. 
That's on the develop branch with no additional patches applied. I take a photo in portrait orientation then while the image is semi-transparent with a progressbar below I rotate the phone to landscape orientation and wait for it to finish. Then there are two photos displayed. If I rotate the phone back to portrait it all becomes normal, only one instance is visible.
Hello @emmanuelbernard  In fact, I removed the field from the`update()` method just to try different things and forgot to put it back. Including the field is the way it's supposed to work, but it doesn't. I just updated the source code including it.  I added 2 animated gifs to the [README](https://github.com/manoelcampos/hibernate-concurrency) to show the issue.  Replacing `persist()` by `flush()` or `persistAndFlush()` doesn't have any effect with the locking. The `@Version long versao` field is incremented, but the data from the previous user is overwritten.  About the transaction, as it's just an example, I made the entire `ClienteResource` class transactional. I moved the `@Transactional` directly to the `update` method and it doesn't help anyway as you said.  I made sure to stop and restart Quarkus after such changes.

I don't know about develop, as I don't currently have my environment up, but I can reproduce this on dvn-build, dataverse-internal, and demo. Hopefully that's enough to conclude we have a problem somewhere.

I ran mvn -X clean test > error2.txt and this is the resulting file.  If you search for  com.allianz.cisl.ext.agcs.jackson, which is a private package not present in maven central, you will see that maven correctly finds it in my local repo (Compile classpath line 1080), but during test it tries to download it again from central maven (lin 1806).  Hope this helps [error2.txt](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/files/3694627/error2.txt)  Previously the issue concerned quarkus-bom package but if managed to run mvn test with a direct connection, then it has downloaded the package once and the issue no longer occurs.
Thanks for your reply! Is there a api for checking if the device  can seamless switching? We don't find ANR issues for now.
Sorry, as stated: no I can not provide such a sample as the actual algorithm start with building a RANDOM route. So any given data set will work or fail ... from experimentation I'd guess a rate of 10:1 but that is highly subjective.  While stating this ... I did *not* look at the random-route-generation code itself! It might well be the error is in that routine producing looping random routes and "fixing" it in the optimize is not the right approach.

@mookkiah ok
I'm told they do, yes. 
@marshhxx, yes, that's basically what solved the problem for me. I didn't really import a modified JAR. I just downloaded the source file from the repo, put it under the same package in my project's source, modified it, and rebuilt the project. 
I think I figured it out though I'm not sure if this is your problem Brayferd. i really like this mod a lot and wanted it to work so i re downloaded it and switched over to the new file, and then tried it worked. come to find out though if your looking at a block even if its right outside your range it will try to place to backpack. Try looking at something really far or in the sky. How ever i had some problems with taking the backpack from the "TooManyItems" NEI and i could not craft with them. but for reference i was using: Too many items. - Marglyph CraftGuide. - Uristqwerty Minions mod. - AtomicStryker Balkon’s WeaponMod. - BalkondeurAlpha  I did uninstall TMI and everything is working wonderfully. its an awesome mod.

SerializationCode do have the correct web context classloader stored in it's inner classLoader variable - the issue thought is that apache EL deserialization library will use reflection in order to properly deserialize the input stream into an object which will use Class.forName - and the only way to pass to correct class loader for such situation is to get the thread class loader, which in this case is not the proper web app classloader.  What I did and it is working is to modify SerializationCodec decode method to wrap the method with setting the thread class loader to the web application classloader and after the deserialization to return what it was before like this:  ```     private final Decoder<Object> decoder = new Decoder<Object>() {         @Override         public Object decode(ByteBuf buf, State state) throws IOException {             try {                 //set thread context class loader to be the classLoader variable as there could be reflection                 //done while reading from input stream which reflection will use thread class loader to load classes on demand                 ClassLoader currentThreadClassLoader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();                 try {                     Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(classLoader);                      ByteBufInputStream in = new ByteBufInputStream(buf);                     ObjectInputStream inputStream;                     if (classLoader != null) {                         inputStream = new CustomObjectInputStream(classLoader, in);                     } else {                         inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(in);                     }                     return inputStream.readObject();                 } finally {                     Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(currentThreadClassLoader);                 }             } catch (IOException e) {                 throw e;             } catch (Exception e) {                 throw new IOException(e);             }         }     }; ``` The best thing for this was to be able to override readObject for CustomObjectInputStream but the method is declared as final, so for my test I end up changing 2 classes that uses currently CustomObjectInputStream - SeriazliationCodec and TasksRunnerService.  I'm attaching both classes that I have modified and are up to date with the latest in git so you could compare and see the difference  Probably the best thing is to make CustomObjectInputSteam private class and use helper method/class that will read the object out of the input stream and set the correct class loader and after that set it back to what it was  [redisson.zip](https://github.com/redisson/redisson/files/3233687/redisson.zip)

hi @macdonst  thanks for your reply well...the code just like the example code  ``` var push = PushNotification.init({ "android": {"senderID": "my_sender_id"},          "ios": {}, "windows": {} } );      push.on('registration', function(data) {         alert(data.registrationId); //it will trigger twice times in my iOS 8.4     });      push.on('notification', function(data) {         //not try yet...     });      push.on('error', function(e) {         //not try yet...     }); ```  but I am using PGB (build.phonegap.com) Cli 5.1.1 with all official core plugin from NPM

> Where does this proposed behavior come from? We chose to model `?foo` to work similar to what users see with R; e.g. that opens the associated help documentation in the Help pane. >  > Is there a difference between what `?list` and `??list` should do?  Yes: in R, `?ggplot` will show the documentation for the function `ggplot`, provided that the package is loaded, while `??ggplot` will search the documentations of all the packages installed for matches with `ggplot`, regardless of whether the packages have been loaded or not, and show the matches in the help pane.
Testing with EC on its own and this only occured when i added in OpenComputers & Actually Computers  EDIT:  Tested with EC on its own, works fine .. tested with EC + Opencomputers and Actually Computers an works fine, so id have to run through a mod by mod basis to find out which mod is causing this conflict
Hello. Today I've send the repport to google - problem still exist. I think the best option is the button visible for all task (for empty ones and with due date). Dnia 8 marca 2015 23:40 Marten Gajda napisał(a):  Did you send a crash report via Google Play or do you have a log of the crash?Do you want the "due today" button only for tasks that have no due date yet?— Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.

No other mods. Sometimes the results stay invisible and and the ingredients stay in crafting grid. until I try adding more ingredients. But usually it does appear when I click on them.   I'll double check if the book changes things.

I don't know how I could explain it better, so I recorded a short [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Zl0DYtUPap9dL4xsN2fgm30gE2dHEZXT). Also this happens only on code exercises and also with very old ones too so nothing I am changing something constantly.

Yes, they don't persist through relogs. Restarts most likely gets rid of them as well but I haven't tested that.
This is definitely a real increase and it happens with the antennapod UI as well as when using my headphones' play button. This is on Lollipop on a Samsung S4. No similar issue occurs with other apps. 
Yeah /authme email exists. I think it had this bug a long time ago – I must have tested with an old version once and confused the commands 
Looking over the Tank code, I see no reason why it wouldn't work. I have been playing with the fluid system to make ABO reinforced pipes better (I did, thanks), and there is no multithreading anywhere in there. I'm going to build a different type of test rig to see if it's a different kind of issue.

Here is the complete Scala code with imports:  ``` object AUCIssue extends App {   import scala.util.Random   import smile.validation.AUC    val n = 100000   val trueLabels = Seq.fill(n)(Random.nextInt(2)).toArray   val probabilities = Seq.fill(n)(Random.nextDouble).toArray    println(AUC.measure(trueLabels, probabilities)) // -1.89... } ```  Maybe `(pos * neg)` is lifted to double after the overflow? 
Sounds good. I'm doing as you request. 
Well idk to what it was related, but it seems to be fixed now... 
Normal javax.servlet.Filters, for example Spring Security, Hibernate, ForceUtfFilter etc. I'm using latest version of atmosphere 0.8.6 with tomcat 6, and long pooling.   
1.3.0 I will retry with 1.3.1 released recently.  If required, I can post a "working" example. The project his happened on is a secret one.
Sure, i will put them later~  2016年7月26日 23:40，"Alen Siljak" notifications@github.com写道：  > Hi, it seems that attachments do not go through when replying from email. > Could you please attach the screenshots on GitHub? >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub > https://github.com/moneymanagerex/android-money-manager-ex/issues/895#issuecomment-235308855, > or mute the thread > https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AOd5CLVxweVZuCe566SDdrXl9HW0Omuuks5qZiprgaJpZM4JOM1J > . 
Thanks Felix. I am using postgres 12 with postgis 3. Actually I was following the "hands-on tutorial v 4.0 (2018) but I will review all these first steps following the official docs you show me. I remember to got an error when running CREATE_DB.bat, but since the schema was created I thought it was ok, and indeed, I have just citydb. Many of my problems will be noob mistakes and not exactly issues on the software. Which place you recommend me to ask/discuss about installing and running 3D CityDB?
Hi Andrea!   Actually I was using Eclemma to generate a code coverage report for me, however, I found that it may in inaccurate. I tried Cobertura instead and I am seeing much higher code coverage results. Thank you for your prompt reply!   I also had a question though while looking through this report... Is EvoSuite able to generate tests for classes that use dependency injection or not?  I also noticed that my code coverage was low when my code called services. Other than services that need mocking, what are the types of items that EvoSuite does not generate good tests for?    Thanks! Pooja 
maybe i try the test in a wrong way,  after i class i used in the testunit is contains static method.

Ah apologies. Minecraft 1.11.2 using as far as I know the latest version of Actual Additions. (ActuallyAdditions-1.11.2-r107.jar)
No - the variant gets converted somewhere along the line from the VCF format of A -> ATG to . -> TG. I am blaming Jannovar but could be wrong. It is not a big issue as long as we tell the users what format to use and code accordingly!  I think A->ATG is more standard in the community right e.g. when you download files from other sources. 
I'm using spoon 6.0.0  ``` MavenLauncher launcher = new MavenLauncher(Sample, MavenLauncher.SOURCE_TYPE.APP_SOURCE); 	launcher.getEnvironment().setNoClasspath(true); 	CtModel Ctmodel = launcher.buildModel(); 	Factory factory = launcher.getFactory(); ``` The trick is that when I fisrt run this code it works, then when I tried second time it doesn't work any more.    
Ok, thanks. Now my app use the latest version. But i have to upload my app to the market and check whether users will report crashes related to bugfender.

I can't seem to reproduce it any more, but also IntelliJ seems to be remembering the SDK location now and I can't work out how to make it forget Previously it had serious issues remembering the SDK path - of course that might be an unrelated issue.  There are several `threadDumps-freeze` logs that seem to show bad stuff happening. I've attached them all here. [log.zip](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/files/1005781/log.zip)  There's a nice 180-line stack trace in there (yeay Java) that seems to suggest it is some deadlock deep inside the file browser dialog, I think when I click cancel.  Could be an IntelliJ issue. If I uninstall the Dart and Flutter plugins, and reinstall them will that reset their settings to a blank state? Might be worth a try if so.

Hi Tyler,  the docker mount works on the Codenvy Version 5.0.0-M4 environment on my personal account: `docker run --rm -it --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse --name codenvy-mount -v /c/Users/sklose/mount:/mnthost codenvy/che-mount 40.114.82.27 34457`  But we need it on our Bitnami Google Image (which is Che version 4.7.2. Build Time :2016-09-09 10:26:29)  you can check it out if you try to mount my che workspace on ount bitnami google cloud (Standard password)  `docker run --rm -it --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse --name codenvy-mount -v /c/Users/sklose/mount1:/mnthost codenvy/che-mount 146.148.115.101 32774`  In our installation che server and workspace server are on the same google vm which got one external IP Address (146.148.115.101 at the moment). you can logon to the workspace with putty.  I would very much appreciate also an working example with  che mount using the cli directly.  Thanks in advance  Stefan  PS: If I install Che version 4.7.2. on my laptop I can mount the workspace - so it must be something with the bitnami google installation [https://community.bitnami.com/t/eclipse-che-on-google-compute-engine-can-not-be-mounted/44795](https://community.bitnami.com/t/eclipse-che-on-google-compute-engine-can-not-be-mounted/44795)

Okay the rotate script doesn't work without FAWE. But to be fair... WorldEdit has problems with scrips in general. It can't even execute one of the build scripts. Plain WE doesn't say "error while executing" though. ![2017-07-28_14 18 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23323875/28716847-9e3a7ed4-739f-11e7-9f29-c08fb6c3a7dc.png)  Here's the rotate script btw.

Boot 1.5 doesn't appear to be affected. For example, [this test](https://build.spring.io/browse/BOOT-PUB7-JOB1-1417/test/case/217332935) takes less than 1 second. That may be due to the tests being different in 1.5, I'm not sure.

My map is a full resolution map using the same procedure as the mapsforge-mapcreator. The difference is just that I build the pieces of the map in small chunks and then stitch them together using a C++ program that I wrote to build the world map. The C++ program does not modify any of the coordinates. It only copies the binary data. 
I don't understand what you mean by "add an empty credential.properties", but I've re-imported the project and it seems like it works now. How come other people succeeded importing the project, while I didn't?  Also, I thought it would be like the new sharing dialog, where you can scroll it and it gets larger. Can you please show how to do it on your library?

It was configured on OAutomaticBackup. I do not have installed linux containers, we are running on windows, should we install anything more?  Other strange thing is that configuration "firstTime", didn't work well, backup started when we started OrientDB service.

Yes, I mean 'Full application restart'. Sometimes I need to click many times. But sometimes just two clicks with like half a second in between hits this. I seem to hit it more often when using a physical Android device than when using the iOS simulator.  After that the only remedy is to restart IJ, so pretty severe.

@luacs1998 Still crashing, there's the log: https://pastebin.com/45ZqLJML  EDIT: Actually it was another mod which caused this and I fixed it with using Sponge Bootstrap.
No it was on an existing db. But some of them may trigger exceptions on indexing - it may be related ? Will do more testing to identify the issue. I have observed this errors 7 times this week. 
@tobiasKaminsky it's not clear what you are proposing for me to do.    It looks like @atomspring did the same thing mentioned in the original post to _temporarily fix the symptom_.    That is: after some unknown and intermittent issue causes the nextcloud account on a device to be removed (for me, this only happens intermittently to my nextcloud app account - no other accounts have this issue) _and_ I discover that I cannot add the nextcloud app account back again on my device (this _also_ is intermittent and not necessary correlated with the nextcloud account on my device mysteriously being removed).   Then I will:  1. put the device into recovery (I use TWRP) 2. pull /data/system_ce/0/accounts_ce.db to my computer via adb 3. edit the "accounts" table and the "extras" table by deleting all entries referring to the nextcloud account in the file accounts_ce.db by using a SQLite editor ("DB editor for SQLite" is my poison of choice for this) 4. After saving the edits in step 3., push the modified accounts_ce.db back to /data/system_ce/0/ on the device via adb. 5. Use "adb shell chown system:system /data/system_ce/0/accounts_ce.db" to make sure this file's user & group ownership is something android expects 6. reboot the device, delete any now defunct nextcloud app accounts _on my nextcloud server_, and readd the nextcloud app account on my device.  FWIW, I continue to have this problem intermittently (so far I have not been fortunate enough to get a logcat of the events otherwise I'd share it).    Updated environment data/additional info:  Android version:7.1.2 lineageos 14.1 20171020  Device model: surnia (I also have/update a falcon and a hammerhead device both using lineageos and a similar app mix but so far have not run into this issue).  Nextcloud server version:12.0.3, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-97-generic x86_64), TOPT enabled, https only, redirected from a DDNS service at a high port that is redirected to port 443 by my router.  While this problem has affected me over the past month when using versions of 2.0.0RC and the "stable" 2.0.0 both from fdroid, I cannot provide reliable info to reproduce this problem.  It occurs unexpectedly, intermittently, and, as far as my recollection goes, not always due to events related to using the nextcloud app.  If I can get a logcat before/after this event happens, I'll share it.

> Yeah, shaders break a LOT of things. Does this happen in third-person or just first-person? Does it happen with other entities, or just the planes?  It happens with all entities as well as both third and first person. It may be a lighting issue (I could be wrong) but for every major lighting update that occurs seems to be the interval at which the vehicle flickers. I've decided to not use shaders and have switched to PR Luminance which is a basic lighting resource pack which uses optifine and doesn't affect the vehicles. It seems to only occur with lighting related to dedicated shader packs and not resource packs which have a similar mechanic.  Really nice mod btw! Flan's mod doesn't really like me so I had to do some digging to find an alternative. Came across this and I'm glad I did!

OK I feel that we are missing the point here. Let's ignore the round-to-nearest-second and the fact that we DO have sub-second ticks and also the fact that we get many, many ticks per day.   We're talking (in a Carl Sagan voice) "billionzz-and-billionzz" of rows in the database.  Whether the time period is ms, sek, minutes, days, years or centuries shouldn't matter btw. Every time period has an open&close and high&low, as well as total volume. This is what I understood your Tick class was handling, by having an addTrade() method for all trades that occur within the Tick period.   Anyhow, we are using TA för intraday trading, and I was testing your framework on our data, by doing a quick hack of the TradingBotOnMovingTimeSeries.java example. It immediately gave exceptions on "Cannot add a tick with end time <= to series end time".  I read trades from the database for a whole day (symbol, timestamp, price and qty) and feed it into the program. In this particular testcase I had about 34000 trades. A few of them has the same timestamp. Whether the TimeSeries period is 1 second, 10 minutes or 1 hour shouldn't matter, right? For the sake of argument, I created Ticks with period 1 minute and 1 hour too, but got exactly the same exceptions.  Since it occurred every time we had two trades with the same timestamp, so I started to see if I could find a way around the problem.  The Tick class computes beginTime as the given time (stored in endTime) minus the period. Doesn't this complicate matters when you add trades sequentially? Wouldn't it be a lot easier if you took the given time as beginTime and set endTime to beginTime + period? Since you normally have trades in time-order with increasing timestamp? How else can I test that "this timestamp" belongs to the "current Tick" or if I should create a new Tick? I must have misunderstood something here.  Thats why I had the "lastTick.inPeriod(d)" call, to see if my tick was to be added to the current Tick object, else I would create a new Tick for the next timeperiod. Also, the rounding was just trying to avoid the problem with the endTime/beginTime I mentioned earlier.   So, to clearify, we are not talking HFT and we are talking intraday TA (of course in coop with other proprietary analysis). I just want to be able to feed in my data with duplicate timestamps.

The latest Authme version. And 1.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT spigot version. 
Not a great solution, should drop the constraints. However, the code is also used for a list upload, so this would create a list with containing everything in the database. So that's not great either. 
Just tried with v1.6 and see same issue.  I also saw https://github.com/square/okhttp/pull/668 which let me to believe that this might be working. 
Thanks @nkzawa, that'll be great. Will close this once it is released.   BTW, we are using this lib in production, so I am doing active trouble shooting and trying to clean the issue list. 30+ open issue is bit scary. And you are the one with full knowledge to do this, could you please go through them and close the ones not valid anymore? 
Mt. Olive. I was looking at 8th alliance teams and on their team pages they all say "Captain of 8th alliance" 
3) Add config option to set energy input value. Now, if I set energy usage value in config bigger than 250 RF/t, Refinery consumes energy very fast => energy buffer of Refinery doesn't fill.

I am not able to give you reproducible code. Auto-compaction is disabled. The code initializing DB is here https://github.com/fblaha/manaus/blob/20e17221f713a5120f9f12d9ca2d0e4d6edfe790/mns-core/src/main/java/cz/fb/manaus/spring/CoreDatabaseConfiguration.kt#L29-L35 . The compaction is launched during spring context initialization.  Additional context:    1) database is quite huge ~ 6 GB 2) the issue started to appear recently not from the beginning when the DB was smaller 3) I am not observing any harmful impact on the app except those exceptions in log. The app works well even DB performance seems to be quite good despite the DB size
Fix verified in 3.2.12b and 3.2.13a. 
https://rule34.paheal.net/post/list/Polyle/1 I am also using the latest version I think
Yea okay, i have tried some things and after alot of work i found out the my scoreboard plugin was overriding EssentialsX's system..
The event is only cancelled if the correct conditions are met. 
Not sure, we might have had similar issue on other classes. It's clearly worth fixing before 3.2 in any case.
@kalyanar  yes please 
The problem disappeared after a few days right after I made a new copy of the original .classpath, I suspect it was a problem with how the .classpath was automated and not a problem with the extension it self, but I'm not sure as I can not recreate it either. 
Hi, I added 3 tests (2 failing, 1 succeeding) that show the bug and created a pull request for it.  Best regards Jan 
Perhaps it was an issue specific to my particular configuration, but when I tried to add ABS as a library project, to an existing app, I needed to change all of my styles to not declare IDs, but to reference IDs defined in ids.xml.  This is likely an issue related to my particular app, and me simply having an issue that didn't come to light until using ABS exposed it, so this is a non-issue, I expect. 
Ah, I was unaware of that endpoint. I had been doing GET /_rollup/job/* to list jobs and was seeing nothing. This list however is a bit big and includes data from a bunch of deleted jobs. The rollup indexes are deleted too. Is there a way to clean these out?
Oh, sorry.. It's 3.1.2-GA and I've also been able to reproduce that issue on provisioned "Demo Site"  at broadleafcommerce.org. 
The best way to explain the issue is to use a unit test (you need to modify the unit test the way you can grab mongo and datastore instances):  public class MongoDbContainerTest ...  ``` // initialized... private Mongo mongo; private Datastore datastore;  public void testIndices() {      final DB base = mongo.getDB("ut_test");     datastore.delete(datastore.createQuery(TestWithIndexOption.class));      final DBCollection indexOptionColl = base.getCollection(TestWithIndexOption.class.getSimpleName());     indexOptionColl.drop();     System.out.println("IndexOptionColl index after drop " + indexOptionColl.getIndexInfo());     final DBCollection depIndexColl = base.getCollection(TestWithDeprecatedIndex.class.getSimpleName());     depIndexColl.drop();     System.out.println("DepIndexColl index after drop " + depIndexColl.getIndexInfo());      datastore.ensureIndexes(TestWithIndexOption.class, true);     System.out.println("IndexOptionColl index after ensure " + indexOptionColl.getIndexInfo());      datastore.ensureIndexes(TestWithDeprecatedIndex.class, true);     System.out.println("DepIndexColl index after ensure " + depIndexColl.getIndexInfo());  }  @Entity(noClassnameStored = true) @Indexes({     @Index(         options = @IndexOptions(),         fields = {             @Field(value = "name")         }) }) public static class TestWithIndexOption {      private String name;  }  @Entity(noClassnameStored = true) @Indexes({@Index("name")}) public static class TestWithDeprecatedIndex {      private String name;  } ```  }  Here's the output:  IndexOptionColl index after drop [] DepIndexColl index after drop [] IndexOptionColl index after ensure [{ "v" : 1 , "key" : { "_id" : 1} , "name" : "_id_" , "ns" : "ut_base.TestWithIndexOption"}, { "v" : 1 , "key" : { "name" : 1} , "name" : "name_1" , "ns" : "ut_base.TestWithIndexOption"}] Jul 06, 2015 12:34:03 PM org.mongodb.morphia.DatastoreImpl processClassAnnotations WARNING: This index on 'estalea.base.setup.springframework.mongo.MongoDbContainerTest$TestWithDeprecatedIndex' is using deprecated configuration options.

Below are my settings for http keep-alive. I could understand some unacurate monitoring values, but that looks like a) missconfigured/non-working keep-alive b) non-working monitoring for keep-alive As you can see, there are no monitor values at all, so I cannot check it works.  ``` Max Connections: 250 Maximum number of requests per connection in keep-alive mode.   Timeout: 30 Seconds Maximum time a connection can be deemed as idle and kept in the keep-alive state. A value of -1 will disable it.  ``` 
As reported, the same failure occurs on a Nexus 6 running 7.1.1. The original key is: ``` 0xB2, 0xAB, 0xE5, 0x90, 0x82, 0x5D, 0x82, 0x27, 0x1C, 0xFC, 0x06, 0x06, 0x06, 0x3C, 0x81, 0x99 ```  
Install ant, run "ant" in current directory (builds the .jar file).  "ant clean" to remove everything, and "ant test" (TBI) to run unit tests 
I cannot remeber very clearly about the steps. But the trace is short I remember. I tried hard to reproduce this issue, but unfortunately fail to provide you a good test. 
Alright i can provide you with some more information i gathered.   I found the demo structure spawning in the Nether and clearing all its surrounding. (so it did spawn with air) Although when I spawn it in my other world it wont clear land. This let me to the conclusion this might be an bug with Multiverse since the world im trying to use it with is a Multiverse world. But in the Normal world also doesn´t spawns with air.   But now to your request.  https://www.mediafire.com/#3a40jv4zbhcaq This are the schematic files i use.

The last commit 458ee7999699b3489684178605c3f8f55294fd63 seems to be bad. 
It looks like this problem only happens when you try to define a task that modifies the main class.  Maybe you could help me debug this problem at some time. 
@hbf  I have sent you a mail on  kf@iaeth.ch dated October 29, 2013 with a sample file which was giving me segmentation fault. Can you try to run it on your machine and see whether problem replicate on your machine. (though you might need rbox to generate points) 
I haven't gotten this error with MapDB.  Doing some investigation, having removed all the records from MongoDB_(crawler) data base and deleted previously the `work` folder where the `progress\latest\status\MongoDB_32__40_crawler_41___MongoDB_32__40_crawler_41_.job` file will be created:  a) I run the crawler with:  ``` <url>http://www.federacionpiraguismodeextremadura.com</url> ```  I got the error mentioned in my previous post (even thought the file didn't exist previously) with the result: reference(s) processed: 4 DOCUMENT_COMMITTED_ADD: 4 Documents in MongoDB: 35 From the .job file: `note=4 references processed out of 35`  The difference I can see from the first run in my previous post (that processed 1812 references)  is that in the previous post the MongoDB_(crawler) data base didn't exist yet.  b) I run the crawler with:  ``` <url>http://www.ideextremadura.es</url> ```  I got the result: reference(s) processed: 39 DOCUMENT_COMMITTED_ADD: 37 REJECTED_REDIRECTED: 1 REJECTED_NOTFOUND: 1 Documents in MongoDB: 39  c) I run the crawler with:  ``` <url>http://www.organicsextremadura.com</url> ```  I got the result: reference(s) processed: 94 DOCUMENT_COMMITTED_ADD: 50 Read timed out: 37 REJECTED_CANONICAL: 7 Documents in MongoDB: 94  So it only seems to fail with the first URL. Finally I have deleted the MongoDB_(crawler) data base and run the crawler with:  <url>http://www.federacionpiraguismodeextremadura.com</url>  but still get the status file error. Don't know what the problem is with this URL. 
Moved issue to main project.
The error is happening in the constructor: `new PdfReader(inputStream)`.  I'm locating the file now to see if it can be shared.
I don't have this problem in the latest release nor in the current development branch, but I'm using Android 7.0. Is there any version where it was working on? 
There are no errors in the log anymore. All steps to reproduce are as follows:  - remove all saved data (`~/.local/share/DBeaverData/`) - install DBeaver - run DBeaver - when asked for a database, just close the window - click `File > Properties`  If I set up a db connection, it works, so what I'm suspecting this to be, is that the button should not be clickable, if no database is set up.

Hi, yes android_alarm_manager is on android x. I will try and track down the issue as well.
``` {         "_id" : ObjectId("54a1e697e4b058d291c8f72e"),         "enabled" : true,         "reader" : "admin",         "search_base" : "o=example,c=com",         "username_attribute" : "cn",         "ldap_uri" : "ldaps://ldap.example.com:636/",         "trust_all_certificates" : false,         "system_username" : "cn=at_svc_graylog2,o=example,c=com",         "active_directory" : false,         "principal_search_pattern" : "(uid={0})",         "use_start_tls" : false } ```  And the users after attempting login, since that's where the null value is:  ``` {         "_id" : ObjectId("54a1e69ee4b058d291c8f737"),         "username" : "rhartkopf",         "external_user" : true,         "email" : "rhartkopf@localhost",         "permissions" : [                 "*"         ],         "password" : "User synced from LDAP.",         "full_name" : null } ``` 
That is what the method `listPlaylists()` was returning and it was crashing when I tried to cast it to `List<Playlist>`. I will investigate some more though. It could be because Im using kotlin, but I'm not sure
The bug seems to have changed a little bit. There are two things. On my Mac using Chrome, I see that [this document](https://datashare-demo.icij.org/#/d/luxleaks/a0d563f8f571776af5305b4fa4704d4f1185a6d68934ab2bd0ea5328d331a3d5fca514869bc610d79cea63e4196beab4/a0d563f8f571776af5305b4fa4704d4f1185a6d68934ab2bd0ea5328d331a3d5fca514869bc610d79cea63e4196beab4?q=)'s creation date is 2004-07-02.  1. If I select July, 2nd 2004 in the creation date filter, it rightfully writes "07/02/2004 - 07/02/2004" in the filter but it doesn't search for the documents. We would like it to search after I clicked for the second time on the same date, not after refresh. 2. If I refresh the page, I then have a "no documents found" whereas there is a document. When I search for "07/02/2004 - 07/02/2005", then it finds the document. 
@loosebazooka  I am not sure if it is connected to Windows or its version. I have installed an Ubuntu OS with VirtualBox, and I could deploy without any problem. The output of that command is [], so an empty array.  @chanseokoh  I agree. Could you reproduce the error? I followed [this tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-app-engine-springboot/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) on my Windows 8.1 computer, and I got the exception.
Ah I'm using Gradle 1.6 because of https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2871. Note that is issue is already open for a year but will be fixed in 2.2 finally :-). But 2.2 will take some time as 2.1 is not yet released. 
no its not working :(  after the last item is removed, it still shows the item on the side, no number above, and pulling "fake-stacks" out 
In fact I do.   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21300678/64481273-f5761680-d195-11e9-9cb4-67521e15adba.png) 
I found the "bug", I sent the log with netcat and this is cause that error. I switched to nxlog and now the input can't stop. Thanks

I don't have any filters on my home screen (didn't know I could). I called the screen where I choose e.g. to search for caches or switch to the saved ones "home screen" - since I didn't find a better name for it and because of being the first screen welcoming me.  By the way: It helped to delete and reinstall the app. But I think this cannot be the answer since all saved caches - including all my notes for the now "invisible caches" - have been erased as well (last update/saving of data too long ago). I tried to save the last status - and I got the message all was OK - but in the end it turned out that nothing was saved but an earlier status was still there.

Hi! I'm using the 1.13.2 Version of Forge and i tried the "newest" Version but it didn't work 
Sure, I will do it. 
Yes, the 0.6.0-beta build 46 fix the issue. Next time i will read the known issue page before posting :) Nicola 
I don't think I have that. Didn't know there were logs. It will be removed when you uninstall the app I think? 
Hi,  sorry for delay :-(  I search what's happend, and I extract sample of code that produce error.  If I remove all private member (static and not), error is not produce.

Thanks for the quick response. No I currently don't have Maven installed on my OS. Also thanks for the workaround tipp. I will look into it next week. 
These machines are placed after that update 
Thanks for the quick fix!  I got this error (having first edited MANIFEST.MF manually to change org.pmw.runtime to org.pmw.tinylog.runtime):  ``` g!

I'm afraid my OSGI skills are not quite up to telling whether it's TinyLog that should have the import-package, or whether it's some other config issue in the project or other bundles that's causing the NoClassDefFoundError.  The project is here:  https://bitbucket.org/cilt/lecturesight/src/a8652a0ce18682860120a0851163293be08cc500/runtime/bundles/system/?at=t/LS-225-calibration  Tinylog 1.0.2 worked fine.

I wasn't planning on it but I can if you just want the one file changed, no new unit tests.  What branch?  And did you want the Apache license link to be https instead of http or just fix the missing colon?

Duplicating these steps on a server on my home network resulted in no error and the successful creation of a workspace.  I didn't anticipate ports being blocked over the course of a couple of hours and the only thing that I had seen that had changed was the software version.  My apologies and thank you for your time.  A follow-up question: when you refer to "the ephemeral port range"  are you referring to the port range 32768 to 61000 (typical Linux kernel range)?
i was able to build the sample app and deploy it on my device with api 14. But when I open the app, it crashes and it throws NoSuchMethodError.

The configuration is rather simple: ``` auth=default logging.file=/var/log/urlaubsverwaltung/urlaubsverwaltung.log spring.datasource.username=urlaubsverwaltung spring.datasource.password=<MY_SUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD> ```  But, I found out that the problem rises from my setup. I put an nginx proxy in front of urlaubsverwaltung for ssl termination. If I bypass this proxy the never ending redirect disappears. So, maybe there is a header missing in the nginx configuration that should be passed to urlaubsverwaltung. The nginx proxy configuration currently looks like this: ``` ...   proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:$server_port;   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;   proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto "https"; ... ``` I run uv with:  `/usr/sbin/daemon -f -u urlaubsverwaltung -p /var/run/urlaubsverwaltung/urlaubsverwaltung.pid -o /var/log/urlaubsverwaltung/daemon.log /usr/local/openjdk8/bin/java -Dserver.address=127.0.0.1 -jar /var/urlaubsverwaltung/urlaubsverwaltung.war`
Now I search.... until without results I'll let you know when I find a way.

Thanks for suggestion on --debug.  That showed we were pointing at two locations and one of these locations included some unwanted migration files.  Short term fix was to rm those files in build script and once we did that the "Ignored" issue went away.  Longer term fix is to add a gradle property to pass in the --locations.  Not to worry about the U22__allow_null_ordroutinginfo.sql as "Missing" that file still needs to be added to our build artifacts.  It's safe to close this ticket.

I see, yes, that make sense. (Just too bad it makes it harder to read.) My language is set to default on ENG.  Yeah, I got it now after first enabling GPS and then restarting app. It took a few seconds. I don't think that GPS should be required to get these populated. Not sure whats causing this delay.  On a separate note, I also noticed that the RSS (Relative Signal Strength) fields are wrong, showing the dec equivalent of 0xFFFFFFF., i.e. it's not receiving the correct data.  
So, after I added the NBT suspicion as an afterthought, armed with that knowledge I found possibly related tickets like #670.  I'm currently redesigning my AE system to get around the NBT issue, splitting off a third branch and adding MOAR minechem machines in the process. So far it's a success, the tick lag is gone and the client/WARNs with it.  NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M, aka shitty laptop card, but it seems it's not the issue.

Same behaviour. Should I submit a PR which removes the close() calls? 
Version number bumps happens when we release the toolkit. Since we have never done a 5.0 release, it does not make sense to bump the version number.

I'm enqueuing multiple write requests at the same time. I don't see any failure before this NPE.  I'm thinking this is a bug on my side, they should be queued one after the other, but it's working on most devices.  Once next version is released, I'll test again and close the issue if I can't reproduce it. Thanks for the effort!
@jvrao sleep() helps indeed. test passes under the debugger (which adds delays). I did not look at this much closer after finding a repro & workaround/unblocking myself.
i have set up the project with maven pom, and the selenium version 2.53.1 has been imported as the dependency libs
I do have some subresources, perhaps related?  ```     @Path("{provisionId}")     public ProvisionResource provision() {         return rc.initResource(new ProvisionResource(provisions));     } ``` 
That's true! (thought it was stored but it was my browser). Sounds to me though this is a bigger issue and requires a notification to an email or something to say hey login again. Will have a think. 
@srkukarni Yes. I tried. The problem is the same as 2.0.1 
hmm, that's really weird. I'm level 23...  yes i am using the latest alpha release. according to pogo i can't upgrade my dragonite further. which is extremely weird. perhaps it's just a fringe case with me. hopefully others can chime in, as i don't have enough stardust to get another max cp cur :/

Most likely not before next week, in the meantime you can disable the Display Stand, this should allow you to start without crashing. 
it appears to be random, sometimes you play whole day and it's fine, sometimes after several minutes.  Also, the message actually appears when bug manifests, not on load. 
Is a screenshot necessary? I simply can't pour Invar or Lumium onto an arrow shaft placed on a casting table. I click the faucet and the metals just don't want to pour. I'm an experienced Tinker, I've checked that I'm not making a rookie error like forgetting to put the metal to the bottom of the smeltery.  I can, however, pour invar and lumium into normal tool parts. My regular tools were invar for a time and my crossbow is currently lumium. I decided to make my bolts from manyullyn instead, but it still should be fixed.

I'd like to increase the number of streams consumed by my app to around 20, but this means I'll have 400 LeaseRenewer threads :grimacing: This _can't_ be necessary or useful.
I never experienced this with other connectors using OAuth but to be fair I did not play with them as much as I did with concur. There were no other deployments, no reset, nothing. It was on minishift, syndesis tag 1.4.5 so no image updates and I did not run any tests, it was all done manually.  Exactly what you mentioned - I set the OAuth for concur, created concur connection and integration, it was: database -> mapper -> concur (create listitem) -> log (body, headers) -> LOG (everything). All I did between republishing was editing the mapper step. 
I'm playing around with oc now, but i'm not at the level to control the reactor. So i did not tried the computer yet. But i'm glad that the computer port works with oc.

It is the 1.2 client. the row is displayed with text but the images are not displayed until I slightly scroll the list and then they appear. This does not affect all lists - some of them work OK, but on one particular example I see this behaviour.

[Java Swing Jayatana](https://code.google.com/p/java-swing-ayatana/) _"is a project that brings Ubuntu global menu (AppMenu) and HUD support for Java Swing applications."_ (says [webupd8.org](http://www.webupd8.org/2014/02/get-unity-global-menu-hud-support-for.html))  It's obviously not strictly necessary but buys me the convenience of the HUD (searchable menus) and of course a nicer design.  I'm not sure this is on the Arduino side, but - as stated before - all other Java software I use runs just smooth. 
No worries, it only happened the once and to me.. so may be something to do with being op? Ill keep an eye out Thanks 
> Could you make a simple demo for reproduce your issue?  @kimmking  This example is simple enough. I mean,SQL is sent to two physical nodes for execution, instead of merging the execution results.

Yes, downloaded Apicurio, Keycloak and setup according to the instructions.  Yes, breaks every time after logging out, linking, unlinking and went through from scratch setting things up a couple of times. I set it up with just my personal account first, then added an organization and added a oauth app to it with changes to Keycloak to use the new client/secret.

This is a regression - the boolean is not being deserialized on the REST API call.   The boolean is in the Comment bean and stored in the relationship between the Referenceable and the Comment.  This function has been working ok and just began to fail recently.
Well, document() is an XSLT function (http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#function-document); doc() is an XPath/XQuery function (http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-doc). Both are supported by Saxon: http://saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!functions/fn. The documentation for doc() documents the URI argument as:   > The URI of the required document (relative to the static base URI) >  > By default the URI is dereferenced using the conventional URL behaviour, as implement by the Java runtime library; this behaviour can be modified by means of a user-supplied URIResolver.  (http://saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!functions/fn/doc)  Actually, _loading_ the document with the relative URI in eXist doesn't seem the problem (see style3.xsl); only when that document is processed directly, without first copying it into a fresh XSLT variable. Note: when the files are run from the file system (not from the db), no errors occur.  Indeed, replacing the relative URI with `http://localhost:8080/.....` makes it work everywhere.  
> Is it faster when you open "photos" again, one time directly and one time waiting at least 30s (as I do caching)?  It takes the same time regardless if I let it sit to do the caching. About 6-9 seconds on average with the new version and 18-20 with the old one for me.  > Do you know when this happens? e.g. all files -> photos -> all files?  Select photos from the drawer, then open the drawer and go back to "All Files". The "Photos" section will stay selected even if its no longer active. **The app will crash if you select "Photos" from the drawer again.** (All files>photos>all files>photos[crash])  >Hm. I did not changed anything in regard of creating thumbnails. Are those exact the same images? Are they generated faster when you browse within the app to the folder containing these images?  I found out they will eventually load one by one very slowly. Yes, thumbnails are generated faster from the "files" section than from the gallery (also the non-QA version is faster at loading the thumbs in the gallery, as mentioned earlier).  Another important issue I discovered was that some photos will refuse to fully load and instead are displayed by its thumbnail resolution, see below: Only way to be able to load images from gallery properly is to go to "Files" section, find in which folder the picture is and let the app load the thumbnails. Once thumbnails are visible for that folder, it signalizes that the gallery will load the picture. In other words, user must visit the "files" section before heading to the gallery for it to load images properly.  ![pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36133540/61531074-18057200-aa26-11e9-9ccf-59a586b4b1d0.jpg) **--**  Another highly important issue is that the folders will display images that are in fact not in those folders (talking about Files section now, not Photos). Go to one of the folders where the pictures are and let it load. Then, manually update that file by swiping your finger down. The "No files bug" will emerge for a second and  then random pictures that do not belong in the folder will appear in that folder. (This problem is not present in the non-QA version of the app).  
yep, here ya go: https://gist.github.com/Saereth/91c5250751e5a24199768f10b0aef5c2  Also opened an issue with betweenlands  https://github.com/Angry-Pixel/The-Betweenlands/issues/705
@spacecowboy I forgot to add that I'm using the [Neo4j Python Driver](https://neo4j.com/developer/python/#neo4j-python-driver)  Here's the neo4j `session.run()` section. Everything works except when I want to add a long super long string, at `app_file_base64`:  ``` ...truncated... session.run(     'MERGE (app:app {{name: "{}", type: "app"}}) '.format(app) +     'MERGE (doc:{} {{name: "{}", type: "{}"}}) '.format(         app_file_ext.lower()[1:],         app_file,         app_file_ext.lower()[1:]) +     'ON CREATE SET app.name = "{}", app.type = "app", app.added = timestamp() '.format(         app) +     'ON CREATE SET doc.name = "{}", doc.type = "{}", doc.added = timestamp() '.format(         app_file,         app_file_ext.lower()[1:],         app_file_sha256,         'timestamp()') +     'SET doc.size_b = "{}", doc.size_kb = "{}", doc.sha256 = "{}", doc.base64_len = {}, doc.updated = {} '.format(         app_file_size,         '{:.0f}'.format(app_file_size / 1024),         app_file_sha256,         app_file_base64,          'timestamp()') +     'CREATE UNIQUE (app) - [r:reference] -> (doc)'  ) ...truncated... ```
It did it as soon as I clicked on the menu to get into seeing the chest

Here is log: http://logs.liteloader.com/view/DY6jCKx?raw=2 
happens all the time its permanent as long as i use the new version of EBWiz also happens on all mobs and i noticed it also happens to the text that apears when i use the feature from quark mod that makes mobs randomly talk nonsens (quark and neat are made by vazkii so probably using the same overlay tingy)
After I did "Sync Project", all the errors went away... thank you!! Perhaps a sync should be triggered automatically, each time external files are found? 
Thanks @jexp   Yes, I am using the enterprise edition and will raise a bug there.  I don't have the errors from the time it happened, however, trying to drop the constraint throws the following message in the neo4j-shell  ``` +-------------------+ | No data returned. | +-------------------+ Constraints removed: 1 7 ms SystemException: TxManager not recovered  ```  The constraint is not removed, however, an exception is thrown.

I do not have console access; I am actually another plugin dev who the server owners contacted about this.  It looks like the inventory clone isn't doing the trick. Normal horses have a `HorseInventory` object that has specific definitions for the saddle and armor slot, and these don't exist in the `Inventory` object inherited from `LivingEntity`. I know there is also a `LlamaInventory` that does the same thing. But all the other horse types, I haven't found a good way to access saddles. Type casting the inventory won't do either.  I haven't been super pleased with the 1.11.x APIs from Spigot for these reasons...
Hi,  Thank you for taking an interest! I tried to reply via Github, but it does not accept .bam attachments. I had chosen STRINGENT as it has become my "mental default" setting for Picard.

I believe the results were exported in https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/807. @gadenbuie, is this true? Until I can access the local version of the job launcher, I cannot test this out myself. (I am having trouble compiling the IDE preview of 1.2.1335 because the Ubuntu 18 tarball appears to not have a `CMakeLists.txt` file).
@davidjgonzalez  I see that resourceResolver.map() is expected to do encoding.  I don't know how it is implemented and what kind of encoding it supports, but I have no encoded values in transformed values. I wrote some tests, where it can be seen that '&' char is not changed after the mapping See https://github.com/sblano4ka/aem_tests/blob/master/src/test/java/com/sblano4ka/ResourceResolverMapTest.java  ResourceResolverMapTransformerFactory can still decode value but maybe query parameters should be ignored in this case 
I see, I will try. For my curiosity what are the benefit of this change? Is that something I should do for my app as well?
no, nothing. 
Hi Alex, the problem was that when it was run under cygwin, you still should use windows classpath separator instead of linux one. 
@ayudovin You are correct. Madhura and I just discussed this one and I think we have this covered. I am assigning Madhura so that work is not duplicated.   
> Do we know what triggers this behaviour or was it just observed on the server? And every time you do a random booster draft?  NO I have no idea. I guess someone started a random booster draft.I don't know which sets were selected. The list of tournements did not show any running random booster draft tables. What we can do is add some logging messages at tournament start and /or if the iteration limit is reached to get the information which set(s) can cause this problem.  And I guess we should add some logic to fill up the booster at least with some basic lands, so the tournament itself stays healthy. 
Hi, Sorry i'm not sure i'll be much help on this! Is there a logging flag i'll need? It's for a client so i fixed and moved on very quickly! 
My humble idea is its caused from ‘%’  sign is not encoded …    Browser can resolve it but as you know using java.URL like visiting the Queen at the Buckingham Palace. :)    > On 6 Oca 2017, at 17:44, Julien Nioche <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > { > "_index": "status", > "_type": "status", > "_id": "0865f11138e80af308041532ed4f8e04cec228d9f749e8c5a82a0ce7fc5f56ad", > "_version": 4, > "_score": 1, > "_routing": "www.hurriyet.com.tr", > "_source": { > "url": "http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/index/?d=20160328&p=13&s=ni%u011fde", > "status": "FETCH_ERROR", > "metadata": { > "url%2Epath": [ > "http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/index/?d=20160328&p=13" > ], > "depth": [ > "1" > ], > "fetch%2Eerror%2Ecount": [ > "2" > ], > "hostname": "www.hurriyet.com.tr" > }, > "nextFetchDate": "2017-01-06T07:35:51.112Z" > } > } > the originating page contains >  > <a href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/index/?d=20160328&amp;p=13&amp;s=ni%u011fde" > will have a closer look later >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/DigitalPebble/storm-crawler/issues/401#issuecomment-270916946>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AQscnzHKBHy4fKYfnv3bFutfbE7lU5HYks5rPlNTgaJpZM4LcEtV>. >   
Sorry for the delay, tasking switched. We are using version 3.0.1. I believe the 3.0.1 version also has the dependencies you mention. I was saying I added the dependency to my module to skirt the Jaxb context exception, but my workaround doesnt solve the following issue.  I'll be working on this the next week Thanks, Josh 
@javiersantos  It will take some time but I will test. I'll let you know as soon as possible.
Below's the code to reproduce the scond problem. Just hit ctrl+space after start. I'll try to find a similar easy way to reproduce the first.  ``` java package pack;  import javafx.application.Application; import javafx.geometry.Point2D; import javafx.scene.Scene; import javafx.scene.control.Button; import javafx.scene.input.KeyCode; import javafx.scene.input.KeyCodeCombination; import javafx.scene.input.KeyEvent; import javafx.scene.layout.Priority; import javafx.scene.layout.VBox; import javafx.stage.Popup; import javafx.stage.Stage; import org.fxmisc.richtext.CodeArea; import org.fxmisc.richtext.InlineCssTextArea; import org.fxmisc.richtext.PopupAlignment;  public class PopupDemo extends Application {     public static void main(String[] args)    {       launch(args);    }     @Override    public void start(Stage primaryStage)    {       CodeArea area = new CodeArea();       area.setWrapText(true);        VBox.setVgrow(area, Priority.ALWAYS);        Popup popup = new Popup();       Button btn = new Button("I am a popup button!");       popup.getContent().add(btn);       area.setPopupWindow(popup);         primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(new VBox(area), 300, 300));       primaryStage.setTitle("Popup Demo");       primaryStage.show();        area.setOnKeyPressed(e -> onHandleKeyEvent(e, area, popup, primaryStage));    }     private void onHandleKeyEvent(KeyEvent keyEvent, CodeArea area, Popup popup, Stage primaryStage)    {        if (new KeyCodeCombination(KeyCode.SPACE, KeyCodeCombination.CONTROL_DOWN).match(keyEvent))       {          area.setPopupAlignment(PopupAlignment.CARET_BOTTOM);          popup.show(primaryStage);       }    } } ``` 
I actually don't know -- it was something I ran into while working on a completely different problem, and I just copied the exception into a ticket so it wouldn't be forgotten. It also looks like something that we should be able to track down purely by analyzing the code for things that could create out of bounds indexes. The exact example may not be necessary to solve the problem. 
Yeah, it crashes whenever I press the + button.  Installing them from a file manager works fine, though.
I've sent via email.

Thanks @misaochan for the details.  @albendz I've updated the description to be a little more descriptive.
I use CE xubuntu postgresql
Adding the generic types to the `SenderSupplier` then using this form works ```java private SenderSupplier<R,S> senderSupplier = new SenderSupplier<>(() -> new RequestSender<R,S>() {     }); ``` 
Resolved by using the parameter `-U`.
the tests also run. I'll bring up the services not running.
Thanks @bsideup - I'll try to get some time whilst I still have a Windows machine available (one more day....).   Actually when building `testcontainers` current `master` on this same (Windows 10) machine I was getting several test failures, so may be more things to investigate / fix than I thought (related, perhaps).
The only setting box clicked in the GUI was to travel East.  I have tried with both the Directional Carriage Engine, and by spawning in a Carriage Engine and trying that to no avail. This is on a template carriage. 
I don't know if crates needs to be redone, but your implementation seems fine by me.  As far as I can tell, it's just a matter of casting on the interface and not the class. Everything's alright in dimensions that use the default SaveHandler instead of declaring their own. Casting on  `ISaveHandler` would make it work with everything.

Oreblock remains! You need to mine the ore by yourself when you "replicate" it :-D

I will try to provide an example. But the error happens on a big project with multiple modules. So that will take some time.

@rsudev map activity most of the time. I think once it was cache description but then I had no crash (as @Lineflyer wrote, can be really the same as #7300) No I cannot because sometimes (maybe when there was not enough time and app was still "active") it works, but often I'm getting crash.

Hi Herve,   Not to worry, we had a work around using CSV files.   I have downloaded and updated the new version, but I’m at a client site all day behind firewalls, so I will try to have a look at it tomorrow when I’m back in my normal environment at my office.   And thank you so much for your contribution to Archi. You truly make a difference for myself and my clients.  Regards, Thomas

For some strange reason the new bug zip didn't get made, I thought this one was it.  It's indeed an old bug zip. If I have this happen again I'll try to make a new one, it's weird that it didn't actually create it. 
Actually it works now. Some update in between seems to have fixed it. Thanks a lot!
I used ffmpeg to add a subtitle track to an existing MP4 file.  So I don't know why the edit list is there, but it seems that ffmpeg always creates an edit list for each track.  In my video there is an edit list for every track.  The edit list for the audio and video tracks indicate a duration equal to the length of the video.  But the edit list for the TX3G track indicates a duration equal to the length of that track itself, which is when the last subtitle ends.  If the last subtitle ends near the end of the video, then the problem is not very noticeable because the last subtitle is shown for only a few extra seconds.  But the problem really shows itself when the last subtitle is shown for quite a bit longer than it should.

The dictaphone is a system app. Don't see any info about it. I can successfully record voice messages in Telegram (last version) as well, btw. Yes, I've tried the Buffer Read Lock.
Have also added a issue there: https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/1609  Because I thought that it maybe is more a server / docker problem,
Sorry for the delay, it seems to work now, thanks!

@jiazhai no problem, I'll do it. Thanks for the tip about pulsar-manager.

I think it was a validation error. (Collection cannot be used.) But I will try to reproduce it. 
Sorry about the lack of details.  Any name without quote signs and brackets is accepted. Special characters, spaces, only numbers, etc. Even though the "invalid name" popup appears, it doesn't stop me from pressing enter to apply the invalid name.   I've tried Antenna and FeatureC++.  ![invalidnames](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/39188877-27058da2-47d1-11e8-831e-8d3226ed37ee.png) 
No writes to internal SD in my case prolongs the lifespan. Also, maybe caching in memory could be an option for devices with more RAM. Maybe adding a wrapper over the caching stuff that allows to choose either file cache or ram cache?  (Also no traces of 4chin on storage)

That is what I'm doing, I've a bioDialog method which has the following in it:  ```             BiometricPromptCompat biometricPrompt;             biometricPrompt = new BiometricPromptCompat.Builder(SecurityEntryActivity.this).setTitle(getString(R.string.securityPrompt)).setNegativeButton(getString(R.string.use_password), new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {                 @Override                 public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {                     pinDialog();                 }             }).build();              cancellationSignal = new CancellationSignal();             biometricPrompt.authenticate(cancellationSignal, SecurityEntryActivity.this);  ```  I know it would deviate away from the bioPrompt api, but maybe a way to make a call to dismiss the dialog would help. From reading it may be that when the activity pauses I've got the activity finishing and I've read that the error can happen if your calling finish with a dialog still open.
Will do that! Fix is coming up. 
Ahh, hmm - you are correct, those tests are in fact marked local. Whoops! This can probably be closed non-actionable then.  Though as an interesting side note, nothing that _isn't_ local ends up in java.log, which I think is what mislead me. Are other execution strategies supposed to generate log lines as well?
I have confirmed ,it is my mistake ,thanks @auhlig @emjburns

Evilcraft compat is built in to evilcraft, to my understanding.  Also, my bad, I meant 'veined scribing tools', it's part of the thaumcraft compat.
Thanks for the info. The reason I asked about it is that we have a need to validate parameter field for provisioning PUT /v2/service_instances/:instance_id. According to the OSB spec https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.15/spec.md#provisioning, it should return 400 bad request if parameters are not valid.  We can't do it because there is no such exception exists in the library  
Can confirm it does break redstone in every world, also non-plot worlds 
Hi sjka, tested the change with the last Snapshot of OH build #989. The `return` doesn´t stop the execution of a rule. Maybe something still missing? Can you please have a look on it. Thanks very much.
@davideas First of all, thanks a lot for looking into this!  What we would like to do with this list is that after loading the requested set of items (page) on screen startup, load the previous page as well automatically and add to the top, so user can start scrolling upwards if they liked to. It's currently disabled, but you can enable it in our app by uncommenting this line: [link](https://github.com/schedjoules/android-event-discovery-sdk/blob/f143950f9decad808a5e493a0a217bc3647ea17f/eventdiscovery-sdk/src/main/java/com/schedjoules/eventdiscovery/eventlist/itemsprovider/EventListItemsProviderImpl.java#L317-L317) (and then use "Event discovery 10 days from now" button on Main screen) So in this case it's independent from scrolling, we would like to add those items without any user interaction. Using a progress item on top and bottom is already in our backlog to implement, not sure if that would solve this though. Maybe I will try.  Looking at your example to reproduce it in your demo app I realized that the Header is not added to the list, which I also found in bold in the wiki afterwards, I totally missed it. It says: _"..The Header item doesn't have to be added directly to the list.."_. Does it mean that it must not be added? They are currently added in our app, I tried to remove them now but then they are not shown - tried to play with setDisplayHeadersAtStartUp() enableStickyHeaders() showAllHeaders(), maybe I just miss some order. If you say it's better not to add them, I will try to update after comparing with your demo.  Maybe I will also try to build from your branch with the partially fix commit to see if that simply fixes our issue.
Hi, Thanks for the reply.  I set DrawableParams in onFinalImageSet(). The top level drawable is a ForwardingDrawable so it will automatically forward the parameters down to ArrayDrawable, which will automatically forward it to mLayers (which are AnimatedDrawable).  Set a small Drawable into the target ImageView. It should be pixelated and not blurry when working.  ``` import com.facebook.drawee.backends.pipeline.PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder; import com.facebook.drawee.controller.ControllerListener; import com.facebook.drawee.generic.GenericDraweeHierarchy; import com.facebook.drawee.interfaces.SimpleDraweeControllerBuilder; import com.facebook.drawee.view.SimpleDraweeView; import com.facebook.imagepipeline.image.ImageInfo;  import android.annotation.TargetApi; import android.content.Context; import android.graphics.drawable.Animatable; import android.net.Uri; import android.os.Build; import android.support.annotation.Nullable; import android.util.AttributeSet;  public class PixelatedSimpleDraweeView extends SimpleDraweeView         implements ControllerListener<ImageInfo> {      private final DrawableProperties mDrawableProperties = new DrawableProperties();      public PixelatedDraweeView(final Context context,             final GenericDraweeHierarchy hierarchy) {         super(context, hierarchy);         init();     }      public PixelatedDraweeView(final Context context) {         super(context);         init();     }      public PixelatedDraweeView(final Context context, final AttributeSet attrs) {         super(context, attrs);         init();     }      public PixelatedDraweeView(final Context context, final AttributeSet attrs,             final int defStyle) {         super(context, attrs, defStyle);         init();     }      @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)     public PixelatedDraweeView(final Context context, final AttributeSet attrs,             final int defStyleAttr, final int defStyleRes) {         super(context, attrs, defStyleAttr, defStyleRes);         init();     }      private void init() {         mDrawableProperties.setDither(false);         mDrawableProperties.setFilterBitmap(false);     }      /**      * Displays an image given by the uri.      *      * @param uri uri of the image      */     @Override     public void setImageURI(@Nullable final Uri uri) {         setImageURI(uri, null);     }      /**      * Displays an image given by the uri.      *      * @param uri           uri of the image      * @param callerContext caller context      */     public void setImageURI(@Nullable final Uri uri, @Nullable final Object callerContext) {         final SimpleDraweeControllerBuilder builder = getControllerBuilder()                 .setCallerContext(callerContext)                 .setUri(uri)                 .setOldController(getController());         if (builder instanceof PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder) {             ((PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder) builder).setControllerListener(this);             ((PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder) builder).setAutoPlayAnimations(true);         }         setController(builder.build());     }      @Override     public void onSubmit(final String id, final Object callerContext) {     }      @Override     public void onFinalImageSet(final String id, @Nullable final ImageInfo imageInfo,             @Nullable final Animatable animatable) {         final Drawable drawable = getTopLevelDrawable();         DrawableUtils.setDrawableProperties(drawable, mDrawableProperties)     }      @Override     public void onIntermediateImageSet(final String id, @Nullable final ImageInfo imageInfo) {     }      @Override     public void onIntermediateImageFailed(final String id, final Throwable throwable) {     }      @Override     public void onFailure(final String id, final Throwable throwable) {     }      @Override     public void onRelease(final String id) {     } } ``` 
Hi. Thanks for your reply. I've created the logfile below following the readme. [logcatOutput.txt](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/files/2776511/logcatOutput.txt)  This part seems interesting: `01-20 12:19:30.720 17803 17803 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main 01-20 12:19:30.720 17803 17803 E AndroidRuntime: Process: com.nextcloud.client, PID: 17803 01-20 12:19:30.720 17803 17803 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to create application com.owncloud.android.MainApp: android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: duplicate column name: redirect (Sqlite code 1): , while compiling: ALTER TABLE external_links ADD COLUMN redirect INTEGER, (OS error - 2:No such file or directory)`  
`Do you connect to a device that is changing it's services or something?` No, the device I am connecting to definitly does not change its services. It seems that I was so long messing around with BLE on my Moto G that it was the time when nothing works and you have to restart BT or restart Moto G. After 2 years working with BLE in Android I can tell that it happens every once in a while (especially when you make some stress tests and connect/disconnect to multiple devices very frequently). But it would be nice to have at least some way to try to solve this issue. 
synchronizing on a single base object will not be enough.  If we consider the approach using synchronization we need to use the static property _ self _ as lock, this property is not visible from xtend code. (And I'm not speaking about the performance slowdown ...)

I was on M4 before. I am not sure how you want me to add and remove a channel. What do you  want me to do?
Tested with both test account and real one (on 'tester' privileges) , they give the same behavior. 
I am not able to install Devel::Camelcadedb 
Sorry about the delay but I plan to get around to doing it very soon. I'm currently evaluating the algorithm that creates optimized routes (given an area; to traverse every single road as efficiently as possible). I plan to finish it this week at the earliest and will fix this bug 
I found this happening on 1.3.1 also, with the compressed recovery bug. I haven't had recovery failures since then so I have no more data to gauge this with :(  On Sun, Sep 14, 2014 at 10:13 PM, suitingtseng notifications@github.com wrote:  > I am using 1.3.1. > Thanks for your reply. >  > ##  >  > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub > https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/7315#issuecomment-55547654 > .

There aren't. 
This option is disabled, it's not just redstone related stuff, spawners stop working too, basically the chunk does not reload a few times and then buga, and only comes back when it reboots ... :(
Nope, just a standard steam pipe. 
@shoebkhan09 check for null.
> What's this AP Turrets? Sounds interesting.  It adds "Mounted Gun" signs that allow a player to right click the sign and change into a sort of turret mode, where they can then right click with a button and fire arrows.  It is very effective at balancing ships vs god armored players (as it can 2-3 shot them if configured correctly).
1.0 for MC 1.7.2, as it says. Not sure about is it 0.6 or 0.7 from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293503-underground-biomes-constructs  I've also tried some other version, usure which exactly. I'll try some more other versions soon [didn't actually have much time for that =D], just notified in case it is useful to support compatibility with that version.  I can send you the .jar file of the UBC I used. And in case it's a single version bug - ... Well, I'm stupid then) 
I can not confirm for other formats, but most often my movies are in mkv h264 aac
Here is a specific line 72 trip:    Start:  82nd & Alder   End:  82nd & Holgate   Time:  I did it at 9:04 PM most recently, but as in screenshot above, happened with trip earlier in      day as well    All other parameters are at their defaults (which is 0.5 walking for us)  The original plan was same as above, except depart at 1:46 PM on 1/9/14.  I also used other start places (ex: Greeley & Humboldt) and end places (ex: 82nd & Crystal Springs) and found that they all showed the start of the trip at the beginning of the route in the trip viewer.  I tried out the other item I thought might be related, and it was still happening. See screenshot for trip details.  Also in the screenshot is the Trip Viewer - note that it is displaying the incorrect direction (and for what it is worth, shows Foster & 88th as the start point for the trip).  ![croppercapture 4](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4853348/2048149/b073e06e-8a3b-11e3-9cb3-23a176c522c4.png)  [The caller wanted to know if they were getting off at the first stop after the Hawthorne Bridge, so the agent opened the trip viewer to confirm that -- and found this instead.  The original trip was planned on 1/22/14]

I'm still pretty busy with other stuff, and since I don't actually use WebDav, I don't really consider this a priority if no one else runs into this problem. I consider this more or less a reminder issue for after my thesis-deadline. 
I do not use this version, I created a notification of a possible dupe. I use Chisel2 and created a ticket there: https://github.com/Chisel-2/Chisel-2/issues/418 
The whole window becomes unresponsive. No error messages are displayed.  No entry corresppoding to this timestamp in <workspace-path>/.metadata/.log or dbeaver-debug.log I checked ${HOME}/.dbeaver and <install-path>/configuration and no files are last modified with timestamp as the crash time.

@tsmaeder This is on the OpenShift dev cluster we use. I don't think it's a cluster issue as it's pretty consistently reproducible.  What do you mean by "default" registry? We're currently moving away from having Che provide default registries of any kind, since the che.openshift.io registries are for prod/prod-preview only -- https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/14266.  I've tested: - Che-server `7.0.0` + devfile registry `7.0.0` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `nightly` + devfile registry `7.0.0` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `7.0.0` + devfile registry `nightly` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `nightly` + devfile registry `nightly` + plugin-registry `7.0.0`: Works - Che-server `nightly` + devfile registry `nightly` + plugin-registry `nightly`: **Does not work** 
No, any chest at all.  The one in particular was not connected to the ME.  It was just a standard chest.    And Yueh, the server owners have a system that allow you to actually purchase points to buy kits that will basically just creative in items for you.  That is how I got my ME drives.    I did some further testing and just can't figure out what is causing it.  I have the exact same set up on an SP world and have not seen such an issue.  Got another guy on the server that has an ME set up, no issues.  I have used AE since Unleashed and never seen anything like this before.    Restarting the server is like an on off switch for it.  After the items dupe, they remain duped until the server restarts, at that point when it comes back online the items literally undupe unless I have pulled them from the ME and placed them in my inventory.  I am at a loss.  
Nicolas could you please send me a link or explain what is ADB logcat?   I have to install Android SDK where, on my phone?  I downloaded an app that is called "SDK Manager" and fetched some data from the phone but I don't see anything related to the Wikimedia Commons app in there.

Yes, Thanks for reminding.

It worked -- thank you so much! This issue can be closed.
None so far.
@dcbriccetti Sorry for that poor description! It's not exactly about "words". Look at the part of form:         <data id="a26280000014QdjAAE">                     <start />                     <end />                     <today />                     <deviceid />                     <simid />                     <phonenumber />                     <phonenumber>                         <text />                     </phonenumber>                     <closemessage />        </data>  As you can see, the questions are inside group with name `phonenumber` so the path is like `/data/phonenumber/text` where the path to automatically added, hidden question at the beginning of a form is `/data/phonenumber`. The same problem occurs if we use one of other existed name: `start`, `end` etc.  This case should be caught by form builder/creator but someone might edit a form manually so my fix is only to avoid the crash.
Even with the change to use `dill._dill` we hit issue https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/272 since we are picking with 0.2.8.2 and depickling with 0.2.7.1 (on the Streaming Analytics service).  Best workaround for Streaming Analytics users is to do: `pip install dill==0.2.7.1`
Possibly. Though I'd argue that at least in Influx's case it doesn't matter. 'NONE', to me, is a work around for a system that doesn't metrics that have the same 'name' but different tags. (like prometheus).   Why store data that is meaningless ( in that exception=NONE is the effectively the same as just not having the exception tag at all )?

Sam local has nothing to do with the Swagger that generates HTML and CSS portion.  The security mechanism that is used with Swagger I found was conflicting with the Sam local proxy security.  In fact the MVC portion of spring boot used with Lambda was requiring a login user name and password, which in fact without Lambda is not a requirement.  I have provided two examples, one with Swagger, and one without.  The lambda example does not have swagger support, but it would be nice to have it.  I can provide and reproduce a test case that provides a failing result, with Swagger integrated into the Lambda example.    Otherwise, you can look at the two test cases, and let me know what you think.
Hello, this is package body initialization section. Oracle docs: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e25519/packages.htm#LNPLS00907 Example 10-8.

@rubensworks  > I assume you meant an exporter on the bottom of the apiary, the importer obviously won't do anything.  No. I have an Importer on the bottom of the apiary. When the queen splits into a princess and drones, the importer pulls them out, then tries to put the princess and any drones it can back in. Combs or drones that don't fit go into the chest.
Hi, The validate() API throws an IOException, so we are forced to catch it (or rethrow). But the problem is when a response different than XML is obtained, we get XML parsing exception which is of type org.xml.sax.SAXParseException, so our catch block will fail when this exception occurs (unless we are catching Exception which mostly is not the case)  Ideally, the API should wrap every exception to IOException itself with proper cause, detail, explanation and reason set so that the API can be used with confidence without having any side effects. The ValidationResponse may include methods to provide such additional information.  Also on a side note the main page for jacabi-w3c should mention all the dependencies (only minimal set) to run this validation service properly. The minimal set of jars: aspectjrt-1.8.4.jar httpmime-4.3.jar jcabi-log-0.15.1.jar jcabi-xml-0.13.jar slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar hamcrest-core-1.3.jar jcabi-aspects-0.20.1.jar jcabi-manifests-1.1.jar jersey-client-1.18.1.jar slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7.jar hamcrest-library-1.3.jar jcabi-http-1.9.2.jar jcabi-matchers-1.3.jar jersey-core-1.18.1.jar validation-api-1.1.0.Final.jar httpcore-4.3.jar jcabi-immutable-1.3.jar jcabi-w3c-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar log4j-1.2.17.jar

It happened with corn. Let me see if I can reproduce it. I had old corn (that was preserved but not spoiled--) I took it out, ground it into corn meal, and went to mix it. The dough in the output grid was green, so I made corn whisky.

Thanks for your e-mail, Michel.  Unfortunately none of these changed something.  The server base URL is already set and the user authentication was set to Default, which means False. Setting it to true I got indeed an access error  ``` $ curl -k https://cta-sonar.irap.omp.eu/api/badges/gate?key=gammalib {"err_code":401,"err_msg":"Unauthorized"} ``` 
Yeah, i will test it, but i don't know how recreate it.

As it happens for me on multiple devices and with many different firmwares and Android versions, I didn't mention it.  FWIW, right now I caused it to happen on a Nexus 7 tilapia and a Galaxy Nexus maguro. Both are running ParanoidAndroid 3+ with Android 4.2.2. On the N7, I've got the build dated 2013-02-14 and on the GNex the build from 2013-02-15.  This is _NOT_ a ParanoidAndroid issue. I also had it with other firmwares, like with cm10.1 or aokp on the N7.  As it does not depend on the ROM or the device, I don't think it's worthwhile to spend time digging in this direction.

Hi!  It is hard to see what changed with #337 because of the code layout change. But, as I am using the git head version from yesterday and you committed that patch approx 15 days ago I would say no, that did not fix my reported problem.

We are using default helm chart that configures basic auth. The command i tried was: app default processor:app-name --version [the new default version to set]  Also, some additional info. I have setup CD to always do [-force] on installation of new version of the app. This might be causing some problem when existing streams deployed are using current version and new version is installed and forced to become default but it cant since existing stream using current version and etc?!
It seem to work. Regarding your PR - isn't it simpler to move `cipherIn.flip();` outside of the `if`? Like this: ```                 int bytesRead = NioHelper.read(channel, cipherIn);                 if (bytesRead <= 0) {                     bytesRead = NioHelper.retryRead(channel, cipherIn);                     if(bytesRead <= 0) {                         throw new IllegalStateException("Should be reading something from the network");                     }                 }                 cipherIn.flip(); ``` ? And re the test - my test involves a remote broker, I am not sure it is reproducible with localhost because timing is completely different in that case. Also, my message is not large as yours - a JSON body of 4224 bytes is being sent + some headers (dunno, probably less than 256 bytes). Maybe for a better coverage it makes sense to run test multiple times with different message sizes. Cheers

Hi. Thanks for the super fast reply! - Using version 0.7.0 ( compile 'com.h6ah4i.android:openslmediaplayer:0.7.0') - Android version 5.1.1 - Device is a Sony Xperia Z5 (E6653) but all other devices we have tested with have the same issue (Note 3, Galaxy S5).  Here are link to a couple of sample files (Github doesn't allow mp3's)  https://www.dropbox.com/s/zbvj84tt6o6zfq4/Aaj%20Din%20Chadheya-%28Mr-Jatt.com%29.mp3?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/tu7ctl8yx3eqtbh/Chand%20Chupa%20Badal%20Mein-%28Mr-Jatt.com%29.mp3?dl=0  Thanks.

@Ashish-Bansal  Hi Ashish,  As I tested, it seems like that bug has got fixed.  Great job, Yashwanth Krishnan 
Great, this seems to have fixed it. Dashchan never asked for storage permission on install, so you might want to look into that. 
Inside the CreateStatefulContract, there is a         TransactionReceipt contractReceipt = contractTxId.getReceipt(client); in line 80. That call generates an uncaught error. Same process happens inside the Get Record, since the (waitForConsensus(client, null);)  includes a getReceipt that fails.  
It's sanctioned now that we fixed the null pointer.   It takes the money.   There was a fun bug where the first time a country was sanctioned for cheating, instead of taking any money from it, it just rounded its availableToSpend to the nearest dollar.   I've fixed that though, so this all appears to be working. 
All 235 Pages? :P Here it is in dropbox, if that's an appropriate method of sharing it :) https://www.dropbox.com/s/fjdysr2x6adq7rr/fml-client-latest.log?dl=0 
yeah, I was just capturing this, don't have time at the moment but hope I get a minute to circle back soon
I'm not doing anything special  went to workspace -> add workspace -> select stack blank -> create after booting clicked run button at top -> create Run Command on Command Line write ``` ls ls ``` Run ``` /bin/bash: $'ls\r': command not found ```  https://youtu.be/gNxZDw1FpIc Here's the video showing the same.  I'm running Windows 10 Pro 1703. Opera 47.0.2631.55 Firefox 55.0.2  If there is any logs that you need, do inform me.
Downloaded and ran MT 1.5.0. Same problem. Tried it with Ctrl instead of Command. No difference.
That's ugly :). We might need to check all locations of pop() to make sure we did not miss anything.
@tdurieux   I have added the library, which provides the the class `com.lmax.disruptor.dsl.Disrupter` to the classpath.   Actually, I have resolved this issue by providing the source code of library `com.lmax.disruptor.dsl.Disrupter` instead of the jar file.  Although I do not know what's the differences, it resolves this issue for now :-)  Thanks very much!
These are all sandbox payments but here's one I just did up:  AP-7UR5582567538880S  This should have been $10 (Primary) + $0.50 (Secondary).  The total I see on the check out is $10.00 CAD. 
@juwlee This sample is running fine on devtools website but I am running it in Android Studio and the error described above is thrown internally. 
It does not crash, but throw a lot of errors in the server log.   Maybe Other mods play a role here, will try with other "fix vanilla" mods to check what triggers te crash tho.

confirmed. Can we change that so that we can sort by any of the rank files available.  Use case: a geneset is significant in one dataset and not significant in another but very close.  Might want to compare the ranked list of the two datasets to see how they differ.
Hi, `System.out.println(graph.getEdge(v.getId()).getClass());` displays `class com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.orient.OrientEdge`. However, the second line throws a `ClassCastException: com.tinkerpop.blueprints.impls.orient.OrientVertex cannot be cast to com.tinkerpop.blueprints.Edge`  I runned the second line step by step. In the next() method of OrientElementIterator, the isEdgeType() test returns false:  ``` java if (immutableClass.isEdgeType())     currentElement = new OrientEdge(graph, currentDocument); else     currentElement = new OrientVertex(graph, currentDocument); ... return (T) currentElement; // fails because currentElement is an OrientVertex and T is OrientEdge ```  Hope this helps.

In english you don't need to differentiate between zero and other. example: "0 keys have been updated" "4 keys have been updated"  http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#Plurals  what needs to be defined depends on the language 
I hadn't thought of that at the time, disabling hw accel helps quite a lot. with it off cpu goes from 22->31 and fps stays pretty solid at 50
I used the last commit.  Set up scene2d ui libgdx test and you will catch these problems easier because it use json e reflection alot.   I remember that the compare was failing (both types should be equal). Is it because type dont have interfacesCache object or for some reason type was created and didn't use the same pointer as type2 ?  
Not sure, I only noticed it spam server console when Alex was on. 
I have updated my question with the stacktrace and the swagger version.
the tables are created via Hibernate in LMFDBUtils https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-uby/blob/master/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.uby.persistence.transform-asl/src/main/java/de/tudarmstadt/ukp/lmf/transform/LMFDBUtils.java  - this is not done for each table individually. - apparently H2 has no problems with this way of creating tables, while MySQL has.
I grabbed alpha08: the first query runs fine. The second indeed takes a lot of time (but it does not crash as it used to), as it does a big antijoin operation followed by a double optional match.  Anyways, I don't think that's a problem: I changed that query a lot since then (see its [commit history](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_implementations/commits/master/cypher/queries-opencypher/bi-19.cypher)). It turned out I misinterpreted the LDBC spec in one place and we also changed the semantics of the query in another. The new query runs a few seconds using alpha08.  So in conclusion, I believe this issue is fixed now.
Sorry for not replying fast. I have my phone rooted and use greenify to keep apps out of using RAM. So not that much RAM usage. Also, I haven't used KISS for a week or so for I am using "ap15". As I have mentioned it, can you work on such a Launcher too. That would be great. Or options in KISS to show all app names on home screen with customization options.
I simplified the Class, added some dokumentation and output. Hope now it's clear what happens [RefreshScopeDeadLock-2.0.0.RC2-v2.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/files/2101180/RefreshScopeDeadLock-2.0.0.RC2-v2.zip)

Do you clean the video cache before the test?
There is a related problem with the generated  ``` if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) ```  It will never pass if you compare a `MyBean` from outside the model with a `MyBean` you get from the model, which is a proxy instance
Hello @kroepke ,  Thank you for your response  The message size is in the range of 3-4K in JSON format. We push around 4 GB of data to Graylog2 using sidecar collector.  We had a requirement to emit multiple records from the single record received and we used graylog-plugin-beats-1.1.1  for that with very little customization.   To be honest I too was surprized by the GC times but again thought it was pretty normal for graylog which is processing huge data load.  Do let me know incase you need any more info ...  Thank you!
Yes, can you fix that? 
No. I am temporary using EditText instead of MaterialEditText exactly because of this problem. With EditText everything is ok. 
Looks like i can hide it with the `--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED` command line option, putting before the `-jar`. Maybe it can also be hided/avoided programmatically without the option?  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46454995/how-to-hide-warning-illegal-reflective-access-in-java-9-without-jvm-argument

i removed viabackwards and it works fine and does not kick people. 
It's the same issue as jenkinsci/docker-plugin#339 - it looks like swarm gives a different response when pulling images, even on success, which throws the plugin off and gives `Could not pull image: null`. The original plugin had an `Ignore Pull Return (Workaround)` option for this, re-adding that is probably needed since it doesn't look like docker-java fixed the actual problem yet. 
Yes. It looks like it actually never leaves the sign-in button screen.   Or maybe on first attempt I got to select Facebook account to use before returning to sign-in button screen. On sequential attempts I do not get to select Facebook account. From a user perspective, the Facebook button then appears non functional.
v2.1.0-151 I grabbed it yesterday and started testing. 
Tested ok. 
Oops, my bad!  Here it is:  ```r tbl <- tibble::tibble(food = c("Crêpe", "Spätzle", "Smørrebrød", "חומוס"))  df <- data.frame(food = c("Crêpe", "Spätzle", "Smørrebrød", "חומוס")) ```
WDYM? It happens any time you try to use a type constructor in a cross-platform module. That's supposed to be illegal, by the typechecker accepts it. (And then the Java backend produces a nasty crash later.) 
Thanks for the explanation. In my code I call `auth0.setOIDCConformant(true)` while initialization. As I said before, this issue is not typical and happens not in general life cycle of the app.  So my resume - we can close this issue, and if it happens again, reopen.  And another question: Could it happen after updating the lib version of auth0 for the old user?

Hm, from what I see you are using a very old version of jaxb and when I see it correctly, since several versions it is already included in java8  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/JAXB.html  And also have a look here,https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.11/docs/release-documentation.html#a-2-2-11  There seems to be a sample somewhere which inlcudes some namespace stuff  Look also here, this is a newer gradle plugin  https://github.com/ewerk/gradle-plugins/tree/master/jaxb2-plugin

@ggezer , thank you for spotting this.  I'm curious that I've already configured   ``` ALLUXIO_JAVA_OPTS=-Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=SSD -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/var/lib/docker/alluxio -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota=500GB -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.high.ratio=0.9 -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.low.ratio=0.7  ```  And here is the command line of the master. I noticed it has the two same key `alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias`.  ``` /usr/bin/java -cp /opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/::/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/assembly/alluxio-server-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dalluxio.master.hostname=alluxio-master -Dalluxio.master.journal.type=UFS -Dalluxio.master.journal.folder=/journal -Dalluxio.worker.data.server.domain.socket.address=/opt/domain -Dalluxio.worker.data.server.domain.socket.as.uuid=true -Dalluxio.master.port=19998 -Dalluxio.master.web.port=19999 -Dalluxio.worker.port=29998 -Dalluxio.worker.data.port=29999 -Dalluxio.worker.web.port=29996 -Dalluxio.worker.memory.size=16GB -Dalluxio.security.stale.channel.purge.interval=365d -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=SSD -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/var/lib/docker/alluxio -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota=500GB -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.high.ratio=0.9 -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.low.ratio=0.7 -Dalluxio.home=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dalluxio.conf.dir=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf -Dalluxio.logs.dir=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/logs -Dalluxio.user.logs.dir=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/user -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=MEM -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/dev/shm -Dlog4j.configuration=file:/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/log4j.properties -Dorg.apache.jasper.compiler.disablejsr199=true -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Dalluxio.logger.type=Console,MASTER_LOGGER -Dalluxio.master.audit.logger.type=MASTER_AUDIT_LOGGER alluxio.master.AlluxioMaster ``` And I checked the getConf:  ``` /opt/alluxio/bin/alluxio getConf |grep alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=MEM ```  Looks like it's configured MEM in the end. I'd like to change SSD as the level0 tieredstore. Any suggestions on it? Thanks.
We both use 1.3.3 - just updated from 1.3.1 to make sure it's no old bug. Still both of us are unable to delete this special folder, whilst other folders which were unable to become deleted with Cryptomater 1.3.1 could have been deleted proberly using 1.3.3 .
@marcanpilami , this behaviour is not for each run, it's very rarely when we have this issue.  Our context configuration: ```    <context>       <name>frontier</name>       <childFirst>false</childFirst>       <hiddenJavaClasses />       <tracingEnabled>true</tracingEnabled>       <persistent>true</persistent>       <runners>com.enioka.jqm.runner.spring.AnnotationSpringRunner</runners>       <eventHandlers>          <handler>             <className>com.enioka.jqm.handler.AnnotationSpringContextBootstrapHandler</className>             <event>JI_STARTING</event>             <parameters>                <parameter>                   <key>additionalScan</key>                   <value>com.frontier.job.def.config.frontier</value>                </parameter>                <parameter>                   <key>beanNameGenerator</key>                   <value>com.frontier.webapp.config.BeanNameGenerator</value>                </parameter>             </parameters>          </handler>       </eventHandlers>    </context> ```  The issue was reproduced when queue has capacity > 1 and there > 1 job already submitted jobs to the queue before start.  So, JQM takes 2,3...N jobs in the same time. And as there was not syncronized block in ClassLoaderManager, JQM create second class-loader due to syncronization issue. Take a look in my patch

Well i am based on MCForge but use my own distri, i mostly code it myself xwom / wom doesnt seem to have a problem:  ```     public void SendUserMOTD()     {         byte[] buffer = new byte[130];         buffer[0] = Server.version;         if (UsingWom && (level.textures.enabled || level.motd == "texture") && group.Permission >= level.textures.LowestRank.Permission) { StringFormat(Server.name, 64).CopyTo(buffer, 1); StringFormat("&0cfg=" + Server.IP + ":" + Server.port + "/" + level.name, 64).CopyTo(buffer, 65); }         if (level.motd == "ignore")         {             StringFormat(Server.name, 64).CopyTo(buffer, 1);             if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(group.MOTD)) StringFormat(group.MOTD, 64).CopyTo(buffer, 65);             else StringFormat(Server.motd, 64).CopyTo(buffer, 65);         }         else StringFormat(level.motd, 128).CopyTo(buffer, 1);         //if (Block.canPlace(this.group.Permission, Block.blackrock))             if (this.referee)             buffer[129] = 100;         else             buffer[129] = 0;         SendRaw(0, buffer);     } ```  This after a player is already connected makes them crash.  I ruled out the motd, so its the SendRaw giving the Client problems  
I'm using the latest version available via the twitch/curse client.  I tried loading up just now to see if I can get this info for you and naturally it didn't happen this time. I'll keep my eyes peeled.  The tooltip had your normal error line for when a part id isn't found in the network but I don't remember the wording. The display gui had the red X and the same message.  Further info: The display screen on the left in the screenshot is using a variable card reading a single slot's item from the apiary (the queen slot) when the problem happened that slot was empty. The display screen on the right in the screenshot is using the list of items from the apiary, this showed the big red X on the screen and the back of the screen was red.   I don't know if WHAT I was using it for matters but there you go!  I'll try to get more info as soon as/if it happens again.
Nope I havn't. It wasn't verbose for us in test failure case AFAICT. Only after recent upgrades it started to behave that way. 
@airsquared Hey, sorry for the late reply but it's working now  
Ok, I digged a little deeper and found out that on my other Android the modify-date is set correctly after downloading. Maybe it has something to do with the files being on an SD-Card?
Sure, I will write info after testing.

Thanks for the fix.  Yes I'm a big Kotlin fan, and I'm very pleased to see that you're working on improving this library for Kotlin devs.  Thanks to you for your work on this library.

I believe its the problem in a specific version. I got it working on this version c511401d4392a485ee1fe2339ab0abf58c90aefb. But this 088478e376 is not working. If I'm pointing to the wrong one, can you tell the latest working version.

Hello, I've quickly tested java relay server today and haven't seen any connection to stack up. I was unable to test rust implementation because I couldn't build it.  Thanks.
I backed up the config folder, deleted the instance, and rebuilt the pack from scratch with a fresh install of minecraft and forge, then added a few mods at a time till all the original mods were all running concurrently. And the crash didn't happen again, so either a problem with minecraft/forge install, or i had a corrupted jar file somehow [a mod that maybe didn't fully-download properly?], or something else entirely. But its fine now i suppose
Same error.
I'm using eclipse and gradle.

Thank you for looking into it, and yes, I think it's rather important. Sucks that it isn't something relatively easy to implement.

Not exactly, one of our extension which is available on marketplace [Code4Z](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.code4z-extension-pack) contains an application called Zowe which pulls a file from mainframe and save it under temporary folder which is one level above `/projects`, this is how we test it if you would like to have a demo about this than we may have a call.

Currently A52. Not currently in a position to push for the newest... and as I said, I couldn't duplicate it locally, so I couldn't see if A59 also exhibited the same behavior. 
No, it does not go away. I don't have the device with me, so I cannot cite the error msg, but it was samething like "attachment ..../cache/... does not exist".  To check it yourself, you could try disabling your internet, sharing a file with blitzmail, (stopping blitzmail) and cleaning its cache, starting blitzmail and internet, and you should get the error.  Thanks and greetings.

It needed a complete server reboot, a BattleArena config reload causes it to break. 
Our SCC version is 1.2.1.  In the contract, we have query parameters in the request section, e.g.: `parameter 'size' : 4` Ideally, we would want to use a regex here, allowing the user to call us with any integral number. As such, in the response we do not want to use a hard-coded number either, but rather refer to the request, e.g.: `body([ size : fromRequest().query('size'), ... ])`  This, however, yields to quoted strings in the generated JSON stub, e.g.: `"size" : "{{{request.query.size.[0]}}}"`  Ideally, fromRequest() would allow us to specify the type of the result, as it cannot guess in advance. As I said, string is fail-safe, but in this case yields wrong results.
Hi @eivantsov, thanks for trying. It is consistent for me, tried today 5 times with different workspaces and every time I face the issue.

> You've not answered the question. Do you have FTB Utils in the pack?  I tried to imply that I had it with my follow up questions, sorry. FTB Utilities is indeed in the pack.  > The Builder is a fake player because it needs to break blocks. This is something that has to be done on FTB Utilities side. There is a config for it. Just make it allow fake players and it should be ok  I've searched through the files and I'm pretty certain fake players are enabled. I'm not having an issue with the builder not being able to break blocks. I'm having an issue with the builder not being able to designate an area beyond the defaults.

Hi, thanks for the answer.  The temporary fix solves the problem yes. Much better for me while waiting a real fix :)  Let's keep the issue opened until you try a new build then.    
thankyou
I tested 6.7.4, and it has problems transcoding the same file. The PS4 logos just spin and spin.... Five minutes later, I canceled playback and immediately tried playing it again. This time it started playing right away, but English subtitles were displayed.  In the directory listing, the file name had changed from `XXXXXX.mkv [FFmpeg]` to `XXXXXX.mkv [FFmpeg] {Sub:SubRip/English (English)}`. I've seen similar behavior with 7.x.x, fwiw. If it fails to play the file once, subsequent attempts will inexplicably play with subtitles turned on. The problem does seem worse in 7.4.0 though, I think.  
Attempt to read from beyond end of underlying data source can be reproduced with test images inside the repository.

This is happening for my obs as well as when I look at others. However, it's happening a little less now.  I tap on an ob and swipe photos immediately when I get to an ob screen. It appears to only happen with 3 or more photos. It also still happens for previously opened obs. Hopes this helps. @kueda is this happening for you? 
That could be. I found this output harder to figure out what's going on than others. I do know that I gave it multiple attempts to 'wait' but its never came out of it.

@hideki , actually it turned out it's not because of the size of the document. It's because canSendCompressedRequests() returns false. Sorry for the confusion. 
@AndyScherzinger I'm using samsung galaxy s10 plus, beta version 3.8.0 rc3 application, on google pixel 2xl instead everything ok
Yes, I just did. Still doesn't work.   Now using the latest EssentialsX version (not the one before).  /ess version: https://gyazo.com/8e16bc7c42712209e7e9c185e1b28f26  Also, it's somewhat unrelated but it is still regarding sign shops: Oak sapling, birch sapling, acacia sapling, jungle sapling, and dark oak sapling buy & sell signs are broken. The buy signs will take money but not give any items. The only sapling signs that work are spruce  Sapling Sign Setups: https://gyazo.com/c3d6cd6b03b532ede9b5af7729fbcc27 https://gyazo.com/e7b90a4e8adb96c70068268834b6f895  Edit: When I try to sell saplings it says "Error: You do not have 4x potted_dark_oak_sapling." so the issue is with potted vs normal saplings.  Edit 2: /i OakSapling, for example, doesn't work either.  Edit 3: /i Oak_Sapling works though and Oak_Sapling on the shop sign.
`BNODE` looks great, will try that, thanks! For the future, is that exception behaviour intentional for blank values or could that be changed so that they are ignored?
Hi @lvca,  I think I am missing something... My dataset is in GraphSon format thus the edges are represented like: `{"_id":1315003,"_type":"edge","_outV":62550035,"_inV":14823714,"_label":"/color/red/"}`  Are you suggesting to modify all the entries to be like `... ,"_label":"`/color/red/`"}` ?  Thanks,

Test in: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/test/games/strategy/triplea/delegate/StratBombTest.java  Does nothing really. I have tried to get it to work, but had to comment out the lines 113-115 because they fail. It seems that the .getUnitDamage() method doesn't get the bombing damage but I can't see how to get the bombing damage - reading the code, getUnitDamage seems like it is correct but obviously I am missing something.  Is that clear now? 
Master... It's a bit old though so I will pull latest and test to be sure.
This was referring to oasp4j 3.0.0, maybe this has been resolved already. Anyhow, I was generating the batch application by the archetype and starting the batch generated spring boot application without any success.

It's difficult to explain, you should try the above method out and see for yourself, the hover message will still be there after the last word (but there's no text) 
- The repetition of a bug (permit priorisation of a redundant detected bug) - _correspond to number of testcase where the same bug ID has been created on the corresponding tag execution._ **=> Yes, that what I had in mind. "TestCases Affected" would be a clearer title for user understanding**  =>I have in mind the fact that bugID are open to the testcaselevel. But it seemed to me that it was more precise to open a bug at the execution level because the  country/robot combinaison could impact the execution.  But in reality, this is maybe too specific to my organisation and some users do not use countries in Cerberus. So yes, link the TestCase associated should be the better solution.   => If  noKO/FA (**then no bug reported**) , the collapse could be close like screen attached. User will be aware of the feature, but it would not disburb users. what do you think ?  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29098010/32368318-afe149dc-c085-11e7-8399-17ea16fa7cde.png)  Here is the new mock up :    ![buglist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29098010/32370121-3813c4e6-c08c-11e7-8c23-f2497a816a87.jpg)        
Hi, no, as I mentioned, it doesn't happen on my Galaxy Nexus.  But it's obvious by looking at the code that it relies on the order in which getView() is called for the various rows.   Since the caches are just queues (FIFO), If called out of order, they can end up with more than one item which are not retrieved in the right order causing this problem.  This doesn't seem to happen on my device, but it happens reproducibly did on my tester's device.  My "fix", which is a huge hack, throws away the cache if any of them end up with more than one item.  In effect, the cache just because a single variable. 
Yep. Sounds good. Just wanted to have discussion and noted plan. 
> Can you at least show the code that produces it?  I clicked type-check a random definition in `Category.ard` and it gives me this. Closing the file and re-open makes the error disappear.
Here you can download the sample application [testapp.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/1371062/testapp.zip).  The test app is a very simple application that exposes the actuator endpoints. If you run the application as it is, the management port is different from the server port and if you perform an HEAD request on the endpoint http://localhost:8889/management/refresh you receive an internal server error (500 error code).  If you edit the application.yml removing the management.port and management.context-path properties and then execute the HEAD request on the endpoint http://localhost:8888/refresh you receive the Method not Allowed error (405 error code) as expected.  This different behaviour represents a problem into the integration with the Spring boot admin application.  The app has the same behaviour if you don't specify the version 1.5.7 of the actuator library, using the one imported with the dependencies management.

I would say `new JavaClass()` is perfectly acceptable, I can't think of any side effect (on subsequent type inference or such), as it should be roughly equivalent to `new JavaClass<>()`.

Actually, I should have said that the favorites get emptied. After that, there's no other way then to manually add every favorite again.  This happened two times, each time at the start of the app, when the app queries the server for station data updates. The first time I  thought it could have been a memory error (device related issue), now I'm trying to understand if it has happened to anybody else. The second time I could actually see the favorites there for half a second, but then, after the update, the tab blanked out saying "no favorites".

Great, thank you for such a quick reaction. Version 2.8.9 build 2326 seems to work fine. I once got some exception but am currently unable to reproduce it. It will probably come up again when I pass this version to the team. Hopefully I will be able to provide some valuable debug then.  I had to symlink the plugin directory (`ln -s plugins-2.8.9 plugins-2.8.8`). Without it I received an error indicating the ganttproject (GP) was unable to find resources.  I tested various scenarios: * externally lock with USER_1, TOKEN_A, GP unlock with USER_1 - SUCCESS (OK), * externally lock with USER_2, TOKEN_A, GP unlock with USER_1 - DENIED by 403 from the server after GP's attempt to unlock (OK), * GP lock, save project - SUCCESS (OK), * GP lock, GP unlock - SUCCESS (OK).  Saving with acquired lock works. I can see the "If" header in the packet dump.  Padlock is visible whenever there is a lock on file. My login next to the padlock is visible only if GP acquired the lock during the current session. Stale lock (after killing -9 the GP) is not recognized by GP as its own lock (no login next to the green padlock) and it seems perfectly logical (just noting it).

After the natural spawned cyberzombies didnt drop I put the rate tom 100%. After that I was just testing with `/summon cyberware.cyberzombie`. Now I killed a natural spawned cyberzombie and it dropped. Seems to be just the manually summoned zombies.   Could be another mod, however I have no clue which one it could be. 
Where can I find that version ?   See also https://github.com/bartoszprzybylski/owncloud-android/issues/21 . 
@yegor256 Thanks for explanation about new ticket. It's a bit more clear now. To the exclusion question. 3rd option is good choice, except one thing - transforming regexp from filepath to full classname is very unstable. Example 1: Input - `/src/main/java/com/qulice/maven/CheckMojo` Output - `com.qulice.maven.CheckMojo` Simple enough but how to cut prefix `/src/main/java/`?  Example 2: Input - `.*/.*Messages.java` Output - `~.*\.Messages` and so on ...  Don't think we need such a complexity in our code. To reduce it we may decide to specify exclusions for findbugs as they are for findbugs - per class patterns (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/filter.html). Tan it would be simple to create native findbugs config file using than exclusions. Have I missed something?

Ok 
@yegor256 Yes, sure 
Yes, this Issue still persists with WIP-Internal v0.1.24-alpha-b6. And maybe it's because I switched from Dalvik to ART-runtine, but AFAIK the next Android "L" will be ART only. 
this woks fine, however other issues turned that may be related. 
Yes. Even tried clearing partition cache to see if that will change anything but still didn't work. 
Ah, I thought we didn't allow non-denotable types in Type.string, but it seems we do. 
From a client perspective though, if it is not explicitly in the schema, you can ignore it exists. In the above example, I can do everything I need to do without ever using (read or write) the _id field (save/update without _id is fine). I would think it could be hidden from the client if there is another field in schema for identity. 
@philwebb Yes, I can confirm that workaround works (though I need to explicitly specify the `value` in the `@Component` annotation). Or one can just define the mocks as done pre-1.4 in a test configuration. 
here you go  http://pastie.org/10705613 thanks 
I had to delete the content in the data repository (otherwise, the Neo4j server silently crashes again, and the logs tell me that it is complaining about missing transaction logs), but yes, increasing the limit to 524288 (according to your source) does help !
I use flandmark, javacpp and opencv(armeabi or armeabi-v71) which is included in java-presets-1.2. and all tests are fine on android version 4.0 to 5.1.x but 6.0. It shows above fatal error. [https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv/issues/412](url) This error happens when 'ffmpeg' is used and it's resolved from changing java-presets version to 1.2.1. However I don't use ffmpeg so, I'm not sure if this problem will be solved with the same solution. if that solution will work then where can I download 1.2.x version of flandmark and opencv. If you have any idea, lead me to right way please.  The error occurred on LG V10(F600) API23 and android v.6. 
>  >  > When did this issue start occurring?  I don't know exactly. But it **works fine** on my old 1.12 server with this version of skript: Enabling Skript v2.2-dev36  (just tested)  
Hi @iref,  thank you for your suggestion! I prefer to do filtering is a behaviour that leads to a defined result. Throwing should be the least alternative, breaking the program at runtime is not a good idea.  I'm looking forward to your contribution :-)  \- Daniel
I have pre-released the plugin and installed it on my machine. There are plenty of errors like this one... I am not sure what contribution is causing this (or a Tipper?), but it should be further tested. This is not urgent I assume, I am just confused because it produces such a harsh error (pop-up error message == plugin crushing).
jetty-client: 9.4.2.v20170220.  Bug was introduced in 9.4 RC3 by changing SslConnection.toConnectionString() Seems that debug log is not enabled in unit test.  Tested simple GET request to https://www.google.com (with keystore).
Yes, all games. Everytime i go to the games configuration and tapping Start the app freezes. 
I am seeing regular polling logs, in this page or in the general page logs ![pollinglog](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2879114/19656291/abd6d07e-9a1f-11e6-80d2-a1c23a31ae21.png) 
All tabs had been opened at some time, but I don't know which was open when the error first occurred.  Now, I can never see the ExerciseViewer window - I select a file but the window does not appear.  I get the same error with any GPX file, including files that did work last week.  I have since tried some old GPX files and some sample GPX files from the net (see https://github.com/pytrainer/pytrainer/wiki/Sample-GPX- for example).  It is always the same problem.  I also just tried v7.1 - same problem.  It seems now the problem has happened once, there is some setting/preference somewhere that make it happen everytime.  Could it be that the window is off screen and hence giving errors when it tries to render?  Is there some other setting/preference that I can remove/reset? 
I'm using the modern RStudio theme, the Ubuntu Mono font, and the Vibrant Ink editor theme. For code editing and display, I have the soft-wrap enabled, a line margin at 80 characters shown, indent guides shown, and no scrolling past the end of the document. I'm not sure what other config option could be set. Is there a way to export my configuration and send it to you?
My query is similar to the cat one, but my table name is `COMPANY_AIFM_AIF`  I get the following sql:  ``` sql select companyAifmAif.*, companyAifmAif.IDCOMPANYAIFMAIF col__1_2 from COMPANY_AIFM_AIF companyAifmAif ```  `IDCOMPANYAIFMAIF` is the PK.  But the returned tuple contains: - the COMPANY_AIFM_AIF primary key instead of the entity  - another columns entry instead of the primary key (which is too a number).  The following statement throws a class cast exception   ``` java new JPASQLQuery(entityManager, oracleTemplates).from(sCompanyAifmAif).list(qCompanyAifmAif, sCompanyAifmAif.idcompanyaifmaif,  sCompanyAifmAif.idcompanyaifmaif) ```  `Java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Number`. 
Sure, I did a search before opening this issue and didn't find that issue, but yes is a duplicate
i see the message   ``` §bfe.protection.use.JABBA.mover§f = §4false §f  zone [§5_SERVER_§f] user [§5<PROFILE NAME>§f] ``` 
This is for NoMoreRecipeConflict mod. I am using it as a simple gate before a costly recipe look-up, for optimization sake. I don't think this method has any effect outside crafting. You could imagine a modded recipe that first check this method of the inventory. The recipe would work in vanilla crafting table, but not yours. As opposed to other inventory in blocks, where not implementing isEmpty() may bring issues with hoppers.
i tried at 80 to 92 
--file removed--- it should be w/e the plugin generates, i haven't configured anything myself yet 
No, because of the rules I just added above.  ``` Hello.java:12: error: unreported exception RemoteException in default constructor     [javac] public class Hello extends UnicastRemoteObject implements HelloIF {     [javac]        ^ ```
> did you mean newer than 1.32.0? If it's older, upgrading is a fix.  You're right, I fixed the title, sorry for the confusion.
http://loklak.org/api/search.json?timezoneOffset=-330&q=fossasia&source=cache&count=0&fields=mentions,hashtags  504 timeout error 
thanks :-) I'll give feedback if it worked 
I've sent you the file and yes you can reuse it. 
I'm not sure now, I don't get it yet, but it seems like HaxeReferenceExpression, has bindToElement, which create new reference to file/package, not sure about class  I think it might be close, basically it changes reference to point to certain file or package, but should it do it for class 
We are using 4.1.0-RC10, together with Oxalis 4.0.4.  We may try the released 4.1.0 of the plugin if you think that will make a difference.  We have so far not noticed anything in the log, apart from the aforementioned log statements from DummyImpl and AssertionBuilderRegistryImpl. What we suspect, though, is that it might be necessary to have had traffic on both AS2 and AS4 for the problem to appear.
Thanks...  I made the change to annotations locally - but it didn't help. I took your PR and built, but the same issue.  My environment is:  - MacOS  - master (up to date as of now)  - Java 11  - I launch 3 platforms & UI as per coco pharma environment  - I run through server configuration & server start notebooks, then asset management (this creates some assets and puts a variety of servers into a cohort)  - the error here occurs after login to the UI   Note that without the fix I made for #2432 (now merged to master, in queue for release 1.3) Asset Catalog OMAS was not working AT ALL - and hence nor would asset search in the UI. With that fix at least the UI works, and searches are successful, so it's just a warning error at login time.  I will attach the error, but my simpler test case was just using httpie (or use curl)
This one is fixed now (#538).
I actually just finished creating a test app that reproduces part of the issues we are seeing. I found a race condition with the building of Instabug and updating the user info that I fixed in our code, but there is an issue when we first run the app, Instabug won't show. If we exit the app and then reopen the app, instabug seems to work normally. If we force close the app, and reopen the app, instabug won't show. We are initializing Instabug in the Application. I will post the sample code in a couple of hours.
Cannot reproduce this one. Will reopen if it pops up. 
https://pastebin.com/CS43XGFp  There it is. Happen 1 time only on 10 players. But this will probably happen again in the future.
Tried it with a unit, too. Same result 
Some of your latest updates broke it. 
[ProsperServerLogs.zip](https://github.com/Elecs-Mods/ElecCore/files/1648975/ProsperServerLogs.zip) 
Okay, I tracked it down to `HypermediaHttpMessageConverterConfiguration`, which is activated by that property.  Working on a sample.
Sorry, I didn't see any response until after the fix was pushed to users.

With the new version of the analysis, the analysis correctly reports the finding for the method `decryptAES`.  ```` Findings in Java Class: com.jzy.game.engine.mina.code.ClientProtocolDecoder           in Method: byte[] decryptAES(byte[])                 RequiredPredicateError violating CrySL rule for IvParameterSpec                         First parameter was not properly randomized                         at statement: specialinvoke $r6.<javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec: void <init>( byte[])>($r7)                  RequiredPredicateError violating CrySL rule for SecretKeySpec                         First parameter was not properly randomized                         at statement: specialinvoke $r4.<javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec: void <init>(by te[],java.lang.String)>($r5, "AES")                  ConstraintError violating CrySL rule for Cipher (on Object #3989e7fdae4a7d21d19818de9ee6 d49e685c881bd4baac223486832a8fe1a897)                         First parameter (with value "AES/CBC/NoPadding") should be any of AES/CBC/{Empty  String, PKCS7Padding, PKCS5Padding, ISO10126Padding}                         at statement: r9 = staticinvoke <javax.crypto.Cipher: javax.crypto.Cipher getIns tance(java.lang.String)>("AES/CBC/NoPadding")                  RequiredPredicateError violating CrySL rule for Cipher                         Second parameter was not properly generatedKey                         at statement: virtualinvoke r9.<javax.crypto.Cipher: void init(int,java.security .Key,java.security.spec.AlgorithmParameterSpec)>(2, r1, r2) ````  In total, the detected violations increased by three. One violation for the secret key, one violation for the IV, and one follow violation as the key used in `cipher.init` isn't generated properly.  One question @johspaeth, @kruegers : Shouldn't it be "same" violation for the third parameter as the IV isn't generated correctly as well. At least, that would make sense for me.   Details in the [report](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/CryptoAnalysis/files/2317410/CogniCrypt-Report.txt). 
If it is of interest I think I have it replicated in a smaller way that you could try it out, the repo is over at: https://github.com/LukeButters/conscrypt-jetty basically you need to start that web server send non stop http 1.0 requests to it and very very very slowly the memory just keeps growing. @flooey this is the best reproducible case I have so far, I don't know how to make it leak faster sorry.  Here is a graph of it growing over ten days  ![leak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7076477/65667175-81d37500-e082-11e9-86ae-c0892f870b80.png)  I also mentioned this to the jetty users mailing list over at https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jetty-users/msg09100.html 
Hi rsudev  Sorry, I didn't found the time to create a screenshot. Meantime the issue is fixed, most likely with a update of the HTC file manager.  Thanks anyway. 
Ah, forgot to mention that restarting the app or even rebooting the phone didn't help.
I was curious about that message, too. I strongly doubt it because all the cfcs work perfectly and even though they will have issues, I'm 100% certain they won't have unclosed tags all over the place as indicated by the output above (or in other experiments I ran). Will check tomorrow morning though. 
Yes, it returns correct headers along with 401 code if there is no `authorization` header. Which is a bit inconsistent, to my mind because responses for a request without header and with the "incorrect" header should be the same - 401.
Hi, When I try it without my change I get an occasional hang (something to do with user preferences) and the last time it tried to load the URL from the current directory so in this case failed to read file C:\MemoryApps\http:\localhost:8080\LastGC.log  Looking at the code I couldn't see it working it seemed to just pass the argument to the method expecting a file name.  With the change I have it working though I got an occasional fail to read the file (my jnlp passes a null argument) (it may be a webstart bug as there was one reported around these lines though I thought it fixed), so I have now changed to passing and reading a system property from within the JNLP to gcviewer  and that works every time.  I still am investigating an issue where I have an occasional issue where it fails to read user preferences and null pointers on loading recentURLs, I've changed the code to just empty string if it can't load from the file rather than crash and that works fine.  My use case is as part of my test results I have a web page of GC logs, I previously had the option to copy the link as an URL into gc viewer manually which does work but it was suggested if I could web start gcviewer and pass the URL requested in that would be nicer and I do have it working in principle.  thanks for the reply   Chris  PS I needed the replace but that may just have been with the way I was testing, I don't need that replace in real world usage. 
I'll check it in a new installation of Graylog 2.3.0
OK ... thanks for help. After command: `java -jar MEP_1.35.jar`  was automatically created a directory MEP at ~/Documents/MATLAB with the following content:  ``` kva@lr17:~/Documents/MATLAB/MEP$ tree -a . ├── CustomProps.properties ├── DefaultProps.properties ├── matconsolectl-4.5.0.jar ├── MEP_1.35.jar └── Replacements     ├── MEPR_Rev.m     ├── MEPR_SC.m     ├── MEPR_THIS.m     └── Variables         ├── MEPV_AUTHORLONG.m         ├── MEPV_DATE.m         ├── MEPV_REV.m         └── MEPV_THIS.m  2 directories, 11 files ``` After that I had javaclasspath.txt with the following content:  ``` /home/kva/Documents/MATLAB/MEP/MEP_1.35.jar /home/kva/Documents/MATLAB/MEP/matconsolectl-4.5.0.jar ``` and I was created two additional files: startup.m with the following content:  ``` at.mep.Start.start('/home/kva/Documents/MATLAB/MEP/CustomProps.properties', ...                    '/home/kva/Documents/MATLAB/MEP/DefaultProps.properties');  import at.mep.util.*; import at.mep.editor.*;  ctrl = true; shift = true; alt = true;  ks_MyKeyReleaseFunction = KeyStrokeUtil.getKeyStroke(java.awt.event.KeyEvent.VK_INSERT, ~ctrl, ~shift, alt, false); EditorApp.addMatlabCallback('MyKeyReleaseFunction', ks_MyKeyReleaseFunction , 'MyKeyReleaseFunction');  ``` and MyKeyReleaseFunction.m with the following content:  ``` function out = MyKeyReleaseFunction(actionEvent) if nargin == 0; out = []; return; end % this is necessary, the first thing happen is trying find out whether  % the passed function is a valid matlab function or not % assignin('base','actionEvent',actionEvent) fprintf('ALT + INSERT\n') out = 1; ```  according your suggestions on wiki. But after all that, when I start MATLAB I always get open editor, see attached screenshot.  ![screenshot_2018-12-03_11-02-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2698803/49366975-036ca780-f6eb-11e8-8be2-79d2547562a6.png)   Is that normal behavior? Is possible to suppress opening editor window with  `MEP: Sorry!`  text ???  Will be possible to create automatically the javaclasspath.txt file in a case when it does not exist at default MATLAB directory /home/kva/Documents/MATLAB and add some generic content to startup.m file at the same directory (+ in a case of no startup.m file)?  It would be really very useful, if the installer solve all installation steps fully interactively and automatically. 
I can't give a timeframe, but this will be a pretty high priority bug so we hope to tackle it ASAP and get it into the daily builds + a preview release of RStudio in due course.  
LuckPerms.
@gsmet  - just updated, its v1.2.0.Final
Block tiles seem to already be loaded in the way Cervator was suggesting: getting a list of every asset file of that type, then processing them all in `WorldAtlasImpl`. I'm pretty sure that that should be possible for blocks, too, as all block registered with the `BlockManager` come from either block-family assets or auto-tiles (blocks with no special properties, specified only by their textures). It should definitely at least be possible to continue using block families in the same way (only explicitly mentioning the family for registration, not the individual blocks).
That sounds like a great suggestion, wasn't aware of that hook in the statement builder. One thing I'm not sure about is DbMigrate appears to always wrap beforeMigrate in a TransactionTemplate. Unless that were changed to follow the same transaction detection, likely wouldn't fix this particular case.  Somewhat related, the transaction treatment of beforeMigrate vs e.g. beforeEachMigrate is different (this is understandable based on their scope, but initially unexpected). I think your suggestion would work as-is for beforeEachMigrate because it is called within the doMigrateGroup() method.
1. Place a mechanical user on top of a platform made of smoothstone, facing down. 2. Configure it: Redstone on, Upper left slot only. 3. Exchanging gadget: swapping out block planks; mode wall; range 3. 4. Put the gadget in the top-left slot, and fill the rest of the slots with 64 planks each. 5. Install a button, push it. 6. The swap happens, and 9 planks get consumed. But where does the cobble go?  It's actually not voided. There's a secret buffer in the mechanical user. A mechanical user with a buffer will try to empty the buffer when activated, and will block until it can do so.

Exactly. Opening the file "encrypted.asc" from K9 only shows "import key". I guess the issue is the mime-type matching.

As you see on the screenshots above it does work (see bulenkov/darcula where the menu is not present). I launch JMeter with exactly the same command, and the only difference is different themes.  Note: the application itself does not modify useScreenMenuBar property, and the property is passed during the startup: https://github.com/apache/jmeter/blob/cfb2bd92acf19123ae8a0de32ca60a46f5a85043/src/dist/build.gradle.kts#L520

It is the default, to match all.  `Must match all of the 2 configured stream rule(s).`  Testing one message that was wrongly routed in this streams says that "it will not be routed to this stream" and that only the facility rule matches. If it makes any difference, those messages were also routed in another stream based on the source, and this is correct.

Can you try it? I've also extracted the archive manually and that's way faster.
And it's needed for a project that uses JSPs, which many do. The server runtime supplies this jar on the classpath automatically, but you can't compile JSPs or run them locally without it. 
Nothing appears to trigger it, it is what happens when you spawn an npc and try to get it to find you. 
Our base URL is set to https://stash.domain.com:8443 and I log in on https://stash.domain.com:8443.

@tthuem My workspace was named FeatureIDE. But I created a new workspace and tested again. There is still the same Issue.  The weird is that the altered example templates are restored on an eclipse restart. 
ok... so further investigation revealed that the JWT token doesn't contain the email in the preferred_username field and it only contains   "preferred_username": "admin.adf"  This is in fact not an activiti issue, but more a problem on how you configure users into Keycloak. 
Hummm… my trin part pack has about 50 wheels, and lots more are to come xD That makes a bit less than 20 objs  Maybe, just an idea, make the wheel system UNU, dvc and Trin uses (in the naming of our wheels we have 14t4d, (dvc only would say 14x4), t being the radius in pixels of our wheels, d being the width) make a little text menu that allows you to search the part like creative inventory would do? So players can look for specific sizes.
this was a vanilla singel chest, (from rogue like dungeons I think) same happened when it broke a sun flower and a saw it a dirt block - but I think that block was dropped down when I was leveling the area at the top.
We should use a standard escape character and make it consistent across DG modelling syntax whenever we use a delim character within the model. For example a "\" set="%ssn,%number(3\,2)" 
It keep happen for users that use Android 7 and above. Here is my guess.   UpdateManager call the CheckUpdateTask -> CheckUpdateTask is bound the app activity to HockeyWeb server -> Asynctask in hockeySdk got execute -> but when the input stream got close the activity or the firebase instance in the acitivity is not alive anymore -> crash happen.
Sorry, this stack trace is from our crash report system, so I don't know what exactly happened.

@tbarbugli type code into Kotlin REPL: ``` import com.getstream.sdk.chat.model.Channel  val a = Channel() val b: Channel? = null a == b java.lang.NullPointerException 	at com.getstream.sdk.chat.model.Channel.equals(Channel.java:395) 	at kotlin.jvm.internal.Intrinsics.areEqual(Intrinsics.java:162) ``` This issue is critical because when you use Kotlin operator `foo == bar` is equals to `foo.equals(bar)`, unlike java `==` which compares pointers and is safe in that case.
I can see other players' messages and /tb tools works, but changing the userPrint value to the suggested values does not change the fact that the tools do not display messages. Also, the only plugins I'm using are the Essentials plugins, VoxelSniper, WorldEdit, Mobdisguise, and Tim the Enchanter. All of them can display text, but only essentials alters chat in any way.

I clearly did not post enough information and I am sorry for sending you on a wild goose chase.  I do have two rooms configured.  I had the HipChat notifier pointed to my account on the public hipchat.com site and it worked fine. I then  installed the HipChat server locally and tried to get the URL and token right, but I just get Connection Failed.  I found the readme section about debugging and turned that on and the dump is below. Looks like and SSL cert problem, but I do have a valid cert on the locally installed server.  2014-09-16 16:24:54,465 - DEBUG - Set "E:\TeamCityConfig\config\hipchat" as the template path  2014-09-16

Of course. I was using dropwizard-jdbi to query for rows in an Amazon Redshift DB with timestamps that fell on a particular date (1/1/2015) in UTC (Redshift timestamps are always in UTC). So, I created the DateTime objects with UTC timezone and binded them to the SQL using the SQL objects API. The returned rows, however, did all fall on the date I wanted. Instead of getting rows between 1/1/2015 00:00:00.000Z and 1/2/2015 00:00:00.000Z, I got rows between 12/31/2014 18:00:00.000Z and 1/1/2015 18:00:00.000Z. So, both of the binded dates got shifted back 6 hours, and my JVM's timezone was US Central (UTC-6). When I passed the JVM argument "-Duser.timezone=UTC", I got back the correct rows.  To answer your 2nd question, there is no peril in the conversion from DateTime to milliseconds. The peril happens after this, either in converting the milliseconds to the Timestamp object (in "new Timestamp(value.getMillis()") or converting the Timestamp into a binary value that's sent to the database - I'm not sure which one, but my guess is the latter. Either way, the root cause is that Timestamp is a thin wrapper around java.util.Date, which is known to use the JVM timezone in some unexpected situations.

Hi, yes in htop I can see that it's filled all 8g of memory I told it to use.  We're running it on a large volume (probably a few million files), perhaps it's legitimately filling the memory?  I was just assuming there's a memory leak somewhere.

I have not examined in detail what is happening when the state machine reaches the terminal state - I will do that.  Having said that, I don't immediately see why there should be a relationship between the state machine being stopped or started and its current state? I had intuitively viewed the different between start and stopped being whether events were being processed. Why link state to start/stop? Even if a state machine is force stopped because it is in a terminal state, surely I should still be able to ask the state machine what state it is in?  My use case is that I am modelling human-centric workflows as state machine instances. So you can view a state machine instance as represent a ticket. When a ticket is finally completed (e.g. approved or rejected or whatever that causes it to reach a terminal state) I need that to be persisted - I am using the state machine context as a way of view tickets in different states (i.e. new, in progress, complete). With the current behaviour, when looking at the state machine context in the persistent store it never reaches the terminal state and you cannot distinguish between state machine that are genuinely in a penultimate state from those that are actually in the terminal state.

Hi @tsmaeder this piece of documentation was planned in https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/issues/712 (Che extensibility reference) but has been skipped for Che 7.0 GA. Now it's about time to create it. Are we in the same situation as #14371 and this documentation should be a pointer to https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/ ?

Thanks guys!
After looking through the code I believe this delay is caused by the things in GCParser.getExtraOnlineInfo (friends log, GCVote, elevation). At least GCVote and the elevation could be done in parallel (without the activity waiting for their results).

Because this means that this is a local issue (as I suspected). Nobody on the server I'm on knows about this issue but me and the owner, so we're fine.  Are there any ways that a mod could do this? It would help us find the culprit.

I've reproduced it in single player just by spawning a few ghosts and some Thaumcraft Eldritch mobs.  I suppose we can throw potions at entities with splash or arrows too.  We're also using the infernal mobs mod, they will change potions when mob is spawning and might update them periodically.
We don't modify MANIFEST.MF. I will confirm what the actual value is when I go to office tomorrow. (Because I can not access the server from my home)

I see, at this point, the specific episodes aren't known, just the titles, so TitleRegEx is the only choice.  But how does a title that contains characters from the regex set get matched?  Since the encoding of  ()'s works, it appears that they're decoded before the regex is used. That's why putting a \ in front of them worked for the original case here. I thought that would apply to all of the regex characters that were part of the actual title (that should be matched without any expression.)  I found that this works:  ``` http://mc0:6544/Dvr/GetRecordedList?TitleRegex=Weekend%20ABC7%20Eyewitness%20News%20.End%20of%20Oscars.%20.%20.%20.%20.%20.%20.x.%20.y.%20. ```  That is, all of the regex characters in the title were replaced with periods. The %20 above were actually spaces when testing from my browser (plus signs work too, as expected.) 
It was a typo, thanks for noticing it. Fixed.  And I agree the log suggests something is wrong, but I can't find what.  For example, when I click on "Mods" in the star menu, the mod version for Biomes o'Plenty is "version" instead of a version number like it is for other mods.

I can't really post the build.gradle files, since it's a pretty big project with many subprojects, etc. I ran gradle dependencies from the project that is failing. The output is pretty big, is there a way of attaching a file to the ticket?

OK, this is effectively hard to reproduce, but I still can do it. If I clic on the arrow, the schema combo expands correctly. If then I clic on a schema, it works fine.  The problem seems to occure after a first start of DBeaver, if I clic on the combo arrow twice.  I have found several hs.err.pid*.log files.  I attach several of them [hs_err_pid_DBeaver.zip](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/files/723295/hs_err_pid_DBeaver.zip)  Hope this will help... Anyway, this is a minor bug that I found "by accident".   
Thanks for the comments. The liblockdev1 library does fix the problem on the RPi3 but not the RPi2 on Wheezy.  The answer came from cvanorman : "The current build of nrjavaserial requires glibc >= 2.15. Debian Wheezy has glibc 2.13 and so it will crash on that platform". As a result I moved on to Jessie and my problem ended.
Well, its unbelievably stupid.  I forgot to implement the `Program` interface for the main class. 
I am sorry, I will elaborate a bit more. For context: I am currently building a framework for fuzzing Libraries that Evaluate XPath expressions.  We found that jaxen behaved differently than the rest when evaluating `/nonexistent<=false()`.  In the framework we pass a sample file (not important in this case) and the XPath `/nonexistent<=false()` as args to the java program below. This then evaluates the XPath expression and return `false` in the aforementioned XPath expression, which is wrong.

RFTools Control apparently does. I'll test Pressure Pipes.  Edit: Pressure Pipes works BUT it doesn't save the values. Quality/Purity/Strength/Efficiency associated with resonating crystal liquid was deleted. High Pressure Pump > High Pressure Input > Pressure Pipes > High Pressure Output.  Can't connect pipes directly to the tank, but that's irrelevant here http://prntscr.com/dpif77

I think the exception is a separate issue.  I crated a new project in eclipse. Presenter1 has a single button that launches Presenter2 Presenter2 has a button that launches a dialog  When I launch the dialog, press the Back button I see the same behavior that I do in my app (Focus Lost, can't press anything).  In this test app, I can press Next and dismiss the dialog.  No exception is seen in this test app. 
It is not.  flac2mp3 implement ShutdownHookParticipant. That does not mean the shutdownhook requires it.  Please look at the code.

@ingmargoudt  I've had it happen twice during two different EDH games.
@eivantsov  I have to keep my keycloak-data pv because I want to keep the keycloak user information even if I delete it. You know, if I lose my keycloak user information, I can't log in to che. In my use case, I have installed Che as helm in AWS EKS. I am using it in conjunction with AWS RDS (Postgresql) for postgres-data. So, in the case of postgres-data, helm delete does not delete it. The way I currently maintain keycloak-data is using Amazon EBS(storage) as pv and connecting pvc. As long as ebs is not deleted, keycloak data information can be maintained. What I'm wondering is there is a way that eclipse che can suggest other than this. Thank you for your help.  
@jhamon, the `issuer` I have configured is `http://localhost:8080/uaa`, the behavior is surprising given that we are driving the value from the IdP configuration and there is a parameter to declare the token URL already. It is also inconsistent with what very well known OpenIDConnect providers use, see for instance:   *  https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration  * https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oidc/openid-connect-discovery * https://connect2id.com/products/server/docs/api/discovery * https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/pf_sm_pingfederateOauth20Endpoints_pf84/page/concept/openIdConnectMetadataEndpoint.html

I tried to reproduce this issue by starting a music and stopping it during 1 hour. No error happenned but it seems that the error occurs when the bot has already been running for a few hours.  I have also tried to send silence instead of nothing using this code: ```java @Override public boolean provide() { 	boolean didProvide = this.audioPlayer.provide(this.frame); 	if (!didProvide) { 		this.getBuffer().put(new byte[] {(byte) 0xF8, (byte) 0xFF, (byte) 0xFE}); 	} 	this.getBuffer().flip(); 	return true; } ``` This did not fix the error.  **Timeline:** - My bot started at `2019-02-20 22:29:41.951` - The first error occurred 4h30 after, at `2019-02-21 03:03:30.862` - The last error occurred 10h30 after the first error, at `2019-02-21 13:36:35.275`  During this period, 13.436 PortUnreachableException were thrown.  Also, but I'm not sure if it is linked, my shards stop reconnecting after a while. They get stuck on `Retry attempt ... in ... ms` but I keep getting the PortUnreachableException. As quantic said, PUE are sent by epoll thread pool so it makes sense it could hog all resources.

@zhangzhx I've tried multiple times and have not seen this error again.

@doanduyhai , all I did was create table xyz with secondary index xid in cassandra Then due to bug mentioned in ticket, I had to use raw query.  I needed pagination like dsl() with raw() api. So set fetchSize to 10 But page._1() has list of size 200 which is total number of records. I was expecting it to return 10 in list item.  **Is there any other way we should set paging state and fetchSize when using raw() api  than below ?**  Here XYZ matches columns from xyz table and is POJO ``` int fetchSize = 10; final SimpleStatement statement = new SimpleStatement("select * from xyz where xid=:xid  "); statement.setFetchSize(fetchSize); Tuple2<List<XYZ>, ExecutionInfo> page = eventByAgentManager                     .raw()                     .typedQueryForSelect(statement, xid)                     .getListWithStats(); ```

FAILED ```  This project has 2 flavours and a library dependency, builds nicely until I changed to put the generated drawables in the build directory ..  Looking at this, I would think that the 'generateReleaseResources' and its respective targets and flavours would be a good spot to hook into.. leaves it later in the build.. Its possible the clean is being done after the dependant library thats built first. 
Sorry, it was my fault. I thought it's not the connection because another signal user told me he has the same problem, but this router blocks voip, this was the problem. I still didn't get a debug report. 
I am seeing the problem with normal table names like MASTER or CUSTOMER.
A weekend has passed... Have you release the new build? 
It still exists. Small fireballs don't explode, they only set blocks on fire where they hit. No OExplosion involved as far as I can tell. 
I just did => my bad, didn't thought to send a crash report !! 
It is set to internal storage. i.e. not on the sdcard but in the private storage of the app itself.
You can see the failed executions there. However, you can try any instance yourself. Just try debug from, it fails. 
Everything works now!  Thank you! 
I can't reproduce it, but I remember that everytime I was trying to sync large amounts of data, I got the "Nextcloud doesn't respond" Android message and when I ignored the message and tried to use the app, it crashed.
Zperms, same issue with PEX I believe. 
Yeah, that's a good point.  So the widget plus some adapter that listens to the network state conveniently? 
i i think so, but is is hard to reproduce, because i don't know the situation

It seems to be more than just updating this script, in the end, as several bundles seem to not be living in the org.eclipse.kapua.\* namespace anymore - at least the jars aren't?

I'm running Elasticsearch's tests. Heartbeat interval looks like its set to 10 (is that seconds?).  Is there a way I can attach a debugger to the forked JVMs? Such as by passing an environment variable or some such to pass the right debugger options?  Could something be happening that causes the Forked JVM to stall before getting to bootstrap event?
@srowen will do, the language is kotlin
Yup this works: ```diff import { Client, Configuration } from 'rollbar-react-native'; import Config from 'react-native-config'; import { Platform } from 'react-native'; import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info';  const codeVersion = `${Config.TRAVIS_COMMIT || 'development'}.${Platform.OS}`;  const config = new Configuration(Config.ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN, {   enabled: !__DEV__, + captureDeviceInfo: false,   payload: {     appVersion: DeviceInfo.getBuildNumber(),     codeBundleId: codeVersion,     client: {       javascript: {         source_map_enabled: true,         guess_uncaught_frames: true,         code_version: codeVersion,       },     },   }, });  export const rollbar = new Client(config); ```  Thanks for the quick reply! Do you have any docs on what info it collects? I may just stay at the old version if there's something useful in there.

Exactly, I guess the application is still running in the background in some way. Going to application manager in Android and chosing "Force stop" and then launching it again solves the problem 
Yes, it is on master, but I'll fit it :-)
@tangiel That works, thanks, we'll use that as a workaround for the moment.

@mshaposhnik As far as I understand you propagate your own InternalInfrastructureException. To be sure that it is a client-side issue it is needed to reproduce original steps when there is no free docker network. P.S. You can create networks with `docker network create anystr` command.
Hi!   We're working on making this into an reproducible test case, keeping the minimum needed for it to work and also checking if there is no other component that might interfere.  In the meantime, there is some additional info/clarifications: - what I named as _staging_ are experimental versions that we run _internally_ with _live_ accounts - on a few debug runs (on emulators) had also missing calls to Listener methods, sadly i'm not able to reproduce the case. I suspect this has something to do with cleaning the build and/or rebuilding the project. - i need to confirm if our implementation of `connectionAcquired()` has some `null reference` issues with `connection.socket()`  I'll keep you updated!
What do you mean by inplace rebuild? Reindex into the same index? If so, it is recommended to reindex data into a fresh index (so less deleted docs in lucene). 
I checked for updates and there were none. I'm on Roku 3.

@marcbaechinger it does not freeze just the video. The entire app becomes unresponsive and after a while it crashes. Next week I see if I can get my hands on the device and create a report
I do not see anything which could make a difference.  It is hard to tell anything from the above information. The best would be to try to reproduce it. Though I don't have much time to take care of it. I will talk about it within a team to see if it is possible to take it into a sprint.

In swagger UI, the behaviour changes for this test:  ```java package org.acme.quickstart;  import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.GET; import javax.ws.rs.Path; //import javax.ws.rs.PathParam; import javax.ws.rs.Produces; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;  import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.jaxrs.PathParam;  @Path("/hello/{path}") public class GreetingResource {      @GET     @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) //    @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)     public String hello(@PathParam("path") String path) {         return "hello "+path;     } } ```  As I said, with JAX-RS's `@PathParam`, the behaviour is the same with or without the `@Consume`, but if you use RESTEasy's `@PathParam`, Swagger UI requires a body if you add the `@Consume`
It seems the code is using -1 to indicate an invalid id for all tablets with walog disabled.   When the walog is disabled, tablets get a walog id of -1. As long as the walog is disabled, define tablet events should not be written to the walog.  However I think the define tablet events are being written in some situations. 
All connection normal. 
@wu-sheng good idea, i'll prepare to find the AOP code to filter enhanced method
Sure, go ahead and remove. We can still support the `updated` filter in the meantime right?  
Well, what do you know! That's what it was. I changed the banner one of the bannermen was wearing to a new one I summoned via command block, namely this:  ``` /give @p minecraft:banner 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Base:1,Patterns:[{Pattern:flo,Color:0},{Pattern:mr,Color:0},{Pattern:mc,Color:1},{Pattern:sc,Color:0},{Pattern:bs,Color:1},{Pattern:ts,Color:1},{Pattern:flo,Color:0},{Pattern:tts,Color:0},{Pattern:gra,Color:0}]}} ```  I dunno why it shouldn't work, but I guess I'll stick to more vanilla banners for now. 
My sample project is based on spring-boot 2.2.4.RELEASE and spring-cloud Hoxton.SR1  that is spring-cloud-starter-sleuth and spring-cloud-starter-gateway 2.2.1.RELEASE 
Sure install Beyond Reality Via AT Launcher Use newest version. Load it up check on iron/gold or what ever ores are loaded by default via the xml https://github.com/CrazyPants/EnderIO/blob/master/resources/assets/enderio/config/OreDictionaryPreferences_Core.xml Now remove EnderIO and check the exact recipes. 
@dsyer - spring-boot with tomcat works well. I've been using it for a couple weeks now  @snicoll - I haven't tried vanilla/standalone jetty. I do regularly use the maven jetty plugin and the gradle jetty plugin though.  I'm willing to dig into this more, though it might be a few days. 
the status is that they will not be moved until we have decided how to build them:  1. Manifest-first (Tycho/PDE) 2. POM-first (maven-bundle-plugin)  how to include them in the user workspace zip archive (if this still makes sense). As all the examples are still in eclipse/kura I'd prefer if they all built the same.
I can't reproduce the issue of sign-out now....

@shekhar16 What is the purpose of the `if(!update){` statement in the `case FILE:`?  [oxTrust issue #384](https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxTrust/commit/6c16f2072c1641fb41d5533224105ed371acc14d)  https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxTrust/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/gluu/oxtrust/action/UpdateTrustRelationshipAction.java#L285-L287  Above is the cause of this issue. Please review. I am disabling the `if` for now. 
Hi, the issue also happens with signed tokens - I just narrowed the reproducer down to the most simple case. It seems as if the ZLIB compression implementation changed between 0.10.6 and 0.10.7 but I couldn't find any related issue attached to the version.
Anything like this does the job on Safari, but not on Chrome / Firefox (where the same circle is serialized to approx. ~13k / 6k message size, both of which arrive without any issue at cineast). So it is most likely a Safari problem. However, i think i've encountered the problem already on chrome / firefox. It seems also to depend on the size of the sketched circle, small circles do not crash. ![Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 09 22 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14314470/71156879-34117780-2241-11ea-86f3-e0d3b52f07ac.png) I suggest keeping this issue open in case someone can reproduce it on firefox / chrome
I did not find any other command with the same problem. 
i was just composting  oak leaves into wooden barrel using hoppers i will get mod list for you soon list: [print.txt](https://github.com/BloodWorkXGaming/ExNihiloCreatio/files/1423995/print.txt) 
This is the Java code that i use to print the `MetaData`  ```java private void showMetaData() {          OrganizationInfoRequest request = OrganizationInfoRequest.builder()                 .name(ORG_NAME).build();         OrganizationDetail organizationDetail = cfOps.organizations().get(request).block();           GetOrganizationRequest getOrganizationRequest= GetOrganizationRequest.builder()                 .organizationId(organizationDetail.getId())                 .build();          GetOrganizationResponse response = cfOps.getCloudFoundryClient().organizationsV3()                 .get(getOrganizationRequest).block();          Metadata organizationMetadata = response.getMetadata();                  log.info("Metadata from  "+ORG_NAME+" :: "+organizationMetadata.getLabels());      } ```  And i use below two libraries to get the `Metadata`  ``` compile 'org.cloudfoundry:cloudfoundry-client-reactor:3.19.0.RELEASE' compile 'org.cloudfoundry:cloudfoundry-operations:3.19.0.RELEASE' ```
Oh... Interesting, I did not know that was a new feature now!  Ok, well that does change things a **little**, but I'll explain the most basic method of how we would create an item with a recipe in the _old_ RPGItems 3.4 (aka 3.0.4)...  /rpgitem furball create /rpgitem furball display &6A &eGross &7Furball /rpgitem furball lore The result of NyaaCat's excessive preening! /rpgitem furball item firework_charge /rpgitem furball damage 10 15 /rpgitem furball recipe _<place recipe items in a pattern, close menu>_ DONE  What is of note is that the command we used was **/rpgitem <itemname> recipe**. When I attempted to use that command on v3.5.100, it kept coming up with the Help text, and that is when I noticed it would display the "CHANCE" option. So I figured I'll just use 1 (since that generally is 100% in RPGItems), and the Recipe Menu showed up.  _However_, the key here is that we never used the Chance option before, and so it seems that 3.5.xx is imposing its own Chance of 0% if an item lacks a Chance % previously.  **ALSO**, I don't know if this is related or not, but I just received word from one of my Admins that the Quests plugin had delivered the reward (which we have set as executing the RPGItem Give command) as a vanilla item. This item is only obtainable by completing this quest, and so it has NO recipe. 
@bhariharan Unfortunately the issue still exists. Exactly same behaviour as described 
I am running LP 0.8.3.100 which is a little outdated, but due to having to update a whole lot of other mods, is not really within the realm of possibility with the current setup to update.  Hope that helps. 
In this case the update of the database is too slow so the leader lease is lost and the RM loose the leader role and transition to standby. This is what the logs say and this is normal behaviour. The RM does not relinquish its role as leader, it lose it.  What the log does not say and that is the cause of the strange logs we got is that in the transitionToStanby function we force the leader election process to relinquish its id and to get a new one. This was done to give the administrator the possibility to make the leader transition to standby. I can remove it but I'll have to rewrite all the HA tests for this (they use the transitionToStandby admin call to simulate the crash of the scheduler node).  Keeping this is not a problem because once the RM as transitioned to standby it will have to go through a total recovery to become active again, so it has no impact if the new leader is the same RM that kept its id or another node because the previous leader relinquished its id.

That's actually how I solved it for now - but is this a bug or not? (according to the docs it is a bug...) 
Hi Alex,  That is what I thought too that the if-else should be reversed. When I said register, I mean install the service. Install is currently supported (0.90.9) only on Windows OOTB, and I was trying on a Windows 7 laptop (64-bit).

Thanks for the quick resolution. I'm looking forward to the next release.
Yes, Chinese characters.  You can see that, in the `Properties` pannel, the **Description** of the `articletag` table is "文章标签", and in the **Columns** pannel, the `Comment` of the `name` column is "标签名称", these are readable.  But in the **DDL** pannel, the comments are unreadable. I think the character encoding was handled incorrectly in the **DDL** pannel. I used MySQL Workbench export the structure of  the `articletag` table: <img width="505" alt="2017-09-05 10 24 03" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1210634/30042551-98a34a16-9224-11e7-8a41-7a375bb72382.png"> The comments are readable.
> Does this scenario work in Eclipse?  It does.
It also happens at 100% zoom in my Chrome/Win7. The 23px height fix in coref.css works for single underscores – maybe we should try to find some solution to automatically set table height by max number of nested underscores, or change the markup strategy completely?

Did you zoom into the page as well or did this occur also with a "100%" zoom?  — Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/korpling/ANNIS/issues/362#issuecomment-62013023 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/ACFlW_ehu2EV4pLOuljY7QJEBJtllY8Qks5nK6ErgaJpZM4CysZR.gif

How can I invoke / debug the sandbox? I don't see any kind of tests on `src/main/tools/BUILD` or files. Any easy way of running it on gdb? 
Did you try the above steps? The key is having both the system (latest) gcc/clang + conda clang. 
I tried to reproduce it but wasn't able to. It seems the issue has been fixed! Last time I remember seing it was 2 or 3 weeks ago. Since, we moved our frontends to n1-standard-2 instances, maybe it's linked?  I let you close the issue if you want to. I'll reopen it if I see it again in the future.  Thanks! 
Yes, I changed the options listed in the migration guide:  ``` #alt#auth=ldap uv.security.auth=ldap  #alt##uv.security.ldap.url=ldap://localhost uv.security.directory-service.ldap=ldap://localhost  #alt#uv.security.ldap.sync=false uv.security.directory-service.ldap.sync.enabled=false  ```  Isn't that enough? Should I delete the lines with #alt#?

Well, can we make it look for either `node.exe`, `node` or `nodejs` then? 
@CPColin inside the `if` block, the type of `e` is narrowed to      <I | OverflowException> & RuntimeException  which is also      <I & RuntimeException> | <OverflowException & RuntimeException>  The type checker (falsely) believes that `RuntimeException` and `OverflowException` are disjoint, so the above type simplifies to      <I & RuntimeException> | Nothing  Or, simply `I & RuntimeException`.  The invocation `e.oops()` is legal, since `I & RuntimeException` has a member `oops()`.

@tobiasKaminsky I did some further testing with a dedicated test account and found out that the root cause seems to be related to the use of an external WebDAV share. As soon as I mark files or folders as a favorite they got doubled. If I use a local file system everything works as expected. I'll send you a test account to android at nextcloud dot com asap.
Yes I fully agree with that, we are handling this now outside RaH already, however white rabbit should not crash. In this case we use Usagi to map a column to a concept_id using the overview table of White Rabbit :)  I do not have the message myself, it was reported to me.

I'm running Win7 64bits, and using JUnit to run a test (surefire maven plugin).  Tests are exactly in the same environment, i only have to change `JAVA_HOME` environnent variable from `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_45` to `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51` and run `mvn test` for the problem to occur.  Maybe it's a performance issue of the JVM, totally unrelated to MapDB ?  Test is an integration test from a closed-source project, using multiple MapDB at the same time with custom serializers. it's measuring performance for about 1 000 000 records and 1000-sized transaction chuncks.  I'll try to write an external unit test showing the performance issue with a unique database ...

The tipper suggests to remove the empty constructor of Bool. Doing that cuases compilation errors, since another constructor exists and the empty constructor is used.

I can't reproduce it either. It's happened exactly once and it was following a change. I was switching branches last night (probably from issue_14[145] to develop.) Figured it was better to document it.  I can't recall any more steps to reproduce than in the original post. 
Seems to be fixed, thank you
I guess that's another issue than this one in any case. Yes, if you are on yesterday's snapshot it will work as it seems to be a regression in Spring Security.

I respect the decision to keep it - but it is simply the principle of deleting a file: when delete, delete forever, from everywhere. Perhaps I could fabricate a few extreme examples in which this small "feature" could expose secrets but I'm sure you know what I mean. 
Yes, I can confirm it does the same on build 1330 but I haven't tried it with builds older than that one.

It's an actual File path pulled from the media store that was constructed by an Android app. I would have hoped that ':' would be invalid in a File path, but apparently it works just fine so we should handle it.  I think it's probably reasonable to assume that anything that starts with '/' is a file path, which would be a relatively easy fix. 
Hi @climbage . Sorry for the delayed response.  My java version is Oracle JDK 7.45. Centos 6.6 This behaviour of hanging only happens for certain value of geometry Point. My work around was to print the Point before calling geodesicDistanceOnWGS84 function. The value of Point that hangs geodesicDistanceOnWGS84 causes printing of the same to crash. I catch the exception and don't call geodesicDistanceOnWGS84 for those odd Point values.  What I have not been able to figure out is in which case I end up creating a Point that manifests this behaviour.  
Yes it works now.

Sorry that I can't upload the pic as privacy. However after I debug this issue, I resolve it with some code adding to the `DicomReader.addInfo()` method as: ```java if(null == this.shortLut) {     this.shortLut = new short[3][]; } this.shortLut[ndx] = new short[this.elementLength / 2]; if(null == this.lut){     this.lut = new byte[3][]; } this.lut[ndx] = new byte[this.elementLength / 2]; ``` The pic has key `Palette Color LUT Data` leads to this issue.
I can't seem to replicate it again. It happened about 3 times so far on accident, but when I go and try to do it the way I did it before, it just works normally with me throwing the sticks or items on the floor. I don't have a crash log that I can find. I checked logs and couldn't find anything about it. Maybe I did something before dragging sticks and clicking the buttons that it didn't like, but trying to replicate it not working...

OK, I've set that up. But the problem normally takes hours to develop. That means it will take a few days to be confident that it will not develop again with the new settings. 
Yes that's the scenario.  Answers: 1. Device A has 90 documents. 2. There is a _load docs_ button on the UI to insert 20 documents at a time. The document properties are the same on each button click. The doc ID is not specified so is uniquely generated by the database.  
This appears to be fixed in the current development version (and rc1).  
It is my fault. No this lib issue. Have to take care which kind of context you used. Check the codes at the permission have granted, if any error happens, error listener will catch it and present.

Hi @janpio, thanks for looking into it. I contacted the company too and they should be looking into it. However, in their defense, the plugin was working until a couple of days ago. I started encountering the issue around 16th November, give and take a day or too. Used to work with the latest cordova and and plugin version up till then, I believe being Cordova 8, cordova-android 7.1.1 and and plugin version 6.1.0.  Re your error being different, the difference is induced when adding the  cordova-android-support-gradle-release plugin and forcing a dependency of support libraries version 27 and upwards.  
Yeah, maybe gui.json is corrupted. Here is: [gui.zip](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/files/1550046/gui.zip) 
Inconsistent but mostly seems to slow down. All ID elements are set to 1tick rates but extraction often slows down to once per second. This also happens a lot while inside a Compact Machine with the item storage claimed via FTB utils and chunkloaded via ChickenChunks.  Since most inputs are always-on farms I cannot easily tell the difference between >5s tick rates and a full stop, will try to test in creative with vanilla nether portals.  **Edit:** tested a bit in creative with the same modpack and could not get a full stop, so it might be a severe slowdown due to the increased load of my "main" world. I _did_ catch the transient end of a slowdown though: the ID transfer system appears to be working at a significantly slower rate while I am in a different dimension despite being chunkloaded.  My test setup consists of a series of TE ducts drawing from an infinite item source into a chest (here: AA large crate, vanilla chest works too). From there ID transfers to a second chest, which is much faster than the ducts while observed directly. The second chest is then emptied into a trash can by a larger number of ducts such that the second chest is always almost empty.  I then enter a nether portal behind me, wait a while in the nether, then go back through the portal and immediately open the first (ID "input") chest. Depending on loading times and waiting time in the nether the chest will contain a significant number of item stacks, which are promptly drained into the second chest and removed as the system picks up speed again once I am in the overworld. I have also observed this behaviour with the ender chests in my compact machines.  Test setup: ![2018-02-27_17 21 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22204328/36743800-75603608-1beb-11e8-8a85-3dcb55061753.png)

Hmm.. I'm not sure, as I've got assigned a new work item.. steps to reproduce where 1. start redis instance 2. log in to the application 3. kill redis instance 4. reload web-page    -> session-cookie is valid, but session is not found in redis, instead of deleting the cookie, it redirects to login page, which instead of deleting the old cookie again redirects and so on..  
Download all feeds the first time the app loads, cache them, download only newer items from the news app and let the user chose how many streams to display. Like k9mail does for mails. And then at the end of this x items per feed something like a button with "show more". That would be my preferred option.  
Now it sorted for the first time (I've tried it about five-ten times)—at least five minutes after opening the Nearby list. @nicolas-raoul Where can I find the logcat? @misaochan I tried it now and also earlier with GPS entirely turned off and GPS turned on before opening the list. (Sometimes I opened the list first by mistake, but usually not.) 
I will be with pleasure to provide a first fix PR soon.
Yes the most recent versions of both. I can't get a crash log because there technically wasn't a crash, but when that spams in the server log a thousand times a pop, the server is unresponsive for like 15 seconds and it happens about every 30 seconds

It looks like there is a different problem. I was trying to put together a PR to fix the line length and I realized what @svilenvul mentioned - line length is not one of the checks in the rules.xml.  So digging into this some more, I found that the rules.xml is not being used at all. Instead, Checkstyle is executing sun_checks.xml (appears to be the default). It looks like the settings from the plugin are not executing, but the the goals are - it runs Checkstyle, FindBugs, and PMD.   Because the properties are not being used, it is dropping the checkstyle-result.xml in target/ rather than target/code-analysis/ so the merge fails and report.html is zero bytes. If I manually copy the checkstyle-result.xml to the code-analysis folder and run again without 'clean' it will generate the report, but it is of course using the default rules.  Originally I was executing as ``` mvn clean install -P check ```  But in response to @kaikreuzer responding to my forum post [here](https://community.openhab.org/t/static-code-analysis-tool/24489/45) I just did a normal  ``` mvn clean install ```  and I got the same result.  I then checked out master from the openhab2-addons repo and ran 'mvn clean install' on the Chromecast binding with the same result:  ``` $ mvn clean install [INFO] Scanning for projects...

@Sirse The forge version is Forge10.13.4.1558-1.7.10 and im using AM2 1.4.0.009 which is the last version made for 1.7.10  I honestly hadnt considered it being a forge issue. I have had other problems with Minefantasy before aswell such as the bloomery and forge not lighting 90% of the time. I usually have to hit it with the light like 30 times before it turns on. Idk if thats a programmed feature or maybe theres something up with a mod conflict, or forge version. Idk.  Im currently just focusing on getting MF2 working as well as possible without removing other mods. So far these have been the only two issues thankfully.
Hi @JeanRev I'm on 0.3.3 (Docker Cloud Plugin Cloud Agent Plugin for Docker containers 0.3.3 (build 27fa717e5e02a9bbc9dc43bb154a2d2b9378e412) - from your previous issue link looks like it was fixed in 0.2.3?  I downloaded the plugin directly from here: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9306-docker-cloud.  Should I build from the repo instead

I'm really sorry that I can't demo this problem again, it just happened by accident
Yes, I checked it during installation and it's in the Users PATH: C:\Program Files\DPF Manager. Also added the path to the SYSTEMS PATH but that did not work either. Perhaps the JRE did not recognize the updated PATH ??? A restart / new login might be required but I am just guessing.  EDIT: cannot be the JRE - forgot, that it is a vbs script running there..... 
The filtered scroll works for main list grids works correctly. It only seems to effect the modal views 
Thanks for the info. The ability to manually override the version is documented in the link I posted above. We'll probably do that.
I have not been able to reproduce this issue since reporting it. At the time of reporting it the bug occurred multiple times each session. I will open another issue if I find a more solid way to reproduce it
Of course! My app tracks BLE devices. I am currently running some first in-house tests with three such devices and one phone. Each document represents one BLE device. - Data/Disk usage for the relevant bucket in Couchbase Console: 32.4MB. - Total number of documents: 3 - Each document contains about 130 revisions on the CB server. - I set database.setMaxRevTreeDepth() to 5, as is probably reflected by a "document.getRevisionHistory().size()" revision history size of 5 in the Forestdb CBLite app. - Size of the mobile database reported by Forestdb CBLite 1.3.1: 74760 bytes (74.76 kb) - See example of one of the three documents (as retrieved from the CB **Server**) here: https://gist.github.com/robinvanemden/fa219f390f71fe017fe438e099100d9e#file-example_birdy_document-js-L149  - I use Sync Gateway 1.3.1 for server (together with Couchbase Server 4.1.1-5914 Community Edition). - It is not easy to replicate the out of memory error, it seems to be thrown irregularly. 
Just tested the EA version and it works flawlessly now (using the JDBC driver provided by DBeaver). Thank you for the fast support.

I just ran a few `git grep` to search through your repository's history for any sign of tesseract, but didn't find any: ``` git grep -i tesseract $(git rev-list --all) git grep -i parse $(git rev-list --all) git grep -i parsecontext $(git rev-list --all) git grep -i parsedContent $(git rev-list --all) ``` It seems that `fscrawler` has always used `parseToString`... unless there is another repository from which you started from, e.g. when it was still named `fsriver`?
When entering a New transaction, I try to search category to choose and when clicked on category fiels it stopped and crashed and goes to the main menu. 
I just changed it from false to true and they're still there, this is how my Premissionsex and Nucleus are set-up to give you an idea what i'm dealing with at the moment. I had to change the file extensions as it wasn't allowing me to upload the files, perrmissions is a .json file and main is .conf :)  [permissions.txt](https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/files/691531/permissions.txt) [main.txt](https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/files/691533/main.txt) 
If I were to guess I think the problem is in [this line](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/blob/master/processor/src/main/resources/org.mapstruct.ap.model.MapMappingMethod.ftl#L22).  
One minute and I'll test it. If I can't, then you will need to set the minimum required Forge version. 
Android Version 6.0
So... question 0) Perhaps this is the simplest solution - as this is all I've done to get it to work and it now works like a champ. question 1) aapt is the only tool that can't be found upon update. I do like the idea of defensively checking that the required tools are available before launch. The error message only told me that aapt was missing. I wouldnt have known to look at my path without realizing that Android has moved the locations of it's tools in the past and this cluing me in. question 2) I had both of these in there. My path now looks like `$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/17.0.0` 
No I wanna set it as executable
Hi @jaikiran, I tested with Java 11 and Java 8 and both are working well.  Here is all the generated files in target with Java 13 ``` ├───classes │   │   application.properties │   │ │   ├───be │   │   └───devoxx │   │           ExampleResource.class │   │ │   └───META-INF │       └───resources │               index.html │ ├───generated-sources │   └───annotations ├───maven-status │   └───maven-compiler-plugin │       └───compile │           └───default-compile │                   createdFiles.lst │                   inputFiles.lst │ └───wiring-devmode  ```  FYI, `mvn package` passes in Java 13. It builds the 'runner' jar that I can run and see the result on http://localhost:8080  EDIT: I checked your PR linked to this issue. Here is the JVM command line in dev mode (and the error again): ``` [DEBUG] Launching JVM with command line: [C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13\bin\java.EXE, -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1, -Xverify:none, -Xdebug, -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=n, -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager, -jar, C:\Users\bdese\workspace\code-with-quarkus\target\code-with-quarkus-dev.jar] Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: Options -Xverify:none and -noverify were deprecated in JDK 13 and will likely be removed in a future release. Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005 Error: Could not find or load main class io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.quarkus.dev.DevModeMain ``` I hope this will help.
1.0.1 behaves the same, and so does 1.0.0. Both freeze.
@tobiasKaminsky i translated the dialogs.
Hello @giraud!  I followed your suggestion and invalidated caches - all good now! I did try that before, but I also updated IDEA this time. Perhaps either a batched update process, or maybe the plugin was depending on something that wasn't in the old version. I have preference folders for 2016.2 and 2017.3 in ~/Library/Preferences.
yes its similar....i will send the code...

We spoke the other day to confirm they should be reenabled, but considering that change, I'll let him comment again. 
Are you referring to [AtomicInteger](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicInteger.html) ? I'm not convinced that it's a thread safety issue anymore (see last comment), but changing to AtomicNumber would certainly be a good idea, just to be sure. thanks !
Thanks for having a look into this. - Exception is thrown with every log statement after channel has closed.  - The channel closes always at the same log statement, why I don't know.  - The next entries in the stacktrace are from classes from our application (can't disclose).   I googled a bit, would you please have a look at:  https://github.com/t0xa/gelfj/issues/87#issuecomment-99060182 and https://github.com/t0xa/gelfj/commit/15842b8b7d0950cbf2d67dbe028fe2e4fb328122    
It would be difficult because of all deprecated gateways that are still there. 
The thing is it breaks if you enable merge paths but doesn't if you turn them off.  I have the same behavior in my flutter port and I'm looking for clarification on these mappings.  Flutter's been great.  I nearly have parity with the Android version and I'm hoping to release an initial version soon (need a PR I have open in the engine to land that enables path measure and path operations).
Sure, here you go. [teamcity-server.log](https://github.com/PeteGoo/tcSlackBuildNotifier/files/2026490/teamcity-server.log) 
Okay , I'll test it later on my other machine. While we are on the subject of animations. I can't remember if this was reported or not but when you load animated .blend files it says they are converted but it only imports the .blend. You can still right click and convert to .j3o. 
You are right, sorry. It's the findbugs maven plugin. I'll annoy them instead.  Thanks for the prompt reply. 
I just tried rstudio-1.2.846-amd64.deb daily build and get the same result.  It looks like it is to do with my window manager. It works fine on Gnome, but has the problem when I'm using the Awesome tiling window manager (which is clearly not very awesome with Rstudio :)  I'll investigate with the Awesome folks.

The exact ecid. Just paste your ecid into iCloud, select and copy it and then paste it into blobsaver
I think there is no other way, but i might be wrong Anyway, it would be better if `%arg 0%` will return alias

Thanks @Cliffus , its not super urgent, just using this ExpandableTextView on a project I am working on. I'm pretty sure it has to do with m layout as it is a bit complex.

If you can recommend a Curse modpack with a server package, I can test it.
@maosongfu agree with Taishi's comment. This should be a MM design issue. will look into this today. 
I recreated it in the simplest way(cobblegen & furnace) with the 3 storage/inventory spaces(1st furnace, 2nd barrel, 3rd void) and wasn't able to replicate the overflow. A pic of the test build is included, so if u want too i'll be able to show u the treefarm build on server to give u a first person view of it if that'll help.

I'm using the latest version. The ingots seem to work properly, but I can't process the ores using the thaumatorium, nor can I grind them up using factorization machines. 
Thanks for investigating.  Yes, it seems to happen with all queries.  These are named parameters. I'm happy for the previous value to be remembered when I run the script, but when I change the value assigned to the named parameter, it's currently reverting to the value from the previous run.  As mentioned, this is PL/SQL script, e.g.something like  ``` DECLARE     v_param1  VARCHAR2(1000) := :MYPARAM1;     v_param2  VARCHAR2(1000) := :MYPARAM2;     BEGIN     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_param1);     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_param2); END; ```  I am executing the code by highlighting from the entire code block and then pressing Ctrl+ENTER.  My OS is Ubuntu 16.04.
working on it now
I think that I can't use a more updated package cause I'm on a **32** bits macs. Version 1.1.463 – © 2009-2018 RStudio, Inc. Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/601.7.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) The .dmg current version file that I've put on my computer can't be installled. Is it possible to find a fix ?
I am not sure how to separate Optifine and LiteLoader from Forge.
hey @rucquoy ! I think this would be a great thing to take a stab at. If you don't mind, it would be great to get a build together so that @lime124 could see how it feels on device (with these changes).   Thanks so much!
> @k7aravind 1.8.1 is the latest production release (1.7.x should be considered deprecated). Can you tell us what error you are getting?  Can you please tell me how can i see the logs. This is what happens, when I try to open the jnlp file through command prompt using 'javaws abc.jnlp', it works. But if I try to open using windows 'Open With' option, it doesn't. It does not even open any command prompt to  logs things that are happening. This happens only in 1.8 version. Whereas in 1.7.x, even when I open jnlp with 'Open With' option, it immediately opens command prompt where I can see the logs and icedtea-web looks to be working fine.
Win7 The problem disappears when I close rbtray
So thats the trick with double space! :D Didn't know that...  I use Ubunut Linux 13.04, so the numlock issue must probably be os related. 
No I do not.  I try [this](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/CrashReporter) to capture the log, and the folder is empty too, no exceptions at all.
@mernst I have updated the steps to reproduce the issue. I have also modified JDK's makefile to build only `determinism` JDK. 
That happened in 2.1 rc5. Almost sure that it can happen on 2.1 
@smalyshev might be able to help you out.
Yes, I think that would be the safest option. It's a backward incompatible change at client level (if one uses the cookie value), so we should still support unencoded values based on a setting.
I'm located at Germany, so no geoblocking issue, I guess. I used v1.0.0 and 1.0.1 having this error message. I also tried v1.1.0. After hearing a sound for a fraction of a second the playback stops saying "Es gab einen Fehler beim Abspielen. Vielleicht besteht keine Internetverbindung." The logs don't seem to be useful, ChannelDetailActivity report no errors:  2016-10-06 05:07:07,INFORMATION,ActivityManager,Android-System,Displayed de.christinecoenen.code.zapp/.ChannelDetailActivity: +335ms 2016-10-06 05:07:07,INFORMATION,Timeline,Android-System,Timeline: Activity_windows_visible id: ActivityRecord{1ba3c435 u0 de.christinecoenen.code.zapp/.ChannelDetailActivity t2136} time:8201259 2016-10-06 05:07:08,DEBUG,ChannelDetailActivity,Zapp,play: Das Erste  However, once I got this Message: 2016-10-06 05:00:27,DEBUG,Cache,Zapp,cache miss: ZDF, show too old  Hope this helps! 
Ok i'm sorry, i need to clarify this issue, apparently.  It's not that /back isn't doing the correct thing, it is?  What's doing the wrong thing is the respawn location when you have backondeath permission.  I'm being told the respawn location after death is somewhat random?  Not sure why that would be  https://pastebin.com/J8bzr7Yu  My recent experience has been to respawn in the last location I had tped to before I'd died last instead of the death location, that... is not very helpful.  I don't know if my configuration needs to be updated for changes in a later build to deal with a change or what.   Death doesn't have to happen, I'm having similar issues just logging back on... and being taken back to the last place I tped to instead of the place I logged out from.  This didn't used to happen so... thinking it may be a recent thing.
Confirmed, seeing this in 0.13.0. I'll try 0.14.0 shortly to confirm and close this out once I have.

@joshiste  Sorry for late response.  It's inside of docker.  And I use it with spring cloud config and spring cloud eureka.  The spring cloud version is Camden.RELEASE.  Here is the application:  ``` @EnableAdminServer @EnableDiscoveryClient @SpringBootApplication public class SpringBootAdminServer {      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {         SpringApplication.run(SpringBootAdminServer.class, args);     }  } ```  and my pom.xml is:  ```         <dependency>             <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>             <artifactId>jolokia-core</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-admin-server</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-admin-server-ui</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-admin-server-ui-activiti</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-admin-server-ui-hystrix</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-boot-admin-starter-client</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>             <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-eureka</artifactId>         </dependency> ``` 
Nop, but like I see map-writer not use javax.xml.bind.
Thanks for the quick response. The whole stack trace is extremely long, but I'll paste it in at the bottom of this comment along with the log messages from the start of the manual version creation. As far as I can tell the effective time is populated in the extension files.

Thanks @kurtharriger, I tried to add that bean to my app but after that I couldn't see any tracing at all on the logs, not sure if that is something that needs to be set inside Sleuth itself?

Stephen, having only lines and source makes debugging inside Joda-time library pretty useless - yes, I can step through code, but vars should still be calculated on paper. Vars add almost negligible overhead, but give a huge benefit for any contributor/curious mind. 
> What is known about this bug? Is it necessary to disable this function in all existing applications?  I do not know the reason behind it (I guess somewhere the direction of the geometry is wrong stored when filling the gaps in the optimize). It would be probably safe for now to do disable it, yes. But somehow I and others did not see this anywhere else ... 
Hmm, I disagree it's working as intended. First of all the `app:elevation` property is there. There is also code around it, that tries to set the elevation - it doesn't work.  I've just done quick research about that and found this https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/issues/652, which is also an indication that something is wrong here.  My point here is, there is no clear documentation around `app:elevation` and `android:elevation`. I had to spend some time investigating why there is no elevation there. Wanted to highlight this to people working on the library and maybe make someone else's life easier in the future.  
same behavior on both the ASUS Transformer Infinity and Samsung Galaxy Relay running CM 10.2.1.  this might be related to having a firewall up but both firefox and apktrack are allowed through. 
Thank you for fixing this. It's loading now and seems a bit faster. I guess there's no duration if both timestamps match? 
@yegor256 Thanks. I merged your changes into PR https://github.com/yegor256/rultor/pull/753 and it is building now. If the problem is fixed there, I'll close this issue. 
Yegor, sounds good. The only issue is that with "fully hardcoded" file name you won't be able to run several builds simultaneously, what is usually done on build servers. So I would name this parameter like socketDirectory (which is equal to "data" parameter by default) and use file names like "mysql-2013-12-25-14-00-48-<random>.sock".  As another alternative (to simplify things for users), you can add parameter like "useTempAsDataDir {true|false}". If this option is true - a random directory is created inside temp on every build. If this option is false, data is located according to "data" parameter. Disadvantage of this solution is that your plugin will be needed to determine "temp" directory location and this is platform-dependent thing (don't know whether Java allows to do it automatically or not).  Another solution would be to introduce option like "dataParentDirectory". User will point you to parent directory like "/tmp" or "c:\windows\temp" and all you need is to create random subdirectory there by yourself. This is easier, but less elegant.

Otherwise, the command errors. I think the tool should be able to take CollectSequencingArtifactMetrics whether run using Picard or GATK. I say this since folks may have these metrics from old runs before the as-of-yet-available Picard tools in the GATK jar.   
There are overlap on keybinds for MPS but none that are set in the gui.  Also no files are marked read only and all users have all permissions to the folder. 
Very possible. I’ll upgrade and verify when I’m back to a computer.

Oh, is it not meant to land you at the other celestial gateway? I assumed it was to land you on top of the other one. I do apologize if this is working as intended, it just seemed very odd to me.
Testing without AR is too impacting. Would be easier if sponge booted in single player.
Sadly and somewhat embarassingly, no. The problems went away with the new installation, and we couldn't think of anything that might have caused the issue. I thought some indices Xtext builds in the background may have been corrupted, and that there is some way of causing them to be rebuilt. If that could not be it, feel free to close the issue. 
Thanks for your response, I'll try reinstalling the plugin.  It seems to be any day. I can only look at my time entries for today because the "formattedDate" query parameter is not set when you first open the time tracker.  Here's the form data sent (when I clicked the ">" button): date:12/07/2016  dayNext:> endOrDuration:end startTime:18:03 endTime:17:43 comments:  And in another instance (I selected a date on the calendar):  date:29/07/2016  datesubmit:Submit endOrDuration:end startTime:18:03 endTime:17:49 comments:  In both cases the URL has "?dateFormatted=12/07/2016" at the end. 
@lbeurerkellner I can't reproduce this bug either. Maybe it happened in the early days when we moved to Eclipse and the system was not stable?
Do you have only one SSL certificate on that server?  As far as I know, that problem only occurs if your server provides multiple certificates for different domains (SNI), in that case, the app, if it doesn't support SNI, will just use a "random" certificate (maybe first or last of the server config I guess, depends on the server).  When using ssl i can't activate the service; "test" will fail with a generic error as far as I remember. I am not in possession of the phone right now :) I will report back if I have any more information.  Here my concrete example: - My picture gallery is located at https://pics.stefanwienert.de, that cert is valid etc.pp - But, if connecting without SNI, like:  ``` $ openssl s_client -connect pics.stefanwienert.de:443 [...snip...] --- Certificate chain  0 s:/CN=fahrrad-filter.de    i:/C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3  1 s:/C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3    i:/O=Digital Signature Trust Co./CN=DST Root CA X3 --- ```  I just receive any certificate (for another of my domains fahrrad-filter.de). 
I see the following error in my error log from `fr.kazejiyu.discord.rpc.integration`: ``` org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Project 'Discord Bot' is not open. 	at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project.checkAccessible(Project.java:144) 	at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkAccessibleAndLocal(Resource.java:215) 	at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.getPersistentProperty(Resource.java:1125) 	at fr.kazejiyu.discord.rpc.integration.ui.preferences.properties.ProjectPropertiesPage.setMissingPropertiesToDefault(ProjectPropertiesPage.java:131) 	at fr.kazejiyu.discord.rpc.integration.ui.preferences.properties.ProjectPropertiesPage.createContents(ProjectPropertiesPage.java:84) 	at org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferencePage.createControl(PreferencePage.java:241) 	at org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferenceDialog.createPageControl(PreferenceDialog.java:1426) 	at org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferenceDialog$8.run(PreferenceDialog.java:1193) 	at org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:42) 	at org.eclipse.ui.internal.JFaceUtil.lambda$0(JFaceUtil.java:44) ``` `Discord Bot` is one of many projects in my workspace, and as the error message says, I have closed it. Does this software handle closed projects properly?
I see it opening and I can navigate it but as soon as I click to "choose" a file, it closes, I get that exception and the app crashes or freezes. 
I installed it via https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/playonlinux5-git/ which uses phoenicis-dist.zip. 
It happens on every video i download, even when the video is 60fps.
I download the game from PlayStore, tab on the icon and it throws that error message: "Happy Can has stopped": https://imgbbb.com/image/LRj62G  Exception class: java.lang.verifyError 
Nope.
As always I try to pinpoint the source of my problem as best as I can before posting in the correct place.  So yes I have already disable all plugins and have defaulted all settings.  > > Hopefully this issue wont go unseen for months like the issue I pointed out with the always respawning at map spawn. >  > I have never seen a bug report for this, I fixed it because I saw the bug in the code while updating. > (Just wanted to clear that up)  I don't mean to to argue but the bug that I was referring to that went on for a while is the one where your spawn point was not saved and you respawned at the map's default spawn point every time you died.  Not sure if this happened more than once but this bug dragged on for about 2 crows and a stable Canary build before it was fixed when I noticed it.  Here's where I requested to be fixed: http://forums.canarymod.net/?topic=3171.0  Which was fixed by commits:  Fixed bug regarding server crash when your bed is destroyed. (Somners) https://github.com/FallenMoonNetwork/CanaryMod/commit/93651f6f8270bcff442a4af51454a39c6aabc627  AND  Fix bed re-spawn issue, I hope. (WWOL) https://github.com/FallenMoonNetwork/CanaryMod/commit/49e48c81500585ac97b72be54cae8d9ed068ed22  ---  Anyway if you're talking about the current bug (respawn at death point) then let me know if that's the one you've already fixed so I can be quiet and we can dismiss this case.  Thanks. 
Hey @koke,  sorry for not being clear here, I have updated the description based on @mkevins explanation.  If something else needs to be changed, please let me know. Thanks.
Technically this is not in production since the generated tests are not running in CI, but it fails when I run them manually on api-client-staging repository.  Regarding `write`: that's fair enough. In that case maybe we want to switch the design back to the original one -- I remember that originally `mockStream.write()` was placed at the end of the each test case but I recommended to move into the common `mockServerStreamingGrpcMethod` in a PR.
I reinstalled 4.2.5, and both action works. I'll retry 4.2.6 tomorrow. I'm not doing anything fancy on 4.2.6, just go the place, right click, create new XXX, get an error. Will post video if I can reproduce when I upgrade tomorrow.
I uninstalled Orbot and now looks like everything is ok. I don't know if Orbot was the reason to this problem. 
Hi   Sorry, so the complete context is that we have a container running latest Jetty 9.3.10.v20160621 and unfortunately we're stuck with that. CometD Java however is using 9.2.18.v20160721.  Between 9.2.18.v20160721 and 9.3.10.v20160621 there have been some refactorings within the Jetty library, and trying to use CometD with 9.3.10.v20160621 generates the issue below:  ``` ! Suppressed: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.server.pathmap.PathSpec !   at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:381) !   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424) !   at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:331) !   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357) !   ... 52 common frames omitted ! Causing: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/jetty/websocket/server/pathmap/PathSpec !   at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredConstructors0(Native Method) !   at java.lang.Class.privateGetDeclaredConstructors(Class.java:2671) !   at java.lang.Class.getConstructor0(Class.java:3075) !   at java.lang.Class.getConstructor(Class.java:1825) !   at org.cometd.server.BayeuxServerImpl.newServerTransport(BayeuxServerImpl.java:317) !   at org.cometd.server.BayeuxServerImpl.initializeServerTransports(BayeuxServerImpl.java:229) !   at org.cometd.server.BayeuxServerImpl.doStart(BayeuxServerImpl.java:128) !   at org.eclipse.jetty.util.component.AbstractLifeCycle.start(AbstractLifeCycle.java:68) !   at org.cometd.server.CometDServlet.init(CometDServlet.java:67) !   at javax.servlet.GenericServlet.init(GenericServlet.java:244) !   at org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder.initServlet(ServletHolder.java:640) !   at org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHolder.initialize(ServletHolder.java:419) !   at org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler.initialize(ServletHandler.java:875) ```  So what happens is that`JettyWebSocketTransport` is using `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.server.pathmap.ServletPathSpec` which is now deprecated https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.3.x/jetty-websocket/websocket-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/websocket/server/pathmap/ServletPathSpec.java  Now that wouldn't be the end of the world normally, but the problem is that this class was not only deprecated but also refactored from  ``` public class ServletPathSpec extends PathSpec ```  (where the `PathSpec` was actually `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.server.pathmap.PathSpec`)  to   ``` public class ServletPathSpec extends org.eclipse.jetty.http.pathmap.ServletPathSpec ```  which in turn is  ``` public class ServletPathSpec extends PathSpec ```  (where `PathSpec` here is now `org.eclipse.jetty.http.pathmap.PathSpec` instead)  So at runtime when an instance of `JettyWebSocketTransport` is created, an instance of `ServletPathSpec` is requested as part of initialisation, which in turn will trigger a classloader lookup, with the expectation to find a `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.server.pathmap.PathSpec` which doesn't exist anymore.  What's more important is that there could be a series of such things that would break at runtime, and these would prevent running CometD on more recent versions of Jetty. 
Checked recently with latest master, controller Main is running fine.
Indeed, in some situation this argument might be null and I'm not checking it. I will check it. Thank you for your fast answer! 
yes here: https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/blob/master/systemtests/src/test/java/io/enmasse/systemtest/standard/QueueTest.java#L213 address shouldn't be removed before all messages are sent/received
Yeah for sure. I have connected
@Azquelt Thanks for the info.  We will look into it.
It does not work in negative longitude areas.  If we want render a shadow, from maptileLeftLng=-3.66 to  maptileRightLng=-3.25 then  int shadingLeftLng = (int) maptileLeftLng = -3 and we want it to be -4, because if not, the code inside the for loop is not executed.   
I try using this other library https://github.com/rubensousa/ViewPagerCards. This works. But I like your library style  
Here is the result of your suggested change. Sorry, what do you mean by command line args in terminal view? I am debugging direclty using F5.

Hmm, I apparently had something wrong in my `logback.xml`. I had a second logger defined that was actually not declared (and somehow I thought this second one was working), something like:  ``` <root level="ALL">     <appender-ref ref="logcat" /> </root> <root level="ALL">     <appender-ref ref="something_weird" /> </root> ```  More than preventing the trace of "logcat" to work, it was then doubling the debug of it. Interesting behavior... :-)  Thanks a lot for your help!
The reference to the topic (which is named for example 'iris10-20%.dita') in the DITA Map is correct and it looks like this:           <topicref href="topics/flowers/iris10-20%25.dita"/>
@eivantsov you're right, now it works fine.
@tsmaeder It is just a display problem, the workaround is to view the keys via user preferences API
Yes, that's wright. Channels can't be controlled and states are not updated.
> I have drafted a fix for this. Could you try out the attached snapshot build to see if it works for you? [#596 (comment)](https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-java/pull/596#issuecomment-484120761)  Thanks for the quick response. Unfortunately it behaves the same way.
I've tried all three options. The above FO was generated with generate.copy.outer=1. 
This fixed the problem. Thank you very much! 
pull request created and looks like its confirmed let me know when you can merge trunk or is it going on the next version? 
Im currently using Alpha Hack and Servicehack and I cannot reproduce too. This happened to me once. Im using the Sony Xperia Z1 compact(Android 5.1.1) 
No, I dont't. But I receive a lot of reports (up to 10/s) and a lot of them with the same cause. Maybe it's timing or threading problem. In my Database i have 4 entries with same stacktrace text, same version_code and version_name but different bug_id (and id).

Unfortunately it's part of a large code base with significant dependencies.  Also, it doesn't fail when run on its own; I have to run some number of other tests first (ugh), although the database is cleared before each test using `MATCH (n) OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]-() DELETE n,r`.  This isn't terribly surprising since it is a concurrency issue, but it is a bit of a nuisance for debugging.  My understanding of the locking in Cypher is that locks should only be released at the end of the transaction, not in between queries.  Is there any condition in 2.2 where locks would be released early?  That seems to be what is happening. If you have no idea how it could happen, I could try to reproduce it in a minimal test case, but it could take a while. 
Sure,  The java Main class is very simple and it is not included in the .jar file:  ``` package org.xjsinterop.samples.video;  import org.xjsinterop.dsl.run_;  public class Player {  	public static void main(String[] args) { 		run_.run(); 	} }   ```  The ceylon run function is very simple:   ``` "Run the module `org.xjsinterop.dsl`." shared void run() {     print("Teste"); }  ```   I've renamed the file to jar.zip, because Github rejects .jar file extensions.  [org.xjsinterop.dsl-1.0.0.jar.zip](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm/files/1011929/org.xjsinterop.dsl-1.0.0.jar.zip)   
Ok maybe THAT was the issue?  The primary group, that is.  Except that "/custom" came back as a 'Unknown Command...' even with the files present, so that may be something else or... i just have to do a total server restart every time I add one.  I couldn't get it to work before even with the primary groups on info but, it does appear to be working as advertised now, at least on the /einfo command.  Maybe had been a problem with a previous build I had that got patched along the way, I don't know.  There wasn't anything helpful in debug since... it acts like the command was never  even attempted.
There was no output in the window where I ran `bin/che.sh start -i` when I attempted to goto definition (F4) or autocomplete (however, in that case I think I was using they wrong key binding.)  I did not use the java stack or use the default template. I do have jdk 1.8 on my stack machine. The Maven project type is selected for the project and Update dependencies worked the second time I ran it.  Since that workspace broke (#286). I created a new workspace. Now Update dependencies fails. Here is the output from my last attempt:  ``` [INFO] Scanning for projects... [INFO] Scanning for projects... [INFO] Scanning for projects...

This might be related to some race conditions regarding logging and similar "cache modifying" actions. Caches get overwritten more often than they should.

Hello Kay Sure, I did import all default patterns. I did not check for those messages, but will do. It seems to be some misinterpretation of some characters. For example: a numbered field identified as INT is not recognized on gl. Changing to some string, it goes on. On the debugger, this doesn't happen. I'll get that error message and drop to you.

The API http://localhost:8080/UI/script/action/enable// is not asking me any path

Can you test this fix and possibly submit a PR?  I can verify (with unit tests) that changing the check `&& FileUtil.getIntFromFile(f.getName()) > 0;` at line 66 to `&& FileUtil.getIntFromFile(f.getAbsolutePath()) > 0;`  fixes the issue.   I changed to unit test SensorsTest to verify the value is greater then 0 in stead of >=: `assertTrue(s.getCpuTemperature() > 0d && s.getCpuTemperature() <= 100d);`

I have tried it with blank, Java, Java-Mysql, C++ and custom stacks. I did not change the default settings for the blank, Java, Java-Mysql, C++ stacks and I have allocated 4 gigs for the custom stack which bases on codenvy/ubuntu_jdk8 image with some minor changes. It happens when a workspace starts. It runs for some time ok and interrupts immediately after the last line of output you see on the screenshot occures.  
Yep, just checked, only happens on firefox it looks like, chrome works fine.  This is just installing to hawtio running in a fabric on a local build, so it's the current master of both, no proxy/remote connecting.  I'll take a look and debug further monday after having some beers to forget about this week :-)

@dadoonet Ok, that'd be a good message in lieu of the NPE but I am able to successfully use the keys, etc. in other tools to access the blob storage.  Also, I had been successfully doing this w/ ES 6.0 so I'm not sure what changed.  Here's my repository creation request: ``` PUT _snapshot/es-2018-01?pretty=true {   "settings": {     "container": "elasticsearch-backups",     "base_path": "es-2018-01",     "compress": true,     "chunk_size": "64mb"   },   "type": "azure" } ``` Here's the `elasticsearch.yml` config: ``` cloud:     azure:         storage:             degreed_account:                 account: <my_account>                 key: <my_key> ``` Oh, and yes it's a fresh installation.  I've simply been doing reindex from remote from my ES 1.7.5 cluster but it's not an upgrade of any kind.
Unfortunately it looks like i can't. for some reason the multiblock won't form (register) in creative and my normale world wont load i keep getting this error "The state engine was in incorrect state SERVER_STOPPING and forced into state SERVER_STOPPED. Errors may have been discarded." if you have any idea how to resolve this issue it would be welcome but i have no way off knowing if its related.  what i was observing though for the initial issue is as the item started arriving the first item would comes passe the stack test and start smelting then an other item would add to the stack but doesn't look like it takes the test. when the stack reaches 16 it keeps smelting. i noticed this because it recipes would never complete when using refined storage and even adding the ressources manually id not get the number of items i'd expect.
Hi Renato,   For anyone taking raw http from a 3rd party source and feeding it to this library, like I am, I think it'd be surprising to need to decode the raw http content before sending to rawhttp.  If it needs to be an option, the least surprise would be if rawhttp handled encoded content by default.  To steal from the XOM library's goals - "correctness, simplicity, and performance, in that order" seems like a good philosophy.  In my case, it is especially hard to workaround %20 because if I replace it with a space for rawhttp's sake, it run into this - https://github.com/renatoathaydes/rawhttp/blob/91fccad19292be8ae6489dd4a9aae62c481aa7d5/rawhttp-core/src/main/java/rawhttp/core/HttpMetadataParser.java#L145

Not sure about 2.0.3 and lower. The 2.0.4 was just saying that this happens in the latest version. 
@Siedlerchr This one works. 
then it is probably the case that the debugger functionality is disabled in my external node. Thanks!

Fixed in 5.4.1 
What 0.0 Repeat again please and in Russian.
I didn't check. Just running through the test plan. Also, it seems that you can normally close the details view. So it must be happening only in a special situation (if an installation is running or something like that).

Excuse me. Sending a video with the playback bug (https://evmezentsev.wistia.com/medias/bc86gf7n2y). If in words, when copying the selected text, and then later deleting this text, after the space this text is not inserted, after the text it is inserted normally.
I will implement the progress bar when we fix the dowloading.

The app works in all mobile browsers and apk built with targetSDKVersion < 26, but this obviously can't be released to the Play Store. I'll have to create an example app, leave it with me
Yes, it's device specific. Only mentioned devices are affected.  In the meanwhile, I figured out following details: 1. Using _top_, I compared CPU load, required to play my streams on the Japanese XPeria Z3 versus European XPeria Z3. On that Japanese device CPU load is twice as high.  2. As well, Japanese devices cause the following message printed to the logcat: 07-13 17:47:33.296 W/ACodec  ( 9173): do not know color format 0x7fa30c04 = 2141391876 , However, European versions do not. 3. Playback stops when the player switches to the 8MBps bitrate. In the initial experiment, I observed 10-15 seconds playback because I started with 1MBps, and then relied on the player to increase the quality. In the clean experiment, I fixed the bitrate to the predefined value and observed. Turned out that on the affected devices, there is no problem playing 4MBps stream, but when ExoPlayer is given an 8MBps stream - it consumes almost all CPU and drops all frames.  So far, my theory is: 1. Those affected devices are not capable of switching the surface to color format COLOR_QCOM_FORMATYUV420PackedSemiPlanar32m (0x7fa30c04) 2. Therefore, they fall back to converting 0x7fa30c04 into something like COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar just after decoding. And that's why CPU load is higher.  If my theory proves right, then there is a little ExoPlayer may do to improve the situation, except, maybe, adapting the algorithm of the maximum bitrate estimation, and including that "incompatible surface" variable into it.  
hi dilipkrish `Role` is just POJO class.   ``` @Controller public class WorldController {      @RequestMapping(value = "/test1", method = RequestMethod.GET)     @ResponseBody     public Role[] test() {         return null;     }      static class Role {         private String id;         private String name;     } } ```  change the return type `Role[]` to `List<Role>`. then result json is correct. only array return type is allways missing model Role. 
Oh well, after upgrade from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3 the false positive is gone. Closing this issue.
I did some research and seems that it conflicts with [MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mrcrayfish-furniture-mod) (v4.1.5). Both of these mods works fine when they're alone, but together they duplicate the sounds.  Client log: [latest.log](https://github.com/OreCruncher/DynamicSurroundings/files/1699681/latest.log)

of course. I will let you know
Nope it did not work. I was looking at already scanned block and did not showed any Aspects. havent checked the Aura nodes. 
Yes, exactly - we have something like that.

Some more observations:  - I figured out that the whole thing works in Chrome. It doesn't work in Firefox only (we have Firefox 52.4.0 (32bit) here)  I pasted the URLs in the browser:    - when using the hostname: I get immediately redirected to some other page (judging the sourcecode: IDE.html) and a dialog pops up "Can not get workspaces. The reason: Workspace with name "" in namespace 'api' doesn't exist."   - when using the ip: I see the JSON proper.   I logged in on the machine and used curl:   - http://ourhost:8081/api/   returns the API description just as it should   - http://ourip:8081/api/ returns the same stuff   - http://ourhost_or_ip:8081/api  (no trailing slash) redirects to the dashboard.  To me it looks  a little bit like Firefox is somehow loosing the trailing slash and gets the redirected page instead of the JSON during the API call.  
will check 
You need change the phone language, and after that, you need reinstall or refresh the metadata. I tested it  with development branch, in real device and in the emulator. And i have this bug always. I tested it against hnqis and hnqis-dev-ci with my user. 
They shouldn't have 0 legs, but I thought I'd avoid throwing exceptions  until I find the cause.

yes
Version 2.9.0.140 It doesn't happen often, it is probably a kind of race condition bug between input and search.
long works because when you shift bit15 to position 31 it does NOT change the sign of long. For int it does change it.  The difference can be seen with test program such   <pre> public class Div {     public static void main(String[] args) {         for(int a=1; a<0x10000;a++) {             for(int b=0; b<0x10000;b++) {                 char aChar = (char) a;                 char bChar = (char) b;                 char ex32 = (char) ((bChar << 16) / aChar);                 char ex64 = (char) (((long) bChar << 16) / aChar);                 if(ex32 != ex64) {                     System.out.println(b + " / " + a + " = " + (long) ex32 + " vs " + (long) ex64);                 }             }         }     } } </pre> 
I isolated the problem to the Crusher. No other machine has problems with accepting inputs from Logisitical Transporters, occasionally I'll have clumps drop out of the machine. Not sure if it's an oversend issue or if the Crusher isn't processing inputs properly.

Hi Mark, I can't test it within KNIME as we can only integrate releases of maven libs at the moment (everything else involves manipulating the eclipse cache which I try to avoid). Anyway, I had a look at your code and it make sense, as you set the `RandomAccess` to the plane position before you iterate over the image. You could have also just set the offset of the `Cursor` with a proper `jump` to the plane position (using `IntervalIndexer` or so to go from `dimension` to index). Anyway, if your test passes now, we can fix this later (=make it more efficient).   As soon as you released a new version of `SCIFIO` I will double-check within KNIME.  Thanks @hinerm  
I can’t reproduce either.  I will reopen it if I encountered again.  Thanks.  Michael Zhou  在 2014年4月3日，22:52，Terence Parr notifications@github.com 写道：  > Any more info? If not, I'll close. Thanks! >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.

No problems with master branch. I can restart master and slave servers without errors.
whoops, I overlooked the remaining stacktace in my terminal, here is the rest of it:   `java.net.UnknownHostException: local_sercer: unknown error 	at java.net.Inet6AddressImpl.lookupAllHostAddr(Native Method) ~[na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.net.InetAddress$2.lookupAllHostAddr(InetAddress.java:928) ~[na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.net.InetAddress.getAddressesFromNameService(InetAddress.java:1323) ~[na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName0(InetAddress.java:1276) ~[na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1192) ~[na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.java:1126) ~[na:1.8.0_91] 	at org.apache.http.impl.conn.SystemDefaultDnsResolver.resolve(SystemDefaultDnsResolver.java:45) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultHttpClientConnectionOperator.connect(DefaultHttpClientConnectionOperator.java:111) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.conn.PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager.connect(PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager.java:353) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.execchain.MainClientExec.establishRoute(MainClientExec.java:380) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.execchain.MainClientExec.execute(MainClientExec.java:236) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.execchain.ProtocolExec.execute(ProtocolExec.java:184) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.execchain.RetryExec.execute(RetryExec.java:88) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.execchain.RedirectExec.execute(RedirectExec.java:110) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.client.InternalHttpClient.doExecute(InternalHttpClient.java:184) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient.execute(CloseableHttpClient.java:82) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient.execute(CloseableHttpClient.java:107) ~[httpclient-4.5.1.jar:4.5.1] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.http.UrlInvoker.doInvoke(UrlInvoker.java:352) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.http.UrlInvoker.invoke(UrlInvoker.java:164) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.listener.PrnfbPullRequestEventListener$1.invoke(PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.java:94) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.listener.PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.notify(PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.java:263) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.listener.PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.handleEvent(PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.java:116) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.listener.PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.access$000(PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.java:60) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at se.bjurr.prnfb.listener.PrnfbPullRequestEventListener$2.run(PrnfbPullRequestEventListener.java:132) [plugin.4464963591233580878.pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket-2.45_1482853392000.jar:na] 	at com.atlassian.stash.internal.concurrent.StateTransferringExecutor$StateTransferringRunnable.run(StateTransferringExecutor.java:70) [bitbucket-platform-4.6.1.jar:na] 	at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511) [na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266) [na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$201(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180) [na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:293) [na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) [na:1.8.0_91] 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) [na:1.8.0_91]`  Seems to be caused by an UnknowHostException with an unknown error.

It was a few days ago and happened several times during this day. I would have to re-check if the problem still exists...

Hi, @yfuks  I didn't override ReactActivity.onCreate. So I think the problem is related with RN. My code is below: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7940552/12816443/83221cae-cb87-11e5-9487-6c31a3839ffd.png) ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7940552/12816456/98091b2c-cb87-11e5-9f4b-453f545c1efb.png) I set two breakpoints in MainActivity.onActivityResult function, but the program did not go to there. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7940552/12816511/d5a5293a-cb87-11e5-8ef3-9084b6f04823.png) So the showImagePicker has no log.  But I test several times, sometimes it works well, the showImagePicker can get the uri. 
I'm unable to reproduce the error myself, but have asked the user to try to narrow down the error by creating a short note and long note and try to cause the error to happen.
Works beautifully! Thank you so much!
Because I wanted to move it.
I don't know. I did update every day except Friday and Sat. However, I tried to reset back to the version  on Wednesday, it still didn't work.

hey @edmundoa, I sent you the dump over email. Looking forward for a fix, upgrading production is on hold because of this. Thank you!
That's strange. The blocks beneath me in this case are dark oak logs.  
the delay before the sound is switched back is roughly a second as far as I can measure it.  the issue doesn't occur with three-pin mini jack connectors apparently.  however, some of the problem depends on the application, as it doesn't happen with e.g. VLC. 
@mcicolella here you go.
The .java and .class files are re-created, but the error persists. 
Hi @omehegan,  I did a short look into the sources as well, that is why I mentioned the branch filtering config. I tried different filtering settings, from filtering by branchname, as well as regex and at least allow all. The NPE occured with every setting.  The config looks like following: [XML](https://pastebin.com/FUnAY4dh) In the job configuration it looks like the following: [Screen](https://pasteboard.co/Ht9HHv4.png) 
Unfortunately we can't remove it since we have other code that depends in this library which doesn't compile if we remove it from the classpath. What version _should_ we use? 
I deleted data for Lawnchair, but the issue persisted.
1. clone the `example` . 2. update project by wurstsetup 2. F1 ->  wurst:build

I am using v1.11.2 of Minecraft and v7.99.6 of BC. Also, in the GIF, when I found the bug before, it would go back up to the top of the water and slowly make its way back down again. Although, that may have been another issue.  (The GIF does not represent my MC framerate) ![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30223844/28271909-f1d40cf2-6ad7-11e7-8407-f0e79ecfabd0.gif)    
I added some words to censor in the config under the "Words to be censored" region, then set censor to true. (it was false before) After a server reboot to put the changes in effect, everything typed into chat had the "censorSymbol" displayed before and after each word. 
Sorry for the incomplete issue posted yesterday, I was in a hurry.  However, I was using the code above for this operations: 1. reading an empty configuration with a default value of zero; 2. (doing some operations not with config library) 3. updating previously readed config with a value  Example: 1. read database version (0 at the first time) 2. creating database with migrations 3. saving database version (version 5)  As you can see above, the config object was built like this ```java this.config = FileConfig.builder(configFile,JsonFormat.fancyInstance())                 .sync()                 .autosave()                 .autoreload()                 .build(); ``` so the `get` and `put` methods reload and save configurations automatically.  However, at the end of this operations **nothing is updated to the config file**. It is strange because I have the following lines: ```java Log.debug("Db:: curr version before: " + currentVer()); upgrade(); Log.debug("Db:: curr version after: " + currentVer()); ``` and  ```java public Integer currentVer() {     return configuration.get(Keys.DB_VERSION,0); } ``` The first debug line prints 0, as expected. The second debug line **prints 5**, as expected, but the **value is not updated** in the file from the version 3.2.0 while in the 3.1.0 this works right.   ---  I'll try the lib with master commit and watch the issue you linked me in a while.
right, thanks

I have made what I think are appropriate changes and added test cases to support both the delimited and fixed parsers.  I have committed and generated a pull request. 
There is a test in Kotlin in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin/issues/46. It doesn't look like the bug has any outward effects normally in Java since the only thing it seems to break is PropertyValueBuffer.hasParameter() which isn't normally called.  Here is something I managed to come up with to reproduce it in plain Java: https://gist.github.com/kpdonn/368a760ab52a9bbb0b334c2a37fae0d2 
The app name, since the icon has not loaded yet. I tried clicking on the empty space where the icon will appear eventually, but nothing happened. 
@teabot Yes, we can query the view via Presto in the metastore directly. 
That's what I thought,  which make me wonder why we get that error. After looking at the link, perhaps there is a setting we've missed somewhere, that tell osm not to look for this bubble... 
@illarionov, thanks for posting this information. Here is the Info of my HTC ONE:  | Device | Firmware | | --- | --- | | HTC ONE M7<br/>PN0710000 | OS-4.19.401.11  <br/> AOKP M7 Generic (KitKat 4.4.2)<br/>Rooted + S-OFF, SuperCID |  `ipctool` and `ipcdump` do also not exist on this device.  I recommend to use the [Secret Codes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.simon.marquis.secretcodes)-App to crawl your phone. Note: His App is fully Open Source and and [on GitHub](https://github.com/SimonMarquis/Android-SecretCodes). Maybe developer @SimonMarquis can be of help for finding how to issue and read OEM_HOOK_RAW requests? @illarionov, do these CSC codes also exist for HTC? Do we need those?  **Secret codes on my HTC ONE:**  ``` *#*#225#*#*  - Kalendar *#*#2657#*#* - ROM Control *#*#4636#*#* - Service Menu (Phone Information, Battery, Usage Stats, WIFI-Info) *#*#8350#*#* - Speech Dialing *#*#8351#*#* - Speech Dialing ``` 
Looks fine on preview.flymine.org But, instead of 'Manage Filters' - it says '2 filters' - wonder what our curators will say to changes once they make video tutorials..hmm In any case, I plan to release 1.1 in production first. 
Thanks,@minwoox @anuraaga @trustin    it is very strange.I've done a lot of data simulation on the original environment,But none of the above shows up.  @anuraaga  You may be right.  I agree with what you said .   I only  catch InterruptedException,ExecutionException,TimeoutException. 
Sorry I'm too busy at the moment and installed back to 3.2...  I only can say that the database properies UI is buggy: If you do a  change in any field (in our case we changed the standard file path) the sort order of the primary criteria is applied (standard = "abstract") although we have activated "sort by original order" (its not YEAR as I claimed false before).  I have no capacity for more feedback or tests, hope you can reproduce the bug...I'm happy with 3.2 at the moment and we need it working at our institute. I might be able to help later this month.

yes the directory also exists and writable for anybody 
the mod version is 7.2.1 (the latest, according to the wiki page). I have found that the returned coal has a data value of 2, but it should be 0 (1 is for charcoal). That small change should be sufficient to solve this issue, I think. 
yeah
I have it setup with default ( = different from minimal) security, and _SYSTEM/SYS doesn't work here; I have to use my own username/password.

@macdonst, I sent two push notifications to the app. The first one with notId=0 and the last one with notId=1. When I tapped the first notification sent (notId=0), the push.on(’notification’) function was called with notId=1. The other notification also had disappeared from status bar. This only happend in Android. Thanks! 
The could is the Postgres macaddr type. 
Probably the previous release. I'll check if there is another stack trace from the current release.

I thank you for taking the time to analyze my humble request and respond in-kind.  My goal was to suggest or provide myself, a slight enhancement to your very rational approach to a rules library - keeping things simple, not trying to boil the ocean.  I'm buried right now, but I will submit a pull request and examples for you to consider, within the coming weeks.  I think the deep hierarchy issue requires more analysis - I'd love to know the more complicated use cases engaged by library users - my intuition says it's probably not as big of a problem as one might think, especially if you manage expectations up front; a user of the library who cares to decorate an abstract "rule" class gets the responsibility of implementing their solution(s) correctly.    BTW- I'm using your library for an IOT project at a fortune 10 company, and I've noticed that the division of code implementing the when()/then() methods is seldom 50/50 but more like 90/10 or 80/20 in either direction, so that might factor into the deep hierarchy analysis.  Best wishes, Dave
I have and there was no reply on their end. It makes no sense as everything else after it in terms of posting date has been answered. https://github.com/Azanor/thaumcraft-beta/issues/1009
I cannot find the showcase. Can you post a link to the git hub location?
I found out that the issue only arises when I share the PacketDecoder between Channels. Could it be that ReplayingDecoders are not meant to be shared?  Here's the decoder:  @Sharable public class PacketDecoder extends ReplayingDecoder<PacketDecoder.PacketDecoderState> {     public static enum PacketDecoderState {         READ_NOTHING, READ_HEADER;     }  ``` private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PacketDecoder.class); private static final AttributeKey<Integer> HEADER = new AttributeKey<>("PacketDecoder.header"); private final Map<Integer, PacketDeserializer> packetDeserializers; private final Set<Class<? extends Packet>> logBlackList;  public PacketDecoder(Map<Integer, PacketDeserializer> packetDeserializers, Set<Class<? extends Packet>> logBlackList) {     super(PacketDecoderState.READ_NOTHING);     this.packetDeserializers = packetDeserializers;     this.logBlackList = logBlackList; }  public PacketDecoder(Map<Integer, PacketDeserializer> packetDeserializers) {     this(packetDeserializers, new HashSet<Class<? extends Packet>>()); }  @Override protected void decode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, ByteBuf in, MessageBuf<Object> out) throws Exception {     in = in.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN);     PacketDecoder.PacketDecoderState state = state();     LOGGER.debug("Current state: {}", state);     switch (state) {     case READ_NOTHING: // the header has yet to be decoded         LOGGER.debug("Decode header");         int header = RawConverter.readUnsignedShort(in);         LOGGER.debug("Decoded header: {}", header);         ctx.attr(HEADER).set(header);         checkpoint(PacketDecoderState.READ_HEADER);     case READ_HEADER: // the body has yet to be decoded         LOGGER.debug("Decode body");         // now parse the body of a packet (if there are enough bytes to do so)         // Find the correct PacketDeserializer for this packet (using the unique header)         header = ctx.attr(HEADER).get();         PacketDeserializer packetDeserializer = packetDeserializers.get(header);         // If the PacketDeserializer corresponding to the header cannot be found, processing cannot continue         if (packetDeserializer == null) {             String msg = "No suitable PacketDeserializer found for header: " + header;             LOGGER.error(msg);             throw new IllegalStateException(msg);         }          // Use the PacketUnmarshaller to create a new packet instance         Packet packet = packetDeserializer.deserialize(in);          if(LOGGER.isInfoEnabled() && !this.logBlackList.contains(packet.getClass())) {             LOGGER.debug("Decoded body: {}", packet);         }          out.add(packet);         checkpoint(PacketDecoderState.READ_NOTHING);     } } ```  }  Let me know if you still want to see the inboundPacketHandler. 
@andrewkm would be best to ask for that.  Sleaker thinks it's related to papermc. 
It was. I'd left it set for a default of 0. As soon as I changed it to 1, it exported without error. I also tried the export with Fixed and Compressed, and that exported without a problem as well. Previously it would export both the regular version and the compressed version but had an error anytime the Fix option was included.  Also, for whatever it's worth, yes it happened at exactly that same point: Blue Orb of Dragonkind. Which was at the 98% point (according to the progress wheel) of exporting.  Thank you very much for your time and continued support of such a great tool.
Thank you. I edited a code as you suggested and sent a PR.
It happens when you grow a vanilla oak tree like this: https://vgy.me/GUqb0k.png
No, the problem occurs only for JPEG-compressed TIFFs. 
I will try that tomorrow  Alexandre Vanhecke notifications@github.com 於 2016年2月23日週二 21:54 寫道：  > Can you try with latest build please? >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub > https://github.com/Xephi/AuthMeReloaded/issues/552#issuecomment-187707859 > .

Thanks for looking into this.  It was failing very reliably for me and I've rarely seen Object.wait(...) go twice as long before, but it certainly can be unreliable.  You'd think in this day and age we would have computers and software that could count reliably. =)  Thanks again for looking into it.
The sever is undertow , I have create the same issue in the JIRA for them . 
I just reprod on emulator w/ Android 7.0.  Plan a trip from University Area Transit Center to Marion Transit Center at 2:00pm, make sure real-time info is shown in the trip times (i.e., some times crossed out), and then hit the home button to background the app and wait around 10-15 seconds.  Key seems to be finding trip with real-time info, then hitting home to background app.  Seems that once you reproduce this once, as well, it keeps crashing - at least that's the behavior on the device I've seen.
If I look for "Trump~2", I'll get those applied filters :  ![Datashare](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1478919/66495957-691f8200-eaba-11e9-9aae-2676983a8e63.png)

Will do in a bit, quite busy. 
after the 100th line the 101th and so one will go to the left side 1 time and now the tempo is ruined it happens every time you load the song..  Pls make a song that exceeds 100 lines and you will know what happens.. 
Thanks. It might be a problem on my side.  On Thu, Sep 25, 2014 at 12:18 PM, Fleur Kelpin notifications@github.com wrote:  > Looks like this one occurs exclusively in the VM.

I tried checking Travis, didn't see an obvious second build. Maybe we could have Gnag report the Travis build number in comments, or include a link back to the Travis job? Could be configurable to be CI-system-agnostic, of course. 
I do apologise, A relog cleared the issue.
Thanks for spotting that! That will teach me to re-use one of the examples without fully understanding it :)  Just a suggestion: perhaps the code could emit a warning if there are multiple sections encountered and only one is supported?  Removing the included content does indeed get my bits working. 
Apologies for only replying now. It happens for me when creating a new file, insert a record and close app. When the app is opened and the password file selected and password entered, the record will be displayed. Clicking on anything, or navigating in the app anywhere will then cause a FC. When a widget is created linked to a password file, clicking the widget will cause app FC immediately. I hope I explained properly
 @aaalaniz Thank you for investigating, i'll try it with a different emulator setup as you suggested and will update this ticket accordingly.

Seems to have used 2000 LP when I tested just now, but the OP from the SevTech issue states it used 1000. So not a dupe on my end? but still annoying.
Jesse,  I don't want to drop the table - GeoNetwork does in its database init method (DbLib.java) - we could change all that in 2.12.x but probably not in 2.10.x - in any case it's probably safer for GeoNetwork to remove the table rather than assume that a table with that name has the structure it expects?   That aside, the problem seems to be caused by earlier code in JeevesEngine which opens a database channel (originally to test the db connection) which is now also being used to select stuff from the services table but which is never closed. This seems to hang the drop table call made later by GeoNetwork DbLib when initializing the database. Closing that test channel in JeevesEngine fixes the problem and releases a channel (probably better for resource usage). I'm just making sure that this has no other implications before committing the fix.

Here is a way to reproduce the problem :   On an empty database, create the following data:  CREATE (s1:Planet {name:"test"});  CREATE (s2:Planet {name:"test"})-[:MdxPath]->(p:Planet);  MATCH (s:Planet {name:"test"}) CREATE (s)-[:Attribute]->(net:Attribute);  And then here is the statement that produces an NPE:  MATCH (s:Planet {name:"test"}) WITH s OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[:MdxPath]->(p:Planet) WITH [id(p),p.path] as pl, s MATCH (s)-[:Attribute]->(net:Attribute) OPTIONAL MATCH (s)<-[:Provided]-(c:Counter) RETURN collect(distinct(pl)), collect(distinct(net)), collect(distinct(c))

What do you mean by it does not fit in the screen? The problem is caused by the has_child filter. The filter works fine by it's on.  I removed some parts of the filter and removed indentation so you can see the filter.  ``` {"actions":[{"add":{"index":"esbug","alias":"esbug_123","filter":{"bool":{"should":[{"bool":{"must":[{"term":{"_type":["person"]}},{"has_child":{"type":"order","filter":{"bool":{"must":[{"term":{"_type":"order"}}],"should":[{"not":{"terms":{"_parent":["AUw3EnRZSNvEdeURvB8t"]}}},{"bool":{"must":[{"term":{"_parent":"AUw3EnRZSNvEdeURvB8t"}},{"range":{"created":{"gt":"2015-03-20T09:00:50.941Z"}}}]}}]}}}}]}}]}}}}]} ``` 
Sorry for missing info. There isnt any error in the console
Yes, it should only affect people from #583.  Well, my idea was to reset the execution count only for scheduled backups. Now I see that I didn't mention it. Anyway, if you are ok with ignoring the execution count for exports, I also think it's better. I evaluated the possibility of doing so but, as the UI allows to set a maximum execution count, I didn't want to break it. But to be fair, I don't see it very useful for exports and I think we should be save from having anyone using it.  I'll prepare another pull request then... 
@illarionov, thanks for posting this information. Here is the Info of my HTC ONE:  | Device | Firmware | | --- | --- | | HTC ONE M7<br/>PN0710000 | OS-4.19.401.11  <br/> AOKP M7 Generic (KitKat 4.4.2)<br/>Rooted + S-OFF, SuperCID |  `ipctool` and `ipcdump` do also not exist on this device.  I recommend to use the [Secret Codes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.simon.marquis.secretcodes)-App to crawl your phone. Note: His App is fully Open Source and and [on GitHub](https://github.com/SimonMarquis/Android-SecretCodes). Maybe developer @SimonMarquis can be of help for finding how to issue and read OEM_HOOK_RAW requests? @illarionov, do these CSC codes also exist for HTC? Do we need those?  **Secret codes on my HTC ONE:**  ``` *#*#225#*#*  - Kalendar *#*#2657#*#* - ROM Control *#*#4636#*#* - Service Menu (Phone Information, Battery, Usage Stats, WIFI-Info) *#*#8350#*#* - Speech Dialing *#*#8351#*#* - Speech Dialing ``` 
I set everything in the Paper UI (under Preferences I selected German and under System/Locale I set the locale to de_DE). I tried it again this morning and have some additional information that may help. For the Homematic things the display texts are correct under Things/Configuration: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/616792/20865302/88ca711c-ba0e-11e6-9a3c-af413f6cd271.png)  BTW: as you can see in the screenshot also the name of Yahoo binding and its description is not shown in the correct language.  The Homematic binding does not use the i18n properties files. So it seems that the problem happens only with i18n properties files.
 I'm editing the .py in RStudio's editor and running the code in an interactive python session at the terminal
Sorry ma1co this is a user error on my end.  I tried recording via i720 and it recorded up to 2 hours.  So maybe it doesn't work for all video formats. 
Sorry that I didn't mention it 1.2.1 
Thanks A lot this is fixed 
Using Settings speed up? What do you mean?  Could you tell me how to do that?

OK, versions: IDEA 14.0 plugin 0.10.1 haxe 3.4.0 haxelib 3.3.0  I use HXML file project configuration (it's the only one Flash debugging works with), here's my HXML file: ``` # required libs, heaps is needed for hxsl -lib hscript  # main class to run -cp src -main Main  # debugging settings, -D fdb is required for having trace() output in the console -debug -D fdb  # AS3/AIR specific settings, make sure swf-version is equal or lower to the one set in the appDescriptor.xml --flash-strict -swf-header 800:600:60:333333 -swf-version 22  # create the script that we'll use for running the project # first output the ADL path - this needs to be edited depeneding on where Flex+AIR SDK is installed -cmd mkdir -p out -cmd echo "/Users/booster/Documents/Flex/flexsdk4.15.0air23/bin/adl `pwd`/appDescriptor.xml" > out/run_swf -cmd chmod +x out/run_swf  # output file -swf out/content.swf ```  It's of course possible that I'm doing something wrong, but I never had libs added automatically to a project.
Hello, The version is v1.3.6 when i installed it for the first time last week. After you replied my answer, i reinstall the plugin with the version v1.4.0 again and then i found the same problem again. 
[TestUndertowGzip.tar.gz](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/60701/TestUndertowGzip.tar.gz)  Attchment is the sample project, when switching the container starter to jetty the response header contains the Content-Encoding with value gzip, and the content is comressed.  But  with undertow this does not.  I have tested this with the chrome and firefox browser. 
Thanks for fix, I've tested it and works as expected. 
Yeah, that's currently one of the issues sadly.  The extension never gets deleted from the file (Which is the odd thing)
this happens in 1.0.0 in browser environment.  note that if I type the inner Foo declaration with String : Foo<String> it does not happen. 
Now, if I turn the screen, the image will go beyond it (I use BIV in Fragment): ![i get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11472748/35774125-92681a22-0999-11e8-92f5-5d7142739c2b.png) I want the image to be placed in it when turning the screen: ![i want](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11472748/35774133-abd62bac-0999-11e8-823b-aef7eb2376fe.png) For this, I override `onSizeChanged` so that when the screen was rotated, the scale and center were reset. But it does not work. It works for the original SSIV, but does not work for BIV. The problem is not `oldh != 0 && oldw != 0`. I can write like this: ``` protected void onSizeChanged(int w, int h, int oldw, int oldh) {         super.onSizeChanged(w, h, oldw, oldh);         getSSIV().resetScaleAndCenter(); } ``` But I still get this result: ![i get](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11472748/35774177-9f9fbf28-099a-11e8-9e5f-e3b3b859b5b5.png) I conclude that the reset (`getSSIV().resetScaleAndCenter()`) does not work. 
Thanks for the tips, I will try to see if it works.  Maybe you could try to use [android:imeOptions](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:imeOptions) and listen when the user press on that key on the keyboard? (maybe `actionDone`, or let the developer choose its own). 
Can confirm, this doesn't happen in spectator mode
No, I dont't. But I receive a lot of reports (up to 10/s) and a lot of them with the same cause. Maybe it's timing or threading problem. In my Database i have 4 entries with same stacktrace text, same version_code and version_name but different bug_id (and id). 
@xLaMbChOpSx, don't worry. I'm not even sure AIMSICD **needs** to start before radio connection. But as @E3V3A already mentioned, letting it start up on boot and restarting it upon kill would rock. 
>  Does anyone know any other LOS-enabled boards besides BFPO which have slopes on them? I do not. 
Ah, it seems like it doesn't crash with the sample URL. However with `bna show-url` it does:  ``` 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: Process: com.beemdevelopment.aegis, PID: 19938 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "8 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: " 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:615) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:650) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.beemdevelopment.aegis.otp.GoogleAuthInfo.parseUri(GoogleAuthInfo.java:142) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.beemdevelopment.aegis.otp.GoogleAuthInfo.parseUri(GoogleAuthInfo.java:56) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.beemdevelopment.aegis.ui.ScannerActivity.handleResult(ScannerActivity.java:111) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at me.dm7.barcodescanner.zxing.ZXingScannerView$1.run(ZXingScannerView.java:164) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:903) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:216) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:7396) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(RuntimeInit.java:577) 02-18 20:17:26.762 19938 19938 E AndroidRuntime: 	at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:950) ```
@TWiStErRob I don't think it is a case of wrong url as everything works fine without okhttp, but I've tried to trim it and result is the same.  @sjudd Here is the full stack trace http://pastebin.com/YfCS0NRL  You can find image url in exception if you'd like to test it :) 
Every single cache I tried today, e.g. GC3908A or GC38B0T. If I activate friend logs, the order is different from the web. It is OK again if I deactivate friend logs. 
Hi @pesse  I get the same error when removing the // Not sure if this will make a difference, but the target server I am trying to connect to is defined as  subdomain.domain.com test/test_pwd@sub.server1.com:1521/service1  Thanks, Coenraad
For my thinking, if the scheme is named `xterm`, it should be map the same rgb color values as [xterm](http://web.archive.org/web/20130125000058/http://www.frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/) do. I'd just double checked against [xterm-256-notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20130125000058/http://www.frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/) with the same results as in the table mentioned above.  So for the »Maybe we can have all the variations?« approach, it needs to add a scheme named like »slightliy modified xterm«. But is this really valuable? Hmm, maybe for users which depend on one or more of those 3 different colors and they might if they became different with the next update.  | Color Name     |AnsiColorMap|  xterm  | AnsiColorMap |xterm| |----------------|:----------:|:-------:|:------------:|:---:| | Blue           |  #1E90FF   | #0000EE | ![ansicolormap-blue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6552470/23630587/fe10f0d6-02bb-11e7-8516-9adbad3699ae.png) | ![xterm-blue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6552470/23630462/7fcdd126-02bb-11e7-959a-ec57d97235bf.png) | | Dark Gray      |  #4C4C4C   | #7F7F7F | ![ansicolormap-dark-gray](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6552470/23630622/0cff671c-02bc-11e7-9f78-18b67c375db0.png) | ![xterm-dark-gray](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6552470/23630472/85e78ebc-02bb-11e7-84fb-a0e5b55aa850.png) | | Bright Blue    |  #4682B4   | #5C5CFF | ![ansicolormap-bright-blue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6552470/23630636/17ed0d5a-02bc-11e7-9c10-a4172466f9d1.png) | ![xterm-bright-blue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6552470/23630476/8a3c33fa-02bb-11e7-8f3b-9ce7cc157209.png) |  (For me personally, its less important for the moment.

The linked code:  ``` ceylon shared void run() {     import simple {         obj { xval = xval }     }     print(xval); }  interface X {     shared default String xval => "x"; } object obj satisfies X {} ``` - On the JVM, there's a backend error - On JS, it prints null - On Dart, prints "x" (fixed in https://github.com/jvasileff/ceylon-dart/issues/43)

It's more that while I'm scrolling, the popup opens and prevents me from scrolling more, so I have to wiggle the mouse to continue scrolling for another second before the popup reappears (and prevents me from scrolling again).
Working on it 
https://github.com/team8/jFreyja/tree/strongback is the code we were running. We double checked the physical mapping in the driver station software, our joysticks were mapped to the ports we expected. Note that our code currently compensates for the swap. 
Well I do think this is related to the test. The test says you should not be able to modify the value. But I am able to modify the value.
Oh, I think I said it wrong. I don't mean the white space in the code. I mean the 1px high white space between the lines. In the screenshot you can see 1px high white lines which starts at line 9. Have a closure look at the line numbers. There you will see the small distance between the lines best.  This behavior was not like this in version 0.7 M5.

As said with 0.90.0 this never happens ... I use graylog2 0.91.1 with no special configuration ... just untar, launch and start a gelf http input...   Those are the same messages with different ids ... every message I sent is marked with an incremental value ... both of them have the 85950 value but different ids ...

The version of Rstudio is the one from the main desktop download section linked here:  https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/opensuse15/x86_64/rstudio-1.2.5001-x86_64.rpm   I believe it is 1.2.5001;  The error on executing ```sudo zypper install rstudio-1.2.5001-x86_64.rpm``` is: > Problem: nothing provides libxkbcommon-x11 needed by rstudio-1.2.5001-1.x86_64  Which is not true; i clearly have the following in /usr/lib64: ``` libxkbcommon-x11.so libxkbcommon-x11.so.0 libxkbcommon-x11.so.0.0.0 ```  What's particularly wild is, if at the error prompt, if I choose to ignore dependencies and install anyways, RStudio launches and seems to work - the main problem any time I subsequently do a `zypper dup` command, it flags RStudio as broken and wants to remove it.    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56571941/66978164-fee08180-f065-11e9-98e1-9b0a99318bcc.png)  >  Does this happen on the latest RStudio preview? Yes, preview has the exact same issue.   
It works well with github.com API  but not other gitHub enterprise domain. My che.properties is like below.  oauth.github.clientid=XXX oauth.github.clientsecret=XXX oauth.github.authuri= https://oss.XX.com/login/oauth/authorize oauth.github.tokenuri= https://oss.XX.com/login/oauth/access_token oauth.github.redirecturis=  http://xxxx:8080/ide/api/oauth/callback auth.oauth.access_denied_error_page=/error-oauth  One thing I should mention is that che server send request to **"https://api.github.com/users" in the middle of oAuth with my GitHub Enterprise domain.   I think the domain should be my github enterprise host.  
I am using most recent version, that is 1.0.RC7.6

I could run che-server:latest without exceptions. This issue is reproduced under nightly only to me. Comparing their logs, it was added `-Dh2.baseDir=/home/user/che/db/` to the nightly.  And I found the similar issue on the other product. https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/issues/298 I guess this is a bug on the nightly.

no - this would make somehow no sence as it would be out of XPrivacys capabilities ;)  i just open up the normal phone app (using cm10.2) and dial a number and establish a call 
Thanks for the quick answer! The fact that you haven't heard this from anyone else certainly points towards an issue in our application.  We are using a custom `DrmSessionManager`. In our application, rapid zapping between different streams (most of them DRM protected with the same init data) is crucial. Therefore, we have implemented a `DrmSessionManager` which uses a `DefaultDrmSessionManager` as delegate. When a DRM session with a specific UUID is aquired for the first time, our `DrmSessionManager` acquires an additional DRM session (using the respective method in DefaultDrmSessionManager). Additionally, we have a method to release all of these artificial DRM sessions which is called in our Activity's `onPause()`. Hence, the stream switching is a lot faster since the key request is made only for the start of the first stream because the artificial DRM session is kept open throughout the lifecycle of the app. I'm aware that this is somewhat experimental, but with most devices (except the ones mentioned above), everything works fine.  Apart from that, we recently also implemented the dummy surface workaround discussed in https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3835#issuecomment-390646933. However, we saw the crashes before implementing this workaround, so the issue should not be related to those changes.
I reverted the whole commit, but I can test the flags if you want, I have just no idea how they are used and the impact :)

yes liteloader  is not detected  because authme send player on hub fast
The player executes the command /unl glass (or any id 1.14) Then I restart the server and when the player enters, this appears in console https://gist.github.com/iGuillem/9c4f00a4f4c7de78fa87cc93739c139a I don't remember if the player disconnected before restarting or if he was ejected on restart I don't know what other screenshot I could show
Apologies that this is late, but we are using the latest snapshot.
I don't see any way to import directly from a ZIP anymore, so it's not an issue.
You have to swap the item in your character inventory with shift click from the tool bar. I deleted the mod but I'll reinstall and show.
Okay, I suppose I should have mentioned a few things: - I cannot reproduce the bug in a modpack with ender IO alone. - The bug happens in my world which also has 250+ other mods - The power line gets its power from a P2P Tunnel - It's not only on server restart but also when placing lights, I have to place the light first then the power conduit or it won't work - I haven't tried applying a redstone signal to it to see what happens. - I haven't tried with the latest that just got out.

Hi, Thanks for answer. Bitbucket version: 4.11.2 Parameterized Builds for Jenkins: 2.6.1 Commit Graph: 2.1  We will try with the 2.6.10 which is the one compatible with our Bitbucket.  Best regards Pawel
I need to block all sites except the checked, but for an example it is better.
hi, @pedrovgs :     I'm using the version of 1.2 . and i had executed the commands that you offer,and the outputs like  that:      unable to connect to 172.18.3.52:5555  ``` ps: 172.18.3.52  is  my ip  address  ``` 
I'm not sure if this is especially related to the new map. My new test case is as follows: - Open live map, scroll somewhere (such that auto-center is off). - Close and kill cgeo. - Restart the app and open live map.  I expect to be centered now, since my understanding was that we store the "auto-center" state with the user session and reset to "you are centered" when starting the app from scratch. For me that does not happen. 
Apparently it happens.  I suspect our SearchView is invoking the OnQueryTextListener after our activity is gone. 
I have this before loot.  stops = map.getMapObjects().getPokestops();  How would you force update the map? Thanks!

Here it is working: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4951420/44711498-d740f980-aaf1-11e8-8e50-f65e80276160.png) I will leave it on until it gets resolved. By the way it is port 1337.
Steps are in the ticket copy/paste one more time: 1. Start ORIENTDB WORKBENCH Enter new server: localhost 2. Stop ORIENTDB WORKBENCH 3. Try to start again.

I have an idea to what is happening as I came across this before with another attribute. Android Studio is changing the way they parse attributes. For instance they were switching enum parsing from integer to string in my previous case. My temporary solution was `View.isInEditMode` to check if it was in preview windows.

I just ran the rebuild. Now I do get back that parent when I query the MAIN/SNOMED-VET endpoint, but it is very slow to return (like 6-7 seconds). Before it was pretty much instantaneous. I also see this log message output when I call that endpoint now: ``` 2019-04-30 12:04:32.967  WARN 2794 --- [/O dispatcher 1] org.elasticsearch.client.RestClient      : request [GET http://localhost:9200/es-query/query-concept/_search?typed_keys=true&ignore_unavailable=false&expand_wildcards=open&allow_no_indices=true&search_type=dfs_query_then_fetch&batched_reduce_size=512] returned 1 warnings:  [299 Elasticsearch-6.4.2-04711c2 "Deprecated: the number of terms [699096] used in the Terms Query  request has exceeded the allowed maximum of [65536].

Hi, Aliksander!  > were you using some custom attributes for this affected TR, btw?  No, I didn't use some custom attributes. Just attributes form [instruction](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/salesforce-sso/)  > Could you please write down all your configuration steps   I'm not sure that it will help you to reproduce this issue because I didn't do any special things. But there are steps that I did: 1. removed previous version of Gluu (2.4.2) (_apt-get remove ..._, then remove **/opt/gluu-server-2.4.2***) 2. apt-get install gluu-server-2.4.3 3. /etc/init.d/gluu-server-2.4.3 start 4. chroot into Gluu envirenment by _/etc/init.d/gluu-server-2.4.3 login_ 5. configure Gluu and setup components. All except CAS and Asimba 6. Create few users in OpenDJ for tests 7. Configure TR for TestShib2 step by step as decribed [there](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/test-shib2/) 8. Testing TestShib2 9. Configure Salesforce step by step from [there](https://www.gluu.org/docs/integrate/salesforce-sso/)  At first time I used cert Custom Script for authentication. But in the second time after Gluu reinstallation I used default auth metod.  I tried to remove TestShib2 TR but the same result. 
Hey there.  I am on RebornStorage-1.12.2-3.0.3.36. I dunno if it's related/something you can fix, but it also takes several seconds to load a single page of recipes from a crafter on the client-side.  I'll test that out when I get a moment. I already moved all of the patterns to a Crafter and it's gonna be tedious to move everything back, haha. Do Crafters and the multiblock accept piped items?

Yes the architect table has an area selected (as shown in the pics) which has diamond pipes, iron pipes, lenses, golden pipes, chests and signs inside the architect table area. There are a bunch of lists in the chests. These lists have BC items, vanilla items and BCA items on the lists. 
Default config aside from changed token & channel/server ID.
It's not present anywhere in the classpath in my IDE (which is IntelliJ). To look for it just requires CMD o, and the class name. When I do that for Cookie and search down in the list, I get the com.squareup.okhttp3 jar. When I do that for JavaNetCookieJar, there's no match. It's also not anywhere in the Gradle 5.5.1 uber-jar.

Off course.

1.7.8 running Citizens v2,0,13-SNAPSHOT (Build 1171) 
fixed it. it doesn't work on internet explorer but i can see all the messages after sorting them from newest to oldest on google chrome. is there a way we can see all the messages, like a next page button, without having to specify a filter or order?
I mean once you have configured the start.bat/sh to have jetty running on a different port.  If you try any port other than 80, the proxy works, on 80 it does not. All the rest of the openhab system are working fine. (e.g. GreenT UI & atmosphere) Just the images/videos are missing. I assume somewhere in the code the number 80 is removed as it is the default port, but the proxy expects a number, and returns "-1"   It worked on 1.4.0 about a month ago which was my last merge. 
It was not "unknown" - it was "3.10.0-1062.4.3.el7.x86_64". It looks to be getting parsed out of `/proc/version`:  ``` $ cat /proc/version Linux version 3.10.0-1062.4.3.el7.x86_64 (mockbuild@kbuilder.bsys.centos.org) (gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Wed Nov 13 23:58:53 UTC 2019 ```
Perhaps you should only transform if a condition is met. Like: if value greater 15000 then value = value / 33.86389. If Yahoo eventually sends really millibar(hPa) then it works also. 
* Open a normal json file, like tsconfig.json or package.json for example * Set the cursor to the end of the file * Hit 4 or 5 times ENTER * Save the file * Error occurs.
Everything seems fine, no crashes of any kind :) 
It could also be that, like, some pipelined task is accessing the queue at the same time as the close method.
Just installed Blender 2.73a and it fixes everything! It builds the project and I can see the textures on the model now. Sorry, I thought 2.7 was usable with it.  Thanks again! 
I am planning to apply advanced string manipulation techniques. Will just add a width attribute to image.
Yes, that is the default. The issue comes up when the sorting is disabled with `@Command(sortOptions=false)`.
@normanmaurer I checked with below code                  SSLEngine sslEngine = client.getSslEngine(); 		socketChannel.pipeline().addFirst("handler", new SslHandler(sslEngine, false));                Future f1=sslHandler.handshakeFuture(); 		f1.addListener(new GenericFutureListener<Future<?>>() { 			 			@Override 			public void operationComplete(Future<?> future) throws Exception { 			  if(future.isSuccess()){ 				  System.out.println("Success"); 			  } 			  else{ 				  System.out.println("Failure---"); 			  } 				 			} 		} );  and i am getting Failure , so what could be the reason, how to resolve it?
I downloaded the whole repository in zip to see them without any automatic change, and I saw that these two files contained `CR` `LF`. (The files were created by @devaigergely81, not myself but the problem occurred in my working copy.)  I work on Windows, and I think git showed these files changed because it knows that when I push into the repository, they will automatically be converted to have `LF` instead of `CR` `LF` although all files in my working copy have `CR` `LF` line endings due to the automatic conversion.  I only added this as an issue because it happened now with three files and I thought we should look further into the matter to find the source of this problem. 
sorry those logs were collected from users and we are not able to get the images which cause the crash. And it seemed to be indroduced from fresco 1.0.0.
It looks to me like it's only making a call to the connection: https://syndesis.192.168.64.28.nip.io/api/v1/connections/5/actions/sql-stored-connector  I think it needs to call the integration endpoint: https://syndesis.192.168.64.28.nip.io/api/v1/integrations/<id>  and you're right that the 'procedureName' property is coming back encoded.   ``` configuredProperties: { procedureName: "»ENC:3fdb17af494c10719ec2820b5f007c894d2f541c012f4ae39d86c723d1725187" } ```  Looking into that.
I thought about the charging station being already taken so i made sure it was not the case. The farming drones are two, and they have two stations (each one is close to its assigned drone, and both drones are in range for both stations if one of them fails).   The drone placing block was alone and i was nearby so i can confirm the station was full, empty and not blocked in any way.   As for the digging drones, they were two for a single station (it was a short work sequence) but i was nearby as well and neither of them even tried flying back to the station. As stated above it's hard to replicate, it definitely doesn't happen in a regular way. So far i noticed it once a day, though i'll do more tries with my block placing drone (i remove it with the pneumatic wrench when he runs out of blocks to place as i'm short on blocks). 
I am using Fetch in a download service. I shared the file with your email over google drive. You will have to add onStart to the listener for it to be compatible with the latest version.

I was thinking about this myself. I think we should just write the necessary jackson methods to serialize/deserialize entities & events so that they can't be instantiated without their immutable state. 
I believe its the problem in a specific version. I got it working on this version c511401d4392a485ee1fe2339ab0abf58c90aefb. But this 088478e376 is not working. If I'm pointing to the wrong one, can you tell the latest working version.
It's a relatively non-issue. 
I just updated Consulo to the latest build and is fixed, yes. Apologies!  PD You're so quick fixing bugs that you fix them before I finished typing :D 
@gerzytet  Each card(issue) serves as a reminder and also a job to do.  I would say it's a bug of the website since the link is dead when it shouldn't. We do have the Javadoc for CommonFunctions, yet the website just doesn't show it anymore. I will have to investigate what is going on.  Wiki is different in missing information, not the link to the existing information is broken.
Sorry, Samsung Galaxy S3 using the official 4.1.2 rom (albeit rooted).  EDIT: Clean installed 4.1.1 rom using Odin, then did an OTA update to 4.1.2.  Then I rooted it, so it should be stock with stock kernel and recovery.  So far, I haven't deviated at all from the official 4.1.2 except for rooting it.  EDIT2: AT&T model.

4.4.2 Previously was turned on, after reinstalling wasn't re-enabled as far as I remember. 
https://www.repetier.com/firmware/v092/index.php  configure and download the firmware from this link.  Compile the sketch and then manually modify the some defines in Configuration.h, like above sample  #define EEPROM_MODE 0 => #define EEPROM_MODE 1  Then you can  see the error report. @matthijskooijman  Thanks 
worked well for me, thanks. Now only rest the lag on the start of the phases when the audio is enabled

My OS is Windows 7, and no, I don't see anything else suspicious. (On a separate note the flat scrollbars are magnificent.)  I found out the Medium weight font is working as expected. Strange behavior. 
I was using the Modern Warfare and Simple Parts packs, version 4.9.0 of each. As for Forge, I think at the time of this report I was using 1291 (sorry I forgot to include it in the OP), but now I'm on 1343.  I've been assembling an update and had moved up to Forge 1352 (latest that doesn't change the Fluid registry stuff and crash some mods), and updated to Flan's 4.10.0 to see if it'd still give me the error at some point, and it did. It's the exact same crash but I'm dumb and didn't bother to look at the full log to see the erroring entity ID, though I was able to once again log into the world after disabling Flan's, so that tells me it's still something to do with Flan's. I would try the absolute latest Forge builds but it doesn't work with a number of the mods that I have, at least not until they update.  I dunno though, it just seems to happen when something spawns, could it be a strange mod interaction messing with entity ID registry? I'm unsure of how entity stuff works in Minecraft's code so I probably don't know what I'm talking about here. 
Hello @mzelzoghbi  I am already on version 9.0.3 as you can see on the issue  thats where its crashing   its is not crashing in version 8.7.2 though 
Yes, it's a predicate, these steps reliably reproduce it when run in a fresh vespaengine/vespa docker image.  ``` mkdir -p app/searchdefinitions cat <<EOF > app/searchdefinitions/my_documents.sd search my_documents {   document my_documents {         field my_predicate type predicate {             indexing: attribute             index {                 arity: 8             }         }   } } EOF cat <<EOF > app/services.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <services version="1.0">   <container id="container" version="1.0">     <document-api />     <search />     <nodes>       <node hostalias="node1" />     </nodes>   </container>    <content id="my_documents" version="1.0">     <redundancy>1</redundancy>     <documents>       <document type="my_documents" mode="index" />     </documents>     <nodes>       <node hostalias="node1" distribution-key="0" />     </nodes>   </content>  </services> EOF vespa-deploy prepare app vespa-deploy activate sleep 30 curl 'http://localhost:8080/search/?yql=SELECT%20%2A%20from%20my_documents%20where%20my_predicate%20contains%20%22true%22%3B'  vespa-logfmt | grep what ```  Should print  ``` [2017-11-30 13:23:07.318] WARNING : searchnode       stderr	  what():  IllegalStateException: The function is not implemented. ```

@ryanjbaxter As a test I set the basedir to "/var/tmp/spring-cloud/repos/" without creating the repos directory. After querying the server these are the folders under /var/tmp/spring-cloud.  ``` Nov  5 14:05 config-repo-8260599878887614334 Nov  5 14:04 repos ```  I would expect config-repo-8260599878887614334 to be below repos.

@dilipkrish What can we expect?   When I have class like:  ``` public class HotelResource {  @ApiModelProperty(value = "The unique id of the hotel", required = true) private String id;  @ApiModelProperty(value = "The name of the hotel", required = true) private String name;  @ApiModelProperty(value = "The unique alpha2 code of the hotel", required = true) private String countryAlpha2Code;  // getters and setters omitted .. ```  Now the Springfox generated swagger.json contains a `HotelResource` definition containing these properties but ordered like: `country_alpha2_code`, `id`, `name`.  Is that expected? Should it not keep the order of the properties in the class? 
Hello. The code is simple. Load sound by AssetManager and play it by Sound.play(). All sounds are encoded with mp3, the strange thing that happened with different devices as noted above. Same code but different results on tested devices. I used libgdx 0.9.9 
The problem is that we lock wrong keys, copying wont help here. If we insert a record, which contains a "temporary" rid as a value, we lock this temporary rid-key and the corresponding index, after that we convert the rid into a persistent one. That's ok in most cases since the index is wholly locked as a component, but for auto-sharded indexes we may lock the wrong shard corresponding to the old rid value and this will lead to data inconsistency.  In `micro-tx` branch there are no more key locks, so obviously there is no such problem any more, but we still need to select the right shard, so we must assign the rid before index locking.
I have created a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates the error in the `SampleActuatorApplicationTests.testConfigProps()` method. The assertion fails and the NPE stack trace is in the log.  https://github.com/bonhamcm/spring-boot-gh-1927 
Sure. Please create a PR @mursyidah 
Here is the Crash report of the server [crash-2016-12-24_18.06.15-server.txt](https://github.com/PrinceOfAmber/Cyclic/files/672261/crash-2016-12-24_18.06.15-server.txt)  Thank you  
1. I have an HP Spectre x360 13t running Windows 10 1903, though this issue has always occurred, even before 1903. Specs are as here:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21211494/61143022-bf1e6280-a496-11e9-90dc-4c9b79da11fa.png) I think I heard HP makes their own display drivers or something like that, instead of using the Windows ones, so that could very well be part of the problem too.  2. Switching to software rendering didn't change anything. Nor did switching to OpenGL.  
I couldn't get the exact crash report that Minecraft gives you, but I did find a good alternative. I tried to get the file and even looked through the files and ran the game about 15 or so times to get the crash report file to appear in the crash reports folder but every time I refreshed to get it to pop up, it wouldn't pop up. So I did the next best thing and got the Minecraft game launcher output. I don't want to cause you too much trouble so here. I feel like I'm being interrogated, just to let you know.

Hmm, my crates are not in the same chunk as refinedStorage mod, but they are in the chunk next to it(diagonally), and i have moved the enderio tanks wich wera in the same chunk but i still get the problem.  But i moved into the dungeon far away from home (there is some crates here too, 1 small and  1medium) and it seems not bugging.  The one upstairs in the house in another chunk seems not bugging too, but this one is in the same chunk as enderio and refinedStorage stuff, its just higher than them 
I still observe it with the version on the play store as of 20190701.  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56189/60441598-e597fe80-9c49-11e9-84bd-54b3d295f85e.jpg" width=200>  I noticed that after a while (I took a photo of the screenshot, cropped and shared it with my laptop), the device was locked and when unlocked, the 0 ETH ether card appears.

No,I set it to false. I think need add Null check to ConnectRequest.
It's obfuscated when the client is built. You can't find it here because it's not open-sourced @Kyle628

Thankfully, I backed it up before deleting it, so I'll send it over. 
I can confirm that I can create a file with path length > 260 from `cmd.exe` using the `\\?\` prefix.
Running a quick test, not only can I confirm that I'm not calling the global registry to create an NPC, I'm [not calling the global registry _in my entire project_](https://i.imgur.com/kFFtBar.png).  The NPC is created within an `NpcController` abstract class which is shared amongst all my NPCs. The only difference between the type of NPC which is being saved to `saves.yml` and the others is that I'm using pathing for this kind.  **Creation in `NpcController`:** ```java     public NPC getNpc() {         if (this.npc == null) {             this.npc = getRegistry().createNPC(EntityType.PLAYER, this.getSkin());             this.npc.data().set(NPC.NAMEPLATE_VISIBLE_METADATA, false);             this.onNpcCreate(this.npc);         }         return this.npc;     }      protected abstract String getSkin();      protected void onNpcCreate(NPC npc) {      } ```  **`onNpcCreate` from Guard:** ```java     @Override     public void onNpcCreate(NPC npc) {         npc.getNavigator().getPathStrategy();         npc.getNavigator().getLocalParameters()                 .baseSpeed(0.8f)                 .pathDistanceMargin(0)                 .distanceMargin(0)                 .range(50);     } ```  **`updateNavigation` from Guard:** ```java     public void updateNavigation(boolean onSpawn) {         final GuardConfig config = this.getCachedConfig();         if (config.getPath().size() < 2) {             return;         }          if (config.getPath().size() <= this.goal + 1) {             this.goal = -1;         }          if (!onSpawn) {             this.ensureSpawned();         }          final NPC npc = this.getNpc();         if (npc.isSpawned()) {             npc.getNavigator().setTarget(config.getPath().get(++this.goal).toLocation(npc.getEntity().getWorld()));         }     } ```  Note that GuardConfig is entirely separate from NPCs. All I'm pulling from it is the predefined path for the NPCs to follow. Perhaps not the most elegant solution, but certainly nothing (that I can think of) which should be making any saves to the global configuration.  EDIT: To clarify again, GuardConfig is something stored elsewhere in the project. It's not something to do with NPCs that I've merely renamed.

hmm.. i tried sample it is working indeed. also tried all possible combination of generics and interfaces i have in my project still working on sample. not able to figure why not working in my project.  will send you patch if i am able to replicate on sample.  
Nexus 5, by default, uses the Hangout app for SMS, the standard SMS app is not installed by default. When I try to send a GeoSMS from Geopaparazzi using Hangout Geopaparazzi launch Hangout but nothing appear on screen. 
Nope. Still can connect while game is running.  Waiting for 1.2.2 :C 
tested just now and it did not crash, will downgrade veinminer to 0.27.1 on the server. Thank you 
Nevermind, the leak is actually on the tile-pool threads only. The Image Fetcher is an AWT thread, started for asynchronous fetching of images, that I noticed (in VisualVM) got instantiated every time a tile factory was set, but as of latest Java 7 it stops properly (I remember that it lingered there in the past, on an old jvm 6 version). The tile-pool leak bug has been here written on a sticky note on my desk for a long time, and it's been a while since I last checked it against the most recent Oracle JVM. With your fix we should be all set :) Thanks 
mh strange... now it is back :) Thank you  P.S.: I use the latest OmniRom (based on Android 4.4.4) on Nexus 5 
It looks like the problem is that remote posts have an ID similar to `tag:null@channels.buddycloud.org,/user/github@topics.buddycloud.org/posts,092f2389-38e8-445c-a347-6e1bd3308add`, and local posts just have `092f2389-38e8-445c-a347-6e1bd3308add`. So when you prepend it with a node name, for local posts you have node,id and for remote posts you have node,tag,node,id. Right ?   So why are remote posts stored with a tag,node,id ? Wouldn't just storing the post ID (without node and tag, which can be found elsewhere anyway) solve this?   (Spoiler alert: I'm not a fan of parsing IDs, which are supposed to be opaque strings. I had to add it in the node server for requests that return results from several nodes at once, but I didn't like it...)  
Good question @cwhelan  I tried with the following minimal alleles input, and it worked without error: ``` ##fileformat=VCFv4.1 ##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description="Genotype"> #CHROM	POS	ID	REF	ALT	QUAL	FILTER	INFO 22	16137300	rs567136176	TAG	T	.	PASS	. 22	16137302	rs573978809	G	C	.	PASS	. ``` On the other hand, I confirmed that the case with the original, full `--alleles` input still crashes on the latest GATK, version 4.0.10.1.  I don't think there is anything particularly special about the command line I'm using, except maybe the `-L 22`: `$HOME/gatk-4.0.10.1/gatk --java-options "-Xmx4g" HaplotypeCaller -R $HOME/GRCh37files/hs37d5.fa -I /mnt/fast/test.bam -O gatk.issue5336.test.HaplotypeCaller.vcf.gz -L 22 --genotyping-mode GENOTYPE_GIVEN_ALLELES --alleles gatk.issue5336.test.vcf.gz`  I will try to play around with the alleles input to get a small set where I can reproduce the issue... 
@stannedelchev, perhaps so that you are not blocked, simply disable the binary protocol for both client libraries, you can do this easily with `useBinaryProtocol: false`, see http://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/features/#TO3f 
@ryanjbaxter sure, in a few days.
Ok bug confirmed: - Activity is not empty in the web UI (and I had never changed my cloud password) - Android app version : 2.0.0RC9.
Thanks, it works that way.  I generated the application.properties from `mvn quarkus:generate-config`  I'm going to close this ticket!
No ... in album view it turns white instead of the toolbar. 
I tried this,  and /ignore - set up as an alias - still results in "Unknown command".  You are correct about /eignore?  I wasn't aware this was automatic, from the documentation it seemed to suggest that I MUST set up an alias if another plugin had a command of the same name for that to work.  Specifically:  `# If you have two plugin with the same command and you wish to force Essentials to take over, you need an alias.`  Anyway i got the idea that putting ignore on the override list would also be necessary if I didn't want to use /eignore but wanted /ignore to utilize the essentials:ignore function.  Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't the alias be essentials:ignore $$1-

I **think** we can fix this in the archetype. Switching to Beam will probably make this moot, but that's a bigger change. 
Well, I don't know what the solution is. I noticed, that the cron expression I had did not work for July 2017. I searched for the error in the debugger. When I changed the code (replaced 5 with 6) then my expression worked. I don't know if this breaks anything else though. 
Txs for  your response! I will test it and let you know if everything is ok!

> One way to easily solve this could be to always put generated code in e.g. build/generated-sources.  I think, that is the best solution. Another one is not to execute xsd2java or wsdl2java by default. And execute it only when it called explicitly.  For example:  ``` compileJava.dependsOn xsd2java ```

There are no reproduction steps.  This was an error report from Firebase, and it did not have a stack trace either.  Manufacturer: LGE Model: LG-H740 Board: Msm8952 Android API: 23 Android OS: 6.0.1 Brand: Lge RAM: 1.84GB Orientation: Portrait  I know it is not much, but I just wanted to make you aware.  It only affected one user out of the tens of thousands we have on our platform.  Thanks again for jobqueue, made our lives a lot easier.
yep,  I don't have a strong use case either. I just wanted to clean up some stuff on my local machine and have pressed the "delete course button" in ArTEMiS (UI) and it failed.   I just wanted to note this "issue" down.  
Hey guys. It's just me being an idiot It never occured to me that the manual would be in-game. I was trying to find one on the net at source of download 🤣 haha just ignore me.  All correct now with the mighty spanner!
The plugin was installed following the readme.md in this repository, the version reads "3.0.1" under cordova plugins. ![sc01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4947843/6213130/dd303912-b5ec-11e4-97fa-bfa92e291645.png) 
I've managed to get it to reproduce reliably, and this time even in the initial message, not just in the reply.  `Original subject: 🐕🐶🐩🐈🐱🐀🐁🐭🐹🐢🐇🐰🐓🐔🐣🐤🐥🐦🐏🐑🐐`  ``` Subject: =?UTF-8?B?8J+QlfCfkLbwn5Cp8J+QiPCfkLHwn5CA8J+QgfCfkK3wn5C58J+Qoj8=?= =?UTF-8?B?P/CfkLDwn5CT8J+QlPCfkKPwn5Ck8J+QpfCfkKbwn5CP8J+QkfCfkJA=?= ```  Shows up as `🐕🐶🐩🐈🐱🐀🐁🐭🐹🐢??🐰🐓🐔🐣🐤🐥🐦🐏🐑🐐`  After sending a reply, it gets worse  ``` Subject: =?UTF-8?B?UmU6IPCfkJXwn5C28J+QqfCfkIjwn5Cx8J+QgPCfkIHwn5Ct8J+QuT8=?= =?UTF-8?B?Pz8/8J+QsPCfkJPwn5CU8J+Qo/CfkKTwn5Cl8J+QpvCfkI/wn5CR8J+QkA==?= ```  Shows up as `Re: 🐕🐶🐩🐈🐱🐀🐁🐭🐹????🐰🐓🐔🐣🐤🐥🐦🐏🐑🐐` 
Unfortunately I'm not able to provide the project since it's private. In my project I have a method like so:  ``` java public Map<String, HealthCheck.Result> getResults() {     return results; } ```  When the enunciate:docs goal is run, the following output is generated into the target directory:  ``` java   /**    * (no documentation provided)    */   @JsonProperty( value = "results", required = false )   public java.util.Map<java.lang.String, com.codahale.metrics.health.Result> getResults() {     return this._results;   } ```  Where the incorrect package name is being generated from the CodaHale project.  I can try to reproduce the issue in a smaller non related project if that would help. 
Closing as fixed by #3791 :-)
Device Huawei P10 Lite Model WAS-LX3 Android version 8.0.0 App version 4.1.1
I think it happens when rotating the phone while viewing lynx. The OS is 5.1.1 and the device is a Samsung On5. The app has been obfuscated.
3.0.0-SNAPSHOT, checked out today. I'm kind of used to SVN, how do you report the right 'revision' ? 
This happens with both newly-placed vehicles and existing vehicles.
Sample query: SELECT FROM Point WHERE [latitude, longitude] WITHIN [[42.26531323615103,-83.71986351411135],[42.29239784478525,-83.7662120858887]]  South-east lat/long by North-west for reference.  I encounter this issue when performing the above query. I have a simple vertex with latitude and longitude fields. I create a spatial index. One record with a lat/long value inside of the bounding box does not return with the above sample. Shift the bounding box edges far enough so that the vertex lat/long will lie on an edge of the box (maybe just outside) and it returns the vertex I initially queried for with the above select statement.  EDIT: I upgraded to 2.1.3 and it has the same behavior. I am open to testing beta builds for linux. 
this issue happened with rv2-stable-9 i downgraded to rv2-stable-8 and it works  edit: i just tested this with only applied energistics and it does this on its own so i am sure its on the mods side and not some conflict 
Sure! I started with a note with this content:  ``` Test note  Test content ```  I edited it so the note contained this content:  ``` Test note  Test content  Edit ```  I think this may also have to do with timing. I waited a couple seconds, switched to Preview, and immediately saw the preview with that new content. But when I closed and reopened the note it didn't include the added content.  However, if I added the content and then immediately switched to Preview, I had to wait a moment for the preview to update with that new content. It looks like in that case the change is saved when I close and reopen the note.
So in other words, the ticket title should go back to "503 should be retriable", but without all the jazz about load balancers? Separately, do we want to give advice about _how_ to run Atlas in an HA configuration (e.g. don't use load balancers)? 
My phone is not rooted and also I don't have android development tools installed. (haven't even used it..) I think those are the only ways I can get proper log. Am I right? Do you have a link to a good guide so I can try to set tools up to get a log. I don't want to root my phone.  App's log. (deleted old, tryed upload -> crash, start app and copy log) <details> <summary>Log</summary>  ``` 2018/04/30 15:08:44 Model : SM-G950F  2018/04/30 15:08:44 Brand : samsung  2018/04/30 15:08:44

You are correct, the NPE should not be thrown, and yet it is - by your own code, not ours. As you said, the AuthenticationActivity is launched by OAuth internally, not by us. (actually, it's your OAuthManager that's starting the AuthenticationActivity, not WebAuthProvider as you stated).   We have not yet figured out the steps to reproduce the crash. There must be some condition in restoring the activity state that's leading to the NPE.   Regardless of how it's happening, your library should handle the error - not crash. The fact that your launchAuthenticationIntent() will do "nothing" if the bundle is null is another problem. It's called lack of error handling. It would be preferable if you could properly handle the null bundle and recover gracefully, otherwise a simple NP check would at least stop it from crashing.  BTW, the crash is happening across all devices and Android versions 4-7  Lastly, telling customers that their efforts to identify and fix bugs in your software is 'nonsense' is pretty unprofessional. 
I can create a new account on our test instance but you may have a faster dev experience if you create a data shape with a large number of fields.

When based on basic boilerplate, `npm run build` will create folder `build/SampleApp/static/js` where all the scripts are. In index.html, they are referenced as `<script type="text/javascript" src="static/js/vendor.bundle.js">`  My need is to have generated index reference scripts with absolute path and slash at the start, `<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/vendor.bundle.js">`  Added union.config.js (version 0.2.1) ``` module.exports = () => ({     outputMapper: {js: '/static/js'}, }); ``` and expected to generate paths with slash at the end. Its due to trimSlashes here https://github.com/lundegaard/react-union/blob/master/packages/react-union-scripts/scripts/lib/utils.js#L68 or here https://github.com/lundegaard/react-union/blob/master/packages/react-union-scripts/scripts/webpack.config.js#L134 EDIT:   Changing `const sanitizedPublicPath = trimSlashes(publicPath);` to `	const sanitizedPublicPath = publicPath;` solved issue.  Is there any reason to prohibit public paths with leading slashes?

I use v1.2.10.   This is my initial setup.  ``` 		WebSwitch webSwitch = new WebSwitch(true); 		webSwitch.setSwitchComponents( 				ImageLoader.getIcon(Msg.getString("img.speed.play")),  				ImageLoader.getIcon(Msg.getString("img.speed.pause"))); 		TooltipManager.setTooltip(webSwitch, "Pause or Resume the Simulation", TooltipWay.down); 		webSwitch.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { 			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { 				if (webSwitch.isSelected()) 					masterClock.setPaused(false, false); 				else 					masterClock.setPaused(true, false); 			}; 		}); ```  My pauseChange() method below will be called as follows :   ``` 	/** 	 * Change the pause status. Called by Masterclock's firePauseChange() since 	 * TimeWindow is on clocklistener. 	 *  	 * @param isPaused true if set to pause 	 * @param showPane true if the pane will show up 	 */ 	@Override 	public void pauseChange(boolean isPaused, boolean showPane) { 		// Update pause/resume webswitch buttons, based on masterclock's pause state. 		if (isPaused) { 			// To pause 			webSwitch.setSelected(false);  		} else { 			// To play or to resume  			webSwitch.setSelected(false); 		} 	} ```  It's supposed to call `webSwitch.setSelected(false)` or `webSwitch.setSelected(true)` to switch to either the `Play` icon or the `Pause` icon but I see no animation.

Ok, so it seems that creating nodes like:  ``` Create (n:timed:phone_type {label:'aa', height: 'low'}), (w:timed:phone_type {label:'ae', height: 'low'}), (t:timed:phone_type {label:'iy', height:'high'})  ```  And then running   ``` MATCH (n:phone_type:timed) where n.label =~ 'a.' return n ```  Returns the correct results (i.e., everything but the node labelled `iy`)  The issue looks to be with `LOAD CSV` and `create index`.  So if you create the nodes manually as above, creating an index before or after the load results in the correct behavior.  With `LOAD CSV`, if the index is created first before the loading, then the regex match doesn't behave properly.  Dropping the index and recreating fixes the behavior.  I should have mentioned that's how the nodes were being created earlier.  ``` CREATE INDEX ON :phone_type(label) ```  And then  ``` LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///path/to/phone_type.txt" as csvLine MERGE (n:phone_type:timed {id: csvLine.id, label:csvLine.label}) ```  Will result in regex matches not working, but reversing the order does work.

Well, I have the editor open, putting the cursor to arbitrary position reveals the outline to the right node. Thus, the locationmap must be valid somehow. But when I right-click and call getElementsAt it's empty for some reason. In other EMFText-generated editors the same scenario works as expected. With "between two parse runs" you mean just right before another parse run? I assume a parse run is only initiated as a consequence of ocurred changes, isn't it? In this case I must answer with no because I'm just selecting some text without changing something.

Sorry, platform was windows 7 using the 4.0.2 install. I tried to duplicate again with a fresh install but no luck - both dropping and creating the index worked. Ran through a number of exercises using pgadmin and qgis but still not able to duplicate.   Closing. 
Android Studio, latest: 0.8.13, gradle plugin 0.13.+ I'm not sure that its related for 100% to iconify lib, it may be a fault of android build system itself.   dex options that I'm using right now and that solve the problem are:  ```     /* GIVE DEX MORE MEMORY */     dexOptions {         preDexLibraries false         //incremental true         javaMaxHeapSize "4g"     } ```  before I use:  ```     /* GIVE DEX MORE MEMORY */     dexOptions {         //preDexLibraries false         incremental true         javaMaxHeapSize "4g"     } ```

At least full application on/off would be helpful.  Yes, I use traccar-web for 20 cars with GPS data and there's a problem with some (half) that, every minute, send same positions. 10 x (7AM->20PM = 13 hours) x 60 minutes = 7200 per day x 1 week = a lot of entries.  I should filter from the datasource so that the DB doesn't get redundant data (i'll do it anyway) but I found strange the high CPU and analyzing queries in the DB, found it was related to events...  BTW - my GPS data collector only gets data at work hours... so, by night, it's all devices being 'offline' x deviceTimeout

Just try it and you'll see. 
I didn't Force Close them, and neither app has a specific "exit" function, so both apps are probably "running" in some way in the background, but I'm not interacting with them at all. I assume the apps run until/unless the phone is running low on available resources (which isn't likely to happen on the Note9).

Yeah, the line #70 is called a "Diamond Route", where it divides and serves different parts of a neighborhood on alternating trips.    BTW, I can kinda understand why OTP is doing what it's doing with that trip, since it's always trying to transfer you to the 19 at some point (so if you say you'll walk a mile, just put you on the 19 and forgo the 70).  The strange thing though is that it's not consistent in telling you to walk to the 19 when you say you're willing to walk 1 mile ... same trip with a fairly small change (e.g., a trip start point 200' to the east) gives you the 17th & Rex routing on the 70.  It's inconsistencies like this from OTP that make me worry there's not a scale of problems underlying the routing choices, hence the desire to get someone to take a look. 
After running the "clean" scenario, it has been successfully built! Wow!  And another newbie question here, don't know where to ask elsewhere, please: Is it hard to make it run with `minSdkVersion 25`?
Here is an example how to reproduce the problem https://gist.github.com/stepango/52e9c69186317af1e95b

It's "undefined callback". I mistook it to report things accessed from within callbacks, but it does this. I had previously thought this to be an issue in PhpStorm (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-50785), and have enabled and disabled d-a-c with Restarts in between (and without changing anything else) multiple times to make absolutely sure that it's the cause.

No, nothing to speak of. One thing that I know we are using is HandleBars.js templates in our production javascript files. To be able to test these using jasmine, we are using jasmine-fixtures.js (calling loadFixtures('template.tmpl'). In our specs. Is it possible that this could cause an issue? Frankly, I am in the dark about this as well. I am still pretty lost as to why we are getting such strange coverage numbers....

@danielegobbetti I tested it but this is the result ![screenshot_20170326-101014](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2318483/24330720/177d4970-1225-11e7-9c64-8689e35ec462.png) 
I'm much more familiar with bukkit than forge so forgive me if I sound like a raving lunatic.  The event in question is the PlayerInteractEvent ...which occurs when a person right clicks on a gui capable block  http://jd.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/event/entity/player/PlayerInteractEvent.html  within that is an isCanceled() method.  To properly support this, I believe you need to add an if statement to you gui opening code to check for this isCanceled() method to be true.  If it is then skip openning the gui.  Does that make some sense to you or am I on crack? 
Yes, i have verified this on 3.1.x branch and it works fine. Thanks @grainier
@skabashnyuk The use case is basically automating creation of che and then signing up a user with the swagger API. But as it stands, if I deploy che, I cannot call the create user api without having to manually sign up first a regular user.
I have been trying to do this... seems to be hard to get a small example to fail, my complete multi project build where I use git-p4 fail pretty often but in a simple gradle init project not so much apparently. If I run the failing command in my /usr/bin I get the same output on stderr and sometimes this error seems to be forwarded to the gradle output and sometimes (mostly) not... This line  https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/176466ed281f85f2ba92ae8b605fb43eb3e010d9/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java#L639 seems to run such a command and spotless/lib-extra/src/main/java/com/diffplug/spotless/extra/GitAttributesLineEndings.java seems to be using these config classes so I guess it originates from there. It seems if there is a CommandException, it will do a Log.warn() so I guess this is forwarded to gradle.  https://github.com/eclipse/jgit/blob/176466ed281f85f2ba92ae8b605fb43eb3e010d9/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/util/FS.java#L515 indicates that it is not certain that stderr will always be read, but rather readpipe() will more often continue with it's work.  For me this indicates that there is some kind of race condition here whether the error will be logged.  Sorry I can't supply I proper reproducible example at this time. 
Done. Still same behaviour: - splashscreen - blank window Eclipse SDK - log file indicates same error
I'm using the latest build (as of today, 4/11/16) of Spigot 1.9.2, the latest vanilla Minecraft client (1.9.2), and I have no idea what version of Java I'm running on the client because I've never installed it on this gaming laptop (it's brand new) so it must just be whatever the Minecraft client installs/downloads.    There's nothing in either the Spigot logs or the Minecraft client logs. I don't know where I would find any Java client logs since I never actually installed Java on this laptop???  The pet hat feature definitely works for me, too.  But when I click on the pet hat icon again (which is supposed to remove the pet from your head), that's when Java crashes. If I just toggle the pet off instead of attempting to remove the pet from my head with the pet hat icon, it doesn't crash.   
I just did a bit of testing and renaming of profiles isn't a problem (sorry for claiming this above). But renaming of used scenarios makes Easer crash every time! Here a simple step-by-step example:  0. Install Easer 0.6 from F-Droid, grant permissions and make it run. 1. Create a scenario named foo (Time 6:00) 2. Create a script named bar that uses foo as a scenario and leave everything else blank. 3. Change the name of the scenario foo to test.  After hitting save Easer crashes with the message "Unfortunately, Easer has stopped." and then crashes every time I try to start it with that same message.

That worked! Thanks
Yes,  I'm using the chcp cli tool. It just happened again on my config.js file.  Starting to think it's with generated files somehow. My css file is generated from a preprocessor and some gulp tasks updated the config file. The other 20 some odd files that I manually updated match.  It's almost as if generated files from windows get a different hash from the objective c function. I've verified all files from the server match the hash in the manifest.

yes, sure I have. And it does work with https, but I it is not "clean" to write "http://" in the route configuration, because I also configure the SSL parameters for client-cert authentication on this endpoint.  If I have a "classic" webservice based on servlet with web.xml I can put <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>   Or if I use SWITCHYARD in FUSEonEAP,  I can ensure confidentiality like that <sca:service sy:security="default" name="LoanContractWS_WS_IN" requires="clientAuthentication propagatesTransaction confidentiality">   So what I want is to enforce https for a cxfConsumer endpoint (because a http endpoint makes no sense with client-certificate authentication)  
@jexp I didn't catch it before, but you are right - running the first explain is just as slow as actually running the query, and adding `CYPHER planner=rule` makes it fast.  I realize these are pretty atypical queries - I noticed the issue and came up w/ them while writing benchmarks to evaluate neo4j as the database for a GraphQL schema defined server framework. 
This is now fixed.
That's a solid idea, definitely worth pursuing. Wouldn't solve the issue I'm facing specifically, but it's a very fringe case and not likely to be an issue for anyone else (hence the super low priority). The duplicate calls in my scenario are technically across multiple systems, rather than just multiple sites.   I could add all of the conventional channels into the same system in the config, but I'm not sure how it would behave since the individual sites know nothing of each other.   E.g. if you had two calls start simultaneously on different channels/sites that weren't actually patched, but both had a TGID of '0001'.  It's a tough problem to solve, and I wouldn't want you to get bogged down solving a problem that likely only affects me, so I'd say absolutely go with the more logical solution to duplicate calls. Would be a quicker win and would improve the app for a lot more people.
I'm not sure it is the same as #3374. Nothing relevant in the log. I do notice that there don't seem to be any icons in any of my menus right now.
@magdmartin no, I haven’t tried it with previous version. Its my first time using Open Refine. On Firefox console I get this (which doesn't appear on Chromium):  ![firefox1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1889828/12596892/12e1c7d2-c461-11e5-959a-2c489cca4333.png)  ![firefox2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1889828/12596895/1a118ab0-c461-11e5-8bdb-ff236363d8cf.png) 
Looks good now, thanks!!
Made an issue for the IntentReceivers: https://github.com/inaturalist/iNaturalistAndroid/issues/356
Hi, thanks for the feedback. I finally found out the problem. Entries with a tag always appear at the top of the list in the 'float' mode, even if they do not fit the search. In the 'filter' mode they are not visible, which is more consistent. Thus it is not a bug but rather an annoying feature. In my view, tagged entries not fulfilling the search may appear first atop the grayed items, however not at the very top. 
We should use a standard escape character and make it consistent across DG modelling syntax whenever we use a delim character within the model. For example a "\" set="%ssn,%number(3\,2)" 
My language is Greek, but I, too, suspected that it might be a problem with the language so I turned my phone to English (UK), rebooted, cleared all CM3G data, and unfortunately the problem persists. 
No I did check disk space was fine.  We added monitoring to detect this so the next time that happens I'll run a jstack.
I tested it too, the problem still exists.
Yes please include in maintenance, thanks!  On Fri, May 16, 2014 at 11:27 AM, jrrmzz notifications@github.com wrote:  > Looks like an easy fix. I can do this if you want.

Seems to be a problem when you give a target on a building. Observed this while moving troops.  @michaelzangl It was the default one 
Hello, the helmet is on my inventory. I try to do /pet show   after I pass the portal: [EchoPet] Your Pet is not currently hidden. 
Yes Philip, when I add baseProduct from admin, I'm getting this exception. It is updating in DB, but in BLC_SKU table, the DEFAULT_PRODUCT_ID is NULL, if I correct is using BLC_PRODUCT then I can see that product in the list of products, otherwise it will list like below screenshot, which I'm not able to add to any category.  ![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6489746/2049318/50533658-8a5e-11e3-8437-0750f5edbfec.png) 
Right, I'm saying that the table check isn't enough. Rather than getting the type of the enchantment, and querying that, query the enchant itself.  See the referenced issue for what's happening. I have admittedly handled it on my end, but you should probably take care of it here too. :)
You can use a very simple Setup.  Just start an Eureka Server.  Create a simple spring-boot Application with `@EnableEurekaClient` and add a dependency to spring-starter-jdbc with a h2 db.  ``` Settings application.yml: spring:   datasource:     test-on-borrow: true     url: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/~/test;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE     username: sa     password:   eureka:   client:     healthcheck:       enabled: true ```  Start the h2 in standalone mode. Now Start the Boot App. It registers successfull to Eureka an propagates a Status UP to Eureka. But when you kill the h2 process the /health says correctly DOWN, but in Eureka it stays UP.  Now if you add the follwing class :  ``` package com.example;  import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.Health; import org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;  @Component public class AlwaysUpHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {      @Override     public Health health() {         return Health.up().build();     }  } ```  Everything works as expected. 
@shakuzen will create issue for 2nd point and open discussion when free on the 3rd one.  EDIT: Issue created: #1327 
The turbine coolant port is right up against the reactor coolant port, there are no tubes. 
Both. I can't look inside of a chest as a result
Ok, to provide a little more perspective, I noticed that it's only the scenarios of two features that get proper naming, if I add a third feature to the mix, the third feature wont get properly named.

The entity is the player model. Sorry that wasn't clear. Looking at the code for #6698, it's checking specifically for NPC Ids of pets, which the player is not.
Starting app Syncthing.  were you doing scroll down in app.( 30sec nothing. app crashing  ) but if i use ADB on PC(linux) and log de data, what should be the command on command line. in order to get useful data ( fault Still present)
yes i always use the latest, niw i got 1.1.0.1243
The item pick does not have a filter, but if i add one to blacklist the chisel mod it works to stop the drone picking the items up. Version is >PneumaticCraft 1.1.4f<, running on the Crash Landing modpack in FTB. Probably just and old version bug, I'll install the newest version and see if it happens again.  I couldn't see anything related to this in your changelog, so I shared it here. 
The Screenshot is from Dynmap, full-world-render right after the regeneration.  But that explains why the world has only terrain generated.  Don't forget the Command bug here.  I do the "pregeneration" of the world to reduce the server-load when players are online and moving around to find other biomes or so. If I only generate the terrain, there is still lost of work for my CPU when the decoration is generated, so this will not really do, what i want - totally remove world-generation-lag.  Maybe a config paramter can do the trick here? So I can switch to full generation (terrain + decoration) for every filler run, to toally remove that i need additional CPU-load for that. Because with every change in a chunk dynmap is refreshing the map too, causing additional load. 
Finally narrowed it down. It seems to be Moving World(The core mod for Davincis Vessels).
Of course `"My Feature With Space"` have to be in quotes, but for non-whitespace characters it is _optional_ to add quotes. isn't it? When leaving this out, `"A"` will be interpreted as invalid feature name although it is possible (because `boolean isWellformed(FeatureModel, String)`will accept it (I'm talking just about a visual representation in syntax highlighting by the way. I don't change anything on the logic outside "coloring" letters ;) ).  With the solution described above, the syntax highlighting works as it should.  ![bildschirmfoto 2015-02-10 um 22 12 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3775170/6136562/f5802358-b171-11e4-8993-848332eba303.png) 
i just found out you can bypass the problem by adding commandline to bazel: >--python_path="c:/bazel/Python3/python.exe"  so apparently the default (>where python) doesnt work
It's a bit different - Chrome and Firefox have well defined set of protocols and ciphers they support. They try strongest and go trough the defined set.  In our case when OkHttp is kind of a proxy and we don't know if: a) set of ciphers on platform is complete or do we have some custom ciphers which we should or shouldn't use? b) what about protocols (TLS 1.2) and selecting routes? 
I'm working on this in https://github.com/OpenMW/android-port/tree/issue-35
@monperrus  I plan to investigate it this week. Then PR or close.
If there are no ranks available then an info message should come up to say Mann-whitney requires ranks. Upload ranks to use this test.  OR if there are no ranks don't have the option in the drop down box.   Rank file missing some of the genes: Will a rank of zero be ignored?  I would rather we don't exclude the gene but by default put it at the bottom of the rank list Or in the advanced settings maybe have this as a setting to either exclude unranked genes or include.  
Yes, I have network connectivity and network is working fine. Stopping and starting the application temporarily fixes the issue but little time after same thing starts happening again (usually after 1h of idle time).   This is not happening on one device but on multiple devices with v 1.6.0. As I mentioned with previous version this was not happening. We do have prod devices with 1.5.37 which are still running in the same network with no connection issues.
 Sorry was having issues uploading the whole config file but I can give you an example of what I changed. I just copy pasted a small section straight from the config and everything else is default. I thought changing the enable/disable effect (default false) would add it to each individual piece and enable/disable the full armor effect (default true) would change the tooltip to reflect that. I did look for the Tinker armors in the config but I just assumed there wasn't an option to change them. I just wanted to change the less expensive ones like Coal or Redstone armor as an example.  # Enable/Disable the Coal Effect (Boots, Leggings, Chestplate, Helmet)             B:enableCoalEffect <                 true                 true                 true                 true              >              # Enable/Disable the Potion Effect the Coal Weapons will have             B:enableCoalWeaponsEffects=true              # Enable/Disable the Full Coal Armor Effect             B:enableFullCoalArmorEffect=false 
Thank you for the quick reply!   I’ve inherited the use of a persistent database from when `Simple Monitor Exporter` was used. We want Simple Monitor to retain state when restarted (our processes can take quite long, hours or even days) and we have preference for postgresql when it comes to relational databases.

I'm using Android Studio, and the Solar System code sample. When I tried to click to a lib definition (e.g. the override icon for RotatingNode.onUpdate(), it opens Nodes as a decompiled class file. If I click "Download the source", Android Studio crashes with an NPE. It might not be related, and I clicked the button to report that bug...  But I didn't do anything more than opening the project. So is this expected, or should I perform some extra configuration steps to attach this zip somehow? (And what zip?)

@bismoy2013 the Presto query event logs contain all the failed queries and a stacktrace. I found this by looking through the logs for failed queries (we have an automated email, internally, that summarizes them) 
@rbirkelbach Please test on the monolingual data set of gsl*
yes 
Uau work! I have to disable access to notification inside Android for Gadgetbridge and Notification Center work. Thanks
Can reproduce it with seemingly any crash, yeah, like throwing a simple exception on game startup to keep the stacktrace minimal:  ``` java.lang.RuntimeException: Test     at org.terasology.engine.TerasologyEngine.run(TerasologyEngine.java:254)     at org.terasology.engine.Terasology.main(Terasology.java:87)     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57)     at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:606)     at com.intellij.rt.execution.application.AppMain.main(AppMain.java:134) ```  The actual log tab of course is still pretty well filled, but the stacktrace tab contents is tiny. Does the log file tab just need a max size or something? 
I've now been able to reproduce this on my local whereas previously i was only encountering on our production server. It seems like the version is incorrect like it is somehow using the created date.   ``` May 23, 2016 8:05:06 AM org.flywaydb.core.internal.util.VersionPrinter printVersion INFO: Flyway 4.0.1 by Boxfuse May 23, 2016 8:05:06 AM org.flywaydb.core.internal.dbsupport.DbSupportFactory createDbSupport INFO: Database: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sofi_dw (PostgreSQL 9.5) Pending Migrations:      null - load uw data fnc     20160523094713 - create-underwriting-credit-facts-table Current Version: 120.1 - create-credit-pull-tables ```  It appears to me that the migration trys to migrate in whatever order they are in the deploy. In this case load uw data fnc is an existing repeatable migration that I have changed. If I create a new repeatable migration then it comes last:  ``` INFO: Flyway 4.0.1 by Boxfuse May 23, 2016 8:08:25 AM org.flywaydb.core.internal.dbsupport.DbSupportFactory createDbSupport INFO: Database: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sofi_dw (PostgreSQL 9.5) Pending Migrations:      null - load uw data fnc     20160523094713 - create-underwriting-credit-facts-table     null - test Current Version: 120.1 - create-credit-pull-tables [success] Total time: 2 s, completed May 23, 2016 8:08:27 AM ```  I can force my (load uw data fnc) repeatable migration to come last if i delete it's current entry from the schema_version table (obviously not going to play with that in prod!).  ``` delete from schema_version where installed_rank=294;  INFO: Database: jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sofi_dw (PostgreSQL 9.5) Pending Migrations:      20160523094713 - create-underwriting-credit-facts-table     null - load uw data fnc     null - test Current Version: 120.1 - create-credit-pull-tables [success] Total time: 2 s, completed May 23, 2016 8:12:41 AM  ```  One other thing to note is that our schema_version table does not have a "State" column. This showed in the https://flywaydb.org/blog/flyway-4.0 but that could be Database specific or redundant?  
I'll check that next time it happens but if it isn't a bug with Chromecast discovery then why would a Chromecast have both services one minute and only Dial a minute later? and why would two phones on the same network get different services at the same time? and why would calling stop()/start() on the discovery manager make this happen every time?  
not sure; in essence it is 'just' the doc.xar installed. i'll need some time to investigate

Hi, I tried without success to reproduce the error with a MySQL connection (I think that the reason is that i can't simulate a very slow/losing packets network).  Maybe there is some other information that i can provide? 
@laszlocsomor @mhlopko Thank you for the answer, please let me know if this is the correct understanding.  The reason I have some doubts is that the same bazel project works on Linux, which means if there is some "whitelist" for system headers, it is different on Mac and Linux.
Yes in that way it works

Apologies for not picking these notifications up sooner. I spent this morning code walking the [Forsaken Soul](https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic/blob/1.12/src/main/java/WayofTime/bloodmagic/ritual/types/RitualForsakenSoul.java ) ritual and the [Cloned Soul](https://github.com/Ipsis/Woot/blob/1_12/src/main/java/ipsis/woot/plugins/bloodmagic/RitualClonedSoul.java) ritual. I see a couple of things that might be clues.  Uniqueness appears to be calculated as a penalty not a boost. Since your code runs this as a constant it should not be an issue.  One difference I see right away is that the original [lines 113-118] includes a *4 multiplier for animal mobs, while you fix this at *1 for all entities. I don't think that's the root cause, but it could help.  The other difference I see is in the health calculation, the original uses entity.getMaxHealth() [line 120], whereas yours is a little more...complicated :) [lines 143-148]. Apart from uniqueness, this is probably the key value driving the calculation of crystalbuffer/willbuffer amounts. I'd want to see if this somehow progressively lowers as time goes on for some reason.   
Only about 1/3 of the nodes before we got warnings about disk space.

It is not necessarily obvious, I would guess a significant number of users can run into this

That would be appreciated, I have a device with the problem but the logcat output made no sense.  As I'm a bit sick and wanted to release the Biometrics and other bugfixes I just reported this to myself as a reminder.  Might look more into this tonight so if you can give me more visibility with more devices that would be helpful.  My approach otherwise would be to comment out functionality until the error disappears. :) 
No I do not, but I have tried going into lua and doing turtle.attack() and it still returns false. However, half the time they do, half the time they don't. There's no discernible pattern to when they will work and when they will not. 
Implemented.
@gkeegan I'm on F-Droid's latest 0.17.1 build and am located in Germany.
No, the issue is on our side :) 
Which snapshot can I use from Maven to test this?  Once you let me know I'll run our integration tests again to see if everything is working as expected with your proposed fix 
There is no way, to my knowledge, as each mod can add their own drops, at their own percentage chance, without telling anyone else about it. Enough Resources, I think just hardcodes the loot and the chance.  It can also use the new json based loot tables, however this is new and not all mods use it.  This is the one thing I didn't want to do as I wanted it to work with mods as you added/removed them.

I am playing on 1.10.2 and the latest version is from June 6th, 2k17 and it's the 2.1.24. And it seems like you can select 2 filters after some restarts and then this bug appears again.
I will try to get a simple reproducer, however data size is not huge,  its generated json couple of hundreds of KB. However there is normalize allocation happening in buffer which rounds to nearest power of 2 or so. it takes many requests to go for next allocation.  Also is there possibility that it doesnt get decoded if command timed out. I saw await being used 
yes
I am debugging it in intelliJ and not using any logger config. How can I set it?
I just got the latest code from your master branch.  I checked, and it does have the changes for the commit you mention.  But it still exhibits the same behavior.  Seems like one way to fix it would be to have a try catch around the call to client = clientPools.borrowClient() in skipToNextHost(). Then after catching the exception it could try the next host in the list.

Yes... I forgot : in Application foler, the exe generated works perfectly. Error occured during installer generation.   It's not that serious, I can use Innosetup to produce the installer
Thanks that worked! 
audio=on, width = match_parent, height= match_parent  don't work audio=off, width = match_parent ,height= match_parent can work audio=on, width = wrap_content, height= wrap_content  can work audio=off, width = wrap_content, height= wrap_content can work  I only found this problem on my Honor 10 Lite
Well, same as for .06; imported from backup. Hostname, port, TLS, etc. all look sane. 
It looks it works now, now more crashes so far.  
Reproducible all the time with arbitrary class names and differing and equal short names on all clusters. 
There are two cycles shown there - starting from `com.impossibl.postgres.system.procs.AutoConvertingTextDecoder.convertOutput(BaseDecoders.java:247)`  This is happening before any queries, after we initialize the C3P0 connection pool.  We've seen another intermittent error on startup that caused a `java.lang.IllegalStateException: type has no supported parameter format: timestamp(1114)` exception to be thrown when trying to run a query early in our app startup that involves a timestamp object. Our best guess is an issue with the shared registry. I mention this as we are wondering if some kind of race-condition-on-startup is the culprit for both.  One other complication to note is that we are using a C3P0 pool for the majority of our connections, but create a single direct connection in order to attach a PGNotificationListener. Again, I'm wondering if there is some kind of registry conflict happening.

It is reproducible with the code from my link above. The return type of the function is float/string.  ![screenshot 2017-08-28 16 32 34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/330436/29778121-8d7bc012-8c0e-11e7-9da2-2bb6b230f834.png) 
This are the Mods I have installed [ModList.txt](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/NuclearCraft/files/380438/ModList.txt) 
Here's a diff against 1.0.7. All it does is make sure HttpResponses get closed. This was enough to ensure that connections in the pool can get reused efficiently. We saw after upgrading some services to Jetty 9.3. that the analytics library would just lock up because it was holding onto connections too long and timing out. This fixes that.

@axkr  Because this function returns different result in different mode. So it leads to give wrong result in other expression like ``` >> N(Int(Sin(x*Pi/3), {x, 1, 2})) 0.15 ``` But ``` >> expr = Int(Sin(x*Pi/3), {x, 1, 2}); >> N(expr) 0.95 ```  ``` >> Int(Sin(x*Pi/3), {x, 1, 2})+0.0 0.95 ``` 
Changed code to   ```java         operator.execute(tx -> Mono.empty()                 .then(databaseClient.execute("insert into foo (id) values(:id)").bind("id", 1).fetch().rowsUpdated())                 .then(databaseClient.execute("insert into foo (id) values(:id)").bind("id", 1).fetch().rowsUpdated())         ) ```  No change in behaviour.

Thanks for the hint! `grid.getDataProvider().refreshItem(order)` works in both cases.
i just saw the message about cardinal components. i removed that and still have this issue. once i get home i can run it to get a crash report.

I've reduced the crash to a minimal example. You can find it here: https://gist.github.com/cypressious/5ccfe84a31fd836fe125  As it seems, any class that extends Google's `SupportMapFragment` and uses any lambdas will crash retrolambda. Should I open a new issue on the original project? 
2.3.2.0 
@marcingrzejszczak  I try spring cloud with version Finchley.BUILD-SNAPSHOT,and the same error happened. I run in debug mode, TraceFeignObjectWrapper.wrap method seems work right. Application not Enter the breakpoint in clientFactory() method. and bootRun failed

If i have that error the next time i try to post a complete stack.  
err easiest is a deck of Darksteel Citadel vs a deck of Wasteland  but any deck full of indestructables vs any deck of destroy target permanent will do.  its not a bug they are legal targets and they don't die so all rules are followed its just bad to use cards to do nothing. 
No and I think because maybe nothing is dropped into the world (that I can see), the xp goes straight into your bar.
Hi Florian, Yes, it works great in 3.5.0. I just double-checked.
Please see my example：  ```java import java.util.Iterator;  import jodd.cache.FIFOCache;  public class Test { 	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { 		final FIFOCache<String, String> fifoCache = new FIFOCache<>(3); 		for (int i = 0; i < 4000; i++) { 			new Thread(new Runnable(){ 				@Override 				public void run() { 					fifoCache.put("key1", "value1", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					fifoCache.put("key2", "value2", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					fifoCache.put("key3", "value3", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					fifoCache.put("key4", "value4", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					try { 						Thread.sleep(1000); 					} catch (InterruptedException e) { 						e.printStackTrace(); 					} 					fifoCache.put("key5", "value5", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					fifoCache.put("key6", "value6", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					fifoCache.put("key7", "value7", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					fifoCache.put("key8", "value8", System.currentTimeMillis() * 3); 					System.out.println("put all"); 				} 			}).start(); 		} 		 		for (int i = 0; i < 4000; i++) { 			new Thread(new Runnable(){ 				@Override 				public void run() { 					show(fifoCache); 				} 			}).start(); 		} 		 		System.out.println("=============================="); 		Thread.sleep(10000); 	} 	 	private static void show(FIFOCache<String, String> fifoCache) { 		Iterator<?> its = fifoCache.iterator(); 		 		while (its.hasNext()) { 			Object tt = its.next(); 			System.out.println(tt); 			 		} 	} } ```
My activity is in com.matrixx.android.activity package activity has 1 @AutoBundle field i make binding in onCreate. Looks like generator only works ok when activity placed in the project root package 
From the GIT Repo (build locally) BTW, it is really awesome what you're doing with jooby (opinionated but still very educated choices) 
right now there is only one version of building gadgets for minecraft 1.14.4 I have also tested it with Forge version 1.14.41.14.4-28.0.40 same issues
Very possible. If your headset doesn't actively check to see which of the active streams are actually playing stuff and instead just takes the first available stream, it would likely lock itself into NewPipe's dead stream until you tell it to change.
I don't, however I am in no rush to have this fixed as the server is still under development. 
Hi Timo,         the article refere to default timezone and use it to convert values, so that the result conversion (i.e. in UTC+1 that is my time) give you something like 01/04/2014 01:00:00. but in joda LocalDate should be converted always in 01/04/2014 00:00:00 by don't care about timezone, this is by definition of the joda LocalDate so in jdbc type conversion that is something that I'm concerning about.  We are using oracle 11.2.01 with querydsl-sql (no hibernate). The fields on db is of type Date (that is Date + Time with no locale support afaik)  Below the example code. The insertRsaRTariffe method add a date value (from another select, but is the same if I use an insert from a bean with LocalDate) in the right way (01/04/2014 00:00:00), but the select +where filter generate a value 01/04/2014 01:00:00 (see SQL) so  there is no match non filter.  Please feel free to ask me others details.  ``` java     public Boolean isRsaRTariffeSovrapposta(Long idStruttura, Long contatore, LocalDate validaARicerca) {         RsaRTariffe_QSQL    rsaRTariffe_QSQL    = RsaRTariffe_QSQL.rsaRTariffe;          SQLQuery selectClause    = queryDslJdbcTemplateViaHibernateSession.getQuery().from(rsaRTariffe_QSQL);          BooleanBuilder            booleanBuilder            = new BooleanBuilder();         booleanBuilder.and(rsaRTariffe_QSQL.idStruttura.eq(idStruttura).and(rsaRTariffe_QSQL.contatore.ne(contatore)));          selectClause.where(booleanBuilder);          BooleanBuilder            booleanBuilder1            = new BooleanBuilder();          booleanBuilder1.or(rsaRTariffe_QSQL.validaA.isNull());         booleanBuilder1.or(rsaRTariffe_QSQL.validaA.isNotNull().and(rsaRTariffe_QSQL.validaA.after(validaDaRicerca)));         selectClause.where(booleanBuilder1);          selectClause.singleResult(rsaRTariffe_QSQL.idStruttura);          Boolean result = selectClause.exists();          return result;     }          @Test     public void testRsaRTariffeBusinessImpl() {         Long        idStruttura        = 9L;         Long        contatore        = 2L;         Calendar cal2 = Calendar.getInstance();         cal.set(2014, 1, 1);         LocalDate    validaARicerca    = new LocalDate(cal2);         rsaRTariffeBusinessImpl.isRsaRTariffeSovrapposta(idStruttura, contatore, validaARicerca);     }   @Override     @Transactional(readOnly = false, propagation = Propagation.REQUIRED)     public Long insertRsaRTariffe(RsaRTariffe rsaRTariffe) {         RsaRTariffe_QSQL    rsaRTariffe_QSQL1    = new RsaRTariffe_QSQL("rsaRTariffe_QSQL1");          SQLQuery selectClause = queryDslJdbcTemplateViaHibernateSession.getQuery()                 .from(rsaRTariffe_QSQL1)                 .where(rsaRTariffe_QSQL1.idStruttura.eq(rsaRTariffe.getIdStruttura()));          Long result = selectClause.uniqueResult(rsaRTariffe_QSQL1.contatore.max());          rsaRTariffe.setContatore(result + 1);         rsaRTariffe.setPostiLetto(0L);         RsaRTariffe_QSQL    rsaRTariffe_QSQL    = RsaRTariffe_QSQL.rsaRTariffe;         SQLInsertClause        insertClause        = queryDslJdbcTemplateViaHibernateSession.insertSql(rsaRTariffe_QSQL).populate(rsaRTariffe,DefaultMapper.WITH_NULL_BINDINGS);          Long                rows                = insertClause.execute();         return rows;     } ```  ``` sql SELECT * FROM (     SELECT 1     FROM RSA_R_TARIFFE RSA_R_TARIFFE     WHERE RSA_R_TARIFFE.ID_STRUTTURA = 9         AND RSA_R_TARIFFE.CONTATORE != 2         AND (             RSA_R_TARIFFE.VALIDA_A IS NULL             OR RSA_R_TARIFFE.VALIDA_A IS NOT NULL             AND RSA_R_TARIFFE.VALIDA_A > to_date('02/01/2013 01:00:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi:ss')             AND RSA_R_TARIFFE.VALIDA_A = to_date('02/01/2013 01:00:00', 'mm/dd/yyyy hh24:mi:ss')             )     ) WHERE rownum <= 1 ``` 
Yes. When you put it in the table, the outcome slot shows a full drill but when you pick it up from the table it's empty  On Oct 18, 2016 7:22 PM, "Ellpeck" notifications@github.com wrote:  > Does this happen in a Vanilla Crafting Table? >  > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub > https://github.com/Ellpeck/ActuallyAdditions/issues/289#issuecomment-254667573, > or mute the thread > https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AKWz_M6Bl6wHIE47Bp0_7zKKviPOZHgvks5q1VSwgaJpZM4KaYNi > . 
Yes, I do.  Noticed it as fixed - what version is the change going into? 
Opens, bounces, quits About .5-5 seconds 
Eclipse and I am using Rabbit 3.5.7 client
How stupid, you are completely right Mark. I must have been staring at too many type errors lately ;-) 
Yes it seems to occur every time for me.
Great, it works as expected, thanks a lot!
I tested the fix by invoking the new code indirectly through the [de.dentrassi.maven.rpm](https://ctron.github.io/rpm-builder/index.html) Maven plugin and it successfully created a .rpm file larger than 2GB (the file created was 2487127517 bytes). I can no longer reproduce the problem, so I believe the fix works. At least on my system and use case.
At the moment the IDE uses CTL-L to go to a given line of code. In eclipse the default is to use CTRL-G (goto). In the library editor I was thinking about (read: am currently) using CTRL-L for opening the library's folder in the OS navigator (Finder/Explorer/... on Linux).  <img width="1133" alt="arduino-2015-11-05 at 11 05 52 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1318077/10965451/4d0ca2d2-83ad-11e5-9b79-ce98f64bc3e5.png">  Does anyone have a better suggestion for OpenLib, or might it be possible to switch CTRL-L to CTRL-G instead?!  PS: the files list is gone because the outline view is more practical, and "show build folder" is for opening the location where the builder is compiling everything (powerHackers might find it easier than to grad it from the console after a compile finishes). So the last section of the menu is for context-dependent (lib, ........) contributed menu items.

Just tried that, can't get it to work, even with a brand new world and a brand new minecraft install. I'm running the latest version of forge (2299) and cyclopscore 0.10.3, commoncapabilites 1.3.2. Is there a dependency I need to update or something?
is a crash really weird and it happens random. On the emulator Nexus 4 with Android 4.3 never happens with the emulator Nexus 7 with Android 4.3 it happens random, changing accounts, opening a transaction, or opening the drawer....in a manner precisely abnormal.

Hii,  Okay, I don't use SQLite, but I can send you a copy of the database if you want to? I'll do everything that you are saying, to help you fix the bug. 
I dont' think I have anything special in my configuration, but you are correct that SSL is enabled. If the Jetty 8 sample application is working, I suspect its because both Jetty 8 and 9 are on the classpath, but that's not an option for my system.

Yes, here is an example that crashes:      import spoon.Launcher;          public class Crash {         public static void main(String[] args) {             Launcher.parseClass("class A { void foo() {");         }     }
Hi imotov  It's quite a big bit of json and I had to obscure the index and shard information as it was too long for the comment section in github. If you need it happy to talk offline via email etc. We quite a large number of indices.  ``` {          "snapshots": {             "snapshots": [                 {                     "include_global_state": true,                      "indices": [                     ],                      "repository": "s3_repository",                      "shards": [                     ],                      "snapshot": "custom_snapshot_24_04_2014_17:27",                      "state": "ABORTED"                 }             ]         } }  ``` 
Checked it out and it works! Nice 
yes i use bungeecord https://mega.nz/#!c3pCUApD!CHhJ1VJW77zZGu93_NLctbuT7cUxiSjZf0bK_7EL8sA (log file)
Yes I can view the video stream in my web browser. 
Hum... Well I just do Reformat Code -> Rearrange entries to fix the problem until the next build when the file changes again.
I try to do so after i tested the new orespawn Version through.
@evant yes, and this is weird.  
My workaround was to run it on JDK 1.8.0_152 :) Was easy to me, maybe not so free on every platform, though.
Much better. Would the following code even work? Seems like it would only check once - don't want to give the user the wrong idea.  ``` java if (sewage_level.get() > 1000.0f) {     // open drainage valve } ``` 
So I need to have it in Jenkinsfile, ok  But what if I want to trigger just one of repos? Did I set it properly?  ```` pipeline {  agent any   properties([   pipelineTriggers([    [$class: 'GenericTrigger',     genericVariables: [      [expressionType: 'JSONPath', key: 'FULL_REPOSITORY_NAME', value: '$.repository.full_name'],     ],     regexpFilterText: "${FULL_REPOSITORY_NAME}",     regexpFilterExpression: 'my_bitbucket_account/my_bitbucket_repo'    ]   ])  ])  ... } ````  where `my_bitbucket_account/my_bitbucket_repo` shows properly what I want to build now  Now I setted webhook to **jenkins.com:8080/job/job-name/build** without CSRF protection as a working out-of-box solution, but I want to have more secure Jenkins instance, so will check that trigger via pipeline :)

No, it's completely messed up. When it's night in PC, moon and stars are showing, the sun is up but low at the horizon on PE.  Possibly, the moon is at the same position as the sun, if that's what you're asking?
Unfortunately neither rebooting nor clearing the application cache fixes it. Going to fork this and try debugging it locally later tonight. If I find something I'll send over a PR. 
Nothing in that area was altered. I reinstalled the v2.2 released on Spigot and the issue seems to be gone. Not sure whether it was a restart or jar change that fixed it.
Just checked and there is no shadow either.  I also tested with an empty card in a CardViewNative... I'm using the emulator btw.

I'll do you one better. I recorded this and threw it on Youtube.  https://youtu.be/TWooGfy0P7Y  As you see from the video, it works right at the start but then it won't let the cart pass going the other way. This leads me to believe that I am doing something wrong but I can't seem to figure out what.  I am using it in a modpack... Could that be the issue? 
Actually it doesn't seem to be a Payara issue but a JDK one.  I've verified my issue is related to the following bug: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8196491 .  Thanks for your response. 
I'll have to check when I get back to my computer.

It should change the brightness, just like ON/OFF should turn the light on and off. 
The code works with the BootsFaces-0.8.1-SNAPSHOT. Thank you very much for your efforts. 
ok! thank you Diana

Yes, it does. But I can no longer resize the client. 
@tux-mind search for target A exploit, edit it to use a certain IP Search for target B the target A IP stays in B. It will be better if we have a condition, when you edit the options the IP address of the target is automatically set in RHOST, like armitage does

Hmm, we can do that. However, in that case we are editing the behaviour of `Save as`. Why not just have a dedicated dialog for creating boards?

It is possible that it wasn't shutdown correctly though this instance is running on one of our cloud servers. We have a policy of not using kill -9 unless there is no other choice. Due to the fact that the instance is running in the cloud, nor does the machine ever experience a sudden loss of power. I'll try to get the db. Andrey, I think you know this already, but it needs to be stated. A general problem with Orient DB continues to be that the database is brittle, and over time information is lost. We see this behavior on pretty much all installations.
@jtaubensee Sample code attached. It happens in Eclipse/Inellij  The program prints the last code message: "Send sample completed." after which it is supposed to exit but it continues to run, the "red square" icon is active "Terminate/Stop" button needs to be clicked on to exit.  [SendSampleQueue.java.txt](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-java/files/980121/SendSampleQueue.java.txt)  
Sure! https://youtu.be/uE0_57qgZD8  I think the event fires twice for no good reason in this case. ( Maybe it fires the crafting event here for each of the 2 axes ?? , since the regular shapeFormed fires only once for the diamond axe, as shown in the video. )

Communication between pods is working when use grpc communication. I have To enable debug logging to see these stack. However seems not really normal. Maybe I have To forward issue to openshift 
Yes, I do have that set.
It quickly flashes a couple of messages about registration and such, and ends with a window titled Success. 
Hi @DerekTBrown , my inventory:   ``` [laptop] aavn-laptop25 ansible_host=192.168.10.10 ansible_user=xxx ansible_password=xxx ``` Is it correct ? rundeck can get host info from this inventory
Sorry for late. I use this library to play video https://github.com/Bilibili/ijkplayer. So where can i find your sample app? I'd like to try it myself. May be something's wrong with my project, I'm going to review my code now. 
> could you please provide also the whole command how you are creating the mixed index?  Sure, it should have been created like this (we use a script that is auto-generated to create the index, I tried to reconstruct it in a few lines, but there could be syntax errors now):  ```groovy address = mgmt.makePropertyKey("Address").dataType(String.class).                 cardinality(Cardinality.SINGLE).make() email = mgmt.makeVertexLabel("Email").make() mgmt.buildIndex("EmailByAddress, Vertex.class).     addKey(address, Mapping.TEXT.asParameter(), new Parameter<String>('EmailByAddress', 'email')).     indexOnly(email).buildMixedIndex("search") ```  I'm not sure if that's also relevant, but we then use an [index template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html) to define how this property should be indexed in Elasticsearch:  ```js {   "template": "<%= janusgraphKeyspace %>_emailbyaddress*",   "order": 1,   "settings": {     "analysis": {       "filter": {         "emailfilter": {           "type": "pattern_capture",           "preserve_original": 1,           "patterns": ["([^@]+)", "(\\\\p{L}+)", "(\\\\d+)", "@(.+)", "([^-@]+)"]         }       },       "analyzer": {         "emailanalyzer": {           "tokenizer": "emailtokenizer",           "filter": ["emailfilter", "lowercase", "unique"]         }       },       "tokenizer": {         "emailtokenizer": {           "type": "uax_url_email"         }       }     }   },   "version": 1 } ```  > How many there addresses with example.com?  9 right now:  ```groovy gremlin> g.V().has('EmailMeta', 'Address', textContainsRegex('example.com')).count() ==>9 ```

The fix didn’t work in a quick test of something else last night.  Not sure where it’s at now, but I’ll take ownership.
> Do you run Che as root?  No.  > Also, your group name is vboxsf - why?  che.sh is ran from Ubuntu (with Oracle JDK, Docker installed) on Virtualbox and the decompressed che tarball is inside a mounted Virtualbox shared folder, hence the vboxsf group. Current user is added to vboxsf, and docker group.  > What you can do is increase timeout in /conf/che.properties - machine.ws_agent.max_start_time_ms  Tried with a 600000, but nothing changed.  > Then, run docker ps, get a shell into a container (docker exec -ti $containerID) bash  ``` $ docker exec -ti foobarbaz007 bash user@foobarbaz007:/$ cd /mnt user@foobarbaz007:/mnt$ ls -la che total 44817 drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 Mar 22 16:08 . drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 Mar 22 16:08 .. drwxrwx--- 1 root  999        0 Mar  3 17:31 terminal -rwxrwx--- 1 root  999 45883817 Mar 21 18:23 ws-agent.zip user@foobarbaz007:/mnt$ ``` 
This is Spring Boot metrics: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-code-hale-metrics So basically bind the Registry called "stagemonitor" to the @Bean MetricRegistry.  I think we might have missed the Stagemonitor.init() call in the beginning of the main Method, but I'm still sure that Stagemonitor should not clear the SharedMetricsRegistry. 
I made a slimmed down project that demonstrates the same behavior: [link to repo](https://github.com/bpgray/spring-cloud-consul-test)  The application context runs on port 8080 and the management context runs on port 8081 - Both the application and management context are registered with consul on port 8081, rather than their respective ports. - The consul service ids for both services contain '8080' in their string, rather than their respective ports. - For the application health check, the url contains port 8081. I'd actually like this health check to be on port 8080, but understand this might be a bit atypcial and can address by overriding the healthCheckUrl with an application.yml entry. 
Seems to be fully working
yes, with snapshot issue is fixed. indeed duplicate.

a.) I like it.  b.) I would think so. If we have one specific file that's already compressed and is known to fail through the processor, this would allow us to exclude it and still use "strict" processing for the remaining files (should part a be implemented) 
@md678685 Update post with /ess version.  There only using Essentials TP commands, /home <name>, /tpahere etc I will find out about the other teleports and update!  
@michalgr  yes ! It is just like what you say! 
I did another testrun, but even with the new version its still crashing mc clients.  https://pastebin.com/VTd0SBcM  Also killed or undisguised mobs stay in the tablist, at least in bungeecord with bungeetablistplus. However i did enable  bungee-cord option via config. bungee-cord: true
@andriizhumela I have a single activity architecture and always initialized Stream in my activity's onCreate. But on Application death, the stream chat isn't initialized anymore, I have handled this, but this is generally my biggest discomfort with the library, the god singleton streamclient which isn't in anyway lifecycle aware, makes it very hard to be flexible and adds restrictions. It's not a good approach imho. Having such kinds of classes in a view would always lead to a crash like like this. I'm not initialising stream client in my Application class as I save my keys in my server
 @srikanth-lingala   Thank you for you Answer。 I am kind of understand why in my case it throws NPE ,and your is find .  in you txt ,there have a blank line in the end, and mine is nothing.    here is my test file  thanks again [a.txt.zip](https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/files/3468244/a.txt.zip)   
Yeah, can't reproduce it also anymore. Either is was fixed by some other PR or it is some exceptional case. Close it for now.
+1!
Both tests ran with 1024x768 but it does not show that in execution detail. I dont set the default resolution.
@chaytanyasinha Feel free to fix this bug when/if you don't have any other issue assigned to you :-)  The problem is always present for me, even after restarting the app many times.
I am able to correct the problem I have wrongly used <com.silexica.che.sequentialc.SequentialCExtension > instead <org.eclipse.che.ide.IDE>  -noincremental -src target/generated-sources/gen -src {path-to-your-extension}/src/main/java org.eclipse.che.ide.IDE\  
When I restart, all works, but I can't resolve this import: `import gov.nasa.jpf.vm.Verify;` But I guess that is not a problem with FeatureIDE itself, except if the library with this jar should be added to the project.  I will check the update. U r welcome. 
> @Gwynnbleid1 Thanks for reporting your issues. Can you please surround your log extract by code fences (three backticks before and after the code) to provide better readability?  Done. I tried to do this but didn't know how. Thanks for info!
I tried both the following options:  1) **soot-trunk.jar & soot-infoflow.jar & soot-infoflow-android.jar** 2) **Up-to-date sootclasses-trunk-jar-with-dependencies.jar & soot-infoflow-android.jar**  And this is my config: Options.v().set_src_prec(Options.src_prec_apk); Options.v().set_output_format(Options.output_format_dex); Scene.v().addBasicClass("java.io.PrintStream",SootClass.SIGNATURES); Scene.v().addBasicClass("java.lang.System",SootClass.SIGNATURES);  It successfully instruments many apps and they work. But for this Wikipedia app, none of the buttons in the first screen of the instrumented app work.
A ran the `python/pulsar_test.py` suite as per `pulsar-client-cpp/run-unit-tests.sh` - this starts a cluster in standalone mode (note how it calls `./pulsar-test-service-start.sh` to do this)
Awesome, that sounds perfect.  
Nope but someone is having texture problems 
Yes ... That's right... Like this:  Authenticator authenticator = new Authenticator() {  ```                 public PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {                     return (new PasswordAuthentication(cloudantProxyUsername,                             cloudantProxyPassword.toCharArray()));                 }             };             Authenticator.setDefault(authenticator); ```  builder.proxyPassword(cloudantProxyPassword).proxyURL(new URL(cloudantProxyUrl)).proxyUser(cloudantProxyUsername); client = builder.build(); 
it was generating `adc083x` instead of `adc0831` - probably because I planned to make it somewhat generic - the reality is that we will probably only ever support the one IC, however.
Here is an example:  ```java public class MyMapPresenter {     // <<<<<< Try setting this enum as private and you will get Compile-Time Error  >>>>>>     enum State {STARTED, STOPPED, PAUSED}      @StateReflection     private State state;      private MyMapView view; } ```
The macOS firewall is off on my machine.
@awalter17 The `return void` problem with the `Chunker` op was a legitimate bug. It's fixed now! Thanks @ctrueden!  The `FFTSize` actually is correct in returning a list, but we had to look in the `AbstractFFTSize` method to figure this out - it has [two ItemIO.BOTH](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imagej/ops/fft/size/AbstractFFTSize.java#L48-52) parameters, so it effectively has two return values. The framework was just automatically converting these into a `List` 
SD card. One more thing I've noticed: I went out, took some photos, and when I connected WiFi and plugged in the charger, they were synced properly - so the behavior I reported isn't consistent. Other times in an analogous situation, the new files weren't 'noticed' by Nextcloud, and the sync worked only that one time.

In the attachement, you'll find a small demo project. Does this help? [starter.zip](https://github.com/payara/Payara/files/331752/starter.zip) 
Interesting, now it seems to work for me also. But I have seen this problem on another project. MIght it be the case that the ordering of plugin execution within maven phase is not well defined?
Thank you @vsch for investigating. Maybe I am using the API incorrectly.  Here is a minimal test case (in Scala) that passes in 0.26.4 and fails in 0.34.40  ```scala   val settings = new MutableDataSet()     .set(Parser.BLANK_LINES_IN_AST, Boolean.box(true))   val parser = Parser.builder(settings).build()   val formatter = Formatter.builder(settings).build()   val markdown =     """       |Table of contents:       |       |<!-- TOC depthFrom:2 -->       |       |- [Quickstart](#quickstart)       |  - [Library](#library)       |  - [Command-line](#command-line)       |- [Team](#team)       |       |<!-- /TOC -->     """.stripMargin   val parsedMarkdown = parser.parse(markdown)   val renderedMarkdown = formatter.render(parsedMarkdown)   assert(parsedMarkdown == renderedMarkdown) ```  The comment is removed even with the `BLANK_LINES_IN_AST` option disabled, but the assertion fails in that case.  The output from 0.34.40 is  ``` Table of contents:  TOC depthFrom:2  - [Quickstart](#quickstart)   - [Library](#library)   - [Command-line](#command-line) - [Team](#team)  /TOC  ```  with the diff from the original input  ```diff --- obtained +++ expected @@ -2,3 +2,3 @@ ∙ -TOC depthFrom:2∙ +<!-- TOC depthFrom:2 --> ∙ @@ -9,2 +9,2 @@ ∙ -/TOC +<!-- /TOC --> (XXX.scala:44) ```

I'm on Android 5.1, Motorola Moto G. The last Version of PhotoBackup I had before the update, was 0.6.5 (F-Droid). 
yes, work! thanks.
Sorry didn't get a notification to the respond. I can't get screenshots because it is working fine now. But what I mean is it wasn't ejecting the cyanite was coming out of the reactor at all... as in not to either access port out or in... no pipes or anything, just a basic reactor. We have the 0.4.0rc8 version and Forge version 1.7.10-1.1.0.300 and CoFHCore 3.0.0B6-32. 
@Gitschubser  Thanks a lot, that explains it perfectly! I wish that info had been found in the API pages and not hidden away with different labels on the [FAQ](http://wiki.opencellid.org/wiki/FAQ) page. ;)  **Long CellID vs. short Cell ID** (CellID vs CID):  > The formula for the long cell ID is as follows: > Long CID = 65536 \* RNC + CID >  > RNC: the Radio Network Controller > CID: a short cell ID (an integer in the range of 0 to 65535) >  > If you have the Long CID, you can get RNC and CID in the following way: > RNC = Long CID / 65536 (integer division) > CID = Long CID mod 65536 (modulo operation) >  > Example for long cell ID 66808694: > RNC = 66808694 / 65536 = 1019 > CID = 66808694 mod 65536 = 27510  
The newest on the market: 2.26RC3 
Strange! Today, I neither can reproduce the phenomenon. Sry. 
@ryantheleach  1. I used the dispenser. 2. Everything happens in one chunk. Not unloaded. 3. Here is another code, I hope it will be so clearer. ``` Optional<EntityDamageSource> optEntityDamageSource = event.getCause().first(EntityDamageSource.class);         if (optEntityDamageSource.isPresent()) {             EntityDamageSource damageSource = optEntityDamageSource.get();             Entity killer = damageSource.getSource();             ... ``` That is, the player's killer is a fire ball, I'm trying to get the source that launched this ball.
I meant to say @version attribute value, not text. Sorry.  
Doesn't look like it, but I can't be sure. The reason this fails, is because of the change of the scope of the closure, which binds it to the prophecy object instead of the test object, causing "static" to be pointed at something else. This is behavior you cannot predict and you can't resolve easily as it can go through many layers of abstraction.  Personally I would simply turn this particular check off if it's in a closure that's not directly used within the same scope.

Hello @ronblum! Thank you for the very quick feedback.  Here is the screenshot of how the document outline appear on my IDE: <img width="242" alt="Schermata 2019-10-09 alle 16 13 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26568338/66489628-37a1b900-eab0-11e9-9617-8e467a68b2d9.png">

Sure, source attached, it's your example changed, in file MinimalDraggableExampleActivity.java I added simple GridView. Few things can be noticed in "Draggable (minimal)" example:  - when activity appears we shortly see scroll bars next to each grid view (maybe because of fixed list item height) - that not too much important :) - when dragging list element grid view disappears and appears when list element is dropped  [src.zip](https://github.com/h6ah4i/android-advancedrecyclerview/files/578381/src.zip) 
@acanive if you mean the white highlight around the logo in the header, I removed that because it was permanently enabled instead of on hover. Thanks for the fixes :)
Hi @Sancretor .  Just define a project name with `:`, i.e: SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe begin /k:"my-valid_project_key" /n:"My Valid: Project Name" 
I will leave the Queue Decorators as there are Topic Decorators there.  It wouldn't make a lot of sense to only have one type if these are to be general utilities.  MessageDigestUtils -> only has one method that takes a byte array and string appends to turn it into a String.  Was replaced with new String(bytes).  ReflectionUtils -> One this isnt jms specific, but there are also several reflection helper apis that are more mature and already support the full functionality of this class. For example commons beanutils http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/api/org/apache/commons/beanutils/MethodUtils.html.  TopicFactoryBean -> This one is very tightly coupled to Spring.  One of the main problems with this class is that it creates a topic from a connection then proceeds to close the connection and session.  According to the javax api this should also close the underlying session and topic http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/jms/Connection.html#close%28%29.  I am guessing that the only reason that this worked is that the author used Spring's CachingConnectionFactory http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/jms/connection/CachingConnectionFactory.html which hijacks the close call to manage connections itself.  If we want to simplify the basic functionality of opening a topic from a connection then we can put it into a static method on a utility class.  This way it is useful both inside and outside of a spring environment. 
Our project is public: https://github.com/dzhw/metadatamanagement  You can see the described behavior here https://metadatamanagement.cfapps.io/en/variables/create if you put an 'Ü' in label and submit the form. 
if the -z param is used wrong the help states:  ``` com.spotify.helios.common.HeliosException: Master endpoints must be of the form "http[s]://heliosmaster.domain.net:<port>" ```  i added helios behind a nginx with ssl. "curl https://helios.domain.de/hosts" works and lists the mashines added to helios.  if i run "helios -z https://helios.domain.de:443 hosts" i get the answer:  ``` com.spotify.helios.common.HeliosException: request failed: Response{method='GET', uri=http://helios/hosts/?user=root, status=400, payload=<html> <head><title>400 The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</title></head> <body bgcolor="white"> <center><h1>400 Bad Request</h1></center> <center>The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port</center> <hr><center>nginx</center> </body> </html> } ```  So i assume it is the client who does not support https (ignores it and always uses http). 
Well I did mention in the PR already, that I have no clue about maven or other Java-ish build systems... and that I don't know whether the build system needs to be told about the new file: https://github.com/dCache/dcache/pull/3628#issuecomment-339438940  So could someone just write another commit which does the required changes to the build system?

I will try, this was during a quick test on a temporary phone.  Would it be more appropriate to close this as "not enough info" and I can re-open if it happens again with the full stack trace?

I've tried, but today I'm not at the office and need to use a VPN to connect to the database. This causes the exception below.

Yeah, I'm looking to extract the map data from the [Rust game](http://playrust.com/) I could send you the asset files, but uploading is obviously not possible.

Thanks for the reply, I tried, still not working, the error output is slightly different  ### with File ``` Input #0, ape, from '/home/vivi/Downloads/example.ape':   Duration: 00:00:35.91, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 548 kb/s     Stream #0:0: Audio: ape (APE  / 0x20455041), 44100 Hz, stereo, s16p [ape @ 0x7f2514a2d940] Got unexpected packet size after a partial decode [ape @ 0x7f2514a2d940] Got unexpected packet size after a partial decode ```
I'm not aware of any app, I thought this was out of the box? 
No need to apologize ;) I'll provide a PR as soon as possible!  David. 
I've created a PR: https://github.com/eclipse/hono/pull/1009
You could place the annotations to the right of the entire driver station (making the image a bit larger), and then using arrows to link specific annotations to specific controls/regions.

@KostyaSha you mean? 
Nope, I wasn't using any shaders at the time.

Yes, at first I thought it was because my client side config was not the same. I copied the server config to my client and although the tooltip shows that absorption is at 100%, when i tested it out by letting some blazes hit me, my DS equips' durability still dropped.

Hello @rohanKanojia , sure so I have a unit test case which creates KubernetesRole and KubernetesRoleBinding as follows: ```   @Test     public void test() throws InterruptedException {          /**          *          * kind: Role          * apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1          * metadata:          *   namespace: default          *   name: pod-reader          * rules:          * - apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group          *   resources: ["pods"]          *   verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]          *          */          KubernetesPolicyRule kubernetesPolicyRule = new KubernetesPolicyRuleBuilder()                 .withApiGroups("")                 .withResources("pods")                 .withVerbs("get", "watch", "list")                 .build();          KubernetesRole kubernetesRole = new KubernetesRoleBuilder()                 .withNewMetadata()                 .withNamespace("default")                 .withName("pod-reader")                 .endMetadata()                 .withRules(kubernetesPolicyRule)                 .build();          /**          * # This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.          * kind: RoleBinding          * apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1          * metadata:          *   name: read-pods          *   namespace: default          * subjects:          * - kind: User          *   name: jane # Name is case sensitive          *   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io          * roleRef:          *   kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole          *   name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to          *   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io          */          KubernetesRoleBinding kubernetesRoleBinding = new KubernetesRoleBindingBuilder()                 .withNewMetadata()                 .withName("read-pods")                 .withNamespace("default")                 .endMetadata()                 .addToSubjects(0, new KubernetesSubjectBuilder()                         .withApiGroup("rbac.authorization.k8s.io")                         .withKind("User")                         .withName("jane")                         .build()                 )                 .withRoleRef(new KubernetesRoleRefBuilder()                         .withApiGroup("rbac.authorization.k8s.io")                         .withKind("Role")                         .withName("pod-reader")                         .build()                 )                 .build();          try {             kubernetesClient.resource(kubernetesRole).createOrReplace();             assertResource(kubernetesRole);              kubernetesClient.resource(kubernetesRoleBinding).createOrReplace();             assertResource(kubernetesRoleBinding);          } finally {             deleteRoleBinding(kubernetesRoleBinding);             deleteRole(kubernetesRole);         }     } ```  So, in order to push the KubernetesRole and KubernetesRoleBinding I will require the corresponding KubernetesRoleHandler and KubernetesRoleBindingHandler.
i think from 1.7.1 but i'm not sure because i can't test everytime i don't have a lot of player on my server x)
Both BentoBox and SkyGrid were downloaded from the release tab for 1.6.0 on both 
Changed it and it still doesn't work... Even opened it in the debugger and it the UUID is correct there. Maybe an Android issue as you suggested
The CAPS are use in a CONTROLLED fashion so your point on that was a waste of typing, and there is no attitude just hate repeating stuff now for the 3rd time it seems!  I understand that the NPC files are created with a RANDOM uuid. I also understand specifically from the lastAccountName value!  So the question is WHY or WHAT plugin could be creating this?    I type no commands this is RANDOM and it just generates this files daily!  Today i just deleted 1,300 of these files and when i posted this i just deleted like 3,400 previously.  The server as NOT been restart/rebooted since this post, and I/nor any mods have any commands what would create any such files.  Here is a list of my plugins you can view from this timings report, if you think some may or may not be compatible.  http://www.spigotmc.org/go/timings?url=14407071  Please don't tell me stuff i already know, if you have a question ask and i will answer, but WHY/WHAT would be generating all these NPC (fake/accounts)?  Thanks 
Which step should we replace? I think it's hard to replace `*` with all columns.  If the we can get `TableMetaData`, encryptor may calculate the owner table.
fixed!! well done, thanks! 
Hi,  The path, as displayed using   > echo $JAVA_HOME > /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_67-cloudera  The same path was then again set by editing the following   > vi /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch > JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_67-cloudera 
`Task` has not a no-arg constructor defined and is included as a library in my application - I cannot add a no arg constructor.   The following class is **NOT** defined in my main application but in a library which I use. The library uses jackson but my main application uses json-b. By the way, the library creates instances of `Task.class` from json under the hood. But I do **not** generate these instances directly from my application code - it is created by the library.   Hence, my application code (except the library which I use) does not make use of the jackson annotations in any way.  ``` @JsonPropertyOrder({"id", "name", "date", "enabled"}) public class Task implements Serializable {      private static final long serialVersionUID = -3670232159675112851L;      private final String id;     private final String name;     private final LocalDate date;     private final Boolean enabled;      @JsonCreator     public Task(             @JsonProperty("id") final String id,             @JsonProperty("name") final String name,             @JsonProperty("date") final LocalDate date,             @JsonProperty("enabled") final Boolean enabled) {         this.id = id;         this.name = name;         this.date = date;         this.enabled = enabled;     }      public String getId() {         return id;     }      public String getName() {         return name;     }      public LocalDate getDate() {         return date;     }      public Boolean getEnabled() {         return isEnabled;     } } ```

Already did (saw that too) and it didn't help.  I also tried going to 0.8.0 and saw a similar problem. There I received a "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no nd4jcuda in java.library.path" and this was solved by adding the location of nd4jcuda explicity in -Djava.library.path.  Since 0.7.2 works without a hitch, there are likely changes to how dependencies are loaded from v0.7.2 -> 0.8.0 -> 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT.

We receive our data from a third-party that supplies versions, starting with 0.  For one of our indexes, we only care about the most recent version of a given resource, but need to be able to support reloading old data (mapping changes, etc).  In order to ensure we're only keeping the latest (regardless of order received) we've gone with indexing using `external_gte`.  Our process simply ignores the VersionConflictException that gets returned when attempting to add an older version.  It has worked rather well for us.  Periodically, we'll need to delete data, for a variety of reasons.  These are one-off deletes, usually related to expiring license agreements and such, and are separate from any versioning scheme.  Historically we've just manually done a delete by query to handle these cases, which has served us well until recently. 
Very simple example. Test it on desktop and ipad/ipad simulator. Resolution is the same, but on ipad it's filled on the screen and on desktop it has black bars on top and the bottom. Also try to tap the screen and check the logs. You will quickly see that touches work only on area, which stage should be drawn, but somehow it's stretched (ipad ofc, desktop is all right).  Here's a link: http://www69.zippyshare.com/v/82635937/file.html Using last nightly robovm and the same for libgdx. 
I am running a modified version of the code (only change is DATALIMIT = 32768 instead of DATALIMIT = 8192) so that I can perform a 100*100 matrix multiplication. The program runs correctly in the graphical version but because it takes about 5 hours to complete execution and allocates more than 3GB of RAM I was trying to get the CLI version to work. I am attaching the program in this post [naive.zip](https://github.com/lupino3/edumips64/files/4064129/naive.zip)  
This works for me now.

This is the sample Dockerfile given in the Eclipse Che doc.  ``` > # inherit an image with node.js and npm - runtime requirements for TypeScript LS > FROM eclipse/node >  >  # install socat > RUN sudo apt-get install socat -y && \ >     sudo npm install -g typescript@2.5.3 typescript-language-server@0.1.4 >  >  # run socat that listens on port 4417 with exec command that starts LS > CMD socat TCP4-LISTEN:4417,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"typescript-language-server --stdio" >  ```  It is stated in the document to start the language server in the entrypoint. This is where I'm confused. If I am to implement a new language server (for a new language), where do I direct the entrypoint to? Can I add my language server to github and build an image from it to be included as the entrypoint, or is there any other way to do it?
Yes, you can start @beingadityak

I do have two other mods that spawn deer, Twilight Forest and Familiar Fauna. I have just slaughtered about 20 deer in a barebones pack (only BAP, LootTweaker and CraftTweaker), and not gotten a single drop aside from EXP.  Actually, I just loaded into a new world with ONLY Better Animals Plus installed, killed 10 deer, and still received no drops.
I have tested the new binding from build #598.  So far I stumble upon two minor issues.  ### First sub-issue  **Usecase** The dimmed light according to config above is set to 93%. I want to INCREASE further to 100% by clicking the "up" arrow in the webgui which will send a INCREASE command. **Error** The set value goes out of scope (0-100) and throws an exception. The _big question_ is how the tellstickbinding follow the "Binding" framework or if its wrong implemented. Should the binding automatic adjust the value to 100% or should the eventbus resend a new 100% command? @teichsta Any comment?  An identical problem exist on the lower half. Eg. I have the lamp set to 4% and try to decrease it which will throw the same error.  ``` 20:21:20.850 INFO  o.o.b.t.i.TellstickController[:36]- Send INCREASE to TellstickDevice [deviceId=9, name=LIVINGROOM-floor, status=16, deviceType=1, data=242] time=0 conf TellstickBindingConfig [id=9, valueSelector=DimmingLevel, usageSelector=null, itemName=GF_Living_Floorlamp, resend=1] 20:21:20.850 ERROR o.o.b.t.i.TellstickBinding[:121]- Failed to send msg to TellstickBindingConfig [id=9, valueSelector=DimmingLevel, usageSelector=null, itemName=GF_Living_Floorlamp, resend=1] java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Value must be between 0 and 100     at org.openhab.core.library.types.PercentType.validateValue(PercentType.java:48)     at org.openhab.core.library.types.PercentType.<init>(PercentType.java:33)     at org.openhab.binding.tellstick.internal.TellstickController.increaseDecrease(TellstickController.java:87)     at org.openhab.binding.tellstick.internal.TellstickController.handleSendEvent(TellstickController.java:58)     at org.openhab.binding.tellstick.internal.TellstickBinding.internalReceiveCommand(TellstickBinding.java:119)     at org.openhab.core.binding.AbstractBinding.receiveCommand(AbstractBinding.java:96)     at org.openhab.core.events.AbstractEventSubscriber.handleEvent(AbstractEventSubscriber.java:42)     at org.eclipse.equinox.internal.event.EventHandlerWrapper.handleEvent(EventHandlerWrapper.java:197) ... ```  ### Second sub-issue  **Usecase** I want to configure the light level with the down and up buttons in the web GUI. I have a dimmed device which got an "ON" state change to the eventbus. openHAB dosent know which level the device is on for sure due the wide nature of dimmer type to tellstick. BUT probably the dimmed device have a high dim level rather then a low.   **Today's implementation** When pushing the down button the value goes to 0. When pushing the up button values goes to 9. (0 + 9). The values start on zero in other word.  **My new proposal** To me its more natural to start on max and modify it from there due many dimmers will be on max when state is ON. Down button will start on 100 - 9 = 91. Up button will start on 100.  @teichsta, what is the best practise and design principles for openHAB? 
OK. The second code is; - getMap**Key**Decoder() returns **key**Decoder - getMap**Key**Encoder() returns **key**Encoder - getMap**Value**Decoder() returns get**Value**Decoder() - getMap**Value**Encoder() returns get**Value**Encoder()  This should be the correct code, but it does not work.  In contrast, the first code is; - getMap**Key**Decoder() returns get**Value**Decoder() - getMap**Key**Encoder() returns **key**Encoder - getMap**Value**Decoder() returns **key**Decoder - getMap**Value**Encoder() returns get**Value**Encoder()  And this works perfectly. 
Asked him via twitter, can check the spreadsheet, atm I always get servers are busy...  Edit I can log into G-Spreadsheet but can't open the sheet anymore... "Servers are busy"

Why not both? 
@tedsharpe I'm going to nominate @TedBrookings to do a first-pass review to check the system calls, as based on my conversation with him the other day I think he might be a good person to review. I'll do a review pass as well to have a look at the CRC stuff, etc.
I'm using the latest version available via the twitch/curse client.  I tried loading up just now to see if I can get this info for you and naturally it didn't happen this time. I'll keep my eyes peeled.  The tooltip had your normal error line for when a part id isn't found in the network but I don't remember the wording. The display gui had the red X and the same message.  Further info: The display screen on the left in the screenshot is using a variable card reading a single slot's item from the apiary (the queen slot) when the problem happened that slot was empty. The display screen on the right in the screenshot is using the list of items from the apiary, this showed the big red X on the screen and the back of the screen was red.   I don't know if WHAT I was using it for matters but there you go!  I'll try to get more info as soon as/if it happens again.
Oh and it looks like the filter interface also ignores the colour AND the localised name returned by `FluidStack.getLocalizedName()`  (apple fluid is just a debug fluid I made so I could test some stuff =P)  <img width="315" alt="screen shot 2015-11-17 at 17 58 15" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5294529/11219897/edce90ee-8d54-11e5-96bb-48c854aebf4c.png"> 
2.0.1-b446 is what I get when I run /ess reload  The username is nothing special. It does it with all players who go AFK. But for reference, it's Teethdude.
I have this on every release when clicking on the notification, instead of opening the app (OctoDroid) or the browser with the page of the release
No exceptions or issues flagged in the console. However, checking I can see that get-all-project-metadata is coming back with an empty list:  `{"projects":{}}`
Yeah, I know, I even downloaded that `.aar` and tried it locally, still nothing, can't recognise the `Logger` class (or `LogLevel`) 
I didn't have time to update them. These should help for the phone, but they don't cover the 7 or 10 inch tablet shots. 
@andrijapanic thanks, workaround helped
@tglman thanks for making it clear! It's correct, that the orginal version of the database is from one of my previous OrientDB instances, but it should still fall within `2.1.*` scope.  I am using [PhpOrient](https://github.com/Ostico/PhpOrient) as the client interface. Do you know if they use old serialization format?  
The tests were done with a already-pulled Eclipse Che nightly image in DockerHub.  The following was ran with ``docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /c/tmp:/data eclipse/che start``   Then I pulled from che repo, compiled dashboard with gulp as per instructed in README, some errors shown up (mostly doesn't exist in the current context errors, etc.) using ``gulp serve``  with server arg.  no local binaries were mounted to test dashboard changes.
Should be doable, let me have a dig
Oh, yeah, I forgot to write it. Tried. Nothing has changed.
@Joker4632  A fast fix is to Delete the player file inside the worlder folder.   How to do that: Find out the uuid of the player who created the shop.   Destroy the shop in the world (if you doesn't have done it already)   Go to your worlds folder Then inside this folder to  data/sponge Inside this folder is a file with the uuid (the same as above)   Delete this file, restart the server.  Done. 
Sure:  This is the `server.xml` of my example project; the database properties are injected from `bootstrap.properties`:  ```xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <server description="Config example">      <featureManager>         <feature>javaee-8.0</feature>         <feature>mpMetrics-1.1</feature>         <feature>monitor-1.0</feature>     </featureManager>      <!-- Postgres config-example-db definition -->     <dataSource id="DefaultDataSource" jdbcDriverRef="postgresql-driver"                 type="javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource" transactional="true">          <properties serverName="config-example-db" portNumber="5432"                     databaseName="postgres"                     user="${config-example.db.username}"                     password="${config-example.db.password}"/>      </dataSource>      <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443"/>     <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="Liberty"/>      <basicRegistry id="basic" realm="MicroProfileMetrics">         <user name="admin" password="admin"/>         <user name="nonadmin" password="guest"/>     </basicRegistry>      <administrator-role>         <user>admin</user>     </administrator-role>  </server> ```  And a file `postgres-driver.xml` that resides under `/defaults/` and sets up the driver:  ```xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <server description="OpenLiberty Java EE 8 Server">      <jdbcDriver id="postgresql-driver"                 javax.sql.XADataSource="org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource"                 javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource="org.postgresql.ds.PGConnectionPoolDataSource"                 libraryRef="postgresql-library"/>      <library id="postgresql-library">         <fileset id="PostgreSQLFileset" dir="/opt/wlp/lib"                  includes="postgresql-9.4.1212.jar"/>     </library>  </server>  ```

Yes, as far as I see the CLASSPATH environment variable is effective.  ![set](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1801890/6624512/21bfbc26-c92d-11e4-80de-a44eb7cd190e.png) 
It is Cyclic-1.10.2-1.8.2 - as part of hermitpack 1.4.0.  The description of #161 seems to match.  I'll upgrade and let you know if I see the problem again.  Thanks again for a great mod and your continued support.

Well, I fixed it... will need to re-break it to see.
is it possible that the icon attribute uses glyphicons and not font awesome?  that could explain why i only get a limited subset of icons.  when i just looked at the glyphicons list a lot of the icons are identical with the same name.  i will try to verify this.
Awesome MinusKube! 
It does not occur with VideoView

I have several fixed issues which might be released very soon. But there is no hurry. I can delay it until you are ready to release 0.0.4.   Btw, why would you version less4j with alpha or beta since the version is 0.0.x which implicitly means that it is kind of alpha? It would help if you would document the reasoning behind versioning used for less4j. 
2.1.0.0 
Now I not get any NPE, meanwhile I have a problem. In elastic search I got a very large dynamic data (so I can't create type mapping). Can I read the elasticsearch result as raw json? (the ES mapping type is wrong sometime, example It's got "" where it's need a number, try to put the double value to long etc) 
The license plugin automatically adds the licenseCheck to the check environment as documented here: > Also it will add the licenseCheck task to the check lifecycle task dependencies, so that during a regular build any missing headers are flagged. https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin  Unfortunately, it adds it to the build task and not "only" to the check. Thus, the dependsOn statement can be removed. Adding it solely to the check task may require to adapt the plugin which I think is not worth the effort. If you disagree, please comment on the issue.
I think this might only be an issue when creating the very first script window.  Once I had a bunch of script windows open I was able to select the database normally.  I forgot about this open issue until I saw jeisoncp's reply.  In testing it I did a few things that brought the issue back. - From a new instance of DBeaver with multiple scripts and table editors open (restored from previously closed sessions) the selection of database and server works.   - I right-click on a script tab then select "close all" - Double-click a database connection - Press "new script" - It seems to open an arbitrary database on that connection - Mouse clicks don't register around the selection object (can't drag it anywhere, open the dropdowns, etc.)  Here's an obfuscated screenshot ![dbeaver](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8485770/15029593/3f4e9c60-121c-11e6-8a89-38450d1bcc63.jpg)  I'll do some more testing on this.  Is there anything else you would like to see/know?  I realize the screenshot looks completely normal but I have limited time at the moment and can't produce a full series of screenshots.

Any long chunk of code in the console would do. I notice that scrolling when hovering on the scroll bar works too, so I think that the scroll event is not catched in the console panel.  I attached a video showing that I can't scroll if the mouse is not on the scrollbar.

Yes 
this issue may be bigger than just your mod. I have had galacticraft bosses spawning in the overworld. something must be screwing with the spawn list... will look into it 
Unfortunately I don't know. It did not happen in the version that was installed before, but don't ask me, what version that was :D  I think adding   ``` AppCompatDelegate.setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled(true); ```  to App.onCreate() fixed the issue though 
1.8.9- 0.0.2.6 
10677 is correct
Items flowing through water works correctly,  Passive mobs are not moving at all. I tested cows and sheep.  Aggressive mobs have the same behavior. While in survival I spawned a creeper and even when I punch it it refuses to move or explode.  Edit: Both passive and aggressive mobs refuse to be moved by water, they fling themselves like when I punch them and then teleport back to the initial point of water entry. 
Hi @drewr ew, I hope you don't mind, I emailed them to you as they contain data I'd prefer not to post publicly :)  @s1monw no stack traces from this in any logs on any ES node.

Thanks a lot @f2prateek  - I am testing. But it seems that Segment caches my old user id somehow even if I log out? Is there a way to remove segment.io cache . Otherwise I have to use a totally different phone to test this. 
Thank you for the analysis. My environment is as follows:  - Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393] (32 bit) - java version "1.8.0_101" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode, sharing) - OH 2.1 release version  But I can also see the issue with snapshot 2.2.0 # 1014 (did only try the item endpoint with this build).  `Charset.defaultCharset()` reports "windows-1252"  Let me know if there´s something else I can do to help to track this down.  with kind regards, Patrik
Yes, image loads but with that error log. I could ignore it, but I think isn't normal.  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7372650/CZ.png  ![cz](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7516541/7346877/10e829a6-ecb9-11e4-87da-c84b42e2ad10.png) 
2.12.0 (but seems that 3.7.0 also has this problem)
I'm using Nova launcher currently even tried with Google now launcher but nothing works and yeah preview picture reloaded into better quality before I select the "set as Wallpaper" 
thanks for reply. i mean terminal windows server 2003. os: windows 2003 server in terminal mode with java 1.7.0.67 i think it's when i'm using nimbus layout but not sure and when using your decoratedFrame. i continue to do some test to do a simple code exemple and i come back. 
This is the only one report I can see in sentry.
It does not fail anymore in our tests :/
It is Cyclic-1.10.2-1.8.2 - as part of hermitpack 1.4.0.  The description of #161 seems to match.  I'll upgrade and let you know if I see the problem again.  Thanks again for a great mod and your continued support.

Thanks for your quick answer, I will try to clarify the maximum of your requirements to to locate this issue and fix if finally it exist. We have only the next cookies at localhost (develop enviroment), the request sends: `Cookie:SESSION=9d1995b6-2831-4de4-a8c3-de41ef9ac970; JSESSIONID=76E7B5DD151E565C48B4CE398463FFCA` - _JSESSIONID_ has domain=localhost and  path="/context-root" - _SESSION_ has domain=localhost and path="/context-root/" (notice the end slash **/**)  The container is **Tomcat 6.0.36 (servlet 2.5)** The configuration is xml based as you suggest at #101: _web.xml_  ``` (defined before springSecurityFilterChain)         <filter>         <filter-name>springSessionRepositoryFilter</filter-name>         <filter-class>org.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxy</filter-class>     </filter>     <filter-mapping>         <filter-name>springSessionRepositoryFilter</filter-name>         <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>     </filter-mapping>    ```  _applicationContext-session.xml_ (class with @EnableRedisHttpSession) `<bean class="org.springframework.session.data.redis.config.annotation.web.http.RedisHttpSessionConfig"/>`  Finally the  _SessionRepositoryFilter_ has some changes to fix the #111: `currentSession = new HttpSessionWrapper(session, getServletContext());` changed to: `ServletContext context = super.getSession(true).getServletContext();`  `currentSession = new HttpSessionWrapper(session, context);` at lines near 193 and 202. 
Tested with SpongeForge 1731 and forge 2079 / 2088. 1.  Start the server (no special java flags) 2.  OP myself 3.  Put myself in gamemode 1 4.  Take any chisel tool (I chose a Stone Chisel) 5.  Put myself in gamemode 0 6.  De-OP myself 7.  Left-click anywhere on any block  These steps might seem simple in mind, but this is really the only things I do.  The mod works without sponge added, and it recently started to happen (guess i can backtrack that).  Here are new logs: [fml-server-latest.log](https://gist.github.com/FiveEYZ/a61983b213d697b67a93744914ac172d) [latest.log](https://gist.github.com/FiveEYZ/08647e1fd7ef43abb8c8c4f1db1c63e0) 
Im not sure as it was another player that did it but im guessing it was 2 or 3 guardians I don't think it was 1  
I have a .g4 file for a custom language from which I can generate the necessary lexer, parser etc. I want to implement this language into Eclipse Che, so that when I enter a statement/expression, the editor identifies it. I know this requires language server support. However, I couldn't find a way to implement a language server for ANTLR4 grammar that could be implemented to Eclipse Che. Can you let me know if there is such a method? To make it more simple, I want my ANTLR4 language to work the same way as it was when I created a DSL in Xtext, ran it in a Docker container, and implemented it in a stack as a sidecar.

[Log.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/che/files/2556520/Log.txt) Maven build output
Not too many other details.... I attacked with a Territorial Hammerskull. The opponent had two creatures, one with summoning sickness. I tried clicking on that creature to select it with the Hammerskull's effect. I tried multiple times at multiple different places on the card. I was unable to select it. I then clicked the second create (without summoning sickness) and the effect triggered immediately.  I will try to re-create it locally and see if I can get any other details that may be relevant.  Thank you.  On Wed, Sep 20, 2017 at 4:56 AM, theelk801 <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > I couldn't recreate this.

Um, try CoFHCore-[1.7.10]3.0.0B9-120.jar or CoFHCore-[1.7.10]3.0.0B9-116.jar. I went from 109 to 116 and didn’t test any inbetween.  It happens on boot, right after you make your core edits 
* `xcode-select -p` -> `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` * `xcodebuild -version` -> `xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance` * `clang -v` -> `clang version 5.0.2 (tags/RELEASE_502/final) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.2.0 Thread model: posix InstalledDir: /nix/store/d9yyrqg1gp7rjw1n0vfp06frxrdmg7wc-clang-5.0.2/bin`  I'm guessing the 2nd is a problem?

Now it seems to be able to keep sending messages after reconnecting, but there's some things to notice with the new reconnection process:  * The retry policies apply to BOTH operations, reconnection and messages sending, it would be more sensible to either separate both into two different retry policies (so we can set NoRetry for messages and a different one for reconnection) or just apply the retry policies to messages and keep the reconnection operations running indefinitely as I'm sure it would fit more "real world" use cases.  * The reconnection process seems to stop after "OperationTimeout" (default to 4 minutes), so unless we set it to Long.MAX_VALUE, we cannot have a permanent reconnection logic. I'm not sure if this applies also to other operations that are not reconnect, same reasoning as above could be applied.
Of course, thanks for answering 
Well, until now, only when I'm using Flubber this error happens, and I can't reproduce this error with another library. Maybe could be an error in the IDE...
Yes, it's a predicate, these steps reliably reproduce it when run in a fresh vespaengine/vespa docker image.  ``` mkdir -p app/searchdefinitions cat <<EOF > app/searchdefinitions/my_documents.sd search my_documents {   document my_documents {         field my_predicate type predicate {             indexing: attribute             index {                 arity: 8             }         }   } } EOF cat <<EOF > app/services.xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> <services version="1.0">   <container id="container" version="1.0">     <document-api />     <search />     <nodes>       <node hostalias="node1" />     </nodes>   </container>    <content id="my_documents" version="1.0">     <redundancy>1</redundancy>     <documents>       <document type="my_documents" mode="index" />     </documents>     <nodes>       <node hostalias="node1" distribution-key="0" />     </nodes>   </content>  </services> EOF vespa-deploy prepare app vespa-deploy activate sleep 30 curl 'http://localhost:8080/search/?yql=SELECT%20%2A%20from%20my_documents%20where%20my_predicate%20contains%20%22true%22%3B'  vespa-logfmt | grep what ```  Should print  ``` [2017-11-30 13:23:07.318] WARNING : searchnode       stderr	  what():  IllegalStateException: The function is not implemented. ```
I guess its the same with 1207. But I'll try your debug build
It's convenient when you want to debug the Liberty server while running the integration tests later in the Maven build. (If you're just running one goal at a time from the shell, then issuing `mvn boost:debug` is easy enough).
I username is editable now
This is crashing when I access a folder on the server, I don't see any logs at /settings/admin/logging or in /var/www/nextcloud or in /var/log, but I would expect to for a server-side problem. Since re-uploading one of the folders the problem has gone away for that folder, so now the problem is specific to just one certain folder.  Creating a test account would only work if you had access to this folder, wouldn't it?
I cannot pause my phone playing after using librespot-java, even if I kill the app as soon as it loads it starts playing again. The only way to fix it is to connect to another spotify connect server, like the web player. When ever I press pause whilst playing on phone, a LOT of information scrolls up the console window from librespot. I don't think it matters whether the music is playing or not when you switch back to phone. I built from source today and the problem is the same. I'm using an android phone and running librespot on Windows 10. 
It works now, thank you!
I had a problem with an update from 1.1.4 to 1.2.1. So I deleted all versions and installed the new version 1.2.2 which works fine: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/395

I see your point.  On the other hand, some functions (zoom in, out, layer, etc) as always(-ish) available so it could be the same importance as these.  I consider viewing info on features as super important so the function should always be available.  Especially if labeling is dropped/deferred.

This is a link to my mod list idk if it will help or not http://pastebin.com/R5fD5bd6 - Make warp called spawn in dim -112 - Make warp called overworld in dim 0 - Use /warp overworld while in dim -112 will teleport and spawn nether portal - Use /warp spawn while in dim 0 will teleport and spawn nether portal - Using /back also does same thing if going cross dimension  Nether portals do not appear if /warp or /back in Same dimension only when teleporting cross dimension.   Also using /cofh tpx will teleport cross dimension without making a nether portal. Seems to only happen when using ForgeEssentials teleport commands.

Excuse me for the lack of information! So i am using javacv 1.1 with android studio 2.0. I used gradle to import and compile javacv from maven central and i put all the .so files in a directory called jniLib in my app directory because i had unsatisfied link error. Everything i use from the javacv library (Mat, normalize function etc) works fine, but when i use anything from the opencv_face it gives the error i have put on the title. I use:  gradle 2.0  sdk tools 25.1.1  sdk platform tools 23.1 sdk build tools 23.0.3  Thanks for your response and for your help!

Just like in sharding application, configure one that has both sharding and master-slave ability. In combination, the official examples are all used separately in proxy. 
Thanks for your quick response. Just a bit more information before I attempt to redo the trace to try to capture what you need.  I have performed the test with two other mail clients, Thunderbird (45.3.0) and standard Mail client on iOS and both detect an invalid password and prompt the user to update the password.  At my organisation we manage approximately 110 smartphones of which 95 are Android with K-9 deployed. From my experience I haven't seen K-9 prompt the user for a new password after their password is changed, but I'd love to be proven wrong!  During the trace I collected I was monitoring the server side logs and multiple authentication errors occurred for the test account with reason invalid password, which leads to the other half of this problem where by K-9 will keep trying to login after password failure. Our mail server (Zimbra 8.7) is configured to lockout accounts that have a number of a authentication failures within a period of time. So in our case K-9 is causing accounts to be locked out within moments of the user changing their password.  To make matters worse, even if the user has the initiative to go into K-9 account settings and manually update their password, at this point their account is inevitably locked out, which means when K-9 goes to verify the password they've input it reports the password as incorrect to the user.  Another thing I noticed when I was testing this issue was in between the user updating their password in the email system and them manually clicking the refresh button on the folder view in K-9, K-9 would eventually display a light grey "IOException: readStringUntil(): end of stream reached" under the Inbox, and put an entry in the K9mail-errors (attached).

@David-Development The crash was just happening with v0.3.0, not with "-SNAPSHOT" version. Yes it seems the problem is not entirely related to SSO but with system permission granting system. It's happening on all devices with Android >= 6 and <= 7.1  @tobiasKaminsky Yep: ``` git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-android -b sso-issue ``` This is an Android Studio project.  Thank you both for your answer!

I get this result whatever the way I goes on a stream (top streams, features streams, followed streams and so on). I have the static image of the stream but bottom shows "Stream is no longer live" message everytime and I can't play it within the app.  Even more strange: I can use the three dots and ask to play it in an external player, and in that case it works. So it's only stream within the app itself which is broken (and status check resulting in the display of this message).  No useful information can be obtained from the `adb logcat` above?

Hello Harald  Sure.  Here are 2 .par files that will not work. Essentially the newly introduced attribute proteinInferencePreferences (see below) never get initialized properly in code because they do not exist in the old .par files. This causes the NULL Pointer Exception.   Please note that this may only be the first attribute that causes a problem, there could be others once this one is fixed.  "proteinInferencePreferences": {     "proteinSequenceDatabase": {       "path": "C:\Work\2\2\ABC.fasta"     }   },  Regards  Tek Wojenski  On Wed, Feb 10, 2016 at 4:31 PM, Harald Barsnes notifications@github.com wrote:  > Hi Tek, >  > Thanks for telling us about this.

http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Status_Information  Here's a simple version of a user defined status script:  <pre> #!/bin/sh # Get data for the WEB Miscellaneous backend status. mythshutdown --check --verbose general --loglevel notice | \     grep " N " | grep -v -f /usr/local/sbin/MythStatus.ignore | \     sed -e 's/^.......................//' | \     awk '{ printf "%s %s %s %s %s[]:[].[]:[]\n", $3, $4, $5, $6, $7 }' # Enter your user/password here: mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -e \     "SELECT value,data FROM settings WHERE value='MythShutdownLock'" | \     awk '/MythShutdownLock/ { printf "Shutdown Lock Count = %s[]:[].[]:[]\n", $2 }' pgrep mythfrontend > /dev/null if [ $? = 0 ] then echo "Media Center Frontend Is Running[]:[].[]:[]" else echo "Media Center Frontend Is Not Running[]:[].[]:[]" fi </pre>  The output of the above is just:  ``` Shutdown Lock Count = 1[]:[].[]:[] Media Center Frontend Is Not Running[]:[].[]:[] ```  I happened to have something like the above on both of my backends.

@spencergibb Sure. Here are the steps to test/reproduce:  - Start a rabbit instance and the `config-server-sample` - Create `config-client-sample.yml` under `/tmp/config-sample`:  ```yml # config-client-sample.yml greeting: Hello ```  - Start the `config-client-sample`and `GET :3000/` You'll get the value in the `greeting` property - Now change the value in the configuration file (`/tmp/config-sample/config-client-sample.yml`) to something else   - The config server will pick this change and broadcast an event   - The config client will retrieve the new value and return it on subsequent GET requests  **Now the Bug**: - Change the value of `spring.cloud.bus.id` in the `bootstrap.yml` of the `config-server-sample` to anything other than `config-server-sample-1` - Config server wont send any RemoteApplicationEvents when changing the `greeting` property in `config-client-sample.yml`  More generally, if the value of `spring.cloud.bus.id` is not `${spring.application.name}-1` the `RemoteApplicationEvents` wont be sent  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I could provide a `docker-compose` to streamline this process if you want, however I wont be able to do it till later today or tomorrow.  
Alright, if you place a inactivated division signal in a crafting bench normal it would give you some iron. If you add the recipe to the autocrafter to transfer it into iron, it will make the iron and retain the signal, allowing you to keep putting it in the crafter and duplicate iron. 
Its on a Nexus 5, running Cyanogenmod 11 m10, with SyncThingAndroid 0.5.4.  All settings at default. The "server" (home computer with portforwarding) is running .10.1, and syncs just fine to my laptop. Music folder is just the normal Music folder (Nexus 5 doesnt support SD card anyways), it has been empty until now.    Not sure how to do a logcat, but I get this:  8:34:52: puller: final: chtimes /storage/emulated/0/Music/Saint Andrews Strings/Simple Gifts/.syncthing04 Ashokan Farewell.wma: operation not permitted  One of these entries appears in the android Web GUI for each file to be synced.  I end up with an entire folder structure, but no files.  Steps to recreate: 1) Empty all files from Music folder 2) Create a new share on Android called Music (share already exists and is syncing on master server).  Point it at the "Music" folder (either in Web GUI or main GUI). 3) wait for resync  The only reason I mentioned permissions is because I dont see "media file access" in the permissions list when I reviewed it, and I had understood that was necessary for an app to write files to Music-- maybe thats not correct.  Let me know if I can provide more info.

The problem seems to lie in this snippet:  ````java     Subscription caretPopupSub = EventStreams.combine(caretBounds, caretPopup.outsideViewportValues())                 .subscribe(tuple3 -> {                     Optional<Bounds> opt = tuple3._1;                     boolean showPopupWhenCaretOutside = tuple3._2;                      if (opt.isPresent()) {                         Bounds b = opt.get();                         caretPopup.setX(b.getMaxX() + caretXOffset);                         caretPopup.setY(b.getMaxY() + caretYOffset);                          if (caretPopup.isHiddenTemporarily()) {                             caretPopup.show(stage);                             caretPopup.setHideTemporarily(false);                         }                      } else {                         if (!showPopupWhenCaretOutside) {                             caretPopup.hide();                             caretPopup.setHideTemporarily(true);                         }                     }                 }); ````  It seems that *before* (meaning before something broke the Demo), the `Optional` wouldn't be "present" if the `BoundsPopup` was *outside* of the `area`'s bounds. That's no longer true.  `caretBounds` comes from `org.fxmisc.richtext.TextEditingArea#getCaretBounds` and its documentation *says*  > Gets the bounds of the caret in the Screen's coordinate system or `Optional#empty()` if caret is not visible in the viewport.  But that doesn't *seem* to hold true any more. Am I missing something?   [VirtualizedScrollPane Exception]: https://gist.github.com/TurekBot/51187a9bdfde85374cf6f8b2ebccf57e

ok, i try to explain what happend 1. every request will execute method `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#loadGatewayFilters` and it will traversal a ArrayList(param: filterDefinitions); 2. u can find method `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#loadGatewayFilters` usage in `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#getFilters` , u can find the implements of List are both ArrayList; 3. some times we must refresh `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.config.GatewayProperties#defaultFilters` or `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinition#filters` or both them, if now the request thread is excuting the method `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator#loadGatewayFilters`, it will throw `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`  i'm sure is not happen all the time, but i think it can make our service return the error message, it's terrible for users, thank u!  stack trace: ``` 2019-05-23 10:28:29.630 [reactor-http-nio-1] [ERROR]

@DefinitlyEvil  I had tried MCPE 1.2.9 and 1.2.8. and both of them caused the same thing. DragonProxy compiled by me was from the lastest source code in https://github.com/DragonetMC/DragonProxy. Thank you! And sorry for my bad English again.
I think this was fixed in the dev build i have. I will check and confirm  On Wed, 13 Feb. 2019, 1:35 pm tastybento <notifications@github.com wrote:  > I can't replicate right now. Hmm.

@ejona86 your `override_targets` does appear to work on my system and the target deployment system as well. Thanks very much. 
As power source i was using two, first a solar panel tier 6 from environmental tech connected via Thermal Dynamics Cryoducts to the chunk destroyer (arround 1.7 million RF/t), which was later changed for overloaded's creative generator, which outputs 2.1 billion RF/t per side, directly placed next to the chunk destroyer.  i forgot to mention one thing, the chunk destroyer behaved normally in a 32x32 chunk square, but the one in the picture was way bigger, being (i think) 1024x1024 chunk square, 0.10.0 made that pattern, but 0.9.22 worked with those huge distances
OK. I looked a bit into it again. I'll write the workaround at the bottom, so people might notice it better. I'll possibly open a separate feature request issue on the other stuff, since it's clearly not related, so I'll just focus on the bug. But first of all I'd like to apologise for not finding the other issue before, even though I find some of the other ones.  Basically I noticed the same behaviour as someone mentioned on the other issue: when I go to turn on the "Read and write to the AnkiDroid database" permission in the settings, it would turn on, but it wouldn't stay on when checking the menu again. AnkiDroid's setting would work just fine. And as someone said, the other curious thing compared to AnkiDroid is if you try to switch it on and then off, it would say "This app was designed for an older version of Android. Denying permission may cause it to no longer function as intended. [Cancel] [Deny Anyway]", presumably referring to the pre-23 API level.  I tried all kinds of different things, and I can't even manually enable the permission through adb with package manager. However, trying to do that FINALLY gave me something useful in logcat: "PackageManager: Cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app".  So, I'm pretty convinced what's happening is that because AnkiDroid is 23+ API level, it can set the runtime permission just fine. And it's also possible the whole "Cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app" has come as a security feature in a newer/different Android version.  Why does it work sometimes at all then? I assume it's because if you install Aedict first, the whole "com.ichi2.anki.permission.READ_WRITE_DATABASE" doesn't even exist so you can't request it. And with the "legacy apps" (on newer Androids?) you can only change permissions on install time... or possibly revoke and re-grant permissions that were granted on install time, you can even see "install permissions", granted or not, separated from the others when you do "adb shell dumpsys package com.ichi2.anki | grep perm".  In the end I don't think it's an _actual_ bug in Android, since it seems like it's something that was put there on purpose... but obviously the UI should say something about it. I don't think custom permissions between pre-23 and post-23 apps is a common thing. I can't even find anything other than the actual Android sources if I Google for "Cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app".  Unfortunately I think the only proper solution would be to increase API level, but of course that's a huge hassle code-wise.  **Workaround: Make sure you install Aedict AFTER AnkiDroid. If you already have both, uninstall JUST Aedict and reinstall it.**
I am pretty sure its because of latest version of paperspigot due to it start happening right when I updated it  my old paperspigot version is https://gyazo.com/f38cda569362de515c73e13a9c4d6136
Tested on 7.99.15 and confirmed not present. As for the build, it's the one linked in discords #testing channel released yesterday, and was also present in my port which is running from the latest commits, I'm unsure when the bug showed up.
I think I figured out the issue. Last night I moved the analyzer with the book still in its slot. Breaking the analyzer with the book in place doesn't drop the book. Apparently the book contains the research (as opposed to Thaumcraft where research is stored in player data), effectively resetting the discovered seed mutations. When I did this I went into creative mode to get a new book, perhaps that is the issue.   The "missing info" I think, is then just the info being reset, it's likely I didn't get any new mutations after that happened. I thought it might be related to mod conflicts from mods I added to my installation this morning.   When I just checked on mutations I ended up breaking the analyzer again and the same thing happened. I cheated in another book. By that time I had successfully mutated sugar cane seeds and they appeared.   In short: mutations don't disappear from books, breaking the analyzer loses book and resets research. 
Basically have a config option to turn off your "socket" effects. Socket Damage: False Socket Mob Freeze: False Socket Leech: False Socket Fire: False Socket Defense: False  Like that. Also im sure my plugin stackableitems is causing alot of issues it doesnt have alot of compatibility with other plugins.  I got a player whos damn good at finding bugs in plugins its almost scary... If you have a duped item or a item from a tier that was changed (which i did 2 days ago) you can use that item as your boots and when you click and drop the item in your boots slot it will duplicate what is in your hand, i havent tried this but they were duplicating stuff like mad.  It also ended up bugging their player data or corrupting it and i had to delete their player data to actually stop them from getting internal server errors in the server and getting kicked. 
The app doesn't actually crash. it just gets closed. so it produces no error on react native debugger console. but here's the error shown on my app analytics: Bad notification posted from package com.app:  ``` Couldn''t expand RemoteViews for: StatusBarNotification(pkg=ir.sabketoplus.app user=UserHandle{0} id=100 tag=null key=0|com.app|100|null|10143: Notification(channel=react-native-music-control pri=0 contentView=null vibrate=null sound=null defaults=0x0 flags=0x62 color=0x00000000 category=transport vis=PRIVATE)) ``` And here is the stack trace: ``` android.app.ActivityThread$H@handleMessage(File:ActivityThread.java:2204) android.os.Handler@dispatchMessage(File:Handler.java:108) android.os.Looper@loop(File:Looper.java:166) android.app.ActivityThread@main(File:ActivityThread.java:7523) java.lang.reflect.Method@invoke(File:Method.java:-2) com.android.internal.os.Zygote$MethodAndArgsCaller@run(File:Zygote.java:245) com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit@main(File:ZygoteInit.java:921) ``` From what i could gather this error is related to the images displayed in the notification which are vector drawables 
The extension is ".json".
@GitMensch  > Could this be a good time to re-raise the issue about automated testing?  Yes, but I'm starting to doubt it would help in this case: I had just accidently set the export option "No conversion of the instruction/expression contents". If this option is disabled, the export looks pretty fine. The good question, however, is whether the extraction of the type definition and variable declarations should happen in the "no conversion" mode. This isn't specified exactly. And the real difficulty is to define all consequences of this mode in a consistent and sensible way for all target languages. And yes - to write the test cases forces to specify the intended functionality.
I'll give it a try. Setting up an empty server with FE as the only mod. 
I've upgraded to 1.2.672-1 and so far today I haven't noticed an issue. Scrolling with a mouse-wheel while directly over the scrollbar as described above did not cause the issue - the scrollbar remained as it should.
I have one query subscribed. It occurs on DatabaseSource and SqlitexDatabaseSource.  I thought that you could be right about thread pool but when I use Schedulers.from(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()) for all queries it doesn't work too. When I debug it I noticed that observable query is called on pool-1-thread-1 but update query is called on pool-2-thread-1.

I tried to find anything about pattern of path parameter in OpenAPI spec but find nothing :(
Yes. Also, happens for clicking completed download. If there is more than 1 completed it sometimes tries to open the other completed file, not the one clicked
> For the record we could also set the canvas color to be the system background color.  That's amazing, I did not know that! Let's do that for starters (set the canvas background to use the dynamic system background color). I think doing that will remove the mismatch between the canvas and RichText, but I think we can make this bullet-proof for the aforementioned examples by removing the background fill altogether from RichText.
Yes, it could be a development build. I unfortunately only have the jar file named v2.0.0 with no further info. But it contains the UriTemplateResolver class which could be used for reverse matching templates. There seems to have been a cleanup in the newer versions but I can't seem to find how to do the reverse matching in the new version.
sorry for late reply, I agree on ManagedExecutorService  in JavaEE, but that would make the application container dependent, for instance, the web app should be deployable on Jetty and tomcat also, ManagedExecutorService requires a container like JBoss or Weblogic etc.  About the custom record reader, I implemented the open() method in such a way that it handled all the jobs, eventually creating a single record,which is actually an array of records. 
Yes I do, If that causes the bug then I will gladly delete Optifine  On Fri, Oct 4, 2019 at 2:27 PM SilentChaos512 <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Unrelated, but I'm curious about the enchantment tokens missing their > first layer.

It is surely caused by Tough As Nails, it surely linked to this issue. https://github.com/Glitchfiend/ToughAsNails/issues/274 Anyway now I get this crash. https://pastebin.com/3x1aXQ9V
@vanitasvitae do you mean https://joindiaspora.com/status_messages/new ? In Firefox for Android, I can see the camera icon instead of the question mark, and I can click it too to attach a picture. In the stock Android browser on my phone (which I assume is the one DfA is using), the camera icon is replaced by a question mark, and same goes with the notification bell; however, I can press where the camera should be and attach a picture normally (see picture).  In DfA, I can not click the button at all (nothing pops up to choose an app to upload an attachment from).  ![screenshot_2016-08-29-22-56-52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1747497/18052253/96f6e036-6e3c-11e6-965f-a9f08be717d3.png) 
#3029 is now in master.
It does not seem to update for me at all until the map is triggered an update through clicking / painting it.
It works now :) :+1:  
@djbrooke @kcondon : There were two bugs in this ticket.  To avoid confusion,  I separated the 2nd one (API downloads not being counted at all) into this ticket: #3331 
Hi, I'm very sorry, I'm new to SpringBoot and was going around in circles for a little while trying to work out where the dependency problem was. I downgraded jadira to version 5.0.0 and it works. Thanks.
For now I think we should try to just make the numbers the same size across Android versions if possible.   I do agree that the date and date-time widgets need rethinking. If you could file a separate issue with your thoughts on what that would look like, that would be very helpful. Before doing that, I recommend you check out the related issues filed by @dalerhoda.
It works with 3.1.0.xx-201809160114-e48, thank you! 👍

Sure, sorry for the delay.

Here they are. Note that in contrast to the exe, opening the jar file works when the folder has a semicolon. However it still crashes when there is an exclamation mark.

Using fritzbox first would be Bad on Mobile. Deactivating use own does work, thanks!  Should I close the issue or leave it Open do Start a Discussion about pros and cons of the default setting? 
Right! Sorry I forgot to post the versions xD `Nucleus version 0.10.1-5.0 (built from commit 627f6b8)` `SpongeForge` `Minecraft: 1.10.2` `SpongeAPI: 5.0.0-SNAPSHOT-b88f5eb` `SpongeForge: 1.10.2-2092-5.0.0-BETA-1746` `Minecraft Forge: 12.18.1.2094`  No errors in console and the starterkit got reset too I think, I will add some other kits to test with those as well though. 
@Montellese That's correct: if connected through TCP the remote only updates the info on a user action/notification/exit. Through HTTP it keeps polling kodi about what's playing (every 3s iirc), so this issue doesn't persist for long.  @FernetMenta I've tested it with the current master and it also happens.  I don't think this is something serious, but it is a curious one. Small differences in timing have different results. 
I have no clue when this started and after installing older versions and trying to find the one that caused it it started to work again. Strange
**Maven:** 3.6.0 **Java:** jdk-11.0.2
No, please not! Keywords should describe the content of the document and not some state in JabRef. They are understood (although often not printed) by biblatex, so I would even vote against making keyword synchronization the default option. Special fields can be easily filtered out by biblatex, but modifying the keyword field to not contain "prio3" etc. is very difficult. What was the reason to introduce the sync with the keyword field? 
Both 1.11.2 and 1.12.1 have the issue.
I had this save method (I have that code in a _companion object_ to make it static):  `fun saveData(data: Data) = myBoxStore.put(data)`  I used that in my `onCreate`:  ``` Repository.saveData(Data("name1")) Repository.saveData(Data("name2")) ```  Then I removed that code.   Now, whenever I uninstall and install the app, I always have those 2 entities in my adapter. Very strange indeed, and I can't get rid of them. 
Looks like a regression not covered yet by tests, will take care about the regression in a separate ticket.
Well, I sat down to test it, crashed the first time I right clicked [a bag](http://i.imgur.com/VrSv3i3.png), and crashed. I've crashed right clicking my [other bag](http://i.imgur.com/ssnE8qP.png) and the [one I wear](http://i.imgur.com/jStTUEy.png) before, BUT.. After I logged back in, I didn't crash when right clicking any of them, and I didn't change the contents at all.  So.. Yeah. I'll try to narrow it down some more I guess.

The effort to modernize the logging layer is being scaled back (result of some discussions), as it will cause other issues in the compat layer.   I'm considering this closed. 
The bug was from an older version of Pet Buddy. I have got a new version set and now it's working fine. If you still want the crash report you can ask me.
Like i forget to add a attachment so i can make the thread, then when i add the attachment, it says "expired captcha" or something like that.
Thanks Felix. I am using postgres 12 with postgis 3. Actually I was following the "hands-on tutorial v 4.0 (2018) but I will review all these first steps following the official docs you show me. I remember to got an error when running CREATE_DB.bat, but since the schema was created I thought it was ok, and indeed, I have just citydb. Many of my problems will be noob mistakes and not exactly issues on the software. Which place you recommend me to ask/discuss about installing and running 3D CityDB?
Thanks for quick response. I will try with 4.2.1-SNAPSHOT. I will update how it goes with it. 
It incorrectly detects the part of the road (and connected roads) as oneway-subnetwork and removes it from the graph. But what exactly goes wrong I do not know yet ... still debugging ... 
Of course,  http://sonic.medyainternet.com:9632/;stream.nsv http://radyodejavu.canliyayinda.com:8054/;stream.nsv  These are standart shoutcast v1.9.x  Same application works on shoutcast 2.4 servers. Example; http://stream.radyovaveyla.com/;stream.nsv http://radyobozcaada.canliyayinda.com:4000/;1  Update: Also problem in 2.0 http://www.mediasrv.akdeniz.edu.tr:8000/;1  Update: icy://www.mediasrv.akdeniz.edu.tr:8000/;1 works fine.   Also; I'm using ExtractorRendererBuilder. Only this works fine for shoutcast.  Thanks a lot. 
I dont have the shell restricted though, thats the thing. I started by restricting everything with the all button, then tested. then i removed the shell restriction because Network info II showed nothing at all with it restricted.  So i FC'd network info II, cleared its data, modified the blocked settings xprivacy so shell and internet are not blocked. (nothing red/dangerous blocked) rebooted and that log was from a fresh reboot and loading network info 2. there is something wrong with xprivacy letting go its clocked perms if   you're saying the log reports that the shell is blocked.   This is the second app in 2 days i have been able to have xprivacy some how hang on to blocking permissions that i chose to unlock. The other was "All in one toolbox" and the only thing i can find in the log is warnings. So i'm kinda stumped.   here is a paste of the log grepping xprivacy,   this is what the log shows while the location is still malfunctioning and now showing anything in network info II it is not shwoing my spoofed location at all  http://pastebin.com/1FiKMnpL  here is a screen shot clearly showing my setting in xprivacy. i have force closed network info II, cleaned all its data and rebooted and this malfunction still happens almost all the time.   ![screenshot_2013-07-16-12-28-41](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1682110/806185/6b7386ba-ee35-11e2-9b8b-a0556b82b20e.png) 
No, I no longer have the execution. The error happened when the SPARQL CONSTRUCT to file list was executing. However, I assume the higher-level exception handling is the same for all components.
Correct, the rest of the settings in the index template are applied successfully, and most days the field limit is as well.  I did output all the index templates and go through them, this is the only one that applies to logstash-*
I agree that address validation isn't necessarily useful, but if you view the source code for `AbstractSubjectConfirmationValidator` (super class of `BearerSubjectConfirmationValidator`) you'll see that it is responsible for validating addresses.  Its implementation uses `InetAddress.getAllByName(...)` which seems to imply that it would support name resolution lookups to compare to the SP's whitelist.  The `AbstractSubjectConfirmationValidator.validateAddress` method will return `ValidationResult.INDETERMINATE` if the whitelist isn't populated by the SP and the IdP included an address in the message, but unfortunately the validator is specifically requiring that the `validateAddress` method returns a `VALID` ```java result = validateAddress(confirmation, assertion, context); if (result != ValidationResult.VALID) {     return result; } ``` From there, [OpenSamlAuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/saml2/saml2-service-provider/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/saml2/provider/service/authentication/OpenSamlAuthenticationProvider.java#L335-L340) will throw a `Saml2ErrorCodes.INVALID_ASSERTION` as the validator returned `ValidationResult.INDETERMINATE` instead of `ValidationResult.VALID`.  In summary, I think the provider should support validation of the address (which may be a hostname or IP) as well as the ability to disable (or ignore) specific `ValidationResult.INDETERMINATE` results.  #7517 Provides a solution to validate the address
Hm, weird, I just tried again and the issue is still the same, and the version (Settings --> About) is definitely 1.0.8. 
Yes, I upgraded XPrivacy, did normally reboot and then simply opened XPrivacy after the "Migration completed" Message. But just 1 - 4 app icons were loaded and all restrictions are gone. 
@mattjacunski Firstly, thanks a lot for you library!  Yes, I downloaded 3.1.5 version and tried it. On my Nexus 5 I couldn't reproduce this issue on your SampleApp, but I reproduced in my application. On Nexus 4 Android 4.4.2 I reproduced on your SampleApp and in my application. I made only one change - add  : scanIntent.putExtra(CardIOActivity.EXTRA_LANGUAGE_OR_LOCALE, "ru"); And then put date in expiration field. When I tried to replace date I could delete only 3 symbols except first. 
Yes the typechecker throws an error. 
@samtstern I call it first thing in onCreate, in my application class.  Also, before I try to use any firebaseAnalytics call, I check that the FirebaseApp (the "[DEFAULT]" one) exists. But even if I tried to initialize it in some other place (for example when I get a response from my server), even by losing some events, should it be a problem?

Thanks for quick reply ... we will try this new version and hopefully we will see what is causing the issue now. And to answer your question - we didn't change the handler at all. 
Using `/npc create test` creates an npc that is not pushable. Not sure how I could push him into the nether portal. I am not familiar with Citizens's in-game commands. I've only ever used it through my own plugins.  [EDIT] I used `/npc moveto` to move it into the nether portal. After a few seconds it disappeared, but when I teleported after it, it was not visible.
I have write fanart and poster, overwrite fanart and poster, write actor images, and write extra fan art when writing data....., and rename movie file. I already have most of my stuff scraped from data18 with the xbmc data 18 scraper. Your scraper brings in a much better poster image. higher resolution. And I use it to rename the folder to movie name with year. So if I scrape a movie with the standalone scraper it pulls in the better image but when I click write it doesn't overwrite the old image. It does everything else. Like change the folder name and overwrites the .nfo and the actor images. Other than it being the old crapy poster when I go back to the movie, I notice that the file size is still very small and the modified date is from the previous xbmc scraping. 
So it's not possible to do it ingame only by using in console.
I'm using version 2.7.5 of mockito !

@TheSnoozer   Thank you so much for your quick & detailed reply!!  Well now I'm baffled too. Because now it seems to be working!  I'm not sure what I did other than I made a few more commits of other stuff I'm working on.  After I got your comment, I tried again and voila!   I have one more question, if I could beg your patience ...  Where does the `git.build.*` information come from? Are you pulling it from Maven? Although I can see the convenience of including that info in the properties `build` information, building the project has nothing to do with `git`, per se.  I would think it might make more sense to label them `maven.build.*`.    Perhaps I am way off track here :)  BTW, This is one of the best documented maven plugins I have seen!  Great job!     
Yes, I did.  I did additional tests with versions ehcache-3.0.0-20160203.125949-245.jar and 3.0.0.m4.jar, and both didn't work. 
I use ubuntu 16.04 and 14 both x64, as to the CHE_variables i use:  ## OS:   Ubuntu  ## OS versions:    16.04 and 14, both x64.  ## Che environment variables:  CHE_CONF_FOLDER=/home/user/che/conf or i try to mount my own configuration file but to no effect; I set CHE_HOST_IP=${IP}, i set my host machine IP, the same one i use when i run che locally as a server.  Heres an image, i connected through bash to the che-server container. ![screenshot from 2016-08-15 14 23 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6517180/17672707/1216823e-62f4-11e6-8dde-6af5632de791.png) 
There's no stack trace, there's no error. Its just that ```java INDArray rnd = Nd4j.rand(2, 2); System.out.println(rnd.equals(rnd.neq(1))); ``` outputs `true`  `neq()` doesn't change anything to the matrix it's applied to
Good call, I just noticed it's universal. You can close this I suppose, must be something with OmniROM 
I am using Chrome aswell so that can't be the problem. Where does the plugin store its configuration in the database? So i can update the configuration through there for now 
My cut at it would be  getTokenTerrainModifier(id) setTokenTerrainModifier(modifier,id) With id being optional if there is a selected token.  I could see losing the Token part of the name unless we will have a similar function for drawings.
I booted in by deleting maxlock apk. Reinstalled it, uninstalled(clearing data) and deleted the dalvik cache. Installed it again, strangely works but it keeps getting optimized at every boot.  Additionally, could I request you to add an option to lock apps upon screenlock? And also, may I know whats "pausing" as stated in 5.2 update. 
Here is the list of plugins we use:  - The Tag Maker - Bitbucket Server Webhook to Jenkins - Pull Request Leaderboard - pull-request-notifier-for-bitbucket - Bitbucket Look and Feel Plugin - Bitbucket Server - Auto Unapprove Pull Requests - branchDetails - Commit Graph - Jira Hooks for Stash - Slack notifications for pull request and push activities - Smart Commits for Bitbucket  I see the error only on a specific repository though.
Oh sry! Thanks for editing.  Tried it, doesn't work, same error. I also changed the version of the maven-compiler-plugin, but still same mistake.  The Error says that it needs version 53.0 of some class file of java. In the WWW i found, that this version is used in Java 9. Unfortunately I can't find any download for Ubuntu 17.04. On my Mac i do have Java 9 and Maven version 3.6.1, but Maven does not accept it as a valid JAVA_HOME ... . Do you think, that an older version of Maven could work for me aswell?  I don't know if that helps to find the problem, but "mvn dependency:resolve", gives me a "Build Success". 
It was set to false , ill try the new build now 
When I remove the `setString` for the jdbc case I have an Exception: ``` org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: No value specified for parameter 1. ```
I can confirm, that this error doesn't pop up on my quickly reactivated openhabian running RC1. Following up openhab/openhab-core#903, the error on the Docker instance might be related to directories outside of /openhabian and req only a slight modification of the dockerfile. 
Verified that the problem is now solved.  >You'll have to put a six-character long string into variable "Str" first, otherwise strlen will return 0, and it would still return false.  Yes indeed.
yes sorry xD 
That's a good question. Fixed.
So that behavior would be leaving the file from time T2?  I don't think that is a possibility, because that file doesn't pass the filter(s) saying to only give us files that parsed.  I always viewed the behavior as 'give me all the code at time X, and then filter out anything not matching one of the filters.'
Hey there,  for me it is just exactly the same as for merman54. It doesn't matter if using the instant upload or when trying it through the share function within the android gallery.Sometimes it just gives the error at once, but mostly it seems to upload some percents and then stopping with the error:  "Hochladen von IMG_20131119_105133.jpg konnte nicht abgeschlossen werden"  (btw. the caldav- and carddav sync also doesn't work anymore since upgrade of PHP to 5.7.0-dev. There is a more detailed error message:  "Sabre_DAV_Exception_BadRequest Empty XML document sent\n1.7.6") 
@valgog no, not here. 
Please find below code   for "debugger" keyword i am  getting error.     link: function(scope, element, attrs) {           var error, expandingProperty, expand_all_parents, expand_level, for_all_ancestors, for_each_branch, get_parent, n, on_treeData_change, select_branch, selected_branch, tree;           error = function(s) {             console.log('ERROR:' + s);             debugger;             return void 0;           }; 
You are correct. Apologies for the false alarm.
I have managed to reproduce this on different Android versions (4.2, 4.4, 5.1). 
When you click "Execute", this happens.
after using math python action instead of print action the execution time is about 7 minutes 
Hi Saudet,  Sorry for my incomprehensible question. The problem is when I used typedef like this:  ``` typedef std::vector<double*>        Vector_p_Double; struct structTimeSeriesResults {        Vector_p_Double         vpd_result; ... } ```  There is an error when I compile: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10292378/9294710/9ca96858-4455-11e5-9755-ac47ac7983e6.png) which tells that javacpp `cannot convert from Vector_p_Double to std::vector<double *,std::allocator<_Ty>> *`. It seems that javacpp does not understand the new type Vector_p_Double defined by the typedef command.  Without using `typedef std::vector<double*>        Vector_p_Double;`, or more exactly using directly `std::vector<double*>` it works fine like in https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/issues/22  So the question is how could I use `typedef std::vector<double*>        Vector_p_Double;`? Hope that you understand my question now.  Thank you for your help. Thanh Liem. 
I'm using the [apt plugin](https://github.com/tbroyer/gradle-apt-plugin) to do annotation processing in Gradle, and it automatically sets it up in the imported Eclipse project. I use Buildship to import the Gradle project as an Eclipse project.  So the short answer is, yes, I'm doing annotation processing in Eclipse.  Here are the relevant gradle config files.  #### Root `build.gradle`:  ``` gradle plugins {     id 'eclipse' }  allprojects {     group = 'com.automate.bill'     version = '0.1' }  subprojects {     repositories {         jcenter()     } } ```  #### `encoding` subproject's `build.gradle`:  ``` gradle plugins {     id 'eclipse'     id 'java'     id 'net.ltgt.apt' version '0.8' }  sourceCompatibility = '1.8' targetCompatibility = '1.8'  dependencies {     apt 'org.immutables:value:2.3.7'     compileOnly 'org.immutables:builder:2.3.7'     compileOnly 'org.immutables:encode:2.3.7'     compileOnly 'org.immutables:value:2.3.7'      compile 'com.google.guava:guava:19.0'      // Other dependencies... } ``` 
@KrzysztofJozefowicz Thanks for the quick reply. I'm using the zoom option because i sometimes give demo's. The zoom option is a very powerfull help. It would very helpfull if at least in source this is working.
Here are latest test results. This time it looks like stably reproducible.  This time, I downloaded the app from Play Store on a physical device with Android 6.0.1. Followed this procedure: 1. Initial settings of the app -> 2. Tap "Take photo" button -> 3. Enter title and description -> 4. Tap "Share" button. Saw a crash. File was not uploaded.  After the crash, I manually gave the app the "storage" permission. The next attempt (2., 3., 4.) went fine.  And then, I manually revoked the app's permission, and the crash would happen again under the same procedure (2., 3., 4).   By the way, I am seeing the same crash pattern on emulator (with the build of the current master branch) as well after I turned off the storage permission. 
Ive migrated about 6 servers from pex to luckperms already. They all have the same issue, but its not always the same users that dont get migrated correctly. On a few servers I can run "lp user VoidAngel info" with no problem, but for a user that is online even at that moment I can type "/lp user exampleuser info" and it will tell me that the user cannot be found.  Given the fact that I have already done this many times I dont think the outcome will change xD But if you have something else in mind that I am not thinking of, I will try exporting and migrating again.

They come up with special `Float` and `Double` value:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/216930/19629370/b3e0ef58-99bf-11e6-90c5-4a94f0716587.png) 
Aaaand there was the problem. I inadvertently downloaded MyWarp v2.6.5 by simply using the "Download" button. Everything works accordingly using the command /mywarp followed by set, remove, etc.  Thanks for the help! 
Fixed in #165.  I don't think it matters too much if it doesn't display in the buyback menu - I'm going to be improving that part of the UI at some point. ^^  I will add a small price decrease for cum-stained clothing, good idea!
commentpara.de does not support notes at all, since it's made for reply-type posts only.  Maybe I should support multipart/form-data:  > All Micropub requests to create posts are sent as UTF-8 x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data [HTML5], or [JSON]-encoded HTTP requests.  Yes, I should. https://github.com/cweiske/anoweco/issues/6
That has done the trick. No more console spamming 
Right the issue has been solved. Unfortunately another issue occurs when configuring the RS485 service on a RG10-20:  java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "Half Duplex"     at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(Unknown Source)     at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)     at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)     at org.eclipse.kura.web.server.GwtComponentServiceImpl.getObjectValue(GwtComponentServiceImpl.java:354)     at org.eclipse.kura.web.server.GwtComponentServiceImpl.updateComponentConfiguration(GwtComponentServiceImpl.java:305)

@grzesiek2010 Now that you have Firebase Crash access, you can take a moment to look through the different crashes and see if you get any ideas. If I recall correctly, the index value isn't always the same.

I'm using MariaDB. I think it could be necessary for reproduction to create an unique or primary key with a name that already exists. After you click on it to rename it, you get this ConcurrentModificationException.  According to error view: 'An exception stack trace is not available.'

its the only poison sac i have in the collection of mods i play with, the ones from the libelle dragonflies id number 4427 
The program is inside it but we if we don't use "StepInto" the actual nodes are not visible. Instead the subgraph node is shown as active node for the whole execution time of the subgraph.  ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36304889/50979677-4c3c2b00-14f7-11e9-8680-4316786f4931.png) ![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36304889/50979730-6544dc00-14f7-11e9-90db-4b846766a56f.png)

I suggest we relocate the logic of "complementing" the mapped software units to validate. This allows both validate and graphics you function normally without being to spent time on creating new code, since it is already built, we just need to relocate it. 
For example; I call a friend to see a car on the map and when I pull away it can have access to my username and password. 
Yes, that's when I see it.
