some inconsistencies when using custom 'home' directories   if you use   etc login defs  to set a custom home basedir  instead of   home    the system breaks when it tries to sync   i have a custom home basedir set of   something blah  and when the  useradd  call gets invoked  the home directory is correctly created as   something blah   username    but then a later  chown  gets invoked  and that seems to be hard coded to   home   username     in my case  i actually  wanted  the users to live in   home   so i made a modification to the sync script to do that  i don't know if that's a configurable option you want to enable or not  seems a little rarely used  to me  not a lot of people are gonna want that  i don't think   but  regardless of that   the bit where it does the  chown  probably ought to read the users "real" home directory  rather than assuming it can do the hardcoding   maybe you'd want to use  getent   username   and parse out the     marks to get their 'real' home  specifically  i'm seeing this work for me

hdfsstorage potential corruption due to zombie processes     problem description   suppose we have two instances of the  hdfsstorage  for the same container  one with epoch a and one with epoch b   a+1  each running on different hosts  call them ha and hb  ha and hb should never run concurrently if we do a graceful container failover  however it is possible that they are both running at the same time  and writing to the same segments  if ha's host loses connection to zk bk and still thinks it's the leader for the container  in that case  both ha and hb will be competing to modify the same segment  thus leading to issues    most of these issues are resolved using the fencing mechanism built into  hdfsstorage   however  there is a case that is not handled  1  ha has an ongoing write to segment x  2  while the write is happening  hb open writes segment x  which causes the last file of x to be marked as read only  and after that  its length is retrieved  3  ha completes the write to segment x  altering it  and increasing its length  after it was marked as read only  4  hb now has the wrong information about the state of segment x  because one of the files has been modified behind the scenes without it knowing about   this can lead to a number of issues  see   example problematic stack traces   below for observed issues     problem location   hdfsstorage java    suggestions for an improvement   this is due to the fact that setting permissions in hdfs is not atomic  or even serializable with other writes  they can happen concurrently and any permission change will not affect ongoing writes   we need to make  filesystemoperation makereadonly  provide a guarantee that  after its successful completion  the target file will never change  this means it should be able to wait for ongoing writes  if possible  note that due to the fact that there is no known server side feature to support this  any solution may not work well in a general case  but it should solve the use case that the segment store is concerned about  on each container there is a single storagewriter accessing a segment  and we can only solve this for two segmentcontainer zombie instances competing for the same segment   1  we introduce a new xattr named "writinginprogress" 2  during a write  we set this xattr  to  true   on the target file right before we are about to open the write stream  and clear it when we're done  whether successfully or not   3   makereadonly  will check for this xattr's existence after it marks the file as read only  if it's set  it will need to wait until it's cleared  or a timeout expires    this should make makereadonly  provide enough guarantees that the file will not change after it returns successfully and the rest of the hdfs fencing code in the segmentstore should work as expected     example problematic stack traces

using bodymatchers with sub arrays results an isempty being generated   bug report   this may be related to #391     issue   if you have a sub array with multiple elements and you want to use bodymatchers  the code tries to remove any duplicate matchers from the response body first and replace it with the bodymatcher check into the output test file     when you add the final element body matcher in the contract  the code then tries to remove the final response body check  leaving it empty essentially  a subsequent process that examines the remaining response body checks then sees this array as empty and thinks that it needs to add an isempty check as a result   ultimately  my goal is to be able to validate each occurrence of sub array elements in the json file   perhaps there is a better way   example   contract    then the code now thinks that the array should be an isempty check   assertthatjson parsedjson  array " 'toydetails' "  field " 'dimensions' "  isempty      thoughts

npe from wicket atmospere support when shutting down tomcat   bonjour   we get this when shutting down tomcat     i am filing this against atmosphere and not the wicket support because it doesn't seem to me that the wicket support is at fault   the npe occurs because the wicket application has already been destroyed  it it destroyed by the wicket filter's destroy   method  which is invoked by reflectorservletprocessor destroy    atmosphereframework destroy   first destroys the handler  and then it destroys the broadcast factory  which resumes the resources   is this correct   if i'm wrong  could you please suggest what the wicket support could do better  merci

memory usage for http server gauges   hey   thanks for bridging micrometer with vertx  we are currently seeing some sort of slow memory increase for gauges  especially for the ones from the http server   it seems that this topic had been addressed in https   github com vert x3 vertx micrometer metrics issues 27  was there a specific reason why the gauges still keep a reference in contrast to the other metrics that have been changed with https   github com vert x3 vertx micrometer metrics pull 28  https   github com vert x3 vertx micrometer metrics blob master src main java io vertx micrometer impl meters gauges java#l40  micrometer seems to use all labels  regardless of additional meter filter  as part of the id   https   github com micrometer metrics micrometer blob master micrometer core src main java io micrometer core instrument gauge java#l190  we have a filter to remove  local  and  remote   but it doesn't seem to be applied to that point in time  which could explain why we see around 250k gauges in a heap dump for just a couple of hours  but not in the metrics sheet from prometheus for instance   application is running on vertx  3 8 1

plugin folder does not exist   hello  i tried installing your latest dev build but i got the following errors   http   pastebin com wbxg0bxg  hope you'll be able to assist me by either telling me what i am doing wrong or fix the issue     thanks for updating 
wrong completion for constructor code on a generic class   this was the old greclipse 1761   consider the following java class     invoke code assist at " " and choose the first suggestion  the expected behaviour is to get either  new javaclass integer     or  new javaclass       what i get instead is   new javaclass number

sending too many metric updates on sealed segments     problem description   we have a pravega system running a scaling test for a couple of days   it looks like the number of metrics being reported are increasing over time   we are currently seeing around 65 000 metric points written every second   this is slowing down our influx database    what i think is happening is that we are still getting updates on metrics on segments that have been sealed or no reading is being done on the segment   as scaling continues to go up and down  we get an increase of metrics being reported every 10 seconds     problem location   metrics     suggestions for an improvement   only send metrics updates on segments if the count has changed   maybe delete the write_bytes metrics once a segment has been sealed

problem to cancel a periodic job   android job version    1 2 4    we have an use case when basically we need to start a job immediately    startnow       based on a button click   if an error occur  e g  failed to sync   another job must be schedule to run every 30min    setperiodic       when our data is successfully sync  this job can be canceled   what have we tried to do   1   we create a simple job using  startnow    2   if an error occur in this job  we schedule a new periodic job  with the same  tag    the periodic job is only scheduled if the job that receives the error when syncing data is the one created using   startnow     that is the reason we use this   if   params isperiodic      3   if an error occur when a periodic job is running  we just ignore and return  result failure   because that job is already automatically rescheduled by the library 4   if the periodic job finishes correctly  we cancel all jobs with the same tag   cancelalljobsfortag     and then we return  result success   here is the code     our problem is that when we cancel a periodic job  e g  when successfully sync data   it strangely does not get cancelled and is rescheduled indefinitely  runs every 30min     what are we doing wrong  there is any other way to accomplish this use case   thanks

gradle plugin does not support parallel builds   the link error below occurs due to race conditions in parallel builds  it may be exacerbated by adding all compile dependencies  as gradle does not support provided scope in its dsl  the internal distribution jars may be being brought in  the mutation of the classloader may be also being leaked across tasks  resulting in more bizarre behavior   the plugin is now harder to debug by not logging the configuration to help understand what flyway thinks the settings are  by using  string    arrays instead of  list string   it does not opt into groovy's collection features  this makes it harder to manipulate the configuration  like append locations from different build scripts   the plugin is not friendly to builds where the tasks must be run after compilation  this is resolved with the _bad_ practice of using  flywaymigrate dependson remove testclasses   to break the circular tasks  my concern is that internally it may evolve to make assumptions that others will have to break  which will cause it to not function properly   unfortunately the link error means that i am unable to transition from my plugin to the official one

codec selection for video tunneling    ### issue description in our particular device which has media tunneling support  exoplayer is unable to list and select the tunneling decoder properly  for example  the device advertises these two components supporting avc  one without and one with tunneling support   omx oem avc decoder and omx oem avc decoder tunneled  exoplayer isn't able to select the tunneled version of the decoder but can only detect the non tunneled version   we believe there are two issues with the current selection logic in exoplayer   1  exoplayer lists by default the codecs using the 'regular_codecs' filter and tunneled decoders have to be queried with 'all_codecs' filter  see this in "frameworks base media java android media mediacodeclist java"             use in   link #mediacodeclist  to enumerate all codecs  even ones that are        not suitable for regular  buffer to buffer  decoding or encoding   these        include codecs  for example  that only work with special input or output        surfaces  such as secure only or tunneled only codecs               public static final int all_codecs   1   2  when more than one decoder supporting the given mime type is returned in the media codec list  exoplayer needs to iterate through the list and pick the one with the tunneling feature enabled  in our devices  the non tunneled version decoder will be listed first so additional logic needs to be added to pick the tunneled version   i guess another problem with the existing implementation is that there doesn't seem to be a way to tell exoplayer that the app prefers a tunneling decoder if the platform supports it  having this ability would make it easier for exoplayer to adjust the codec selection logic as suggested above   ### reproduction steps play any stream with demo app on exoplayer v2 9 x   ### link to test content any content  including the sample streams in the demo app  ## version of exoplayer being used exoplayer v2 9 x  ### device s  and version s  of android being used android p on broadcom reference designs  ### a full bug report captured from the device n a

browse issue with xbox 360 in 6 7 x   a new problem with version 6 7 x and xbox 360  has been reported  http   www universalmediaserver com forum viewtopic php f 9 t 10024   i'm a bit clueless as to what is the exact cause  but knowing how terrible xbox' dlna support and given the changes in #1061 i'm assuming there are som "conflicts" relating to that  and the changed  output    what i don't understand is why we haven't gotten more than one report  the problem is that this particular user isn't too keen on doing too many tests  and since i have to just try to change things pretty randomly to see what makes the difference i'm kinda hoping for another report   do we really have that few active 360 users  or is the percentage that files a report that extremely small  in any case  i really need some testing against a 360  do we know of anybody else that has one

first report   it's the first time that i open an issue report  a pop up window in bisq suggested me to create this  so here i am  hope it can be useful     java lang nullpointerexception

bot uses surgical extraction wrong   hello   the bot "mad" uses the surgical extraction and most of the mil cards wrong  the bot used the extraction on his own graveyard  that's not the smartest way to cast it     and he did some self milling with some cards  witch i don't remember   you can get some of the server logs here  http   paste2 org 7zwek4cy it's round about 10    it is a really huge log  i hope  that is enough  the original log is   25 mb    the bot used this deck     i hope  you can resolve that issue   do you need any further information   kind regards  matthias

extendedquerypostgresqlstatement emits result before processing execution errors   note  the following issue was observed with  spring boot 2 2 0 m5    spring 5 2 0 rc2  and  r2dbc   0 8 0 build snapshot     if an exception is caught inside  transactionaloperator  transactional   in the example below it is a duplicate key error   the exception ist not always handled correctly forwarded down the flux  if the statement that failed is a  simplequery  without bindings  the error is handled correctly  but if it is an  extendedquery   the rollback query seems to be mixed with the failed query  at least this is what i could debug with my limited knowledge  and none of the queries ever succeeds  instead  reactor core publisher operators  write a log message  operator called default onerrordropped  and the process is stuck    when switching to  r2dbc   0 8 0 m8  the code below will work  but due to bug #139  which is not fixed in m8  the transaction will not be rolled back anyway  so this is not an indication that m8 works correctly    here is some code to reproduce the issue     if this issue is regarded as being related more to spring boot r2dbc  please move it there

large number of boolean operators in query causes ksql to hang   i recently updated from a manually built 5 0 0 beta2 docker image to 5 0 0  upon doing so  when starting in headless mode with a queries file  ksql only loads about 70 queries  then stops  i'm using a large number of queries  and most are  insert into    i'm referring to the printing of these messages on load    rolling back to beta30  cp ksql server image  seems to work again loading all queries  any idea if some limit on queries was added  i tried using the official ksql cli  yes  running in headless mode  and cp ksql server with the same result   sidenote   i tried to build a 5 0 0 docker image locally  but even at a build success  i can't see any built image

mmcif simplemmcifconsumer incorrectly replaces residue numberings    the simplemmcifconsumer class currently replaces residue numbers for group instances when it parses the _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme    1  in multi model structures  this replacement only searches through the previous 1  n 1 models  as the last current_model does not get added until documentend   is reached   this will cause the models to have out of sync numberings  2  with the example of the model pdb 2ksa  performing this renumbering based on the pdbx_poly_seq_scheme actually incorrectly renumbers residues   instead  it seems sufficient to rely on the original _atom_record numbers that would then agree with the pdb entry for 2ksa   all the current unit tests for pdb mmcif consistency pass with the renumbering by _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme disabled   at least fix for  1  would correct the issue  but i am wondering if it would be best to avoid this issue completely by preventing renumbering as suggested by  2    i can submit a pull request with related changes but would like a comment if disabling the renumbering should be part of this fix

vertex version incorrectly increased on the destination node in the distributed mode   when running in the asynchronous distributed 2 node mode  if the create vertex and add edge operations are performed withing the same transaction  the vertex version on the destination node get incorrectly set to 2  while on the source node it's 1   which is correct  this causes replication inconsistency   here is a unit test that demonstrates the issue  https   github com orientechnologies orientdb pull 4738

running em with "only positive nes scores" doesn't generate an accurate picture    veroniquevoisin please add your opinion as not sure how others would want to see the results but to me it doesn't look right    i have run gsea on 4 different rankings  mesen vs rest immuno vs rest diff vs rest prolif vs rest  i am only interested in genesets that are specific to each subtype and when i run em using the 4 gsea results it filters the network to only include genets that are significant with positive nes values in the map but for each geneset the chart includes the nes value for each dataset regardless of whether it is significant or not and regardless of whether the nes value was positive or negative     with the nes positive only  or the inverse  i think that the negative nes values should be excluded from the network as given the analysis they don't actually represent anything    an example of what the network currently looks liks   img width "693" alt "screen shot 2017 06 16 at 12 14 18 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 3842763 27235122 9473ac1e 528d 11e7 8040 39ea772e14e0 png"   i think all the blue areas in the above image should be gray

git_repository rule should error if a commit attribute is fed a non sha   i don't think it should be legal to be able to do this   https   github com bazelbuild rules_scala pull 100 files    and for bazel to allow it without either   throwing an error about the value of  commit  not being a valid sha   warning the user that the value of  commit  was resolved to a particular commit from that tag  in this case  0 3 1   within the remote   but the user should consider using the  tag  attribute instead     i don't really like this  since if values can be arbitrary input  they could be branches  in which case those are mutable  and guarantees of the revision from the repository evaporate

 mockbean leads to mockito validation exceptions presumably masking problems with  async annotated services   hello everyone   i have been experimenting with the mockito integration in the new 1 4 0 release version of spring boot and encountered some difficulties while writing some tests   i wrote a controller  which injects a service bean and calls an async method  async configuration is written to return a threadpooltaskexecutor   when using the   mockbean  annotation on the service in my test class all usages of parameter matchers fail  either while configuring in before method using given willreturn or while verifying method calls    i wrote a basic project illustrating this behavior   it can be found at https   github com walternative mocking bug   the tag "problem" contains the failing test while the tag "workaround" contains the profile configuration deactivating the async configuration for the test  the test passes without exception    while researching the errors i stumbled upon issue #6405   could be linked to that to some extend  i tried playing around with the proxytargetclass parameter but i had no luck there   while debugging the test cases i got the expected behavior while inspecting the mocked service with the intellij idea debugging tools   might have resolved some proxies manually which maybe cannot be resolved reflectively by mockito  but that's just guesswork   haven't had the opportunity to reproduce that yet    thanks  gregor

strictmode  how to avoid "resource was acquired     but never released"   maybe i've got too paranoid settings for android strictmode  it's not completely deterministic  most likely because the fragment containing the map is in a viewpager which implements some kind of fragment caching  in most cases i can see following stacktrace     is this caused by wrong usage of mapsforge  or is it a shortcoming of mapsforge which could be avoided  should particular strictmode settings be turned off   i'm using v0 6 0  please tell me  if you need further information

setting for left or right side of the road   i have had this idea for a little while and think it would be a good thing to implement  i think the config needs a new variable for the side of the road the cars are intended to drive on  most mts models at the current moment are designed for right side of the road but that really limits creative freedom with road layouts  so how this would work is that each vehicle's json has a value for the side of the road it was designed for  then inside the mod config you could specify what side of the road cars drive on and the vehicles that their jsons don't align with that would have their models flipped across the length of the vehicle to make things fit better  this would come in very handy in cases such as buses  garbage trucks  mail vans  and any other vehicle intended to have something facing out on one side relative to the road's center

ssl it's not fully implemented   hi   i was trying to use your library with aws clustered mode and figured out it does not work with ssl  i figured out the problem and fixed it in my fork  but it's a hack what i did  basically everywhere you create an address like "redis   "    you need a way to know if it's ssl and put "rediss   " instead  since those places have no access to config  unfortunately i changed all to force ssl everywhere   do you have in plan a fix for this  or i can do it if you point me to the right way  i am trying to understand your logic and how can i be least invasive to pass a config  the simplest way would be to put a static public flag somewhere    but that's also a hack i guess  and will only allow one type at one time  or pass a jvm property    what do you suggest   thanks in advance  florin moisa

b datetimepicker defined on hidden b modal at start of page   i have been struggling with an issue for a while and finally figured it out   previously i had defined some primefaces  p dialog  at the top of my page which allowed me to edit events on a calendar   i switched these for  b modal  as they work better for mobile screens   primefaces dialogs cannot scroll   anyway one of the forms had a  p calendar  control which i switched for a  b datetimepicker    now when i go to a page that uses a  b datetimepicker  it renders and functions but will not allow me to click the button to show it   could this be because it shares the control with the one that is on the modal and because the modal is hidden i cannot see the control   update  i moved the  b modal definitions to the bottom of the page but the problem still occurs

escaping colons for solr   fields erroneously detected   we keep running into failures where solr thinks we're specifying a field  while we could escape our data to avoid this  it's not trivial and the likely case is that this is happening accidentally for other users as well   would it be desirable to escape colons for solr by default  would it be more desirable to add a flag to specify that colons should be escaped for solr   happy to put the work in  but not sure what would be the most desirable behaviour

nullpointerexception in quotereplacement   hi   we were using flyway maven plugin 2 2 and we just upgraded to 2 3  we're doing the database migration with mvn flyway migrate   until some point in time the migrations worked perfectly  but we started to get some errors and we can't get it to migrate with mvn flyway migration anymore    prior the upgrade  using version 2 2  we got the same error as described here  https   github com flyway flyway issues 575   there's no error with our sql files  if i copy   paste the sql file contents into the mysql client  the statements are successfully executed   after the upgrade  now using version 2 3  we indeed get an error  find the stacktrace below   as i understand there's some error replacing the placeholders   this is our pom definition for

using the "robot" class to clamp the mouse can freeze the entire os   recently  i've had a weird bug where my system would sometimes freeze entirely when a litiengine game was executed  this occurred entirely random and there was no reliable way to reproduce it  i've done some research during the ldjam and found out that using the    robot    class can under certain circumstances cause this behavior  the engine uses this class to clamp the  mouse  to the game window to prevent it from leaving the application  after disabling the clamping via  input mouse   setgrabmouse false    the problem did no longer occur    i've observed this problem irregularly for a few weeks to months now    at first  i thought it might somehow be related to my new machine  the engine didn't change anything related to how it uses the  robot  class recently  something external must have changed     some ideas about the issue      maybe it's related to the mouse refresh rate   maybe the os changed its handling for some input related stuff    maybe the jvm has a problem     re installing didn't help   similar issue  https   bugs openjdk java net browse jdk 8196030 attachmentorder desc  we need to do some research to solve this     specs        cpu    core i7 8700k   3 70 ghz     os    windows 10 pro   10 0 17763 build 17763     mouse    logitech g903   1000hz 1600dpi     jvm    java se 8u201

bazel's dependency suggestion is wrong with proto_library    i wrongly added a  proto_library  dependency  while i really should have added a  java_proto_library  dependency to a  java_test_library   bazel then suggests that i should depend on that  proto_library  that i am already depending on    build_data_proto    while it should really suggest to depend on   build_data_java_proto       cc   cgrushko

fix 2 deficiencies in documentation   there are two features which as a new user i didn't really understand because they weren't on the "documentation for users" page   1  row mode vs record mode  i finally figured it out thanks to  this article  http   kb refinepro com 2012 03 difference between record and row html  2  the difference between  null  and the empty string   ""      i still don't understand this  after reading as much as i could stomach of #820  #1544  #1571  i still really don't understand the fundamental difference in how they are represented and how they change the functionality of openrefine  e g  during export   i have also found out that it seems easy enough to convert from  null     ""  with the  coalesce    function  but i don't know if it's possible to go from  ""     null  or if i would ever even want to do so   thanks so much for an awesome tool  i have loved most of it so far and am super excited for its future   i hope that someone can add a simple explanation of these two details to the documentation for users page  possibly in their own sections

pushy proxy support requires external dns lookup   hello    we want to switch to pushy library to be able to use the new apns provider api  until now  we have been using javapns library to send apns push messages  as our server is on an internal network  we need the proxy support that became available in pushy 0 6   we also talk to gcm for android pushes  and all  external communication goes through our proxy    i managed to have pushy  current version 0 7 2  run successfully on my local development environment  but when running on the internal server  i was getting a clientnotconnectedexception   this was after i have resolved all issues with ssl and alpn    i then had a network colleague look at the protocol layer on the host when initiating the ssl connection over the proxy  surprisingly  the library first tried to resolve the name   api push apple com   which failed on the internal server  as this server cannot resolve external host names   this seems to be the root cause of the _clientnotconnectedexception_  because when we configured a valid ip in the local  etc hosts file on the internal linux server  the pushy call succeeded   our network colleagues also confirmed that the name resolution should be done by the proxy and not by the internal server   to hardcode the ip address of that apple apns host in the local hosts file is definitely no option for a stable environment  as we don't know if all apple hosts will keep their ip adresses forever     also  all other communication to external systems over proxy worked so far  so that i think that this is a problem specific to the pushy library or the referenced included libraries   can anybody help or advise how to solve that issue   thanks and kind regards   wolfgang

when working multi window android studio  save actions plugin only works in the first instance    it may be a luxury problem   but when you're working multi project in android studio 3 0  and thus also multi window    i e  opening a second project that has a demo in it  bit with bad code formatting   the save actions plug in only works in the original project that was opened first   if it's easily fixed  that would be great  like the plug in already is  if not  then it's maybe nice to know this limitation  hence the fyi

"ran out of memory" checking spec with a large tuple   hello  i'm continuing development of my trace checker   we began discussion in #367  i'm following ron pressler's method from " verifying software traces against a formal specification with tla+ and tlc  https   pron github io files trace pdf "    currently  i have a python script that parses a mongodb log file and generates a tla+ spec with a tuple of 6532 states  each state is a tuple of variable values  some of these values are large  including tuples up to 1014 elements long  the whole spec is 130mb of tla+    here is the spec and config file  https   www dropbox com sh nq1guc0nqv940ns aac1031rhi5sxcziig4rusofa dl 0    tlc can parse this file  although it takes some time  the problem is this  tlc runs out of memory during model checking  this surprises me  because there are only 6532 states  i increased the heap size to nearly the size of my physical ram with   xmx60g   that didn't prevent the crash  it only delayed it   is there a way to diagnose why tlc needs so much memory  so i can determine a solution to the problem  do you think i should use a different data structure rather than a tuple of tuples

a bug in "exclude http headers"   thanks for the quick implementation of "exclude http headers"  however  i think it contains a bug   i added a payload  which is once reflected within the "x request path  " header  and then in the body it appears on 7 different places    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 4717664 41102901 36c84b62 6a68 11e8 839b 37650047fdce png  however  even though i see these occurrences in the session tracer  there is no issue reported by this extension  here is my setup    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 4717664 41102738 d7b1ba0a 6a67 11e8 9e39 38bb930f4ae5 png  i assume it matches the payload only once  and since it happens to occur in the header  the rest of found bugs are ignored

chan sankakucomplex is only downloading preview images   is there an actual workaround for this   i'm not the most skilled whatsoever at this sort of thing but i was going to try and edit the class file i found in the ripme jar  i also didn't know if i should or shouldn't as i don't know if it's even possible for this case   it's downloading the images properly  i have actually zero complaints for this tool as it works brilliantly and had only messed up the first time i ever used it and never again  the problem is that it's downloading the preview image  which is a very very small watered down version of the actual image   i also want to say that i've noticed chan sankakucomplex has it stored on  data sometimes and then  sample other times  so i don't know if that could confuse it even more or not there   is there a way i can get it to open up the url it finds to then open up the photo and then download it  again  not the best with this stuff but that sounds almost too complicated and impossible   thanks

some dispatched action replies are not getting sent     recieved   a user reported that his dispatched actions were hanging about 50  of the time  i verified that it is exactly 50  of the time  every other   if you run a program that dispatches an action and exits and then you run that program again it hangs   this is because the socket management code in  sendreply  in  servershr serverqaction c  is not working   given a script    some more information   1   the treatment of the return values for send with  msg_dontwait do not seem to be being handled correctly  see  https   developer ibm com tutorials l sockpit  2  the case that the 2nd  send  in sendreply fails was not causing a retry 3  the print statement that the connection was lost was trashing the 1st and 3d terms of the ip address  the debugger showed them to be correct  4  i don't think this is relevant but is the global variable that holds the list of client sockets thread safe    i am positing that attachport and removeclient in that c file are not working correctly   i tried removing the dontwait and checking for success on the 2nd send  this did not help   stopping for now 
"send to interpreter" re expands all tests   if you expand a combinatorial trace  and then right click and attempt to execute just one test  using "send to interpreter"   all of the tests are re expanded before running the single test identified   though the test does then run as expected  the traces console displays the number of tests expanded   this isn't noticeable with small numbers of tests  but if a trace expands to 10 000 tests or more  there is a significant delay before a single test can be re executed  each test is just a sequence of operation calls  so it should be possible to run an individual trace without re expanding the whole set  this was wrong in 2 3 4  but i'm pretty sure this used to work correctly at some point

cannot iterate on headers in java 11 + jpms   trying to iterate over a  headers  instance does not work when using plain java 11 and jpms   the reason is that  headers implements iterator kotlin pair   and  kotlin pair  is not available to jpms   this works fine in java 8  as the kotlin stdlib ends up in the classpath   but does not work when using java 11 and proper jpms modules  because the application class that iterates over the  headers  would need to jpms _read_  kotlin pair   which would require a directive in the application  module info java   unfortunately the kotlin stdlib does not support jpms  no  automatic module name  in the manifest  no  module info class  in the jar   so that leaves the application relying on automatic modules with unstable module names   this can be worked around iterating using  headers names    and  headers values name     ftr  i encountered this problem in  cometd 6  https   github com cometd cometd tree 6 0 x  which is based on java 11 and jpms

logback with encryption is not writing all the data    i have written a custom rolling file appender  where i overrode  setoutputstream     and i'm trying to encrypt the output stream  as shown below  highlighted    my custom rolling appender class     however if i use 30 lines of data for example after i click a button  it is working good  i was able to encrypt and decrypt it back with all the data entered   i did set immediate flush to my encoder which is going to be used as flag to flush the bytes to underlying output stream   can you please guide clarify on this  let me know if you have any questions on this

hidden mod on opsu  doesn't fade on time   tested on opsu 0 10 1 commit f22498ae7dedc3b0043d601e6787fde814b11690  on the minor update ui   hidden mod fades too slow on most maps  it seems to be fade properly because the notes will be removed right after you click on it if you have disabled the "show perfect hits" or have been obscured by the hitobject animations if you didn't disable it or getting 100s or 50s  the note is completely hidden when it is right at the start the 300 range  iirc  need confirming   from the fade it is using now  it is following the last possible range that a user can 300 a note   also  the hit notes expanding out  idk what it is called  sorry about that  only happens on sliders when you click on it  reached on the other end of the slider where the ball reaches  when it have reverse arrow  and both slider start and end when it finishes  on normal circle  it only show 300 100 50 without the hit notes expanding out 
asyncfile flush bug    it looks like asyncfile flush does not ensure that the entire data is written out before calling filechannel force    it should have waited until the outstanding write has been flushed before calling filechannel force

column name vs  column label   when you have a query where you assign a different name to a column   select   toto as "my very long column name" from   mytable  the long column name is shown in the output  but when you click on your result set and choose "advanced copy   copy column name s "  the short column name is copied  in my case  "toto" instead of "my very long column name"    my guess is that there is a confusion between resultsetmetadata getcolumnname   and resultsetmetadata getcolumnlabel     i honestly don't know if that's a feature or a bug  in other words  is that working as intended

integration of graphic modeling editor   language server with language server protocol   hi   i am developing a proof of concept where i try to build a graphic editor for different graphical languages  uml  bpel       where the editor is agnostic about the language used  it only knows the object palette   language knowledge is decoupled from editor using a language server for each language   this is achieved using a javascript library with specific components for the desired graphic languages  firstly  jointjs  http   jointjs com opensource  but i have moved to  gojs  http   gojs net latest index html  because of the problem described in issue https   github com eclipse che issues 3639  that has the capability of providing a json representation of the displayed model  this json representation would be processed by the language server  for a proof of concept  this would be good enough    i have already implemented   deployed successfully a language server  with its corresponding workspace agent  for the uml representation provided by gojs  and now i have to link the js editor with that language server  and i would like to reuse as much as possible of the available code that che already provides for this  it is specially important to be able to process language server responses because they will involve changes in the graphic representation provided to the user   the use case i have in mind would be as follows   1  when a new model is created  a sample model is created using  gojs  http   gojs net latest index html  2  any library event will trigger a save operation of the json representation of the model in the file system  as this file will have the proper file type   languageserver editor will trigger the change to languageserver to examine it  3  languageserver response will somehow captured by my extension logic and will produce proper changes in the represented model   i have verified that the lsp client is available in the  che plugin languageserver ide  https   github com eclipse che tree master plugins plugin languageserver che plugin languageserver ide  module  i foresee several ways of using that module  1  integrating it with my extension using its editorprovider and somehow "shadowing" it with my graphical editor  2  using lsp client classes provided in package _org eclipse che plugin languageserver ide service_ and implementing the rest on my own  i would prefer not doing this  3       there are many intermediate or different paths   i would like to have some hints about which is the best way to integrate that languageserver editor with my graphical editor  or if there is a better way to integrate the graphic model with a language server      os and version          che version       5 2 2   os and version    ubuntu 16 04  linux kernel 4 4 0 57 generic    docker version    1 13 1   che install      binaries from eclipse che 5 2 2 docker containers combined with compiled assembly from the same version to integrate my graphic editor  thank you very much for your help  best regards  alberto

assertlinesmatch nullpointerexception during fastforward evaluation   ## overview  assertlinesmatch#matches has a bug that will cause a nullpointerexception to be thrown after evaluating a fastforward match if there are more expected lines after the fastforward match then remain in the actual results   this only manifests itself if the expected list size is equal to or larger than the actual list size   the reason this fails is because after matching the fast forward region  the actual list is now empty but assertlinesmatch doesn't check for that condition and sends the  null  value from the actualdeque peek call to assertlinematch#matches   the solution is to simply add a check for  null  in matches   the return statement could be modified to    ## deliverables  a pull request with this issue number as the branch name will be submitted that contains the change to assertlinematch#matches and a test method added to assertlinematchassertionstest to illustrate the bug is fixed

newpipe doesn't properly shut down audio streams when playback is finished interrupted      x  i carefully read the  contribution guidelines  https   github com teamnewpipe newpipe blob head  github contributing md  and agree to them     x  i checked if the issue feature exists in the latest version        i did use the  incredible bugreport to markdown converter  https   teamnewpipe github io crashreporttomarkdown   to paste bug reports   newpipe ends up leaving open the streams when it's done using them  even worse  newpipe doesn't recycle old streams  causing a memory leak to form in android's internal mediaserver over time  as it requires explicit commands to be given in order to free memory used by audio it plays  on low ram devices  this can cause problems if the user starts playing multiple videos   basically  the way i found this out is via an equalizer app that i use due to my sensitivity with certain frequencies  https   play google com store apps details id com devdnua equalizer free  in this app  i was exploring the settings to make sure everything was just the way i want them  and i found the "view active audio sessions" area  newpipe had a ton in this list  despite no actively playing videos at the time  so i began to investigate  the summary of my findings with newpipe is as follows     if nothing is currently playing  and the user starts a new video  newpipe will open a new stream  this includes having a video audio stream currently open  but stopped paused    if there's currently something playing and another of the same type is enqueued  newpipe will use the existing stream when the new one starts    if there's currently something playing and the user replaces it with another of the same type  a new stream is started    if audio is playing and the user starts up a video  newpipe starts a new stream  same goes for if video is playing and the user starts an audio stream    switching between pop up and full screen recycles the old stream    at no point does newpipe actually close a given stream      this includes when the user manually closes a stream  regardless of whether the stream is still playing or not   i should note a few other things  as well    the equalizer app can't actually close the streams itself  as they are owned by newpipe and the system's equalizer abilities only allow for a passthrough adjustment for apps like this  not a complete change of ownership  using the "x" button in the active streams window only tells the equalizer to stop filtering  as a result  the memory leak will still occur even after i remove a stream from the list    force stopping newpipe also does not get rid of the memory leak  i assume this is to allow for apps to resume using a given stream even after such a close  i've seen other apps such as bubbleupnp and vanilla music do this    the only two ways available to users to get rid of the memory leak here are as follows      reboot the device      rooted users can alternatively kill the mediaserver by running  killall  9 mediaserver  as root in a terminal or something  this will kill all streams  including currently playing ones  so if newpipe is currently playing something and the terminal command is used  the audio will cut out and newpipe will never be the wiser  video will still play  however  it will be silent until newpipe starts a new stream via one of the methods outlined above   the recommended solution is to have newpipe close out each stream when it's done playing  as well as have it recycle streams when shutting down currently playing items in favor of new ones  also  audio and video currently use separate streams  so replacing them so that only one notification stream or the other can exist at one time would also be helpful

crashes immediately after loading screen finishes   issue type   problem  ### description   in both the v1 2 1  v1 3 x86  and v1 3 x64 "non x86" versions  the game will crash immediately after the loading screen completes due to a runtimeexception  this occurs whenever the app config generated by the game has a value greater than 0 0 for the "volume " setting within the file  even the stock app config file created by the game when cleanly installed   extracted  produces this behavior   it should be noted that the bug only occurred on windows systems  being personally observed on both windows 7 home premium 64 bit edition  and windows 10  while using oracle's java 8  when tested on debian linux 8  jessie  64 bit  with openjdk8  _which includes openjre8_  the game ran without crashing at all  regardless of the value assigned to "volume "   that being said  i'm led to believe that this could be a compatibility issue with oracle's java  or windows itself  i can't find a windows binary of openjdk8 to confirm or deny this theory though  please advise   edited to fix typos       #### examples   raw text from error_log_client3464147 log     upon successfully reaching the title screen in linux only  complete with music  i closed it as this was just to show that linux can reach the title screen with the music enabled just fine with the default settings  i noticed some messages appear in a different order when under linux  not sure if that's relevant but figured i'd show you anyways

 astro  time drift on positional job   the sun elevation is supposed to be calculated at a regular frequency  default is every 300s   however  due to the use of  schedulewithfixeddelay  for the positional job  which schedules the job starting from the termination of the previous job to the commencement of the next job  there is a small time drift introduced  this time drift can be anywhere from a few milliseconds to 35 40 milliseconds per execution  depending on the cpu speed   example of drift    this drift could be eliminated  or greatly reduced  by the use of  scheduleatfixedrate  instead of  schedulewithfixeddelay    the guidelines indicate  schedulewithfixeddelay  is preferred  however  as the astro binding performs accurate calculations  it can be argued that the frequency with which those calculations are performed also should be accurate  therefore a deviation from the guidelines is warranted   reference this forum discussion  here  https   community openhab org t astro binding event drift 44328

old apis show green robot launch icon    short description  default green robot launch icon shows on "old" api versions    expected behavior  blue squirrel icon shows on all versions    actual behavior  daniel saw the green robot on api 18   i saw the "green robot" on the api 16 emulator       steps to reproduce  run the app on a device or emulator running an old api and look at the launch icon    discussion  i tried removing  vectordrawables usesupportlibrary   true   from  build gradle    the result was that on the api 16 emulator    the standard sqrl icon did show properly     this standard  not round  is expected since  android roundicon  was added in api 25   this post  https   stackoverflow com a 47910420 897007 indicates that removal of the support library will enable   build time png generation for vector drawables for api levels lower than 21     so although we could remove that support  i have proven it would increase the size of the apk file   my quick experiment showed that the apk was "3 517kb" without the support library and "3 490kb" with the support library   these apk's were generated using the  build   generate signed apk bundle  process   i recommend that we leave the situation as is  accept that old os's will see the green robot

openjdk 11 javadoc not returned on hover   i am running debian testing with openjdk 11  i am using neovim v0 3 4  lately  jdt ls has not been returning javadoc from the openjdk 11 doc package in hover responses  for example  if i hover on the keyword  string   i do not get the javadoc for  string   instead i get this    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 7351168 55675103 25398f00 5883 11e9 8470 456076818e90 png  i had it working with snapshot  jdt language server 0 36 0 201903201910  and neoclide coc java as my client for a while and it just suddenly stopped working  the problem seemed to be that i had set java_home for maven and i was able to get snapshot  jdt language server 0 36 1 201904020132  to send javadoc by explicitly configuring the path to the jdk in coc's settings  even though it was the same path as java_home   however  jdt ls has stopped sending the jdk javadoc again and i have not been able to get it to work again  i have tried the most recent snapshot   jdt language server 0 37 0 201904162228   but it does not send the jdk javadoc either  to rule out coc as the problem  i also tried using prabirshrestha vim lsp as my client and i still had the same problem  here is a trace i get from coc   the bug report i made to neoclide coc java concerning this issue can be found  here  https   github com neoclide coc java issues 17 _pjax  23js repo pjax container    i have closed that issue since this seems to be a problem between jdt ls and openjdk 11 on debian and not an issue with my lsp client

adding command into recipe's content of stack causes issue when starting workspace   ### description if you add a command in the recipe content like following    "recipe"                  "type"  "kubernetes"                "content"  "kind  list nitems  n    n  apiversion  v1 n  kind  pod n  metadata  n   name  hub tooling n  spec  n   initcontainers  n       n     image  '192 168 2 100 30500 license' n     name  attach license n     imagepullpolicy  always n     command   ' bin sh'  ' c'  'cp  usr xyz xxx  usr xyz csa'  n     resources  n      limits  n       memory  512mi n   containers  n       n     image  'wsskeleton che machine exec latest' n     name  machine exec n    resources  n      limits  n       memory  512mi n"                "contenttype"  "text x yaml"                 stack gets created but the command    array gets converted into list in the workspace config  ### reproduction steps format might be wrong here by a space or two but the original one that i tried worked for creating a stack  so  basically if you try adding a command to your container in the stack recipe and then check it in your stack raw configuration  it will appear fine having all square bracket and quotes and everything  then when you create a workspace with the same stack and check config of it  you will notice that the content of command in square bracket gets converted into list like     "command  n         bin sh n        ' c' n        cp  usr xyz xxx  usr xyz csa n"  now workspace doesn't start at all    when you try and open it it will keep loading forever and if you check for resources inside the workspace namespace  you won't find even a single resource   is it not possible to use command for a image inside recipe   or am i doing it wrong

hashmap hashcode throws npe after deserialization   hi  guys   there is a bug in the latest release release   2 0 2   regarding  hashmap hashcode   the issue is that after a hash map is deserialized  calling it's   hashcode   https   github com javaslang javaslang blob v2 0 x javaslang src main java javaslang collection hashmap java#l377  method throws npe  the field  hash  is null    this issue has been fixed on master by a  pr  https   github com javaslang javaslang pull 1242  made for a  refactoring design improvement  https   github com javaslang javaslang issues 1235   the reason i'm opening this issue is to keep track of this issue on the latest release  and to be able to prioritize the upcoming release accordingly   while investigating  i realised that the reason behind this problem is that the lazy   hash   https   github com javaslang javaslang blob v2 0 x javaslang src main java javaslang collection hashmap java#l35  field is marked as  transient   while it makes complete sense to throw away evaluated hash value while serialization  as the contents' hash values might change   still  there should be some additional serialization logic  e g   readobject  and  writeobject  methods  that should reassign the lazy  hash  field into its unevaluated state  alternatively  the field  hash  could be made non transient and the class   javaslang lazy   https   github com javaslang javaslang blob v2 0 x javaslang src main java javaslang lazy java  could clear its calculated value upon serialization while serializing its _supplier_  i realize that this is the exact opposite of how  lazy  is handling serialization right now  maybe we could make another lazy flavour for this     the above pr fixes this issue by removing the lazy  hash  field altogether   it might worth mentioning that we stumbled upon this problem after we started using javaslang's persistent collections with  apache spark  http   spark apache org    a distributed computing system that heavily relies on serialization of data  our  hashmap  instances were put into other hash based collections  hence the calls to  hashcode

 indexing  a network partition can cause in flight documents to be lost   this ticket is meant to capture an issue which was discovered as part of the work done in #7493   which contains a  failing reproduction test  https   github com elasticsearch elasticsearch blob 596a4a073584c4262d574828c9caea35b5ed1de5 src test java org elasticsearch discovery discoverywithservicedisruptions java#l375  with  awaitfix   if a network partition separates a node from the master  there is some window of time before the node detects it  the length of the window is dependent on the type of the partition  this window is extremely small if a socket is broken  more adversarial partitions  for example  silently dropping requests without breaking the socket can take longer  up to 3x30s using current defaults    if the node hosts a _primary_ shard at the moment of partition  and ends up being isolated from the cluster  which could have resulted in split brain before   some documents that are being indexed into the primary _may_ be lost if they fail to reach one of the allocated replicas   due to the partition  and that replica is later promoted to primary by the master

possible race condition during heron update   during the heron update command the following flow is orchestrated by the scheduler   1  scheduler  deactivate   a  tmaster  deactivated 1  scheduler  delete physical plan 1  scheduler  update packing plan in state manager   a  executors  detects new packing plan   b  executor0  refreshes process list  restarts tmaster     1  tmaster  restarts with new packing plan     1  tmaster  receive new strmgr registrations     1  tmaster  satisfies new packing plan     1  tmaster  creates distributes new physical plan 1  scheduler  await new physical plan 1  scheduler  receive new physical plan 1  scheduler  activate   a  tmaster  activated  the scheduler deletes the physical plan so that the tmaster will restart with a new packing plan  recognize stream manager registration requests and build a new physical plan representing the new packing plan   since the executors all refresh their packing plans in parallel  a potential race condition exists if executor0 takes a long time to restart the tmaster  i e  step 3b   this happened due to a python issue fixed by #1930    in this case new stream managers will register themselves with the old tmaster  the tmaster will generate a new physical plan that matches of old packing plan  if it can  and update it in the state manager  the scheduler will detect the new packing plan and complete the update  but the topology will still be in the old packing plan state  new scale out stream managers will go unrecognized   finally the tmaster will get restarted by the executor with new packing plan  it will load the old physical plan and reject registration requests by the new stream managers   what is needed is a guarenteed way for the scheduler to invalidate update the packing plan on the tmaster that doesn't rely on an asynchronous change propagating through the stream manager

green overlay and corrupted playback on 4 1 2 device   hi   we're currently integrating exoplayer into an app that runs on devices back to 4 1 2  and on one of our devices we're seeing a strange issue playing back an mp4 file  this is occurring both with hardware acceleration enabled and disabled in the manifest file   exoplayer version  we've tried the latest version  plus a few versions back   example screenshot    example  http   i imgur com 8eez3qc png   i've sent an email to dev exoplayer gmail com with a link to example content where this issue is occurring   any ideas what might be going on  i'm guessing this is probably a hardware issue  we don't see this behaviour in a standard videoview  but we're using exoplayer to try fix issues with anamorphic widescreen content which isn't displaying correctly with the built in videoview

threading bug causes server thread to hang   i am running jetty 9 4 11 v20180605 as embedded web server  i have an issue with server threads  hanging  in some environments  it's very rare or even un reproducible  while in other environments it is triggered quickly and continually  i have code that is essentially the following  i say 'essentially' because this is implemented as part of framework so i am extracting out the relevant bits here so that it makes sense      it appears that the idle timeout does not take effect  in trying to debug this  i found that if i set a breakpoint at httpinput java  on line 570   _inputq wait     and then each time it hits  i wait a small amount of time  from 1 second to 5 seconds or so   it makes it much easier to reproduce  this is partly why i believe it to be a threading bug   i also tried setting a breakpoint in the httpchanneloverhttp java class at the first line of the  onidletimeout throwable   method to try to understand why that is not getting called  the  onidletimeout  method is called after 30 seconds  however  the first line checks  if  _delayedforcontent     and  _delayedforcontent  is  false  when the breakpoint hits  so it returns immediately without doing anything   once this issue is encountered  we also see it happening continually  quickly locking up all the threads that we make available to it 
enqueueing regional jobs uses too much memory   on 21 july someone enqueued 18 regional jobs at once on  analysis conveyal com  and the system lost track of which jobs existed  and stopped processing all of them  examining the logs reveals that the analysis backend ran out of memory in regionalanalysismanager where it was enqueueing the tasks   the failure is inside the method  enqueue  regionalanalysis regionalanalysis    for each of these regional analyses  we have about 350k tasks  each of those tasks exists as a java object  and all those objects are serialized at once into a byte buffer  which the http layer then turns into a string to send to the broker  the broker will then deserialize the received copy of this string into 350k more java objects  so at the moment when the job's being enqueued  each of 350k tasks exists as two objects and three serialized copies of those objects  we could easily be at 1gb of memory per regional analysis  so it's no wonder this failed as the 6th analysis was enqueued   the simple solution is to enqueue in small batches  as we used to do in the past  there's even a todo comment in the code saying to do this  "cluster" the tasks     the more disruptive solution is to not use an http api to enqueue tasks into the broker  we could just run the broker in the same jvm as the backend and inject the task objects directly  no serialization  no multiple copies of the tasks  we would have to consider how to enqueue static site regional jobs if the broker was not a separate process with an http enqueueing endpoint

vertx canceltimer   can return true when timer fires   the api contract for  vertx canceltimer    appears to indicate that if it returns true  the timer has been successfully canceled  however  the timer handler is not properly synchronized with the timer flag  so the handler can see the  cancelled  flag is false and start the handler execution before the cas in the  cancel    method runs   currently  we have to do our own synchronization around timers to ensure that when a timer fires indicating a timeout  we are guaranteed the handler does not also execute  it would be better if  internaltimerhandler handle    also did a  cancelled compareandset false  true   and only executed the handler when the cas is successful  ensuring that canceled timers are guaranteed not to execute their handlers

npc bug when player is beyond chase range   hello   as you can see on the video below  a sentinel that goes outside of its chase range starts to get buggy and is stuck constantly  as long as the player is in sight  at least  in a loop of movement    https   streamable com gv5xa  on this video  the npc has a range of 20  and a chase range of 25  when the player gets outside of the 25 chase range  the npc doesn't know what to do  i think if the player gets outside of the chase range  the npc should simply just return to its original position  in a roleplay way  that would imply it "gave up" on chasing the player and decided to "go home"   that would make much more sense

unable to use udp incoming data with tcp udp binding "error while executing background thread udp refresh service"   hi  i'm trying to integrate in oh2  with the oh1 tcp udp binding   my already inplace arduinos that are controlling some lamps    my protocol is extremely easy i use udp packets to send commands to arduinos  and arduinos respond with http get's over udp   right now i have my own udp2http proxy that converts those http requests to tcp and forward them to an apache that handle the requests    i want to remove the whole thing  apache and my app  and integrate those arduinos in openhab    the outbound connections are working properly  i have a switch in oh that will send the proper command when activated but i'm stuck with the inbound connections   my planis to write a javascript transformation that parses properly my url into diferente variables in oh so  after that i could handle the state change of lights and some other data    to begin with the easiest thing i've set up an item like this     string arduino_tcp_rcv "arduinoudp   s "    udp "    8888 '' "      this should store in arduino_tcp_rcv the complete udp packet sent from the arduino    in the log you an see this     what am i doing wrong    i've read all post about udp binding  and tested almost everything  but i'm stuck    can someone help me    i'm using  oh2    4 0 8  binding tcp1   1 9 0 b5  raspberry pi3 runnig jessie   thx

couple bugs   hello  scout freddyhair back to report  i found a couple weird bugs with the backpacks  namely  the cow backpack  didn't try any other  as of now  here we go   the hose seems to work weirdly  i collected 4 buckets of lava in one of my tanks and then tried inputting it directly into a tinker's construct seared tank  didn't work as expected  it generated some "ghost lava"  oooo spoooooky   which couldn't smelt anything  the tinker's tank appeared full  but the backpack one appeared full as well  then  as i compacted the smeltery into a geochest and then opened it again  the ghastly lava was gone  nb  geochests instead keep any inventory item or tank fluid or thingumajig contained in the blocks they grab   however spilling it on the ground and then collecting it with a bucket appears to work just fine  as does filling the bucket directly in the inventory  in this regard  i also have a question  can you spill milk and melon juice as well    when i die  the backpack gets put on the ground in rather weird locations  when i died from a silverfish nest  couple meter under the surface  my backpack got placed over the surface  instead of right next to my grave  something similar happened the second time i died  way farther underground  and i lost it    luckily there wasn't anything preciousssssss in it  i am not completely sure this second case was a bug in your coding  though  there's a tiny chance that the backpack got instead blown up and destroyed from the tnt zombies  damn deadlyworld   i'll have to test this further    apparently it doesn't recognize tinker's construct longsword and mattock as tools  having the pickaxe in my hand  i shift scroll to the longsword  then it just scrolls through the hotbar  instead of swapping the longsword to the mattock  same happened with the mattock    every time i place the backpack on the ground it "recrafts" itself  i'll explain further  i get attacked by something with it on my chest slot  it obviously takes damage  and whenever i place it down and grab it up again it hasn't got any more damage  i said "recrafts" because i have the "you will die" mod installed  amongst other things  it also gives a random bonus in protection to any crafted armor piece and then changes its name accordingly  well  if i at first had  let's say  a damaged "old cow backpack" with an armor bonus of 0 5   when i place it down and grab it up again i could end up with a pristine "hardened cow backpack" with an armor bonus of 3   just as if i crafted another cow backpack for free  i don't know if that's intentional  but i suppose not

fixed time caching  caches forever    hi  i used to use google guava cache for fixed time caching of certain contents on a web application  after knowing about cache2k  i wrote a small facade to be able to switch between cache2k and guava  and changed my default cache framework to cache2k on a high traffic website   100k unique users per day   i switched to cache2k for two reasons  first it's out of the box jmx support  second i assumed that when my db fails for any reason  and so  org cache2k cachesource get k   throws any exception  cache2k continues to return old cached values for the keys  so my website home page would continue to work even after db gets down   i was satisfied with jmx support but about the second i was wrong  please tell me if this is intended behavior that cache fails when cachesource get   fails   well  this post is about another issue which seems to be very severe  the problem is about fixed time caching and _strong_ caching of cache2k  in my high traffic website fixed time caching never refreshed after a couple of days  that is  it kept old values and did not update values every 1 minute  1 minute was my fixed caching period   the case was getting bad when i added an api to do a  org cache2k cache remove k   for failed caches so that website admin can refresh a cache himself  it works for some days but again fails after that  and cache remove k  did nothing   switching back to guava  everything works fine

base 64 plugin is not browser native compatible without build step   hey michael  i hope all is well  i have a pretty urgent request that will need to be addressed to continue to allow capacitor to work out of the box for browsers    import   as base64 from 'base64 js' uses umd exports and causes the browser to throw an error when ran natively  this is found in your web utils js file    i would recommend using  this base64 package from npm  https   www npmjs com package js base64  which will allow you to use native es6 imports and then leave it up to the end user to transpile build  it will also support code splitting tree shaking to ensure that you only include what you use from the package   it also is one of the most widely used base64 packages on npm at around 5 million per week downloads    i can gladly make a pr using the more up to date base64 package  please let me know how we can move forward on this as quickly as possible or how i can help in any way    all the best    tsavo    img width "1049" alt "screen shot 2019 03 11 at 3 13 34 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 26530323 54151460 3cff2e00 4411 11e9 9406 66deac0f8689 png"    img width "679" alt "screen shot 2019 03 11 at 3 13 26 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 26530323 54151464 3f618800 4411 11e9 96c8 8c4e7998c61e png"

backpressure handling of workqueueprocessor leads to unnecessarily dropped messages with bursty producers   ## tl dr  because the following explanation are a bit long  i'll try to sum it up in a few bullet points    i use a workqueueprocessor with ringbuffer capacity 128    there are never more than 15 slots occupied  workqueueprocessor getpending   is always below 15     the consumer faster than the producer    but still    backpressure drops messages    ## details  in the following situation  the producer publishes messages with a rate of 200 messages per second  it does so by always publishing bursts of 5 messages and then sleeping for 25ms   the final consumer consumes the messages with a rate of 250 message per second   to buffer the bursty producer  i wanted to use a workqueueprocessor with a capacity of 128  in the test it is initially filled with 10 messages  in a real application  this could be e g  a remainder of a previous burst    using backpressure strategy drop  i would expect that no messages at all are dropped  because the consumer is much faster than the producer and the ringbuffer should take care of possible lags and bursts   but actually after the first  880 messages  there appear regular drops  to illustrate the problem  i created a small unit test  see https   gist github com mlex a7349216f32c4f94acc0c9d7c10d6321 for the full test     ## possible explanation  the reason for the observed behaviour lies in the way  subscription request    is called in  reactor queue requesttask   which is used by  workqueueprocessor    the  requesttask  initially requests  buffersize 1  messages  in our case 127   it then waits for the ringbuffer to consume  buffersize 3 4   in our case 96  messages and then requests another  buffersize 3 4  messages   as far as i can see  the intention behind this is the following  in the case of a fast producer and slow consumer  this would lead to a ringbuffer  that is always filled with 31 to 127 elements  in case of a slow producer and fast consumer  this would lead to a number of pending requests being constantly between 31 and 127 elements   unfortunately the condition  waitstrategy waitfor cursor + limit  readcount  spinobserver     see  ringbuffer java 868  https   github com reactor reactor core blob 0d459836c9b3621846bedc48a3b839e465167726 src main java reactor core queue ringbuffer java#l868   that should wait for the next  limit   96  elements to be processed  is not triggered after exactly 96 elements  it is triggered after _at least_ 96 elements  because the  signalallwhenblocking    in  workqueueprocessor  is only called after  nextsequence   cachedavailablesequence  is reached  see  workqueueprocessor java 818  https   github com reactor reactor core blob 0d459836c9b3621846bedc48a3b839e465167726 src main java reactor core publisher workqueueprocessor java#l818     in the case of bursty producer  the  cachedavailablesequence  does not increase constantly  but makes jumps  the size of the jumps being the burstsize   in the above example  this causes  waitfor  to return after 100 elements have been processed  not after 96 as expected   so we actually "loose" 4 slots  "loose"  because they will never be filled again   even if the producer starts producing at a much faster rate     after 800 elements  we have already lost 8 4   32 slots  this means  that the next  subscription request    is only triggered when the number of pending requests equals zero   in which case we start dropping messages

write transaction interfering with reads   ### summary we started seeing an issue in our applications where data was sometimes not returned from api calls  while investigating  it appeared to be an issue where write transactions happening in one application that destroys and recreates a node in the database interfere with the read transactions from the apis  this seems to violate the expectation that the write transaction should be self contained and not affect the read of the same node   we've setup a simplified version of this problem occurring  we first create a node and spin up a separate instance of the application to simply continually query for that node  we then continually run a write transaction that first deletes the node and then recreates the node with a configurable delay in between those two steps  however  the same transaction is still used in both steps    ### setup    neo4j   enterprise  v3 5 3  also tried v3 5 6    os  macos mojave  neo in docker   ubuntu 14  servers    driver  java v1 7 3   language  scala v2 13 0  ### steps to reproduce  linked repo  https   github com hoekz neotransactioninvestigation   run twice at the same time  once in write mode  and once in read mode    sbt "run 0"    runs in write mode with 0ms delay between delete and create in same transaction   sbt "run read mode"    runs in read mode with a constant read of the same node and reports when the node is either found or not found   these two commands should be run at the same time in two different terminals  better to kick off the write first  but should be very little delay between starting the read    ### expected  no matter the delay used  the read should always see a node   ### actual  with no or very little delay     10ms   the read intermittently fails to find the node  with a longer delay  1s   the read always finds the node

robovm backend  black screen bug   hi libgdx team   ive ported my game from using monotouch backened to robovm  and it runs great  but sometimes the screen becomes black on resuming the game after a couple of hours  first the launcher image shows briefly  if you have launcher images set up default png  default 2x png   then its replaced by a black screen  the continues to run with sound but nothing is rendered  its almost as if the game loses the opengl context   resuming the game within a shorter period of time does not produce this issue  even after locking the device   the launcher image does not show in this case  maybe we need to implement viewdidunload or didreceivememorywarning   im not familiar with ios though   happens on ipad mini   anyway  amazing work on the robovm alternative

navigation stops cannot start while in background   we are having an issue on some devices  oneplus  where if the app is in the background for too long  the app is force killed by the system for "excessive battery use"  there doesn't appear to be a way to stop this  but the app being in the background is a legitimate use case   we have an idea to run a monitoring service to detect if the app has been killed  and simple restart navigation from where the user was up to  the problem is we can't seem to start navigation with the app in the background  e g  screen off   because onnavigationready   does not get called until the app is in the foreground   is there anything that can be done to allow navigation to start in the background  or alternatively is it possible to look into the fact that oneplus devices seem to kill the app after a while of navigating in the background  oneplus 6  android 9  based on some quick research  the suggestion is that it's a oneplus feature aimed at increasing battery life

orient spring data is not calling close   on the database connection    ### orientdb version  2 2 18 enterprise  ### orient spring data version  0 14rc1 ### java version  1 8  ### os  sles  ## expected behavior   for every call to orientobjectdatabasefactory opendatabase   there will be a matching call to databasedocumenttxpooled close   method so that the acquirecount will go back to 0   ## actual behavior   the opendatabase   method is getting called but not close     ## steps to reproduce   create a simple test case that calls a find   method using orient spring data  and follow it by a call to opendatabase    put a break points just before the call to find    at the start of opendatabase    and at the start of close     the call to find   will cause a call to opendatabase   and the acquirecount will go to 1  but no call to be close   will be made   the second call to opendatabase   after the find   completes will show that the acquirecount is still 1 rather than being decremented back to 0   note that this behavior actually improves performance because the connection does not get destroyed since the acquirecount never goes to 0  so the next time the connection is used it's already connected

very slow page load and missing resources when using http 2 with jetty 9 3 7   we have found an issue when remotely loading pages using http 2 in jetty   the page takes tens of seconds to load  and when it finishes it usually is missing resources  css and or images    the issue is quite frequent  you can reproduce it by opening a new window to the test page which is just plain html with several img tags   it happens after just a few tries  usually less than 10   it looks like it is more frequent in pages with many images   you can reproduce the issue with 2 remote computers with this setup   server running    jetty 9 3 7   jdk 1 8 0_66  remote client    firefox 44 0 2 for example  also happens with chrome   it is very important to run the client remotely  not from the same computer   the issue is not present when the client is local   we have reproduced it through different networks and with different computers  but not locally   we assume that jetty is installed in  usr local jetty  and java in  usr local java8   steps to reproduce   1  prepare the server computer     i add more information in case it could help to find the route cause of the issue     we initially detected the issue in a  jetty setup with haproxy  http   www eclipse org jetty documentation current http2 configuring haproxy html    in our setup we have 2 servers  one with haproxy + jetty  and the other one just with jetty   the ping between them is just about 0 2 ms   we detected the issue in the http 2 requests sent by haproxy to the other server   the requests that were served in the same server did not experience the issue   we tried moving haproxy to the other server and then the jetty with the issue was the other one   so the issue only arises when there is a network involved   although in this setup the only network causing the problem was the one between haproxy and jetty   if the connection between haproxy and jetty was local there was no problem  even if the browser was remote

algorithm specific layout option defaults   there's a conceptual problem with the layout option defaults  each layouter gets its own    options   class to access individual layout options  using that class  a proper default value is returned as specified in the melk file  however  this does not work whenever an option must be retrieved without knowing which layout algorithm is currently used   this also applies to the configuration classes for graphviz and ogdf  where every layouter can have a different default value but during configuration   coreoptions   is used to avoid code duplication 
index out of bounds exception with camera2capturer   we recently updated our app to conditionally  on api version  load the camera2capturer for use in calling   it seems to have fixed quite a few of the quirks we saw with foregrounding and backgrounding on newer devices  however one exception we've been getting shouldn't be happening at all     java lang indexoutofboundsexception  empty list doesn't contain element at index 0      for a little background  this is happening when we try to retrieve the first camera in the supported cameras list if we cant find a front facing camera in the list   heres the catch   _the devices are kitkat devices_   before we load camera2capturer  we use the following code to determine which api to use       the devices we've seen this on thus far are all kitkat 4 4 2   is it possible camera2capturer is returning true incorrectly in some edge cases 
interpreter to transform premises to conclusions   issue      there is a lot of low level noise in a lot of derivation functions  most of the noise seems to be doing really simple operations  one possible solution       write a small interpreter which consumes some sort of bytecode from a  statically initialized  "program" for the transformation   performance tradeoff       to be determined  optimization       we could compile it to java bytecode which just calls the static functions in the fixed order as determined by the program

websocket hangs in blockingwrite   hi   it was suggested to me by  joakime to open a new issue for #272 as it still occurs on 9 4 8   with a slight tendency to occur more often now  which might be just bad luck on our end    unfortunately  i can't say anything new about the issue  it still appears to be random  regardless of load for example  that threads end up in waiting state and only a server restart helps to solve the issue    as this is affecting our production servers  i'd appreciate if this is investigated again  i'd also appreciate any workaround that doesn't suggest a server restart   cheers  christoph

errors borrowing clients from the pool after running for about 20 min   hi ran   my company is building an mmo for kids and we are using cassandra as the data store   until quite recently we used http   code google com p cassandra java client  as the cassandra client but have since moved to hector   with hector  though not with the old client  we are experiencing a problem whereby after about 20 mins of running when we borrow cassandraclients from the pool they come back in the closed state    i am using the jars from http   github com downloads rantav hector hector 0 6 0 8 zip   i don't understand why this should be happening because inspecting the code i see you use poolableobjectfactory and the cassandraclientfactory checks whether the client isclosed or haserrors in the validateobject method and so presumably if this fails a new client would be requested   our webserver s  holds a static instance of the pool and then within individual requests calls pool borrowclient host  port   with a try finally we release the client back to the pool at the end of every request   have you any idea what the problem might be and has anyone else reported a similar problem   thanks  matt

reports and feature requests  the best place to     ask a general question is at the elastic  forums  https   discuss elastic co       github is not the place for general questions   2   is this bug report or feature request for a supported os  if not  it     is likely to be closed   see https   www elastic co support matrix#show_os  3   please fill out either the feature request block or the bug report block     below  and delete the other block             feature request        describe the feature          bug report        elasticsearch version     bin elasticsearch   version    discovered in version 6 5 4  then  i reproduce the bug in 7 1 0   version  7 1 0  build  default rpm 606a173 2019 05 16t00 43 15 323135z  jvm  1 8 0_162    plugins installed    no plugin    jvm

expected versus actual behavior     while insert data to index  power cut  after i recovery the cluster  there is a shard unassigned  the log reported       i find docs say that  elasticsearch translog  and  elasticsearch shard  tools could delete the corrupted translog data  so that i will lost data only in translog  but unfortunately   elasticsearch translog  and  elasticsearch shard  report the error    too  which means i will lost all data in this shard      i guess the elasticsearch record offset first  write datas to translog file second  while offset write successful  but datas  write failure  the bug appear。     steps to reproduce    it's little probability to reproduce the bug by power cut  so i reproduce the bug by delete translog file   1  kill elasticsearch

to many ocs share api calls  endless loop    i use the latest owncloud android app  1 5 4    today i discovered that the battery of my mobile phone discharged quite fast  after looking at the battery settings i saw that 55  of the battery power was used by the owncloud client  i disabled the android client for the rest of the day and enabled it at the evening again  immediately it starts to connect to the owncloud server again and starts loading   i looked at the access log of the owncloud server and discovered that the android clients sends a lot of requests to the server  like     it seems that it sends this request for every single file in my owncloud  this can take really long and consume a lot of battery power for users with a lot of files   i wonder why we don't send this requests only on demand for the files folder we need the information   edit  after a few hours i even see repeated requests in my log  it seems that there is an endless loop sending this api calls 
"there are unsaved changes" sometimes shows up without changes   sometime the dialog "there are unsaved changes" shows up  even though there are no changes    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 15231595 24756011 92b784b0 1adc 11e7 8540 5ec9201db07c png   it's not clear to me what you have to do to run into this bug  the same actions sometimes cause the dialog to show but not always    the only reliable way i was able to reproduce this bug is by changing the env while the site is still loading  the easiest way to achieve this is to keep clicking on an env while the site is loading till the dialog shows up  it seams to happen more frequently on apps that have a lot of properties and relations   it startet to happen in the 1 12 2 release  in 1 12 1 it worked fine  i tested with chrome

keyboard shortcut to add #' for multiple lines of code   in rstudio  on windows 10  using version 1 2 1335   i can use ctl+shift+c to add or remove commenting for multiple lines of code  i also realized i can use the same keyboard shortcut to remove the documentation indicator  #'    but there is no shortcut that i could find to add it back in   pressing ctl+shift+c predictably adds  #    if it doesn't already exist  a shortcut key for adding  #'  to the start of all highlighted lines would be helpful   in particular  i want to use this so i can remove  #'  for the start of each line for some examples for an r function to see the syntax highlighting while editing  and then add the  #'  back in after i am done  i am sure there are other cases when editing documentation  or creating new documentation  that this shortcut could be useful

requests for static resources trigger a security error during mime type detection     framework version  1 3   implementations  spring boot  ## scenario hosting static resources  e g  css or js files  from a  static folder on the classpath   ## expected behavior the static file is served by the service  ## actual behavior requests for paths with extensions causes  getmimetype  to be called on the  awsservletcontext  class  this in turn calls  securityutils getvalidfilepath string     the string input to  getmimetype  is treated as a relative path  which fails the security check   my understanding is that spring is passing in the request path rather than it's true location  possibly embedded inside a jar file  or non existent in the case of api endpoints   prefixing non absolute paths with  " tmp "  allows the content type to be correctly probed  although the file does not exist at that path   issue #158 resolves a similar problem with the rest container mappings by disabling extension based mime type detection and avoiding this call completely  but static resources are requested by a different route and not affected by the fix in that issue  additionally  it is desirable for the mime type detection to work as expected for static files  rather than disabling it   ## steps to reproduce request a static resource with a file extension  or a rest path which appears to have a file extension  as per #158   ## full log output

job freezes after first component placed when no tapefeeder specified    first trial run setup on my machine consisted of movable head  vacuum source and a small set of 0805 parts from a cut tape  the cut tape was defined as a tray of 10x1 parts   first part placement consisted of the head moving to the part  lowering the nozzle to the correct height  activating the vacuum  lifting the part out of the tape  moving to the destination  lowering the part and switching the vacuum off  at this point the program was expected to lift the nozzle and move the head to the next part in the cut tape  this did not happen   i thought that maybe since tape feeders are expected to be used then perhaps one needs to be defined   i added a reference tape feeder and added actuator a1 to it    the clue was in machine xml which listed the actuator  but not a tapefeeder   now the machine picks and places all parts in the job bom even though no tapefeeder nor actuator is present on the machine

views broken with concurrent update and delete   hi guys      we've spent about a week and a half with a very annoying issue with this library   we moved our server from couchdb to sync server to resolve it  finding other issues like https   github com couchbase sync_gateway issues 1505 in the meantime    and changed out server logic a few times  and watched the change feeds  but the bug still persists and is quite annoying   now we have clearly tracked it down to the java couchbase lite library   this is what we do    we have an document shared on multiple devices and our server   base revision 1 x    we have a view function on the client to show all docs of type x  it displays this document    the two devices make changes and sync them concurrently  either very good timing  or taking one device offline  editing  then bringing it back online      we now have a conflict between versions 2 a and 2 b on the server    so far the view looks good and shows the same  arbitrary  revision on both clients   view updated well    now  we run a conflict resolution script that marks 2 a as deleted  3 c  and updates 2 b with the merged data  3 d    both these changes are synced in the same _changes query to the couchbase lite client and processed in one batch   if rev of 3 d   rev of 3 c  everything works fine and we see the merged object in the view   if rev of 3 d   rev of 3 c  the object is considered deleted on the client  and disappears from the view     this is the problem  more details    all data looks proper on the server   also  if we restart the app  the document is still missing from the view  i guess this is not updated again     the custom view function for the view is never triggered by the last update  for either document rev 3 c or 3 d    we have some log messages there and nothing happens in this case    if we wipe the local db clean  and resync from the server  the document will appear correctly  i guess we trigger different client logic     if we pull out the sqllite store from the client  even with a broken state  and look at the revision table  we see both rev 3 c and 3 d marked as current  and 3 c as deleted  which is proper   if we look at the maps_n table for this view  it is empty  the document is not there   looking at winningrevidofdocnumericid  sqlitestore java 1971   the query there will calculate the correct winning revision from the data store   currently we trigger this only on the server  but i doubt it would be much different if the conflict resolution occurred on a client   the main point is that one branch is deleted and the second updated in the same batch  and it leave the client in a broken state   given that the main use case for couchbase is the conflict resolution  offline sync   and i figure we are doing a typical form of conflict resolution  update one branch  delete the other   i am quite surprised that this issue hasn't popped up earlier  and seems quite critical to our use case   currently  two developers have spent an entire week on the client and server hunting this issue  and this unreliability is threatening to block the adoption of offline sync by our company  which is annoying  as in theory this software matches our use case perfectly   please let me know if you need any more help to reproduce this bug

nullpointerexception is thrown during cache deletion   we encountered an issue during deleting cache while using redissonkeys delete after upgrade redisson from 2 2 16 to 2 3 0  i have verified same issue with latest version 2 10 1 as well as 3 5 0  my unit test was very simple  the main thread keeps deleting 40 keys while another thread keeps setting the same   i am very curious why 2 2 16 does not have this issue  the only change i could find related to this is "switched from io netty util concurrent future to org redisson api rfuture"   well also surprisingly i could not find any same

major bug  groupby aggregates incorrect ranges   assume your data begins at time 17 48 and is stored every minute   you give groupby an interval begining at 17 46  with a granularity of 3 mins   you should get data with timestamps    17 46   17 49   17 52     etc    however  you get    17 48   17 51   17 54  this is _not_ the data that was asked for  the interval returned should be the one in the former list    there is currently no workaround for this bug either  if you want data aggregated and looking like the former list  there is no way to ask druid for it  _update_    while there is a _origin_ option in granularity  it doesnt actually work since it always makes the realtime node throw an exception  thereby the broker returns a 500      i am using druid 0 6 121

android 6 0  logging stops after period of inactivity   first of all  thank you for your awesome app  i've been using it non stop for over a year   i'm afraid i have another task killer bug for you  recently i upgraded to android 6 0  cm 13  and over night gpslogger suddenly stops logging  and i have to start it manually again  this happens every night  looks like it is related to the new doze mode in 6 0  here are a few infos    notification is enabled and it stays  but only showing "gpslogger is running"   location mode is set to "high accuracy"   i've disabled android 6 0 battery optimization by setting the app to "not optimized"   my device is plugged in and charging the whole time   ram is averaging around 1 5 of 2 gb   the debug log shows that the logging stops almost exactly 1 hour after i last used my device  every time   addendum  i'm currently testing it further  it's strange  looks like it happens _only_ when charging   if i leave my phone unplugged for the night  it still works as expected   debug log excerpt  last logging attempt + manual restart in the morning  
the client is lagging   probably the only problem is my end  all i'm currently in possession of is a very crappy laptop  no time to really play anything anyway  wanted to catch up for when mobile comes out  saw your client pop up  it looked super nice and clean  said it was lightweight too  so i wanted to try it out  it's laggy  even with all plugins off  though i can run the original client perfectly well and osb runs almost good with half the plugins enabled  am i doing something wrong or maybe something can be tweaked  i apologize if this does sound dumb  as i'm the one with a crappy laptop and an upgrade would fix everything  but i can't justify buying anything of that sort at the moment

springsecurityresolvedaccountfilter performs a costly authentication on every request   while the purpose of springsecurityresolvedaccountfilter is clear to me  i have a feeling it should not produce a new authentication every time it runs  each authentication means reading the groups the user is member of  and this is very costly as collections are not  yet  cached   i think the springsecurityresolvedaccountfilter should check if the current authentication  the user href inside the userdetails  matches the account resolved from request  probably from cookie param   only if the authentication in the context does not match  or does not exist  a new authentication should be performed   i've modified the filter to meet those needs and it works quite good  eliminating the communication to stormpath on every possible request  the performance gains are very noticable  esp  where there are a lot of resources to load  css  js  images

a possible problem with the code generator    i am performing an empty transformation with soot on the com walmart android apk file taken from googleplay  after the transformation  the exception below appears in the log  this does not happen for the original apk    the method that throws the exception is pojopropertiescollector _sortproperties  its original source code and the decompiled code from the apk produced by soot are given below  there is a suspicious casting of locallinkedhashmap1 to treemap  which neither exists in the original source nor in its decompiled version from the original apk  the issue is also consistent with the exception in logcat    as a side question  it seems that when alpha  null  alpha   false and _config shouldsortpropertiesalphabetically   returns true  the value of sort might be incorrectly set to true instead of false  why is that   thank you in advance for looking into that  regards  julia                      logcat                 w system err  2437

dependency bug combining jadira usertype core with spring boot starter jpa   i spent a couple of hours today trying to resolve a very nasty dependency bug combining spring boot starter jpa with jadira usertype core to automatically convert datetime objects in the hibernate layer for persistence  dependencies in my pom  excerpt  were as follows     the problem is caused by incompatibilities between the versions of the hibernate entity manager required by the different libraries  attempting to resolve the problem by importing up to date version of the hibernate core and excluding that in other dependencies results in problems elsewhere   jadira usertype core is a standard approach to convert custom types for persistence   it would be really good if this worked out of the box in future releases  for the time being i solved the problem in my project by writing a custom converter   you can check out the issue directly by pulling the following project   https   github com alastairknowles commentrelational  url  and adding the problematic dependency  org jadira usertype to the pom  then just run the integration test  commentservicetest java

cannot use variable in zest script as part of post url   i've recorded an authentication script  and now i'm trying to get it to work repeatedly  the main issue is posting a form to its action url   the login page request returns html along the lines of     lt header gt   lt h1 gt sign in to application lt  h1 gt   lt  header gt   lt form action " mysecurityservice login key dhsja9jaaadsjaiidd2016 09 06t15 253a45 253a14z" method "post" role "form" gt      lt input id "username" name "username" type "text" value ""   gt      lt input id "password" name "password" type "password" value ""   gt    etc     the key of the url in the form action changes for every request  and is not re usable  so i can't just replay the script i recorded   i can extract the form's action url into a variable using "assign variable via string delimiters"  but am unable to use that variable to then post the form to that url  if i try to change the url on the request post action  those changes get ignored  and reverts to the url in the original recording  the variable is not used in the script source either  so it doesn't appear to be an ui issue    so for example  i edit the post request  and set the url to use the variable myformposturl e g     http   10 1 1 1  myformposturl     when i save it reverts to its previous value  the one originally recorded    the change does appear to get reflected in the script   urltoken does contain the url as entered  including the variable name   see also forum post   https   groups google com forum # topic zaproxy users ezk1tzliuym  url

brush rail bug causing background error unlimited refresh   i'm running      minecraft  1 12 2     spongeapi  7 1 0 0abc85a72     sponge  1 12 2 7 1 7 snapshot     spongeforge  1 12 2 2838 7 1 7 rc3880     minecraft forge  14 23 5 2838     jvm  1 8 0_201 64 bit  oracle corporation      os  windows server 2019  when a player tries to use a piston to move a track to an empty square with another track next to the empty square  multiple tracks will fall  and the console will report an error  which will not be logged  then when players cooperate with some of the module's automated placement pickup devices and cycle through them  the console will keep reporting errors that are difficult to use  even if it is not automated  players can brush the rails indefinitely by right clicking the mouse  causing the console to keep reporting errors   in addition  this problem seems to lead to the probability that the game thread is stuck in the background  and the player will disconnect  but the server can still be searched  and the server will show that the player is online  even if the plug in is automatically restarted  there will be no response  it is not 100  certain at the moment  but when the rail brush machine is turned off  there has never been any jam phenomenon   当玩家试图使用活塞将一个轨道移动到一个空的方块上，而在这个空方块旁边存在另外一个铁轨，就会掉落多个铁轨，同时后台报错，并且这个报错不会被记入日志。 然后，当玩家使用一些模组的自动放置 拾取设备的设备并循环使用这些设备时，控制台将不断地报错，并难以使用。 即使不是自动的，玩家也可以通过右键鼠标无限刷铁轨，从而导致控制台不断报告错误  而且这个问题貌似会导致后台出现概率游戏线程卡死，玩家将断开连接，但是依旧可以搜寻到服务器，服务器会显示玩家在线，即使是自动重启插件工作，也无反应。 暂时不能100 确定，但是在刷铁轨机器关闭的时，从来没有出现过卡死现象

doesn't work on samsung galaxy note 4  and probably note 3    hi   it seems that the samsung browser  "com sec android app sbrowser"  on the galaxy note 4 and probably also the galaxy note 3 does not return to the app after the user has clicked the "allow" button in the google login web page  instead it just loads "www google com"  which is the fallback if the app cannot be started as far as i know  so the app does not get any login information and cannot proceed with the authentication   a workaround is to ignore that browser so that google chrome is used instead  e g  this code has fixed the issue for me     however it would be good if it would work "out of the box"  i e  if the appauth library could handle  blacklist   this by itself  i have found functions to blacklist certain versions of a browser in appauth but it seems that it doesn't blacklist any browsers by itself   what do you think  should appauth blacklist this automatically  samsung probably won't fix these old devices any more   kind regards  dominique

a child springapplication can cause springapplicationadmin mbean to indicate that the application is ready when it's not   sts boot dash uses the lifecycle jmx admin bean  i e by passing vm arg  dspring application admin enabled true"  to determine   a  when a app is 'ready'  b  determine server port and managment port   the problem is this  sometimes the app passes the 'ready' check  yet aparantly the port s  are not yet set   this creates a race condition for sts  see https   www pivotaltracker com story show 125728671  because sts waits until the app is 'ready' and then tries to determine the port its running on  but because of the slight delay    this means sts sometimes gets 'unknown'  actually 'null'    i've addressed it on our end by adding a wait loop that polls the port after app enters ready state   i'm not sure its really a bug  but it seems like one to me because     i'd assume that 'ready' state for the app means it is fully started and is in fact ready to respond to requests on its port  if so then i would also expect that asking the app what the port is  should already work   i mean why else is there a 'ready' state if it doesn't actually mean the app is truly 'ready'   anyhoo    if you do not think its a real bug or not worth fixing  that is fine  but i thought i'd at least report it and let you decide what to do about it  if anything     further useful info  i'm not sure this affects all versions of boot  i have seen strange test failures in our ci builds that _might_ be attributed to this  so also boot 1 3 x   but i only recently found a reliable way to reproduce and debug  and fix  it with a set of apps that i can only run properly when using boot 1 4 build snapshot  in other words i have only really been able to observe the problem with boot 1 4

decorator based controller doesn't comply liskov substitution principle implemented by hibernate   when the springmvc raml plugin is initialized with the rule  'com phoenixnap oss ramlapisync generation rules spring4controllerdecoratorrule' the mvc rest controller is implemented by    an interface controller     a decorator that is composed by a controller   note  the decorator implements the interface controller   because the decorator methods are annotated adding restrictions on their arguments and the overridden methods of the interface are not annotated  the decorator is not compliant with liskov substitution principle   the issue is that from the version    1 5 x of springboot  hibernate validates the bean against this principle and generates the error ‘hibernate validator   hv000151’ for our decorator that prevents the service to process requests   a solution would be to remove the overriding link between the decorator and the interface controller  not sure this link is really relevant    _what do you think about this issue _  note  there is a workaround that consists to disable the hibernate validation but it is not really recommended

new stuff and bugs   when i am reading through the mcforums   replying and helping people  i often see them making bug reports or adding new features  so i though why not put them all in here so people can see   new feature  a level editor    http   i40 tinypic com ustox jpg http   i39 tinypic com 9qxkb6 jpg http   i41 tinypic com ifvfjr jpg  this looks pretty awesome to me  i think this should be implemented in the titlescreen in some way   quote not sure if this has been suggested already  but what about adding new characters with different attacks  these attacks wouldn't be better than the default attack  just different  and some might be even weaker or harder to control  the idea is just to add some variety to combat   perhaps a new pair of characters  one british and one german  could be added for each of these weapons   sword   short range melee attack but very powerful    dagger   short range melee attack no stronger than the gun  a direct nerf for extra challenge   boomerang   weapon flies out and back to you instantly destroying all enemies it hits  but you can't shoot it again until it returns and it travels fairly slow   elephant gun   slow weapon that can penetrate through multiple enemies  etc   perhaps these additional characters could be unlocked by playing through a single player campaign  quote  regular hexadron  suggested this  i get his point and it's pretty cool   holy    wow  just an hour and a half later  and the game has changed so much  some more suggestions  of course  the help file needs serious updating  first  it still has all the old costs  even though in game  they only cost half  second  it needs to list the upgrading costs  third  the bombs still say they destroy gemmed walls  even though they now destroy cracked walls  when you level up the collectors  it didn't seem to do anything  and i can only assume that means it increases carrying capacity  honestly  i would rather have it increase range of suckability  even if carrying capacity stays the same  i assume the carrying capacity is still 1500  when carrying an item near the top of walls  the top of the wall overlaps the item  this may not be fixable  as i know its to give the appearance of walking behind the walls when you're behind them  still  if you could clear it up  that would be awesome  jenkins is hard to navigate  when i was downloading the latest build  i wasn't sure what i was downloading  a big  bold permalink on the front page would be very nice  not only for me  but for casual gamers who just want to download the game and play  rather than navigate jenkins for half an hour  i exaggerate  of course   waitwhatyoucanpickupthesarcophagi   this should definitely be in the help file   and there we go  more calc homework  danori  they better implement the new panel  because it's pwn  irvin  can't wait for the level editor  also  if i'm just annoying rather than helpful  which is my intent    to be helpful  i mean  then tell me  don't want to be annoying anyone    gidaio had these ideas  also pretty cool   i think most of the things i posted here and now should be put open for discussions and the bug reports in there should be fixed

eclipse doesn't find step definitions in jar files   i understand this feature was added previously  but it is not working for me today   i am running spring tool suite 4 version 4 2 1 release build id  201904170946  i had previously installed eclipse cucumber via the update site  but now that it is available in the marketplace  i uninstalled it and re installed via the marketplace  it was the same version anyway   i started with the step definitions in the same project  i then packaged them in a  jar file and added them to the classpath in another project  but that new project does not find the step definitions   i have confirmed  referenced libraries    library name    package  that it is on the classpath   i have tried adding the specific package name to the window    preferences    cucumber    plugin settings under "only match steps from specific package and sub packages"   i have a simple junit class that _does_ find the steps and runs fine   it is only when i'm editing a  feature file or trying to execute scenarios from the editor that it fails   i noticed that if i exclude the  glue       option in the junit class that it fails there as well

java memory leak during use of the message log   when the 'message log' pane is used  the java process is continuesly increasing it's memory usage  especially when the logging is set to 'trace'  in my case initially the java process takes around 800mb of memory and when running tests for half an hour with trace logging  i end up with 9 2gb  also when you run a next set of tests  the memory is not cleared  it seems that 'message log' and 'console' pane data is sent to memory  when to log is set to 'error' only a small increase of memory is found   only a restart of eclipse is setting back the memory usage to 800mb  running from console does not have these issues  since the java process is not used  found with java version 8  ubuntu16 04  eclipse oxygen and red 8 0

some album titles are bugged out in the library   so i just transfered some music to my device and for some reason there's a couple albums in my library where phonograph just parses the name of the album incorrectly   now this wouldn't be a huge deal if the whole album was affected  but the weirdest thing is that only a couple of tracks are   even more weird than that is the fact that when i got to the tag editor  the name of the album is 100  correct  so i can't even fix anything   example   here  https   i imgur com qaxgw0h png 's the incorrect one and the corresponding  correct one  https   i imgur com ovxxz6s png   the mp3 tags attached the files in both of these albums all display the name of the album on the right   see here  https   i imgur com vsfzlgu png    but when it displays in my library it's bugged out  and so i have two separate albums when i should really only have one  this seems to only occur on some particular tracks as well  so maybe it's related to the song title having certain special characters   i checked in other players and the names of the albums are all fine   example with poweramp  https   i imgur com uysmhrr png    only phonograph has this issue  this kind of bums me out as i just paid for the pro version of phonograph yesterday and my library can't be sorted properly

error dispatch can cause two sessions to be created   # updated description  after further feedback from  tsachev the issue is reproduced    initially there is no session created on the server and no session cookies in the browser    the controller servlet creates a new session and sets an attribute  then throw an exception   the error is handled and the sessionrepositoryfilter is invoked on the error dispatch  this happens because the wrapped request that is caching the current session is not there anymore  it is a new httpservletrequest object that is no longer wrapped  instead  we should save the  httpsessionwrapper currentsession  in a  httpservletrequest  attribute  # original description  if a request creates a new session and then forwards   requestdispatcher forward     to another servlet view which tries to update the session   two session are created   if sessionrepositoryfilter is registered for  disptchertype forward    two spring sessions are created  if sessionrepositoryfilter is not registered for  disptchertype forward    one spring session is created and one tomcat session   i can see that two  set cooke  headers are sent to the browser

exception when concurrent threads are trying to build the same mapper   ciao alessandro   i noticed this exception when 2 threads are trying to build the same mapper and no mapper are available on cache  eg  app just started        when the mapper is available in cache  no exceptions are rised   eg  a second call of the same function  even from concurrent threads   maybe this behavior is simply "working as intended"  i solved this "non problem" by triggering mappers caching at app  start   btw  the chance that concurrent threads trigger the build of same mapper  in general  is very low        personal note    grazie per questo fantastico contributo alla community  a presto

figure size in rstudio is different than in rendered output   ### system details  	rstudio edition   desktop 	rstudio version   1 3 74 	os version        macos 10 13 6 	r version         3 5 1  ### steps to reproduce the problem  create a new   rmd  file with this content     run the chunk to see the output inside rstudio   knit the document to see the output in the rendered html   ### describe the problem in detail  the size of the figure in the rstudio interface is different than the size in the rendered output   i spent time trying to adjust the  fig width  and  fig height  so the figure looks good when i run the chunk in rstudio   it turns out my time is wasted because the rendered output does not use the same figure size as the figured in rstudio  see screenshot below    ### questions     how are users supposed to size their figures properly     are we meant to re knit the file each time we tweak the  fig width  and  fig height  parameters       if so  notice that the user must ignore the output as shown in rstudio while tweaking chunk options  since they will never share rstudio output with others and it is not representative of the knitted output     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 209714 55044514 fd3f6580 5010 11e9 969d 25db07b002eb png

warn for assignment in if   upon compilation   i often see students write  if  x   y   when they mean  if  x    y    an understandable error  even a prof of c++ taking one of my intro classes made this same mistake in his code and wasn't able to see it   apparently  gcc  can be made to warn of assignments in  if  tests  by using the   wparentheses  flag at compilation  the warning can be avoided by using an extra pair of parentheses to demonstrate programmer's intention  i e   if   x   y        gnu's  gcc  wparentheses  documentation   https   gcc gnu org onlinedocs gcc warning options html#index wparentheses   as many users of the arduino ide are newer programmers and unlikely to intend assignments this way  i recommend that the warning for assignments inside of  if    tests be made visible in the console

problem with apt exploring for dag in modules besides model where there currently is a dagger compiler   basically  something i've noticed  if you have a android library module with base classes for your activities or w e  you wish  there will be an issue in compiling when you subclass those base classes    so what appears to be happening    is that to be safe  the processor puts the providers in the module's namespace to be able to access package private fields and expose them publicly for the dagger components to be able to inject in their own dependency's modules  in cases of package private  inject declarations  is there a reason for this  it looks to me as you could easily write this to generate the provider factories in the dagger compiler's module if it knows that all provider methods are public     https   github com patryksplaygrounds daggerbehaviour  logs     thanks

if the server is started with 2 replicas at the same time  the replicas might not find each other   the problem is mitigated by starting just 1 replica  and then scaling it up afterwards    the reason is that the subset addresses are separated into _addresses_ and _notreadyaddresses_  as seen at http   localhost 8000 api v1 namespaces default endpoints hazelserver    the hazelcastdiscoverycontroller java#l120 could be updated to cater for this   i am sorry not to provide a pull request for this  but i am now using io fabric8 kubernetes client instead of doing the call directly  i run minikube with kubernetes 1 4 3  i submit this issue  as i suspect you would like to know about this

tick inperiod   bug    i have a lot of recorded ticks  price + volume   and sometimes a few have exactly the same timestamp   for this example  i want all my ticks to be collected within a ta4j tick instance with period 1 second   i use this code to round off my timestamp to nearest second          new_ts      ts + 500    1000     1000   i keep track of lasttick  to see if this new tick is on the same second as last  and if so  i call addtrade instead     is this the wrong way to "fix" the problem that will cause unwanted sideeffects later  is it better if i "clean" my data and concatenate all ticks to a single tick or    what  please guide me

long non nullable history and comment cards break headers   non nullable history and comment cards  really any 'comment like' cards  whose footprint exceeds the 80 character line limit  are added to the header as is  producing longer than 80 character lines  and thus breaching the header format requirement   the resulting headers become unreadable for most  if not all  fits tools    the expected behavior is    long comment style cards  e g  history  comment  should either throw an appropriate exception upon creation  for non nullable cards   or else get truncated at the 80 character limit  for nullable cards   when the long keyword convention is not enabled used    when the long keyword convention is enabled  long non nullable comment style entries  e g  history  comment  should be wrapped using continue keys  just like regular keywords   a fix to that end will also need to make sure that continue keys are properly parsed for comment style cards when reading a header    at the root of the issue is that only long card 'values' are wrapped using the ogip 1 0 convention  but that history and comment entries have no 'value'  null   but only a 'comment' field  the quick patch  for writing  may be to treat the  non nullable  comment fields in comment like cards just the same as values  but not for regular keys       perhaps  the better long term fix would be that comment style keys carry their content as 'value' rather than the optional  and always truncatable  'comment'  and are distinguished from regular keywords via a boolean flag  e g  headercard value null     headercard iscomment true   this could make formatting a little more regular     a workaround  until the issue is fixed  is that the user must take care not to create history or comment cards with content longer than 72 characters      attila

hangup when inserting signature   today i had the same problem twice with nb29 09   network coverage was ok at that time  while logging a cache i selected "insert signature"  the selection window got stuck and i had to force close it  after that  c geo returned to mainscreen but had problems with the network connectivity in general  could not load caches  etc  i needed to close and open and it was working normal until the next try of inserting signature   my signature is using  the  number  string   attached the log  hope it fits  i cutted it   '405aa998 sorry   server ' 10 02 18 58 15 079 i

crash when saving "noname" file from email   i subscribe to a lot of mailing lists  and k 9 doesn't seem to like them   i've been able to reproduce a crash by opening what should be an ordinary email  and instead of seeing the text  there is a "noname" attachment  trying to open it with an application  as far as i can tell  sends no data to the application in question  attempting to save the file causes k 9 to crash  i've included a gif to show this  the email i'm opening is  here  https   lists debian org debian mate 2018 04 msg00018 html    and i've also included some output i got from my first time using  adb      crash  https   user images githubusercontent com 8465972 38395758 8b857d7e 3902 11e8 8809 8ba0ce61f1e3 gif     i've been having this issue for a while now  probably with several different versions  but right now  i'm on k 9 mail 5 503 and android 7 0   and by the way  even though this is on a mailing list  i have openpgp encryption enabled with my email provider  they'll use my public key to encrypt emails that aren't encrypted already   so it is encrypted with pgp mime  i don't think that has anything to do with it  but that's just a disclaimer  the email decrypts and displays fine in thunderbird + enigmail

 feature  add option to deactivate the playerupdatetask   as mentioned in a few issues the playerupdatetask seems to cause lag   we also encountered this problem on our server with  100 npc's and no patroling etc  going on   therefore i made a custom version of citizens without the playerupdate task  as our npc's are just standing there and wait to be clicked it didn't seem to make much of a difference  but improved our performance hugely    since more users are reporting problems it would surely be nice to have just a config option to disable it if needed    also what features aren't working without the task  i didn't have time to test it out fully

fr  retry failed camera uploads   a user review on googleplaystore requested a feature   "image upload still does not work reliably  not in 2 6 and is actually my most important feature  as far as i was happy  everything worked as it should   i was actually satisfied so far  everything worked as it should  now i've had the problem for a long time that the photo upload to the instantupload directory always fails  especially because then simply ceases to upload the images  which is very unreliable  as if the trigger is lost in the system  samsung s6 edge and now samsung s8   it would be ok if a second attempt would be made later to upload the picture again  but here this breaks completely away  so that not all my photos arrive in the instantupload "  could this be implemented into the app

long write operations does not seem to work correctly   ### summary  i tested the new long write operation commit that has been pushed recently  tried it in my application and it crashes after the second "long" write operation   let me explain a little more my use case  i'm currently sending a rather big file to a ble device  the file is a firmware in  intel hex forma  https   en wikipedia org wiki intel_hex   from the defined application exchange protocol  i'm iterating through each line  wrap the line in a application packet format  starts and ends with a predefined byte value   chunk that into multiple packets  20 bytes  and write them one by one to the device by using  writecharacteristic   the callback is then used to trigger the next packet once a line has been fully written  i start sending the next one   i wanted to test the new long operation as it greatly reduce amount of operation on the queue since a full line using long write operation would used a single operation on the radio queue   i tried it with the following code     where  mpacketwriter  is a custom chunker that creates all the chunks to write and then  concatmap  them using the  mbleconnection writecharacteristic  observable as the "synchronization" point

quarkus startup time is 2x or more slower on slow networks   we had several reports of people on non controlled networks like at conferences where quarkus startup time was very slow  2x or much more  i experienced it myself a few times and ended up disabling network on stage   i think the problem is a jvm issue or one of our framework network stack   there is a famous slow down of the jvm on macos if people don't have a local resolution rul in their  etc hosts     but even with that  i see startup time going from  5 to 1s on conference networks  it would be good to get a openjdk+perf+quarkus+resteasy team to investigate that and find the bottom of this problem  cc  stuartwdouglas  dmlloyd  n1hility  stalep

enhancement request  there should be no need to click on the "update" button in the "import text data" window when it is activated from the "file panel"   when clicking on a  csv file in the file panel and subsequently selecting the   import dataset      option  the   import text data   window pops up  which is great  however  it will then be needed to click on the   update   button at the top right corner of the window to have the   code preview   section completed and have a preview of the data shown  the last click on the   update   button seems to be redundant in the above scenario    ps  i think in the previous versions of rstudio there was no need to click the   update   button in the above scenario   thank you for looking into this

confirmed expert mode   i'm still using xprivacy 2 0 25  cuz from version 2 0 30 something the so called dangerous functions have to be ticked manually  which means that when i upgrade to a new xprivacy version it messes all my restrictions by unticking all the dangerous functions  and leaves me alone to clean the mess and retick all those restrictions  i tried to import from a backup but no dice  the "dangerous" functions still have to be ticked manually  not very convenient  to say the least  moreover that i don't remember all what is restricted on all apps and would need to test again  specially with the system apps    another problem is that when i install a new app those functions are not disabled  eventhough they are ticked in my template   which means that my phone is unprotected until i do the job manually  in my template everything is disabled cuz that's the best way to prevent privacy leaks  but what's the point if it's not applied    could you implement a kind of expert or confirmed expert or whatever mode  for people that know what they are doing  where those perms don't need to be set manually and where xprivacy doesn't mess with the existing restrictions  i have been on xprivacy since the days of version 0 30 and i allways restricted most of those perms  my phone never exploded    at the worst i get a bootloop  so what  i enter recovery and fix it in two minutes from my file manager  that's not rocket science    thanks in advance

alias with filter is not reliable   i am using elasticsearch 1 4 4 and i want to create a filtered alias   the index contains 3 types a  b and c  b and c are children to a  the filter extracts from the index all the types applying some conditions for one of the types  let set it's a  the filter contains a nested and a has_child filter  the alias gets created and works fine until i try to update the filter  i need to update the filter because  some entities are soft deleted  but the alias should not return them  in this case the filter changes to something like extract all documents with type a where b deleted date   some date   after i update the filter and try to query for a with a simple search it sometimes return all a  applying the filter  and sometimes it returns only some of the documents  excluding others that should be returned  this happens on consecutive queries sent seconds apart  do you have any ideas on what happens  would it be helpful to post the filter   the filter works fine if not used in the alias context

schedulewithfixeddelay should have an option to disable it during unit tests   right now   schedulewithfixeddelay  is run both in main and in test classes  it is sometimes desirable to run it in test classes the same way as in real ones  but during testing of the class annotated with it might cause problems  one cannot have two tests that create instances of given class because it  correctly  throws exception   my initial idea is to add another annotation that can be used to mark given constructor that will disable the scheduled execution  but that creates artificial constructors and pollutes the code  so i don't have an idea right now how to solve this

queryidgenerator stuck in unrecoverable state due to non transactional execution of a statement      describe the bug   this happens because when we execute a statement in  interactivestatementexecutor   we get to building the physical plan  the first action is to get the  queryid  from the  queryidgenerator   create the kafka streams app  then set the next queryid in  interactivestatementexecutor   if the kafka streams app creation exceptions out  then the queryidgenerator won't have a next id set and will be in an unrecoverable state until the server is restarted     to reproduce   create a query that will fail when creating the kafkastreams app   for example  set the monitoring interceptor configs for consumers and producers created by ksql as part of executing a query  but the jar file can't be found      expected behavior   we should be able to retry and attempt execution of the statement successfully     actual behaviour   we fail to execute the statement due to the queryidgenerator not having any available id set  the ksql logs gets spammed with this error      additional context   this isn't a problem in 0 8 0 and onwards because the queryid will be stored in the plans that are in the command topic

rlock performance issue   hi  i am using reddison rlock with a cluster setup   and sometimes i see latency  up to 1000ms   when trying to acquire the lock or unlock  i saw this issue opened by zhxjouc   https   github com mrniko redisson issues 455  with a similar problem  and i am working with 2 2 13 but i am still getting latency when a thread is trying  lock a key  my code is running with java thread pool for accessing redis  i notice that if i work with pool of size 1 2 almost no latency when getting the lock  but working with 30 50 threads cause the lock delay  it could be thread overhead issue but i think that 1000ms is too long for that  any help on how can i get better performance when locking an unlocking    thanks

list of bugs   non implemented features   here is a long list of bugs   non implemented features  you probably already know some of the things here but it's to be used as a reference for anyone  including me  to know what needs doing   ### blocks    x  swords don't prevent breaking blocks in creative    x  when destroyed  all the blocks i tested drop themselves        plants can be placed on top of each other       block gravity isnt implemented    x  lily pads can be placed on the ground and cant be broken       vines can be placed on top of any block but become invisible       rotation

doesn't make obsidian  it replacing the water block       nether portals arent implemented  these can be implemented without the nether because they still look cool        end portals arent implemented  these can be implemented without the end because they still look cool        using flint and steel  light a liquid block on fire and it replaces the liquid with the fire block       flint

 can't break slime blocks in survival    x  hoes   shovels don't create tilled dirt   grass path          doesn't make a sound        breaking chests in creative doesn't drop contents       enderchests act as normal chests and don't share contents like they should       can't fill cauldrons with water         cant dye the water colour       can't empty cauldrons  well we cant fill them sooo        can't place redstone dust and redstone is not implemented    x  enchanting tables arent implemented       anvils arent implemented       beacons arent implemented       brewing stands arent implemented       lapis lazuli isnt implemented     x  barriers arent implemented        command blocks arent implemented       not all ores give xp  i think they are supposed to at least        breaking leaves does not drop saplings  ### entities   player       hunger depletes too fast       mobs just aren't implemented at all       can't place painting and item frames don't stay on the side of the block       splash potions don't work       projectiles don't work except for arrows       an arrow is required to fire a bow in creative  it shouldn't        fireworks don't propel an elytra forward       can't fit through one block gaps with elytra       bottle o' enchanting doesn't make a glass break sound when thrown       no xp pickup sound       minecarts dont work    x  swimming isn't implemented          exhaustion from swimming       you can catch fire in creative  and it takes the same amount of time to go out as in survival        dropped items   projectiles fall kinda weirdly       arrows seem slightly laggy when in the air  ### other       adventure mode is not fully implemented it seems       ut3 query is not implemented       resource packs   behaviour packs arent implemented        oxygen bar when underwater in creative shows         player inventory isn't saved when leaving the server       can't sleep in a bed    x  i see everyone else wearing my skin sometimes  i think it's when i join the server and there are already players online because it displays their skin if they joined after me    x  player list doesn't seem to show all players  i think it only shows players that join after you and not ones already online       postfixes for commands dont work       barely any commands are implemented    x  no join   leave messages       no colours in console and i think it should be an option  as well as a less shitty console format like seriously        player chat is not displayed in console  maybe this should be optional    ### world       trees do not grow  as far as i can tell        gamerules arent implemented   if they are  its just we cant access them because the command doesnt exist        no day   night cycle       placing water

mediadriver unaligned 8 byte access in statusmessageflyweight   i  have encountered a repeatable jvm crash issue when starting the mediadriver on a solaris 10   sparc9 box   this appears to be due to an unaligned write in an unsafebuffer made by the statusmessageflyweight   i have reproduced this with aeron 1 2 5 and 1 3 0   to diagnose i ran with the  javaagent agrona agent 0 9 6 jar as per the wiki and it returns the following  on windows 7 x64 and solaris 10 sparc9       is this something that can be looked at and resolved in the flyweight     i appreciate this target platform is unusual but in this instance i have a requirement to deploy a new server to legacy kit running solaris 10 sparc9 architecture for a transient period   more generally should we consider sparc solaris as a platform generically supported if run with a 1 8 jvm but not specifically verified

retry time for accuracy filter absolute timeout problems   hi i'm using gps logger to log gps coordinates to my own server  this process works great   i have set accuracy filter to 3m for not logging inaccurate gps positions  many times i see the app dropping points because it "says"  activity log screen  that accuracy has timed out  sometimes it happens right at the start of gps logging process  most of the times it's random during logging  but just after a couple of seconds after trying to get gps position   i still receive many gps positions on my server  but also many are dropped supposedly because accuracy has timed out  i tried increasing values  120s 480s   but watching gps logger working  log screen  i still see it dropping gps points just after a couple seconds of gps searching  shouldn't it wait for the defined timeout value  and then drop position

pathfinding is buggy   hello   there is a big issue with pathfinding in the latest versions of citizens   please watch this video   https   streamable com ky2a  this is with citizens 2 0 16  build 1308   on a 1 8 minecraft server  at the beggining  the player puts a waypoint on the ground  where he hits    we can see that the npc goes correctly to that waypoint  even if it does not chose the best course to do so  in other words  here  it's fine   now  watch this video with citizens 2 0 20  build 1420   on a 1 10 minecraft server   https   streamable com q22i  as you can see the npc simply does not recognize a correct path to go to the location and heads straight to a wall  where it stays blocked virtually forever  note that in both videos  the npc is just a npc  without any trait in particular  this issue however has major consequences with sentinel  since it makes npcs go completely nuts when trying to reach an attacker  as you can see on these videos   https   streamable com 5m83 https   streamable com xgir

migrations in multiple maven modules are incorrectly combined   i have a maven project that contains two separate modules  each of which builds a server to talk to its own database instance  if i run the flyway migrate goal in either of the modules individually  it works fine  but if i run it from the parent  usually implicitly as part of "mvn test" or some other goal  it looks like it retains knowledge of the migrations between modules   specifically  the migration in the first module maven visits works fine  or rather  it detects that there's no work to do   but then when maven moves on to the second module  i get    again  this works fine in module 2 if i run maven directly from that module   happy to provide any additional diagnostic information

bootsfaces renderers not being called   this is a follow up to issue #636 submitted by tg47  unfortunately  this issue continues to plague us  i work with tom and i have a separate bootsfaces project completely independent of his that behaves the same way  we are using payara  4 1 1 171  build 137   i am using bootsfaces 1 0 2  i am working on a completely separate set of workstations than tom  different machine  different o s  etc   and am seeing the same behavior  here is what happens   i deploy an ear to payara  in 80  of the cases everything works great  however  in about 20  of the cases  the bootsfaces components do not render  in this situation  non bootsfaces components on the page do render  such as h outputlabel  h form  etc   i can solve this problem in one of the following ways     undeploy and redeploy the application   undeploy  shut down payara  remove the osgi cache  restart payara  redeploy     undeploy  shut down payara  remove the osgi cache  reboot the machine   restart payara  redeploy   note that there are no other applications running in the payara instance  just the one under test    in 100  of the cases  one of these steps will fix the problem  for this reason  i am inclined to rule out issues in the build process  if the same ear can be made to work by restarting the container  etc   it does not seem all that likely that the problem is in the way the ear is built   tom had also observed differences in how an ear with bootsfaces behaves depending on which server it is deployed to  all servers are running the same version of payara  so again this would seem to point away from build issues    i have downloaded the bootsfaces sources and have been debugging the application   our application is quite simple   here is what i am seeing   the addresourceslistener methods processevent   and islistenerforsource   methods are being called  the seems to indicate that faces is aware of the bootsfaces component library  the processevent   method successfully calls addcss    addjavascript    and addmetatags    there do not seem to be any exceptions thrown in these methods    i then put breakpoints in the containerrenderer  for b container  which wraps the jsf page  and the encodebegin   and encodeend   methods are never called  i also tried breakpoints in various other renderers  such as b panel  etc   but none are ever called  it seems that faces is skipping rendering the bootsfaces components entirely in the render response phase   it "feels" to me like some sort of race condition is occurring during deployment  once the ear deploys successfully  it runs properly forever  but in  roughly  20  of the cases  something seems to go wrong in deployment  and from that point on  faces does not seem to call any of the bootsfaces renderers during render response phase   can you think of any possible cause for this  i am not an expert in the internals of faces  so i don't know where to put a breakpoint to see where the top level faces code should be calling into the bootsfaces renderers  i can see that the render response phase is proceeding normally  and the non bootsfaces components are being rendered  i thought that the addresourceslistener would probably not be called in this situation  but it is  so faces seems to know about the existence of bootsfaces   i can see that addresourceslistener is specified as a systemeventlistener in the faces config xml file   i'm more than willing to continue to debug the situation if you can offer any suggestions as to where to look  i've noticed a few other posts alluding to the same problem  so i don't think this is an isolated instance  though it might not be very common   we think bootsfaces is terrific and would like to continue using it  but this issue makes each deployment a bit of a guessing game  any advice would be appreciated  thanks   p s  i haven't described the application in detail because i don't really think the application code is all that relevant  i have seen this behavior with just a simple jsf page with b container  etc  there are no other complicated libraries included  e g   my project does not use shiro  etc    i could probably create a simple demo application if needed  but then in   80  of the cases it will work perfectly  so i'm not sure how helpful that would be  the payara server log shows "application running on bootsfaces 1 0 2" and there are no errors or exceptions  in other words  we've tried to look for the obvious stuff first      p s s  i notice that bootsfaces uses a variety of external resources  i am not sure if these resources are retrieved asynchronously  but is it possible that if one of these resources is not retrieved quickly enough  that bootsfaces gets "stuck" in some way and is unable to render components  whatever is happening  the actual component renderers are not being called during the render response  just a thought

how to play audio with javacv    i followed the samples on github  which use   when i run the code there is an exception says that cannot convert  directshortbufferu  to  floatbuffer   i also tried  frame samples 0  array    and there is another exception  i googled and find that although this directshortbufferu extends shortbuffer but there is no method array    i tried some other ways too  but the audio quality is unsatisfying  actually very bad   any ideas on how to fix it   thanks

make webapp function properly behind a proxy pass   if the webapp service is behind a proxy and redirecting from a url with a non null path after the host  e g "www dicoogle com demo"   the application will not work because the client will resolve relative paths without taking that base path section of the url into account    search  would resolve to "www dicoogle com # search" instead of "www dicoogle com demo # search"   what would you suggest to solve this properly

autoconjugation rules are not applied to different classes  only work with one   i apologize in advance for my stupidity and poor english  i have a language that has genderspecific adjectives  for example some adjectives only apply to gender dominant  some to objective and some only to submissive  i use the newest version of polyglot  i created the classes all  dominant  dominant objective  dominant submissive  and submissive  i assigned every adjective a class  this happens  i have the form singular dominant  i have one rule and i copied ot 4 times  one applies to all  not capital all  but my created class   one to dominant  one to dominant objective  and one to dominant submissive  it is the exact same rule copied  it looks exactly the same  adjectives with all are working perfectly  they are displaying all possible forms  but words with dominant class who should display all dominant forms show nothing  the same applies to my other genders  the only one working is all  but the rules are identical  i tried changing the order of the rules  deleting all but all and copying all again then changing the class those new copies apply to  do you have any ideas what i did wrong  i am most thankful for your kindness and patience

geo fences are lost during android phone reboot   tested with allview x3 soul pro running android 6 0 and domoticz app v0 1 343   1  i set up one or more geo fences  2  i walk in and out of the geo fence perimeters and the geo fences are properly triggered and the associated switches are properly switched  3  if i kill the domoticz app the geo fences still work properly  thank god   4  if i reboot my phone  the geo fences are lost and they won't trigger anymore when i walk in and out of the geo fence perimeters  5  if i open the domoticz app after the reboot of the phone  the geo fences still won't work  6  if i go to settings    configure geofencing in the domoticz app  the geo fences are restored automatically  without actually changing anything in the geo fence settings  and start  working properly again  until the next reboot                        tested with allview x3 soul pro running android 6 0 and domoticz app v0 1 360  2104    0  mobile data on  location on  phone

reboot problem because obviously the data and location cannot eb kept on all the time  because of battery consumption and data plan reasons   b  rebooting the phone kills the geofences  c  going to the settings configure geofences section of the domoticz app seems to correctly restore the geofences  except for steps 19 and 20 where it seems that this failed too  d  one time after reboot it seemed that the geofences were restored  but they didn't actually work when walking in out of the fence                       update for version v0 1 360  2104  tested with allview x3 soul pro running android 6 0  a full update of every app on the phone has solved most of the problems described above  there is just one major geo fencing bug remaining  the geo fences are lost when the android location is turned off until the setting configure geofencing section of the domoticz app is open again  at which point the geo fences are restored  this is still a big problem  the location cannot be kept permanently on because the gps antenna drains the battery  the reboot is working fine now  the geo fences are restored on reboot

 1 12 2  some glow in the dark textures appear to be    fading out  in a way if blocks surround them  kinda hard to explain without showing an image    minecraft  1 12 2 forge  14 23 4 2708  mods  ctm mc1 12 0 3 0 15 twilightforest 1 12 2 3 7 424 universal      now    i am not sure if it's meant to be here but i noticed this after updating ctm so i figure i mention it here first   anyway    using the twilight forest mod since    as far as i know    has these blocks that have some parts of their textures that glow in the dark without any light level    however apparently with the latest ctm mod it kinda broke some of those glowing bits of the texture if blocks are surrounding them  it's perhaps easier to notice it in some screenshots        image key    left is "ctm mc1 12 0 2 3 12"  right is "ctm mc1 12 0 3 0 15" blocks from mod  "twilightforest 1 12 2 3 7 424 universal"  example image 1      https   cdn discordapp com attachments 377171551155650560 458699217196810242 twilightforestglowctmblocks png   in this image    the blocks have this glow in the dark effect which are the castle rune brick  reappearing block  castle door blocks  to name a few   if you look at the right side of the image  you can see how they glow and such  but when you look at the left side  the castle door blocks appear to be slightly faded while some of the other block don't seem to be affected  while it's not noticeable in this image it becomes more clear in this next image   example image 2      https   cdn discordapp com attachments 377171551155650560 458701514173841438 twilightforestglowctmcastledoor png   this one shows it more clearly when you surround the castle door blocks  right side of the image shows the glowing effect kinda being affected but that may be normal due to the way the lighting works however when you look at the left side of the image  it's glow effect is pretty much almost gone   it could be possible that maybe the mods that use this effect might need to update due to the changes with ctm but i figure i mention this just to see if it's ctm or something  unless there's a config in ctm that does this

stackoverflowerror when using cache asmap     hi there   from my understanding  cache asmap   wraps the cache object in a concurrentmapwrapper  in this class  the methods keyset    values   and entryset   are implemented using abstractset   the problem is that abstractset size   method was implemented as "return size  "  which recursively calls itself and crashes whenever size   is called  i believe the intent was to call concurrentmapwrapper size   instead  in which case it should be implemented as "return concurrentmapwrapper this size  "  sorry for poor formatting or w e  first time creating an issue   p s  forgot to mention  it was version 0 27 beta

link queries with implicit "and" bug   hi guys   i'm having troubles using link queries with implicit   and      based on how regular queries work i would expect this one to return contacts which have at least one email with  state    new ordinal      and    badge    red ordinal     but in my case it also returns contacts which have emails with  state    new ordinal      or    badge    red ordinal     maybe it's by design  but then i'm confused

unexpected sockettimeoutexception   using version  1 3 0 release  obtained from http   mvnrepository com artifact com squareup okhttp okhttp  stack trace     you might be thinking 'what's the problem '  nothing happened for 10s so a timeout makes sense  except for the fact that stuff is happening  only in  util readfully in  buffer  limit  firstcopycount     that's where data is actually read  successfully  but slowly  from the input stream   network   so if 30kb  realistic  are being read from the network  at 2kb s  a sockettimeoutexception will always be thrown  technically  this would be fine since the timeout is specified at 10s  however  note that only a simple readint   was called but that resulted in 30kb being read from the network   this is an issue  which i'm not yet sure whether it is due to an issue inside okhttp or due to compression  say 30kb are required to decompress the first int   importantly  there is no way to distinguish between 'no network or server not responding' and 'connection is slow' since they are governed by the same timeout  could that be added   or is there already a way to do this that i should know about    there is also another issue that revealed the issue above  on intel atom android device  thus single core  x86   on wifi  it sometimes  say 25  of time  takes 14s to read 30kb  all in util readfully  using okhttp  which leads to the sockettimeoutexception noted above   before i investigate any deeper into okhttp   is there any busy wait thread switching thread starvation that could be happening inside okhttp that could potentially cause the slowness   yes  i'm that desperate for leads

handle no internet connection better   there are several issues at hand here  the most important is with the caching of teams and events in the sqlite database  if there is no internet connection  loading either one fails very silently and marks the list as loaded  even though it isn't  so subsequent queries don't try to reload the list  the other is indicating to the user that they're using cached data if they do happen to be offline  this might take the form of a panel that slides in from the bottom and indicates that the data they are seeing may be out of date

better failure model when pvc fails during workspace creation    when starting a new workspace  if the pvc fails on the underlying infrastructure  openshift   for whatever reason  there is no immediate feedback to the user  the workspace loader spins  the mount is retried and re fails  until the operation times out  60s   and returns a generic error message  "workspace failed to start"  there are "failed to mount pv" errors reports in the openshift pod events for the workspace  but this information does not seem to propagate back up to che   i believe that we should be able to detect that a pvc failed when creating the workspace  and then inform the user that there was a problem allocating storage for the workspace

problem with turbine coolant port   when ever i unload the chunk that my turbine is in and return  the turbine starts spinning down because it is not receiving any steam from my reactor  the reactor is right up against the turbine  no pipes involved   the only way i have found to fix this is to destroy the turbine coolant ports   not the reactor's  and then replace them and reconstruct the multiblock  this solves the problem but is fairly annoying to do every time i leave the chunk  the part that confuses me is that i have two turbines and it only happens to the one  i have tried removing all the insides and facing them the other way  but no luck    2014 07 24_21 30 23  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8263141 3697324 418a8e3a 13a4 11e4 89cf a5dc4ee50baf png    2014 07 24_21 30 31  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8263141 3697325 418b7a48 13a4 11e4 8a8e fe48d4e4ee90 png    2014 07 24_21 30 45  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8263141 3697326 418c30fa 13a4 11e4 833f a89c62d4d0e1 png  some images showing the setup of both the broken and working turbine

listviewbinder throws exception when it tries to access listview   i've only seen this behavior with the main teams list  when the lists come back into the foreground and we attempt to bind new data to them  we get a ton of these exceptions  the easy solution would just be to check if the list is null before accessing it  but the real question is why is the list null in the first place  the binder should be able to hold on to the reference to the listview even when it goes into the background and then comes back into the foreground

nbttranslator and byte int arrays inconsistence   when using the nbttranslator class to convert a nbt tree with bytearraytags or intarraytags to a datacontainer  it will properly represent these as byte   or int    however  the resulting data container cannot be converted back  as the nbttranslator getbasefromobject method will only convert byte    not byte   and the same for ints   is this inconsistence intentional

virtualhost feature doesn't work with clients connecting from forge   clients who have forge installed don't get to see the special virtualhost stuff  it seems to work ok with unmodded clients and liteloader clients  but whenever i connected to a virtualhost from forge  i only got the default server message  i couldn't find this documented anywhere  but correct me if i missed something   also  this is slightly unrelated  but i couldn't seem to get the virtualhosts feature to work when connecting to an srv record  for example  if i made an srv record for _minecraft _tcp example com pointing to 25565 example net  and added an entry to the slp file for example com  i would get the default server message  not the example com virtualhost one  i figured this had something to do with the way minecraft actually pings the server and there was nothing you could do about it  so i just worked around it by pointing a subdomain like exampledotcom example net to the ip and pointing the srv record for example com to 25565 exampledotcom example net and adding a virtualhost config for exampledotcom example net instead  this workaround works alright

exposed ports should be authenticated   ### description  currently no authentication is performed in either single port mode or random ephemeral exposure mode  allowing attacker to access arbitrary services   this is a   bad idea    workspace normally contains private information   in multi port mode  a port scan can be performed and you now have access to many user's vnc  essentially allowing you to do anything with their workspace    this applies to codenvy as well  basically trashing the privacy    in single port mode  predicting workspace url is harder but still possible  the procedure is basically same   ### comparison with other providers    google cloud shell  an app engine based proxy is used for authenticating all user requests  they use kind of wildcard dns except it's single level so https is possible    cloud9  authentication is performed using cookie or something  i don't use it so i don't know the details   ### possible ways to solve    place some reverse proxy agent inside the workspace   put https   github com bitly oauth2_proxy in front of traefik  i'm not sure how we can configure the restriction

aerial interface preventing functionality of rightclick hold items   first discovered this while trying to shoot a bow  the aim animation would just continuously loop as long as the right mouse button was held down  releasing the mouse button would never actually fire the arrow  this was affecting vanilla and all modded bows i tested  this also affected the horn of the wild from botania which uses the right mouse hold to break plants in an area around the player  holding the mouse would start to play the animation and sound  but the sound would end without producing the plant break effect even though the right mouse button was never released  it also affected eating  the eating animation and sound would play  the food item would disappear from your inventory  and your hunger bar would fill  but shortly after the hunger would drop back down to the level it was before eating and you would find  if you sort your inventory with the invtweaks function  the food is still in your inventory   i dismantled my entire base trying to find the problem and realized that when i removed the aerial interface the problem went away   i can place the aerial interface and there is no problem  but once it reaches the 10 0 working pressure the right click problem comes back  breaking the interface immediately fixes it   unfortunately if i create a fresh world and attempt to reproduce the problem  i can not  everything seems to work  but i can consistently reproduce this in my main play world with the exact same mod set   some pictures  not sure if they will help   http   puu sh gbv7q a41b0c87c7 jpg http   puu sh gbvdv e065d5713b jpg  if there is any other testing i can do to help figure this out i will  providing mods versions etc   edit  after additional testing  i am even able to add a new aerial interface in the main play world and apply pressure with a creative compressor and the problem does not occur  i am stumped as to why just placing and pressurizing this particular interface causes the problem 
pattern replicator drops redstone dust if placed before supporting block    minecraft version   1 12 2  forge version  2838  mod version   1 19 14  single player or server   sp  but probably both   describe problem  what you were doing  what happened  what should have happened    i was trying to make compact machine walls using a pattern replicator and the redstone gets placed before the iron block  causing it to pop out of the air into an item    the pattern is redstone dust placed on an iron block in the miniaturization field      log file link  n a   video images gifs  direct upload or link     n a       the pattern replicator needs to not place redstone or other attached items until the supporting block has been place   if possible  an option to build from the bottom up instead of randomly would be enough   thanks

unhandled noclassdeffounderror in sourceconfigutils java  and friends      describe the bug    i am running a custom localrunner under the control of gradle  there is a problem in sourceconfigutils  validate   when the jarclassloader is used a classnotfoundexception is caught  the catch results in using the narclassloader which would succeed   but instead a  noclassdeffounderror is produced for which there is no catch and consequently the narclassloader is not used     to reproduce    it is not entirely clear to me why noclassdeffounderror is sometimes the thrown exception  the issue is that it is not an unreasonable exception to expect when a classloader is unable to find a particular class     expected behavior    the nar file does not have its sub dependancies in the top level but in the bundled dependencies  i expect it to not find the pushsource when read as a jar file and then process the file as a nar  the fact that the class is not found is as expected     operating environment        run a variant of localrunner in a gradle task    additional context    i have done some noodling around and have found that the narclassloader would have succeeded had it been used  https   github com apache pulsar blob 413aa74ed68557284d6f4502456b3bef2dbd9618 pulsar functions utils src main java org apache pulsar functions utils sourceconfigutils java#l282 l299 the following is a trivial  but repetitive  fix that has worked for  me                   try                       typearg   getsourcetype sourceclassname  jarclassloader                       classloader   jarclassloader                                     catch  classnotfoundexception e                           class not found in jar try loading as a nar and searching for the class                     if  narclassloader    null                            try                               typearg   getsourcetype sourceclassname  narclassloader                               classloader   narclassloader                            catch  classnotfoundexception e1                                throw new illegalargumentexception                                      string format "source class  s must be in class path"  sourceclassname   e1                                                   else                           throw new illegalargumentexception                                  string format "source class  s must be in class path"  sourceclassname   e                                                          catch  noclassdeffounderror e                           class not found in jar try loading as a nar and searching for the class                     if  narclassloader    null                            try                               typearg   getsourcetype sourceclassname  narclassloader                               classloader   narclassloader                            catch  classnotfoundexception e1                                throw new illegalargumentexception                                      string format "source class  s must be in class path"  sourceclassname   e1                                                   else                           throw new illegalargumentexception                                  string format "source class  s must be in class path"  sourceclassname   e                                          
catch and consume runtimeexceptions in database#postchangenotifications     i use version 1 3 1 on android with coubase lite android 1 3 1   when listening to changes through callback interface database changelistener i noticed that changes called through method database#postchangenotifications   which result in runtimeexceptions will be catched and consumed with just a log   in production handle these changes submitting it into a custom threadpoolexecutor with custom error handling   in order to test complex change listener behaviour in my app i rerouted callbacks from this executor to test thread to have synchronous calls  in my case the test threw a runtimeexception which was catched by the catch clause in following snipped     so the test was ok but when my test case occurred during real app runtime with my executor the app crashed of course because of custom exception handling in my threadpoolexecutor   sure it can be discussed if it is right or wrong to change and mock tests that far but i from my point of view you should let the runtimeexceptions come through the system and let it crash their because maybe some people rely on working change listeners and build logic on top of that  this could lead to an inconsistent state of the app which could be quite hard for developers to find

websocket message size seems to be magically capped around 6500 string length in safari   for some queries  the base64 string sent by vitrivr ng is cut at ca  6k string length when it arrives at cineast  this then leads to two issues  1  the query is not executed since the message cannot be parsed properly  2  the ws connection crashes  jetty closes it with a 1006 error  which is not helpful at all   i have not managed to triangulate the issue  none of the available config parameters from jetty fix the problem and it also does not seem to be a problem on the vitrivr ng side    this is not a clearly reproducible problem  it is most probably reproduced by drawing a small black circle    this is certainly an issue for novices  as we have neither automatic reconnect nor is it intuitive if a query is not executed   one trivial fix would be to resize the canvas before serialization in vitrivr ng from currently 450x450 to e g  200x200  this would reduce the length of the base64 string without a massive reduction in the quality of sketch input and would be very low implementation effort   thoughts  lucaro

unintuitive interpretation of some interval operator phrases   there is an ambiguity in the specification related to the interpretation of timing relationships  specifically  given this example       define interval1  interval  2012 01 01t09 00 00 0   2012 01 01t10 30 00 0      define interval2  interval  2012 01 01t11 00 00 0   2012 01 01t18 00 00 0      define within1  interval1 ends 1 hour or less before start of interval2  the specification implies in the definition of timing relationships  2 5 5 3  that this should return  true   but then describes in 5 5 3 2 that it should be interpreted as a duration between that would return  false    the problem is that there are two boundaries involved in the comparison "x 1 hour or less before y"   1  the boundary specified by the "before"  which is exclusive by the definition of the "before" operator  2  the boundary specified by the relative qualifier  "1 hour or less"  which is clearly inclusive   in this particular case  those boundaries meet and so the interpretation is ambiguous   in the case of "1 hour or more" the boundaries don't meet  so there is no ambiguity and you get the intuitive behavior     the translator should be updated to provide the intuitively correct behavior by having the inclusive boundary of the relative qualifier override the exclusive boundary of the comparison operator   an stu comment has been submitted to the specification to clarify the ambiguity  http   www hl7 org dstucomments showdetail_comment cfm commentid 1336

default camera folder name is the same on multiple identical devices and should be unique   after installing syncthing for android on two family member's phones that are the same make and model  i encountered confusing behavior where photos taken on one phone were showing up on the other   the problem was caused by syncthing on both phones coming by default with a camera folder with the same folder id  based on the device make and model  "lg m210 photos" in this case    i've now manually fixed the problem  by removing the folder on one device and recreating it with a different id   i hope future versions of the app will assign a default camera folder name that is almost certain to be unique  even on multiple identical devices   for example  how about appending a couple of random letters  e g  on these lg m210 phones the folder names might have defaulted to "lg m210 photos hz" and "lg m210 photos ej"   ### version information      app version  0 10 4     syncthing version  v0 14 43     android version  android 7 0

improve "using"  extension methods  autocompletion   now extension methods display the first argument and that is wrong   also would be great to be able to mark some classes with an optional annotation specifying they are classes with extension methods  that way we would be able to autocomplete those methods  but displaying them as grey and with very low priority if not having an using clause  and when as when adding import clauses  add an using clause   i would suggest the   extension  or    extension  meta     all clases with the   extension  meta would be available grayed without the using clause+action adding the using  and normal with the using clause after the indexing phase 
reading and then writting to the same item in a transaction cause error   1  add a getitemrequest for an item to the transaction 2  add an updateitemrequest for the same item to the transaction 3  commit the transaction 4  an error occurred  "item should not have been applied   unable to release lock"  after adding the updateitemrequest  the item is applied  when the transaction is committed  it loops through its requests to release locks  the getitemrequest is added first  so it is handled first  the transaction will fail to release read lock for the getitemrequest because the item has been applied by the updateitemrequest   a possible fix for this is that the transaction should not expect the item to be not applied when releasing read lock

renaming diagrams   i was creating multiple diagrams for the a system implementation "mycar cruisecontroltasks " one for the bindings and one overall perspective of just basically components and data flow  i was creating a third for looking only at bus access and decided to rename the binding diagram that i created earlier  nominally  the diagrams have the same core name with numbers in parentheses   after renaming  the latter two diagrams became unreadable  however  the renamed binding diagram is fine   perhaps renaming is not supported   it would be useful but is not critical  since one can export the diagram and name it as needed for clarity   thanks  dave gluch dpg sei cmu edu

auth issues are not shown in ui   so i just updated the binary after pr#9 and when i started hawkular app  it shows me the url and a proceed button  clicking it seems to have no effect    adb logcat  shows    i think the app should in this case redirect to the auth login dialog again  otherwise  if the credentials are still valid  that screen should probably be skipped and changing the server should be a menu option

docker mounting error when creating workspace   ### description the machine i'm running on has  restricted permissions in the   home  directory  https   github com eclipse che issues 10473#issuecomment 405955844   even for  root    so when creating a workspace  the che server presumably tries to mount   home user eclipse che lib linux_amd64 exec   but encounters  mkdir  home user  permission denied   full log at below     since i'm unable to grant permission to the   home user      i'd like to configure che try mounting somewhere else  does such a config exist  i've been reading the che docs and github issues for the past day and a half looking for potential solutions    i saw that   home user eclipse che  is the  che home  path  but it looks like setting this via a  che_home  docker env may have been removed  alluded to  here  https   github com eclipse che pull 2817   it also looks like moving  che home  may have further ramifications    ### reproduction steps 1  run the  eclipse che  docker image successfully  2  disable root permissions in   home         this one might be a bit of a conundrum    docker normally runs with  root  permissions  so it _should_ always be capable of this  as  root  should always be capable of anything  however  this is _not_ the case on my system   3  try creating a workspace  presumably with a new machine       os and version        rhel 7  eclipse che 6 8 0  docker version 18 03 1 ce      diagnostics     logs from within the workspace     ### summary due to machine restrictions  docker  root  lacks permissions to create   home user eclipse che  and subdirs  i also probably will not be able to pre create these directories    are there configuration options which will let docker mount this workspace volume somewhere else

trying to create a new schema    hi   first of all  thx for this application  its really usefull   i have a problem that seems a bug when i try to create a new schema using "schema registry" option of left menu   i have many schemas created automatically but when i push  "create a subject" button  the form that appear is disabled and seems that hq understand that i'm trying to update a schema instead of create one   i'm sure that i have all rights because im using a superuser to connect   searching a little into the code i found this in schema ftl file    i check this code into the navigator using web developer tools too   i suspect that "schema has_content" it's returning false but i dont know how is this possible   someone can reproduce this behaviour    regards

redisson calls do not time out and very long cache times depending on ttl setting   hi  while developing using redisson some problems with timeouts and cache times are experienced   1  consider the following scenario     now there are several problems here  timeout exceptions are being thrown  but seemingly at random times ignoring the timeout setting of redisson  it is also somehow being affected by ttl setting as the shorter ttl yields lower cache times  as well as the frequency of hitting the cache  you can see it from the following graphs of cache_time timer  1  long ttl setting  and around 4 5 queries per minute  cache time goes as high as 800 000 ms     long ttl not many queries  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3584701 8947897 ba086774 35db 11e5 9314 3c844218bce6 png  2   with long ttl setting and around 200 queries per minute  cache times also go as high as 800 000 ms but there are fewer spikes than in case 1  sorry no screenshot  3  short ttl setting  around 4 5 queries per minute  cache time goes as high as 800 ms     short tll not many queries  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3584701 8947906 d30ba498 35db 11e5 8491 2c5e0683e31f png  4  short ttl setting  around 200 queries per minute  cache time goes as high as 1000 ms but very rarely     short ttl many queries  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3584701 8947916 eacb9976 35db 11e5 8878 d5591f1ac113 png   so to summarize     ttl   queries per minute   max cache time   cache time spikes   picture in the previous list                                     long   4 5   800 000   many   1     long    200   800 000   few   2  no pic      short   4 5   800   many   3     short    200   1000   few   4    in all cases the timeout was set to 100ms  3 attempts with 100ms interval  in all the cases in the end requests succeed to fall over to the database  either through a timeout error or through returning null   regardless  the timeout is not being thrown according to the settings  please let me know if you might know the cause of the issue  thoroughly investigated the code on this side and it seems like the issue is in redisson  let me know if you need more context

regression in exchange in 3 14   hey  folks   i think i'm running into something that appears to be a regression in 3 14 around the new exchange mechanism  i can reproduce this 100  of the time in my app by creating a specific scenario   here's the basic setup  we have an interceptor that does a lot of things for us  including setting headers and handling retries for auth errors  here's a simplified version of the code  eliding a lot of details around how the retries are triggered     it doesn't seem to matter if you mutate the request or not  even just using  as above  a newly built version of the request produces the same behavior   any ideas what's happening here  i'm going to revert our library back to 3 13 for now to work around this  but i'm curious what could be causing this

management endpoint tomcat connector picks up general server properties   it appears that the management port connector is using the same settings as the regular one  usually 8080   we found this during performance test  it makes sense to tweak the settings for port 8080  or whatever port the application is running on  without impacting the management port  it doesn't make sense to assume that at peak usage  there is going to be as many people using the management port as the number of concurrent users   this ticket is to introduce new thread and connection properties for the management port  to begin with  don't use the ones for regular 8080 port

experiencing odd issues on my nexus 4 on t mobile with radio selector   first of all   thanks you very much for your efforts with these simplified flashing procedures  the utility does indeed allow me to connect to the t mobile 4g network here in san diego and when i am at a remote location with 4 5 bars of services i am getting an average speedtest results of 40mb down and 20mb upload which is great   i have noticed a critical connection issue however when i am located in my bedroom at home which gets horrible service  generally see 0 1 bars displayed on my phones display    basically what i have noticed is that after switching over to the hybrid firmware and enabling lte support my phone does not seem to properly auto select the best wireless connection to be used for regular internet access  a quick background on my connection details where this keeps happening   i have a 100mbps down 50mbps upstream connection  which i have never seen deliver less than 40mbps down and 15mbps up   my isp is cox communications an my service area is san diego  ca  north county   internet access from cox come in through a docsis3 piped directly into a linksys wrt600n  802 11n router with all firmware up to to date    under this exact setup  before and after enabling lte support my nexus 4 always showed a strong 4 5 bar consistent local wifi connection in every part of my house on all devices   however  after enabling lte i have noticed a real issue in the device seemingly not recognizing that a strong wireless connection exists and should be used  especially when the lte signal is consistently between 0 1 bars   i constantly notice this when i am browsing the web from my device and notice that a link i clicked is taking forever to load or times out    reloading the page a few times eventually brings it back online but even then i believe its actually still using lte instead of wifi + every time i notice a connection loading problem i consistently always see a very strong wifi signal and 0 1 bar with t mobile   btw   whenever this happens if i manually turn on airplane mode and enable wifi these connection problems disappear so it must be a radio issue in my view    correct   so my question here is  has anyone experienced this same issue and is there a fix for it in the work or some type of way to adjust these settings to tell my device to always use a wifi connection if t mobile has less than x bars  basically i just want to tell the radio to quit using lte for internet requests when its connected to a specific wifi signal and then switch back to t mobile when it loosing that wifi connection   any help  guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated   ch  please advise as this has become a real issue for me

on right click of  does not support offhand  and cancelling events is broken         this is just a recommended template  but you should follow it       ### description       a clear and concise description of what the problem is      there are 2 bugs  for one  "on right click of" does not include offhand  this can cause huge exploits on a lot of servers that are using this trigger and should be fixed  the second bug is even worse because it completely breaks all cancel events and requires a server restart  just ruins the server completely 2  when cancelling 2 events at the same time that are on the same script  then skript breaks and cancels the event continuously without a trigger   ### steps to reproduce       steps to reproduce the problem  if applicable  add a script or code snippet here      1   on rightclick holding a egg      cancel event  will not cancel event when right clicking on offhand   2  to reproduce second bug  have these 2 things for example   on rightclick holding a egg      if player does not have permission "egg use"          send "no 1 "         cancel event          on rightclick holding a bow      if player does not have permission "bow use"          send "no 2"         cancel event   try rightclicking them both at the same time  or put one item in your offhand and right click twice and it will break immedietly  and then it will stop checking the permission and will not send a message  but will rather just cancel the event forever and u cant use the items in any way  cant even break blocks with them   ### expected behavior       a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen      i expected for right click trigger to include offhand   there is no other offhand support  and i expected cancelling events to not leak and break the server completely by ruining the items  ### errors   screenshots       if applicable  add errors and screenshots to help explain your problem      will do if necessary  the bugs are clear         if you get a console error  you should send the full error  also if the error contains a stack trace  you can remove the server information section below   also you should send long errors using a permanent and reliable paste service like gist  not hastebin        ### server information     server version platform                version         skript version                         version skript       16 03 54 info   this server is running paper version git paper 1593  mc  1 12 2   implementing api version 1 12 2 r0 1 snapshot   16 03 54 info   you are 2 version s  behind  16 04 00 info    mycmd  this command have add_permissions type  16 04 00 info   skript version 2 3 1  16 04 00 info   customize minecraft's mechanics with simple scripts written in plain english sentences   16 04 00 info   website  https   skriptlang github io skript  16 04 00 info   authors  njol  mirreski  bensku  thebentobox  snow pyon  pikachu920  nicofisi  tim740  tuke nuke  thelimeglass  xxandrew28xx  sashie  roycurtis  nfell2009  syst3ms and blueyescat  ### additional context       add any other context about the problem here

typeexplorer ui fails to connect  docker compose environment    the docker compose tutorial environment contains a ui server in addition to 3 egeria platforms   jupyter  the intent was to be able to augment the tutorials if necessary with some ui guidance notes   however in this environment the type explorer does not appear to work  when type explorer is pointed at  cocomds4   datalake 8080 the following error is displayed    datalake 8080 which is the name port  within  the cluster  as used within the notebooks    note that it's not obvious from the gui where the connector is to from  which makes a big difference in a container based installation  but it's actually from the ui backend to the egeria data lake server   so this host should be correct   opening for further investigation

java lang verifyerror when using with aspectj compile time weaving   i've checked out your current version of the code  thanks for getting some java 7 compatibility rolling   and it has worked great  except for some aspectj generated classes  any time i try to run my tests on the instrumented aspectj classes i get the following exception   caused by  java lang verifyerror   class  myclass ajcclosure7  method  __cobertura_classmap signature   lnehtclassmaplistener  v  illegal type in constant pool  my work around for now is to simply keep those classes from being instrumented in the first place  and i really don't care about coverage for them too much so it's not a huge loss  wanted to make you aware of the issue to see if you think it is something that can be fixed    by the way  i have no problems instrumenting and testing the same generated classes with the cobertura 1 9 4   thanks   dave
allow number of leaserenewer threads to be configured   i have an application that consumes multiple dynamodb streams   eleven currently  i use a single worker on each stream but each worker creates a leasecoordinator with twenty leaserenewer threads  so i currently have 220 leaserenewer threads   this seems excessive but there's currently no way to reduce the number of leaserenewer threads that i can see   would it be acceptable for me to create a pr that reduced the number of leaserenewer threads created by default  or simply add a configuration option to allow this number to be reduced

weird state management in firstrunactivity   hi   on the first start  without being connected   the firstrunactivity is launched after a few intents   and  when you access this activity  and lock your phone  and reopen it  you should go back to this "firstrunactivity"  but instead you're redirected directly to login and a thread crashes   so why don't we redirect immediatly to firstrunactivity through mainapp instead of passing from filedisplayactivity  and why we don't relaunch this activity onrestart   and why is it a mediafolder detection before any connection  which fails and kill the thread          so  what is the "wanted" behaviour for the first launch   and why do we pass through filedisplayactivity without being connected    v  3 9 2

progress bar shows when no data connection   when there's no data connection  the progress bar shows endlessly instead of alerting the user to the problem   when it has no data and no ability to get data  it  should display a message instead of the progress indicator  i'd recommend some message like  "you need a data connection to load this content  please try again with data enabled "  it may be nice to have the widget listen to the network state in order to trigger a refresh once the data connection is established  but that's not necessary and may be confusing when it comes to abstraction layers

issue with arrays and class type   hi   it appears that the serialization implementation makes an assumption that the component  type information is a concrete type   as a result if you have an arraylist object  or arraylist serializable  then a null pointer exception is generated  definitely on the arraylist serializable    it seems that each object in the array needs to be written out with it's own type field   i did some more investigation and it seems like you may need to add   obj instanceof serializable  in the public void serialize final dataoutput out  final object obj              fastarraylist objectstack  throws ioexception

busybar is not clipped if not in a window parent   if  busybar  is added directly to a  stage  or a parent that does not clip it by default  like  table  or  container    it will be drawn over other widgets and actually take much more space than its  width  setting allows it to  the widget currently works as expected only when paired with a  window    when  busybar  width equals zero  it will not move at all  but its image will still be drawn in its fullest  again   taking much more space than  0    the lack of movement might be expected  but i still think the  busybar  drawable should be clipped to its current width   the widget itself could also use some additional properties like speed modifier and moving direction  both possibly accessible through its style       busybar  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 11707612 19211629 61010f50 8d41 11e6 9142 7dcf7a3f41dd png

'package' target fails on tests   hi     appplies both to 'release' and 'master'   i have an issue compiling the stack  the closest i get is the 8 errors  tests   the problem is that in such case the 'mvn package' fails and does not create jars   trying to use the stack in a docker container  i e  automatically git clone    mvn package    i've tried many combinations  with without jdk6 target  installing bc crypto provider manually  java7 8       i think this is an issue that might block newcomers from using your project  moreover  if this is an 'official opcfoundation stack'  if they try to install use the stack  simply  using    there are errors and no jar files that can be used directly are not created  although the compilation phase succeeds   imho  you should either turn off  ignore or print skipped message  the failing tests  or note it explicitly at the readme md page so that newcomers end up with a working  compile package  project   this also applies to the release  i would expect the release to pass the tests    thanks for fixing      m   the  automatically generated html result of the tests is attached    test results   all_in_ua java html zip  https   github com opcfoundation ua java files 663452 test results   all_in_ua java html zip

developer tools  problems reloading context   could be spring cloud or maybe spring integration contributing to this  or maybe both   the app seems to be running at the end but it did stumble a bit and i'm not sure what's broken  there are 2 exceptions on restart  one to do with  genericscope   cloud  and one mbeans  integration or just spring boot    look carefully and you will see that there are 2 contexts starting up at the same time  on the same thread  how is that possible  classloaders   so i think that's the problem   once it is in this jag  an app never seems to come out of it  so i suspect some state that is stored on startup  but it's not deterministic  it might never enter this state  see below for clean restart logs    here's a log from a session that just starts and app and adds a   requestmapping

bug  iguana tweaks disables all functionality for mods that change harvest speed       versions before 1 12 are not supported  minecraft version  1 12 2     please make sure you're using the latest version before sending a report  mod version   1 12 x  iguanatweaks reborn 1 4 15 and newer i did use the latest version as well  it’s the one i noticed the bug i reduced the versions until i found the one that added this bug    forge version  14 23 5 2838  what happens  iguana tweaks reborn 1 4 15    fixed a possible compatibility with mods that mess with breaking speed  tinkers' construct was one   this change also broke any compatibility with any mod adding skills that increase harvest speeds with shovels axes pickaxes literally anything  or any other mod that changes harvest speed other than the basic speed upgrade from tinkers redstone modifier    this also not only affects skill mods but also normal mine craft haste seems to sometimes be affected also any bauble item that adds a mining speed or potions or other buffs… i wonder how i didnt notice that sooner until a player came to me he i upgraded x skill and it doesn’t go faster anymore what’s wrong xd  well i went around and tested with various mods that add skills items or buffs that increase your mining speed and other than redstone modifier from tinkers nothing makes you faster anymore  this is sad as i was literally using iguana tweaks to make the start hard and gave them skills to make them feel like getting better when they slowly crawled up to normal mining tee felling shoveling speed  all tools from all mods are affected by this  easy combination to test this with would be  newest version of iguana tweaks reborn and improvable skills 3 mod   try it out you won’t get any faster at mining or other harvesting if you increase the skills anymore  unless you disable the hardness global config of itr  all versions below this it reborn 1 4 15 seem to work fine

add a bug reporting function to c geo   as per the discussion on #2128  we could add a new bug reporting function to c geo that would let a user send a mail to the reporting address with an attachment made of the last log entries   to avoid needing any permission on any android version  we could exploit the fact that all our logs go through  cgeo geocaching utils log  static methods and add a circular buffer storing the  n  last logs  such as the 500 last entries

which are accepting items from hopping bonsai pots the extractor is extracting logwood to the industrial foregoing item splitter  channel 1 has  item interface is on storage drawers drawer  the item importer imports charcoal from the industrial foregoing resourceful furnace  the crafting interface is on a crafting table and has a quark block of charcoal recipe in it crafting channel set to 1   an item exporter exports quarks blocks of charcoal with the _craft_ set to _true_ to the industrial foregoing petrified fuel generator it doesn't actually work i don't know why  maybe related to storage drawer    one other detail i want to mention is that i noticed some errors in red i use multimc  when i was shutting down the game yesterday  but i cannot find it now  but i remember it was something about ftb backups and it had something about integrated dynamics too that the interfaces were in an unloaded chunk  i am sorry i couldn't provide it now   #### versions     common capabilities  2 4 1

table or view autocomplete works incorrectly   this is happening under oracle  i noticed that when i need to auto complete a table or view name it shows me different schemas if the table or view exists on more schemas   example   i write  select   from btus  and i want to complete the table name to  btusers   then i'll be shown  myproduct_dev btusers  and  myproduct_preprod btusers  and  myproduct_prod btusers   this is annoying because i have to look for my schema among dozens of names  and given that i already choose a schema  the one upon the editor window  it would be great to auto complete names in the schema you selected  i e  when i write  select   from btus  and then i press ctrl + backspace it will be expanded to  select   from btusers   thank you
player summoned mobs lose ownership when entering leaving the end dimension   minecraft version  1 12 2 wizardry version  4 1 1 environment  all  single multiplayer   issue details   apparently  if you or your summon tries to enter the end dimension  the summons are no longer considered to be owned by you  resulting them attacking you as if a evil wizard summoned it instead of you   their names are also affected  it no longer says 'playername's summon'  but just says the original mob's name   steps to repeat                      1  get a wand with a summon mob spell or a summon mob scroll  2  cast the summon spell   it can be any mob  so as long it doesn't fly   3  spawn an end portal using this command cus it's faster   fill             end_portal 4  proceed to push your summoned mob the end dimension portal     or you can do step 5 instead     you can also use whirlwind or just let it walk into the portal  5  walk into the end dimension portal  5  let the game load the end dimension  6  go back to the overworld   if you did step 4  skip this step  7  find your previous summoned mob  it will attack you and lose it's ownership tag                        they will still despawn after 30 seconds like normal     this bug isn't really a big deal  cause the fact that leaving and entering the end dimension is coded really funny   but i'm just gonna point this oddity out     other mods involved  none

command without arguments   don't know if this is is a thing or not  but i can't seem to figure out how to register a command that does not have any arguments  i know this api is all about using the new brigadier formatting  but i'd like to be able to do something with the command when it does not have any arguments   currently the solution would be to register it with spigot bukkit itself  but at least on my test environment it will then override the formatting from commandapi and default to tab completing a player on the server and does not show the arguments of the command that i'm also registering with commandapi   adding to that registering the command with an empty linkedhashmap will result in the message "an unexpected error occurred trying to execute that command"

http request header normalization is inconsistent   in the  httprequest  class  header names are normalized before they are stored  so for instance  if a raw request with an  if none match  header is made  it is stored in  httprequest  as  if none match   as per the  httprequest#normalize    method  this is because  a href "http   stackoverflow com questions 5258977 are http headers case sensitive" http headers are not case sensitive  a    however  the rest of the  org s3auth relay  classes try to _fetch_ a non normalized version of the header names  because we are using the constants from  httpheaders   take for instance  the following code from  httpthread      the problem here lies in the fact that the constant  httpheaders if_none_match  is actually defined as  if none match   since all incoming request headers will be normalized  the header key and value will not actually be found    if none match  is _not equal to_  if none match  as java string equality is case sensitive  although http headers are not   we must implement consistent normalization across all of  s3auth relay  methods  one way we could do this is to make the  httprequest#normalize  method package private  or perhaps define our own constants with normalized versions of  httpheaders  strings   this is directly related to #25  fixing this will also fix #53 
not all notifications got response   hi    do anybody experience the problem  that each hour pushy does not get response to some sent notifications from apple  that happens at the time when  auth token expires  it happens for about one hour and ten minutes when it is issued   count of unanswered notifications depends on how many notifications are sent through connection  seems that 50 notifications per second are enough   it could be reproduced with following conditions  say for example you have 8 threads where each tries to send 10 notifications at the same time  and for example you do it once a minute  when auth token expires  and you send next time  pushy receives response about expired token for some first notifications  but for all other remaining there is no response at all  it looks like that apple when it receives new auth token in some way fails to respond on notifications with old token that it receives shortly after that  these numbers of threads and notifications i found empirically and with them this situation could be reproduced consistently  also have tried to comment out auth token change and continue to send with expired token  on first attempt have not got response on all sent notifications  but on next iterations all notifications are responded  so it looks like a problem at apple side  but would be nice if somebody can clarify  my pushy version is 0 10 and netty is 4 1 11 final   thanks  z

overlapping notifications requiring blockwise transfer are not detected   on the 2 0 x branch the  observationlayer  is not able to detect an already ongoing blockwise transfer for a notification when a new notification for the same token is received while the blockwise transfer is still in progress  this leads to the following problems    we no longer follow nstart 1 because we run multiple blockwise transfers in parallel   already running blockwise transfer s  might mix up  old  with  new  blocks of the  changed  resource    since all blockwise transfers are conducted independently from each other  the blockwise layer delivers a separate  assembled  and potentially corrupted  response  for each of them to the application layer when it should have delivered only one  response  reflecting the most recent  completely transferred  state of the resource   on master  this does not happen because an already running blockwise transfer is stopped and replaced with a new  blockwise  transfer for the newly received notification when such an  overlapping  notification is received

force recheck setfitmethod after changing movementarea   i'm using something like following    how can i force to update the image scaling to fulfill the fit method again without touching the  photoview    i want to only update if the current scaling of the image does not fulfill the fit method restrictions   cropimagegestureview getcontroller   resetstate     will work but resets the scaling  can i somehow force the checking of the restrictions   ps  this is important for me as i allow to specify crop ratio by the user  and i allow to freely scale my overlay view  so the image underneath should not rescale as long as it's bigger than the current overlay region

 enableswagger2 interfering with application configuration    hello  i'm trying to integrate swagger2 with a spring mvc project  no spring boot  and am running into a configuration related issue that is causing build failure whenever i use the  enableswagger2 annotation     pom xml    i've been able to track the issue to a particular property value that seems to be missing whenever the  enableswagger2 annotation is used  which in turn is causing the above exception  if i remove the  enableswagger2 annotation from swagerconfig java  the property in question is correctly injected into the appropriate  bean method and everything builds fine    again  this is a spring mvc application  i e  no spring boot   following the lead of another issue i found in this repo  i elected to remove the  configuration annotation from swaggerconfig java with no success    any help would be greatly appreciated

docservice should provide a way to navigate endpoint request objects without leaving debug form    currently  if one of the parameters in the request is a struct type  clicking on it will navigate away from the debug page  this makes it difficult to input a debug request while looking through the documentation  it would be nice if you could stay on the debug page while navigating structs   substructs  perhaps it could open on a frame on the right side of the page 
jenkinsfile  temp folder + debug logging in a docker slave    i currently have a jenkinsfile which will trigger the dependency checks to run within a docker container slave  completely ephemeral     1  i found that when i changed the temporary folder the 'dependencycheckupdateonly' would work  but   only once  it would then break after the first time when you rebuild that specific jenkins job  it would log   unable to update the dependency check database   2  i would like to enable debug logging so that i can look into this problem  i've noticed people saying that the logger can look for 'org owasp' however i'm not sure how you can enable debug logging in the first place through the jenkinsfile   question   1  is it possible to get the dependency checker working through ephemeral docker containers  it seems like there is some saved state  cache on the master  the only thing i can think of   in case you are wondering  i have tried a centralised database  but had similar issues   2  can you enable the debug logs through the jenkinsfile  if not  what are the alternatives    thanks

received amount is counted twice     i keep a spreadsheet of my bitcoins without really paying attention  today i noticed that the spreadsheet amount was different from the amount shown in mycelium   i hunted everywhere for missing transactions with no luck  finally i looked for the difference between the spreadsheet and mycelium totals  0 01825049btc  and had one transaction from last november of that exact size  the chance of receiving that exact amount of btc twice seems really unlikely to me   i'm guessing that one transaction was counted twice  is there anyway to verify or fix that  thanks

merge request ci is repeated when pushing to branch with same suffix as targetbranch name   ## issue   seems to compare with  endswith  probably to avoid having to deal with 'origin ' prefix  have not actually tried to fix this   ### problem description  basically title says it all  we have several branches that have the suffix "_master" as well as an actual master branch  merge requests that target "master" are repeated  whenever anyone pushes to one of the " _master" branches  this is a large repo with many contributors and a relatively length merge request ci of 30 minutes   when there's a lot of activity this causes our merge requests to never successfully complete a jenkins job

inconsistent raw data in row returned from buffreaderfixedparser vs buffreaderdelimparser   if a user chooses to keep a copy of the raw data in the returned row  both buffreaderdelimparser and buffreaderfixedparser add the parsed line to the row that is returned  there is a difference though in that if the line is longer than the metadata indicates  the line is first truncated to the specified length   in buffreaderdelimparser  the line is first parsed to columns  then if there are too many columns the extra columns are removed from the array but the orignal line is left unchanged and set in the returned row   would it be possible to return the original line in it's entirety in both cases  i realize that this might create an issue with users already relying on the current behavior  perhaps it would be possible for the row to  optionally  have both the original  unmodified line as well as the substring of the line that was used to create the row

docservice should provide a way to prepopulate debug forms   it will be very convenient to use debug forms if they can be prepopulated with sane request objects  similar to what's done with swagger annotations   i think we should be able to support two types of use cases  1  default values by type  any service method that contains the given type will have that type automatically prepopulated  think some sort of request context type message containing user id  app version  etc   2  default values by service method  this can allow completely populating a request  just hit send to try out your api   if possible  would love to have a way that uses normal java objects instead of annotations   swagger style json strings are really hard to maintain  not type safe unfortunately  but i personally would still prefer a map from method name to default value object

spring boot service fails on startup when using custom autoconfiguration class for enabling disabling eurekaclient   we were using spring boot 1 4 5 and camden sr6   we did not want to use  enableeurekaclient annotation in spring boot application class to register a service as eureka client  so  we wrote a custom auto configuration class and added the annotation to it with profile and made a library out of it so that we can refer it in any spring boot service accordingly   we now upgraded to spring boot 1 5 3 and dalston release  we found the below exception on startup of the service class for which we have activated the profile for making it as a eureka client  we did not see this when using spring boot 1 4 5 with camden sr6   can you please let us know how to resolve the issue    i have also shared the code for the service which has this error on startup   the library and also the eureka service used for reproducing this issue  https   github com bsridhar123 demo code

precision may be lost when saving the exchange rate in the database   when the user enters an exchange rate  it's not saved directly  instead  the relation between the original amount and the converted amount is stored  as a consequence  the exchange rate precision will depend on the precision of the two currencies   in addition  the converted amount is  wrongly  stored with the currency of the  original amount and rounded to its decimal places  if the original amount has no decimal places  even more precision is lost   for example  if the user transfers from a yens account  no decimal places  to an euros account  2 decimal places  and enters    transaction amount   10  yens  no decimal places    exchange rate   0 123456  gnucash calculates    converted transaction amount  1  1 23456 rounded to 0 decimals    exchange rate  stored in db   1 10   0 1  gnucash should store directly the exchange rate instead of calculating it

spriteanim animations don't play properly in some cases   for my project i would like to switch between players  a big and a small one  just scaling the player is no option  so i would have to end the current player and then add the other player to the scene   everything works  except when both are playing animations  it's all messed up  even if both players have different materials and textures  it won't play correctly  so my guess is  that if an object is added after it was ended  it has inherited the last sprite coordinates being displayed   so i tried to go around this by playing the initial sprite once when the object is ended  but it doesn't help much  it's very strange  but it plays the animation of the first player 3 times in a row  and then it plays the animation of the second player 1 time  and so on   i guess my only option is now to use the same sequences for both players and use two different animation sheets to play the animations from  but it's just weird  i checked if the animations are somehow connected  but i can't seem to find the connection   here is the code for the players and the camera   player0 java

wrong base line   textview#getbaseline   returns the offset of the widget's text baseline from the widget's top boundary  it is of especial importance for single lined texts  if it is correct  several single lined texts in a horizontally oriented linear layout will align vertically like a single line of text  even if their font faces  font size  stroke width  etc  differ  base line should work for edit texts as well 
 improvement  fix multiple issues around poolsubpage   poolarena   now after i disabled recycler  it looks like there are few things left to left the application _fresh_ without restarting  currently the process's res is around 6gb while the used heap is around 70mb  while the app has no traffic + 1 day uptime      2         142122        9095808  io netty buffer poolsubpage  i would guess that the poolsubpage doesn't take a lot in jvm heap  but retains quite a bit of native memory  is it possible to allow poolsubpage to shrink via some runtime option   am i correct that this behaviour will change with these paremeters

resolve type checker bugs   the type checker right now is not bug free  the main bug is that it crashes on recursion   some visual bugs    some functions like scanl _visually_ have a signature  a    a    a     a     a      a  when there's no wire connected  to fill in a type variable  and they are uncurried  though their actual signature is  b  a  b   b   a    b    some functions show a number as type variable instead of a letter  this number also increases with every change  so look into that    when currying uncurrying a function for which the output is already attached to another node  this node may become invalid  shown with a red line and a warning sign   but it will not become _visually_ valid again after moving the knot back    connecting an output with a second wire to a tree only _visually_ updates 1 occurence of that type  for example  connect a true and an      to an      as inputs  then connect the true to the      as input –the type will read bool only at the argument where the true is connected

implementation of bag   arrayindexoutofboundsexception    in the implementation of  bag java  https   github com haifengl smile blob 3e34c767011ce385649b016bc72627e5ff71b6ec smile src smile feature bag java  an arrayindexoutofboundsexception will be created in case you do the following  1  create a new bag with an array of any type  which has duplicate entries  whichoff some are at the end of the array  for example      "test" "is" "a" "feature" "test"  2  call the feature method on a sequence of words that contains "test"  the reason this happens is because the this features hashmap sets the index for test to 0  but later to 4  which is outside the bounds  because the features hashmap contains only 4 elements   possible fixes are  a  before putting a entry with index in the hashmap  check if it not already is contained in there   b  insert the entries backwards in the hashmap  such that the lowest index will lead   c  update the documentation to specify that only arrays with unique data can be used in training bags  d  alternative   i'd be happy to implement any of these fixes  so please let me know which one you prefer  such that i can do a pr with the fix   kind regards   mike
navigation pathing seems to bypass memorynpcdatastore   the output of command   version  on my server is     simple enough   unfortunately  for whatever reason  some of the entities are being saved  regardless  and it seems as if it's   only   the npcs which make use of pathing navigation  none of my other npcs are being stored to saves yml   from what i can gather  the xyz values are blank  and the information being saved doesn't seem to actually reflect what they're being used for  except the accurate navigational values  such as range and margin   but they're being saved  taking up space  and incrementing the  last created npc id  value 
doesn't load after logging in half the time   i'm using windows 7 and ptc account  about half the time i log in  nothing happens  no logging in source code that i saw so i can't pinpoint the issue  interestingly  program is more likely to load when running in a sandbox environment  i'm using sandboxie 3 66  got an error only the first time i ever used it     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 20910359 17639372 7aceafc2 60bf 11e6 8ce0 5e7b8be40f35 png 
missing json type when found only inside list of list   when generating documentation for a rest api with enunciate version 2 2 0 i have a data type that only appears inside a list of list  this data type is missing from the documentation and is given only as "array of object"    here is file that gives an example of the behaviour  the documentation of container states that "items   array of object"  if a reference to the item class is given somewhere else it is included  even in the containers documentation  my guess is that all types are identified first and that it fails to look for new types in lists  giving the type in a typehint doesn't help either 
possible multi threading bug    ## expected behavior consistent performance and behavior every time i start gephi and perform exactly the same actions   ## current behavior i am loading a large network into gephi  386k nodes and 9 3m edges   i load the data from the data laboratory tab  then i switch to the overview tab  now there are two separate things that happen inconsistently  when i load exactly the same network  perform exactly the same steps  and have no other programs running on my machine  1   occasionally  gephi claims that there are parallel edges in the edges spreadsheet  but most of the time  it does not  and i've checked  there aren't any parallel edges  2   in the best case scenario  the network  with its random initial node positions  will render in about 60 seconds after i switch to the overview tab  in the worst case scenario  it never renders  i noticed the presence of a lock file in    gephi 0 9 2 dev when the overview loading appears to get stuck  if i delete that lock file  gephi will render about a minute later    ## possible solution  is gephi getting dead locked somewhere during the loading of the overview tab  the symptoms i described above are characteristic of a threading problem  a bug that doesn't happen every time  that happens during extensive parallelization  as during the import of a large edges spreadsheet   and that seems to be resolved by deleting a lock file    ## steps to reproduce  1  start gephi 0 9 2 2  click on the data laboratory tab  3  first import a nodes spreadsheet   4  then import an edges spreadsheet  here's where the first bug appears  sometimes gephi finds parallel edges in the spreadsheet  but most of the time it doesn't  even though i import exactly the same spreadsheet each time   5   once the edges are done being imported  click on the overview tab    ## context        how has this issue affected you  what are you trying to accomplish       ## your environment    version used  gephi 0 9 2   java version  1 8 0_161  this is oracle's version  not the openjdk    operating system  ubuntu 16 04        or preferably  include a copy of your messages log file in your user directory  see https   github com gephi gephi wiki troubleshooting

no refresh when app starts   ### actual behaviour  sometimes when the application starts the root folder is not refreshed  and a manual refresh is required  this is verified  because execution will not enter the if haswindowfocus    statement in startsyncfolderoperation method in filedisplayactivity java  the issue cannot be reproduced every time  increasing the delay applied to the runnable  for example to delay_to_request_operations_later + 500 fixes the problem   ### expected behaviour  the application should refresh the root folder when it is started  ### steps to reproduce 1  compile the application 2  start the owncloud application a good number of times  at least 10   can this problem be reproduced with the official owncloud server   url  https   demo owncloud org  user  test  password  test  yes ### environment data  android version  4 0 4 device model   xperia arc stock or customized system  cyanogenmod 9 1 0 owncloud app version  2 0 1 owncloud server version  9 0 2

gcnv wgs cohort germline wdl run outputs vcf files with names that do not correspond to the actual sample inside the file    i used the very last version of the wdl using the last master commit for the docker and the name of the output files seem to be a random permutation of the actual sample names  the name inside the file  i e  the one listed in the #chrom line  seems to be correct   a previous run using a earlier version of the wdl  probably the one just before the last update  and the latest official gatk docker didn't have this issue

incorrect processing of "b3" header   tldr  when a "b3" header is present in a request processed and dispatched by spring cloud gateway to business apps  the ordering of the spans of the distributed trace is incorrect   take a microservices app made from 3 parts  a gateway based on spring boot and spring cloud gateway  two business services based on spring boot  all parts use spring cloud sleuth to get distributed traces  or spring cloud zipkin to publish them to a zipkin server    when the app client does not provide the "b3" header  everything works fine   but when the client  i can reproduce the problem with postman  or an intermediate infrastructure element  such as   pivotal cloud foundry    adds the "b3" header such as "1234567812345678 1234567812345678"  some business logs print an invalid spanid and the zipkin ui displays an incorrect spans ordering   see uploaded snapshot for an exemple  i used short id for simplicity sake      zipkin issue  https   user images githubusercontent com 25341695 65692336 a7f11900 e072 11e9 8351 e3afe9a0d08d png   the problem is experienced with spring cloud greenwich sr2 and sr3  i haven't try other versions    my naive interpretation is that spring cloud gateway forgets that the "b3" header has a special meaning to spring cloud sleuth and forwards it "as is" instead of updating it or  even better i think  removing it

transform transform   bug  incorrect processing order of nodes imported via doc     testing with exist 2 1  i've bumped into an xslt bug  the problem occurs when an xslt stylesheet that has been stored in exist db imports an xml document via the  doc    function  and tries to process its nodes   this simple stylesheet   style xsl   illustrates the problem     this is clearly a bug  and seems to suggest that nodes are processed in wrong order when they have been imported in an xslt stylesheet with the doc   function   i have tried to find workarounds for this annoying bug  and discovered that the problem does not happen when    the same   test  xml structure is constructed as an xslt variable and next processed  see style2 xsl    the same   test  variable is imported with the doc   function  but first copied indirectly via an identity transform with  lt xsl apply templates   before further processing   style3 xsl    for convenient testing  i have attached a backup of the test collection containing these documents  including a test xquery  test xq  which executes all 3 versions of the xslt stylesheet and reports errors where they occur   while the problem is related to xslt processing with saxon  i think this is an exist issue  the problem only occurs when the xslt stylesheet is executed with transform transform   from within the database  when the collection is stored and run from the file system  all goes well  also  when run with pure saxon  without exist   no errors occur with the transformation   i hope this provides some clues for debugging       sorry  i don't know any better way to attach the backup of the test collection in this githb tracker than by renaming it as a  jpg file  in order to use it  store and rename it to test_xsltbug zip    test_xsltbug zip  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 223134 2934021 aa992e76 d7c8 11e3 86de 2fcc787f9b71 jpg

fe4  "retain healers" can miss the point of retaining healers   their starting healing staves can randomize into something that isn't a healing staff  even if retain healers is on  i generated a seed with this option and aideen randomized into a priestess with a light tome in place of mend  and claude randomized into a sage with a fire tome in place of fortify  none of the drops or shops in the first generation gave any healing staves either  the first one i got access to was in lana muirne's starting inventory  well out of the reach of aideen claude  which makes it pretty hard for them to be healers

 jvstm+ojb  code injector bug for final variables   the code injector creates a new constructor in every domain class that receives the oid as an argument  this constructor is invoked when an existing object is materialized from the persistent back end   the java compiler creates code optimizations for final variables inside every existing constructor  however  the code injector runs after the java compiler  and the constructor that it injects does not contain the optimized code  which is necessary in runtime   as a result  final variables of materialized domain objects are not initialized  which should be impossible according to the java semantics   here's an example of the situation  the programmer creates a dml class cat and codes it like this     invoking gettail   on a cat that is fetched from the database will return null  which should be impossible   this happens with any non static initialization block  so any variables are affected  not only final   the problem is just more serious with final variables  because of the java specification for  the final modifier   i'm not sure if there is an easy way to solve this problem  but i consider it is important to report this anyway 
 api query occasionally returns datapoints with missing tags   we use opentsdb heavily in our organization  and we have noticed that occasionally datapoints are returned with missing tags  for example  this query to   api query       notice that the second response is missing the  env  tag  when the same query for the same timespan is issued again  the  env  tag is present again like in the first response  we can rule out that the issue is us writing bad data or rewriting datapoints  since the metric without the  env  tag is not returned in subsequent requests   any ideas what might be causing this

possible deadlock thead starvation between hive loadpartitionbyname and gettable   we've seen an issue a couple times now where the presto coordinator continues to queue queries  but none get executed  i believe i've traced it back to a race condition that can cause a deadlock   in a thread dump of the coordinator we saw that all 40 of our hive metastore refresh threads were waiting on a  gettable  call from within the  loadpartitionbyname  method    i believe the issue is that all the executors in the thread pool are being used  leaving no open executors to complete the  loadtable  call needed to fulfill  gettable    this behaviour seems to have been introduced by https   github com prestosql presto pull 1921  when  loadpartitionbyname  was switched from using  delete  directly to calling  gettable

pebble battery runs down faster than with official app   awesome project btw   now i can do without the play store  run only free software on my phone and still get some use out of the pebble   but  i notice that the pebble battery only lasts a day or two now  whereas it could go several days before   my phone does not have ble  so it has to use old style bluetooth  and that of course makes battery life worse than it could be  but still  gadgetbridge is 2 3x worse than the pebble app in this regard  so i'm guessing it must be a bit too chatty  communicating too much   i have the pebble time steel  not the second version    also have an original pebble which i could test  if someone expects that there could be a difference

logging  found execution with unknown task name   hello   the use case scenario is that i have a single scheduler with 5 scheduler threads  10s heartbeat interval and polling interval of 5s  this scheduler has to start several recurring tasks both on a fixeddelay   daily  i'm still not sure if the issue happens for the daily task  but for the fixeddelay tasks i get a huge amount of logging  for each task  saying  "internal execute due pool 7 thread 1  com github kagkarlsson scheduler taskresolver resolve   found execution with unknown task name  task_name "  it seems that task execution itself is not affected   i'm convinced it might be related to threading  but can't be sure  is this an issue for anyone else  could i be missing something   thanks  rui

jodd works not well with tomcat   mysql   threaddbsessionprovider is jodd's default sessionprovider  tomcat will work with a thread pool when tomcat creates one thread the thread will stay in the pool and never release the dbsession   there is a variable named 'wait_time' in mysql when  one connection never use for a long time the mysql server will close it   so when the system never query the db for a long time the db server closes the connection when a query comes one thread of tomcat in thread pool will run it holds one dbsession and use the dbsession to query the db and throw "connection is close" exception   maybe you say that i can use coreconnectionpool with validateconnection true but in tomcat the connection will be hold by one thread in the tomcat thread pool and never be returned to coreconnectionpool  and never be checked that it is a validate connection   thanks

build exception  cannot call task setenabled boolean  after task has started execution   while attempting to upgrade to retrolambda 3 0 0  from 2 5 0  i've run into this error a bunch of times    cannot call task setenabled boolean  on task ' trello wear shared compileretrolambdarelease' after task has started execution    it doesn't always happen  cleaning the build seems to fix it  but on the next build the task gets run again  even though it ought to be up to date  and then this happens  maybe it should be using  stopexecutionexception  instead of  setenabled    i hate to create an issue where i don't know why it's happening or how to repro  but i've run out of ideas

thread safety vulnerability   the current implementation uses a static property in order to store the companion xxxaspectproperties object for a given xxx object   this leads to potentiel issues when the same k3 code is executed in a multithreading environment  for exemple  apply the same trasnformation on 2 models in eclipse   or if 2 differents transformations reuses the same aspects   it would be much better to be able to pass the companion xxxaspectproperties object as a parameter of the method   ex of code with the pb xtedn code     the problem is the use of "_self_" as a static property instead of a method parameter when qualifiedname   call _privk3_qualifiedname

rcl bug  version 1 10 2   1 3 0    for some reason  the rcl refuses to enter a tank more than 300mb at a time  the smelter uses up 2 ores  then stops  leaving 200 mb in the tank above  then just stops  i've managed to get it to continue through the process but i have to deal with tiny increments of about 200 mb in a series of tanks separated by fluid conduits from enderio  the only way i managed to get 300mb inside is using the creative fluid injector and even that stops at 300  even multiblocking several tanks together won't let it get past the 300mb limit   painstakingly getting it all the way through to the end of the process at the crystalizer is possible  but wasting resources at the laser section and very time consuming   interestingly  when multiblocked with three tanks and filled up  then broken  each tank section keeps 100mb  then refuses to be filled any further after that amount   this leads me to believe that the rcl is refusing to mix with itself

private method can be redeclared in a child class as public without the compiler fail to compile   hi   working in an example for tour de jewel found the following bug     in 'components exampleandsourcecodetabbedsectioncontent as' i have a private 'changehandler' method    in 'buttonbarplayground mxml'  that extends 'exampleandsourcecodetabbedsectioncontent'  i created a public 'changehandler' method that is called from a buttonbar instance in the 'change' event declared in mxml   running tdj result in the following issue  'change' event handler tries to call the private changehandler in 'exampleandsourcecodetabbedsectioncontent' and fails with an error since event target is not the right one   this seems to me a bug since compiler should fail to compile and report that 'changehandler' method is already declared in the parent class as private  or maybe i'm wrong

after a couple of days or weeks the channel subscription seems to die   i'm running spring boot 2 2 0 release with the default  org springframework boot spring boot starter data redis  dependency and i'm observing this problem for quite a while now  for all this time lettuce was the underlying redis client   i created a redis message listener bean like so in my  redisconfiguration      after a couple of weeks  sometimes months  the listeners will all stop receiving messages over the channel they subscribed to   checking redis itself  4 0 9  tells me that redis is still up and running and also the pub sub mechanism still works fine when using  redis cli   only the java redis clients seem to not receive anything anymore  after restarting my application it works again

high volume of requests causes illegalstateexception in streamspanreporter   hi   i've been playing with sleuth  zipkin and kafka a bit lately  and noticed some exceptions when using relatively high request volumes   i have some demo code here  https   github com barrycommins zipkindemo tree master it's just a simple spring boot web app with one   restcontroller   traces are sent to the zipkin server with kafka as the transport  under normal load  everything looks fine    zipkin trace normal  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 19176452 19267427 85608576 8fa6 11e6 900d 006ef1922564 png   however  under higher load  just simulated with jmeter   i quickly start seeing  java lang illegalstateexception  queue full   here's the stacktrace     the traces then don't seem to be closed normally    zipkin trace error  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 19176452 19267523 0e0ecfe0 8fa7 11e6 9c2e d194132f2ecf png   i guess this could be related to https   github com spring cloud spring cloud sleuth issues 378    is there any way to handle this  or is the solution to just reduce the sample rate  it doesn't seem to be an issue when sending traces to zipkin via http   thanks

services can be flooded with requests   pushing "too many" requests towards the hono http protocol adapter make it behave rather poorly  my expectation would be that hono would still be able to handle the amount it can handle  but it looks to me as if the http adapter mostly breaks down   i tried to dig a little bit into this and i think i know one reason why this could be  pushing http requests  make the http protocol adapter issues requests towards the device registry  if such a request cannot be handled in a specific amount of time  default 200ms  then it will be aborted and the http request failed   my understanding of the message flow is the following     request handling  https   user images githubusercontent com 202474 43648168 f907dc12 9739 11e8 9054 6c62f032e8d9 png     details  title request handling  client  +endpoint  send request note right of endpoint  validate request endpoint  eventbus  publish request endpoint    client  accept request  note over  client  new credits are available  note right of eventbus  process request eventbus  endpoint  publish response  endpoint  +client  send response client    endpoint  accept response   details   this would mean that the client  the protocol adapter  can push at a higher rate than the eventbus requestprocessor verticle can handle  building up requests and slowing down the process   that would also mean that  if requests stay longer than 200ms in some kind of queue on the eventbus side  then they would time out on the protocol adapter side  so once your are in state that the eventbus queue is at a size that requests have to wait more than 200ms  then all requests will timeout  which in fact means that no http requests will be accepted any more   a possible solution for that problem would be to delay the accept of the request until the response was send  the reject or release could still be sent directly after the validation of the request   another possible solution would be to get rid of the eventbus completely  as some initial profiler run showed that most of the time is spent processing eventbus messages   this may as well relate to issue #735

raw select picks string datatype if the first row has a null value   beta19  i'm using a variant of the enumordinalconverter which stores  integer   instead of  int   so i can use null values   after going through the results of    raw      get   tolist    i ran into an unexpected type mismatch where 1 of 3 enum fields out of  tuple get index   reported itself as a string instead of an integer   after looking at my database  it seems this is happening because the first several rows of the dataset have a  null  value for that field    the other two enum fields that are working correctly are never null  
request to alter cloud debugger json format   how flexible are we in altering the json that the cloud debugger uses   the current format being produced loses information  bad java util logging assumptions   faults    some concerns    the conjoined "message" key has        logger name  unless caller source is declared      caller source class no method  logger name is lost       caller source class and method  logger name is lost       throwable  multi line throwable messages can cause issues    throwable common   overlapping entries are not stripped  like other frameworks do    thread name is assumed to be  thread currentthread    at time of logging  not when the logging event was created   mdc  aka  logcontext  can overwrite json keys  an example output as it exists now         in java util logging  the caller source class and method only exists when you use the  log logp    style methods  which is in rare form     the logger name should never be excluded is often more useful then the caller class + method  and wont confuse people attempting to configure logging levels   the "message" entry also has the throwable appended onto the end of it  which in the case of multi line throwable messages can be difficult to understand where the logging message ends and the exception message begins   i propose the following changes    keep "severity"  possible values "trace"  "debug"  "info"  "warn"  "error"  as this is the common overlap in all of the logging frameworks    keep "timestamp" as is  but based on logging event time   keep "thread" but base it on the thread at the time of the logging event creation   keep "message" but it is only the formatted parsed message for the log event   new  required  "logger" which is the logger name   new  optional  "caller" entry which is a string which has the class + method + extra    new  optional  "throwable" entry which has the entire stacktrace  sans duplicate stacktrace elements   optional "traceid" is always in top level  and obtained from mdc    all other mdc entries are in a new "mdc" sub object  this will make the json compatible with more then java util logging events  and can be populated with events from log4j  commons logging  java util logging  slf4j  logback  logkit  osgi  and apache juli

enemies using items they can drop  despite not being able to   fe4    this happened on two ocassions  one  i was facing hannibal's high priest  who had thoron in his inventory  i was wondering why he couldn't use it  until i remembered he normally drops something in the vanilla game  but i had "inherited" thoron with a unit   tralala  i go to attack the high priest  and    he kills me with thoron in retaliation   the same thing happened with hilda's first fight  except she was a general  when attacked from range  despite her having the silver blade on  she attacked with volcanon    which froze the game because generals have no magic casting sprite  i assume   when i attacked her up close  before she even changed weapons  mind  though fe4 does switch boss weapons if they have a good option   she used the silver blade she had like normal  so i assume it has to do something with retaliation   i have a changelog  though i don't know how to upload it  github says it doesn't support the file type

duplicate id in index   i decided to reindex my data to take advantage of  doc_values   but one of 30 indices   120m docs in each  got less documents after reindexing  i reindexed again and docs disappeared again   then i bisected the problem to specific docs and found that some docs in source index has duplicate ids     the only thing that happened with index besides indexing is optimizing to 2 segments per shard

 native image   tracer  potential bug in the merge function of the tracer   i think there is a likelihood that the tracer somehow overwrites the manually amended sections of the config file   below are two scenarios  the first one  is a result of a manual amendment after a runtime recommendation that the two fields need write permissions  so i did that  due to another reason  re ran the tracer and it resulted in the amended block been replaced by the original block   before running trace  after manual amendment    _reflect config json_   and this is fairly reproducible  i have already done this a couple of times and i see that it consistently replaces it with the original block   let me know if you need anything else to track this issue down

sort out problem with hascandidategroup   thanks   this appears to be a problem in camunda bpm assert rather than in the engine   the method taskassert#hascandidategroup makes the following query  taskquery   taskid actual getid    taskcandidategroup candidategroupid  singleresult     the javadoc for taskquery#taskcandidategroup says   per default it only selects tasks which are not already assigned to a user  to also include assigned task in the result specify   link #includeassignedtasks    in your query   so  the query you need is taskquery   taskid actual getid    taskcandidategroup candidategroupid  includeassignedtasks   singleresult     are you sure that this worked with 7 2  because the null check for assignee when filtering by candidate group appears to be there for quite a long time already   cheers  thorben

commandlinkbutton  font size and color incorrect for windows   as far as i can see   the uxguide doesn't explicitly mention it as the commandlinkbutton is a standard win widget  so just looking at native examples   the size of the instruction should be the same a the size of the maininstruction of the task dialog   i've seen that there is already an issue over at google concerning the not quite fitting blue  just reminding you      additionally  the explaining text should be blue as well  instead of black  as it is right now    cheers jeanette

 0 6 4  network randomly    stops working   sometimes when i log back into our server at least one of my id networks have stopped working  the indication is at least one of the writers showing the status "network corrupted"  although in one or two cases i've seen that status although it still seems to work   so far i've been able to fix it by either pulling out the data card in the writer and re inserting it  rarely  or breaking a couple of cables around the writer and replacing them  usually    i was reluctant reporting this because i have no idea what causes it could have  it doesn't seem to happen while i'm online  so my suspicion is that it either happens when the server restarts or is related to the chunk loading issues we have on the server  our version of ftbu seems to be rather random about actually keeping the chunks loaded i set it to   both networks i have this happened on cross chunk boundaries   one other thing i noticed  which i'm just going to mention  not sure if that is id's fault   if i "repair" a network after such an incident  my fps in that region often go to hell although the regulation shouldn't have set anything off that causes it

secret rotation failure   hello   i've ran into an issue that results in a failure to rotate secrets at the end of their lease  the renewal process is working correctly  renewing the lease until the max ttl has been reached   but once the lease has reached it's end  the system fails to rotate the secret   i've tried with a number of default lease max ttls to verify if the issue was due to the low ttl times  but i get the same result with small or large ttl values  vault version  0 11 spring vault core version  1 1 2 release requestedsecret mode  rotate vault backend  database default lease ttl  2m max lease ttl  3m  i traced the error back a few levels and found the following code  i've annotated the method with comments related to this issue with    issue  when reading through this code  it appears that this situation was meant to be handled by the first catch block notated below  but that block is no longer catching exceptions related to lease expiration

raised error and not saving the record    please help me   ## steps to reproduce the problem    i don't know   this behavior is unexpected     it seems we have a null pointer for a record in storage  after the database hanging    i guess there is a problem with cluster 29 because when i insert some record after 3 successful insert the following error appears      error during saving of record with rid #29  1   thanks saeed tabrizi

different result sets when different cache types are used   i've been playing around with the object cache configuration  and i was surprised when i turned the object cache to "none" that i got a different result set than when it was set to "soft" or "weak "  for example  if i just use the web relationship viewer  db data node x relationships   i get about 1 4 of the expected relationships when cache type is none  and all of the expected relationships when cache type is soft or weak   i would expect that object cache type would have no effect on the actual data that's returned and only impact performance   i'm using 1 9 rc1 on a box running centos with 128gb of ram   my database has a little over 1 billion nodes and about 10 billion relationships   although i've been tweaking them a lot because of very poor traversing performance  i'm usually around 60gb for the jvm heap  set in wrapper   i use memory mapped buffers for the low level cache and set the nodestore to have 12gb and i let neo4j auto set the rest  it gives about 40gb to the rel store

cryptomator modifies file names containing url encoding   20 and similar    ### basic info   i'm running cryptomator on   windows 7  64 bit    i'm using cryptomator in version   1 1 0  64 bit  ### description  just copied the contents of a boxcryptor classic virtual drive into an empty cryptomator virtual drive  afterwards  i ran a comparison scan of both virtual drives using winmerge  the following observations  1  during the copying process  a windows message popped up that one file already existed in the cryptomator virtual drive  further examination led to the following result  the boxcryptor classic vd contained  among others  2 separate files  one named "xxx 20xxx 27x 20xxx pdf"  the other one named "xxx xxx'x xxx pdf"  i  e  both file names were identical except for the "url encoding"  character codes in hex   while boxcryptor considered them as different file names and thus separate files  cryptomator considered them as having the same file name  which resulted in windows unexpectedly asking if the file should be overwritten  2  on a similiar note  some file names ending with "xxx df pdf" in boxcryptor had been renamed to "xxx� pdf" in cryptomator   all of this doesn't happen if i copy those files into a non virtual drive  i  e  in a normal windows folder    might be related to https   github com cryptomator cryptomator issues 278 ### log file  optional   no

the precedence of loading cipher in environmentdecryptapplicationinitializer decrypt is different as spring profiles active does   hello   let's create a spring cloud project with two profiles  dev application dev yml   dev andy application dev andy yml   main content of application dev yml  actual result  got the user dev andy db user with password dev cipher expected result  should got the dev andy db user with password dev andy cipher  spring cloud version  'greenwich sr1'  spring boot version  '2 1 3 release'   i have found that environmentdecryptapplicationinitializer decrypt propertysource     map string  object   will load the spring datasource password from application dev andy yml firstly  and then override it by loading from application dev yml  seems that the precedence of loading configuration items in environmentdecryptapplicationinitializer decrypt is different as spring profiles active does  is there anybody can take a look  thanks in advance

syncthing android updates file modification times on initial sync   i am having an issue where syncthing android resets file modificaiton times to the time of initial sync on the android device  these modification times are propagated through the cluster  i consider this a data loss   my cluster consists of four machines  android 0 4 3 syncthing v0 8 20  this project  darwin amd64 v0 8 21 linux armv7 v0 8 21 linux amd64 v 0 8 21  here is how i reproduce this bug   i stop syncthing on every machine in the cluster  i  rm      from within the repo directory on each machine  now the repo exists but is completely empty  then  i  rsync  a  my files into the repo of one machine  specifically  the darwin v0 8 21  from a backup  these files have diverse modification times   when i start the cluster without the android machine  the files sync normally  propagating the correct modification times to each machine in the cluster   when i add the android machine with an empty repo  it syncs the files from the cluster to itself  but it erroneously updates the modification time of the received files to the present time  these updated modification times are then propagated to the rest of the cluster   modification times are important information to me and i don't think it's normal behavior to update them when syncing   please let me know if i can provide any logs or debug traces to assist you

leadership election  local leader set to late    hi   we migrated our leader election code from hazelcast to kubernetes  the setup we have as of today is like     my expectation was that this will yield to the correct behaviour  yet an  ongrantedevent   where   event getcontext   isleader    is invoked will return  false   on the contrary an  onrevokedevent  will yield for the same invocation  true    this is due the fact that leadershipcontroller is setting localleader   newleader after it notified on grant revoke  which to me looks too late   i can work around this issue by checking for the type of event received onrevokedevent ongrantedevent rather than the isleader   method  yet i would assume that both should allow me to conclude the same result

fundamental issue in random beans validation   i found fundamental problem in  random beans validation  implementation  currently every randomizer created by the package will generate same value every time  or almost every time  see below    let's for example look into   sizeannotationhandler   https   github com benas random beans blob master random beans validation src main java io github benas randombeans validation sizeannotationhandler java    every time randomizer is looked up for field annotated with   size  it will create  new instance  https   github com benas random beans blob master random beans validation src main java io github benas randombeans validation sizeannotationhandler java#l56  of  characterrandomizer  providing it with   same   seed and therefore randomizer will generate   same   value every time  or almost every time  because randomizer for string length is  not using  https   github com benas random beans blob master random beans validation src main java io github benas randombeans validation sizeannotationhandler java#l54  seed  but it should   other annotation handlers have same issue  except those generating constant values  for obvious reasons    ideal solution would be to somehow cache randomizers created for the field from annotation  but i'm not good with java  so not sure how feasible doable it is

non determinism when using inprocesstransport with direct executors   ### what version of grpc are you using   1 0 1  ### what jvm are you using   java  version     1 8 0_101  ### what did you do   i am attempting to write unit tests for rpc systems without mocking stubs  which would be lovely if it worked  recent discussions  e g   here  https   github com grpc grpc java issues 1469    1 0 1 release notes  https   github com grpc grpc java releases tag v1 0 1    this example  https   github com grpc grpc java commit 7306df42662b8eb96f3524e3940b3e65d37deb73   suggest this is the new done thing and is supposed to work  to this end i am running an  inprocessserver  and calling it over an  inprocesschannel  with both ends using a  directexecutor    ### what did you expect to see   the 1 0 1 release notes imply that this is now deterministic  after the removal of the  grpc ready  thread pool  which was causing issues for me before   so i expected to see determinism in my unit test  and for the server handler to be called on the same thread that made the stub method call  the rpc method is a client side streaming rpc  but i don't know if that is relevant   ### what did you see instead   the unit test is not deterministic  since the service handler seems to end up being called on a  grpc timer  thread provided by the  scheduledexecutorservice  created by  grpcutil timer_service   the task that causes the call is  the  nameresolverstarttask  in  managedchannelimpl   and there appears to be no way to provide an alternative timer service    see managedchannelimpl java line 307   https   github com grpc grpc java blob 496a621da7c57a252286f041e9b41e59b722ae9b core src main java io grpc internal managedchannelimpl java#l307   for reference  the stack trace that i see on the handler side is as follows     am i doing something wrong  is there a workaround  it seems like doing the name resolution work on the  managedchannelimpl 's user provided  executor  rather than its  scheduledexecutor  might fix it  but i don't know if there's some reason it's not done that way

photos missing caching feature    ### actual behaviour 1  photos  accessed from drawer  seem to be missing any sort of caching of thumbnail data  each time when accessed  app will try to load all the photos from scratch  since i have a good amount of photos on the cloud  it takes a lot of time   ### expected behaviour   caching of the thumbnails is desired  probably cache as much data as possible  to prevent performance hiccups   also  performance wise  i'd suggest that the app doesnt try to load all the photos at once  but perhaps just a few photos  50 60  and load more when user reaches the end of the list by scrolling   small enhancement plug   i view the photos as a very important segment of the app  sorting and categorization by folders would be a great improvement     ### steps to reproduce 1  open photos from the drawer 2  after photos are loaded  go back to files 3  go back to photos again  you will notice that all the photos load from 0    screen  https   user images githubusercontent com 36133540 61249021 94613200 a754 11e9 9b7e 3b0a1cf79315 jpg     ### environment data android version  9 nextcloud app version  3 7 0 nextcloud server version  15 snap

auto configured webmvc application with security not publishing authentication events   the default spring security providermanager uses a nulleventpublisher by default  which means authentication events don't get published to applicationlisteners  such as the auditlistener provided by spring boot actuator   for example i wasn't seeing badcredentials events published when they should have been  etc   based on the boot web security samples  i worked around this by adding an autowired authenticationeventpublisher in my globalauthenticationconfigureradapter and then calling auth authenticationeventpublisher with it in init   which sets up a defaultauthenticationeventpublisher thanks to its bean definition in boot's securityautoconfiguration   it looks like there might be the beginning of some work to make this the default autoconfigured behavior in authenticationmanagerconfiguration via lazyauthenticationmanager  but it seems to be unused   not sure if i'm way off base and noone wants this as default behavior  or that its supposed to be the default behavior and there is another bug in a place i've overlooked causing defaultauthenticationeventpublisher to not be setup

theia should not offer to start apps for debugging   ### is your enhancement related to a problem  please describe  many default suggested debug configurations in theia operate similarly to vscode  they start the specified app and connect debugging to it   this does not make sense for eclipse che  we often start the theia sidecar container with a limited   512mib   memory quota  and often it's impossible to run anything else significant in this container    some examples that come to mind are  1  the netcoredbg plugin for  net workspaces only seems to work locally  so the application has to start in a sidecar container 2  the built in autocompletes for debug configurations include "launch" configs  which call e g   npm debug  in the theia container  these usually get killed before starting up completely  ### describe the solution you'd like at the very least  theia should not suggest configurations that will not work  ideally theia would be able to somehow operate in the main workspace container  which should have enough memory to run the app   but i realize this is likely not possible in a general way   ### describe alternatives you've considered caveat emptor  i guess   ### additional context      add any other context or screenshots about the enhancement here

exception while binding named parameter of type java util list   jdbi 3 3 0 probably has a bug while binding named parameters of type java util list   i have a rest api service that should insert a _comparison_ into a postgresql table  the _comparisons_ table is created on application startup by executing the following sql statement       the insertion in the catch block succeeds  i checked the _comparisondata_ bean that is binded and its _stringlist_ attribute  but there is nothing strange about them  the fact that the insertion succeeds with exactly the same parameter makes me think that there is a bug in the list binding   i would be happy to receive feedback from you regarding the issue

pendant working without blood   ive noticed that for some reason  the pendant still works even after being drained of blood  ive removed it completely to make sure that it was in fact that   not some mystcraft bug   it does in fact keep removing effects  ive tested it on a number of effects like fire   potion effects like weakness  which brings me to the 2nd issue  while testing the pendant  i was going to use poison   had a few poison sacs when i viewed how to make the poison potion it was shown that i could make poison using the magma crucible from thermal expansion to turn them into straight liquid  but you cant put them into the crucible  figured i'd mention both of these for version 1 7 10  0 9 3 since they happened at the same time
