Is it likely to be one of the manifests I have ticked in the dialog box for version number update or any manifest in my workspace? 
yeah I'll get you a log when I get home tonight.  it's not supposed to currently be possible for the client to be stuck in an infinite init loop like it is if client.prefs is the only file missing, right?   I mean I don't think this is intended behavior.
Yes, this is after the login dialog went away. Didn't happen in my other comp though.

I'm using 1.2.1335-1  Unfortunately I am not the sys admin so I can't update the version myself.   If all that is required is a version bump. I'll wait till the preview is released and then request the upgrade. I guess we can close the issue if its fixed in the preview version.

It does happen every time. You did change the behavior of the "Next" button, though, so that might have fixed it. I'll test again with the next beta (so leave the issue open for now — I'll close it if it's gone).

Hi, I tried to write a unit test but without success, I never reproduce the problem but it is always existing in my full code. After more investigation, the problem seems to come from one custom constraint (HardActivityConstraint) I added to the VRP (with one additional custom StateUpdater for this constraint ). In fact, if I always returned FULFILLED or always return NOT_FULFILLED, I never have the problem. But If I keep the logic of my constraint I have the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  So I am sure I am doing something wrong but no idea for the moment. Thanks for your help. 
Yes, it was registered using a metadata file, over the rest interface. I also suspect it's that first restriction in the `where` that is the problem. That seems to look for something that is an SSN#Sensor. So I guess we need the schema editor for that? 
> Hi @chufgard, > sorry for the late response, now I am going to investigate your issue now. Could you provide more details? For example, your WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter config, your properties(except sensitive data). And if you can provide a sample project, that will be better.  Sample project will be difficult - at least since the whole stuff works like a charm if I deploy it on my local machine. Only running in azure it breaks.  We are assuming that the problem might be caused by a federated AD scenario plus a conditional access policy (access only from company IPs) bound to the ad where we are federated into.

Thanks, @saudet! If you decide at some point to use `flatten maven plugin`, feel free to ping me for PR!
No changes. Just press "Save" button on Log Levels page on fresh payara installation (downloaded today a hour ago), no config changes, just defaults.  This adds line   com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler=OFF  to ${DOMAIN_DIR}/config/logging.properties  in my case:  /opt/payara41/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/logging.properties  Switching com.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler to INFO resumes logging as expected.
Which kind of memory dump do you want ? How to create it ? Note: I sent a small maven project which reproduce the bug here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/orient-database/bAOK-bVrd3U 
Sure. Https://rcrdbrt.com/blog If it's too much of a big deal or there's a lot of code refactoring involved tell me, I could just add a subdomain, in that case I think it will work. Maybe no one else uses a setup like my current one.

that didn't work for me. to build the project, i had to create an `ant.properties` file with the following contents:  ``` source.dir=src source.dir=src_ical4j ```  i created that file after using the `android` command. (using --subprojects made no discernable difference to me.) i'm guessing there's a way to set these in `AndroidManifest.xml` or somewhere else.  unfortunately, 83cfc156753f73889d2c3545b601d7e844217348 built this way crashes when i click "add account" in the system settings and press the caldav icon. i haven't built it in any other way. 
That is a temporary solution and considered a bad practice. The solution to this problem lies in the concept of Handling Lifecycle callbacks and is an important concept for all Android Developers to learn about. Solving this issue will help them learn about it and implement it in a project as well. I would not encourage locking the screen orientation :)
I think 1, 2 and 3 it's also your problem, because with CombatTag or CombatLog instead PvPManager fly event in plugins WGFlyFlag and FlightPack work normal.

The syntax is actually working for me. I use it in all of my scripts. But yeah you are right. I should not split a list variable as it seems not to be working this way.
I create a static Jedis object when project starting.   In the process of the whole project alive , the Jedis Object as a singleton provide services, but when a sentinel down, this **error** will be report all the time.
I'll investigate more next week.
I'll give it a try but I suspect I'll have a hard time getting a reproducible testcase. Regarding your proposed solution: do you really have to do a `read()`? Calling `java.nio.channels.Channel.isOpen()` should return false at least in the above case.

The IDE version I was using was 1.5.7. [Here](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/TFT/utility/Adafruit_GFX.h#L272-275) is the link to the file. After `} // end scanline` the file should be closed with `img._bmpFile.close();` on line 274. The issue seems to be present in version 1.5.8 too. 
@fpj I hit the problem while developing a unit test for the writer.  I don't think the specific error is significant.    Take a look at the referenced code block, observing that the `pendingWritesCount` is not decremented on error, causing a subsequent `flush` to wait forever for `pendingWritesCount` to reach zero.
@arvindsv I noticed that with the plug-in but I didn't raise it was because it was working with 18.7. So, I presumed something about how the server handles it has changed.   Now, if you look at my report, you will see that the form params on both versions are same. However as it enters the rails layer, the input payload has got restructured a bit. If you can help me with how the request gets processed until the rails controller part, it would help me debug this further too.   I can revert to an older plug-in version as a workaround before either fixing here or in the plug-in.   Let me know.

the way we are getting the device count is incorrect.   `hostMachineDeviceManager.getDevicesByHost().getAllDevices().size()` gives the count of all sims+real devices. Ideally, we should read the caps and get the corresponding devices and add it our `deviceCount`

No, I got this error myself testing walking to bank the script ran for 5 minutes, clicked a ladder. The floor and landscape changed then got this error when the script should run towards the bank NPC. All though I'm casting the matrix from locatable because I switch between npc & object. One of my users claims he encountered this after spinning ~4000 bowstrings.  Code: <code>final TileMatrix matrix = ((Locatable) bank).tile().matrix(ctx); ctx.movement.findPath(matrix.tile().derive(-1, +1)).traverse();</code> 
Probably that’s the problem... When I attach the debugger to the emulator or phone the bug doesn't appear. 
It's the best I can do for this one, it comes up in my crashlytics crashes. I'll see if I can find some device correlation, but if I remember it was scattered across 4 and 5 and different manufacturers.

Interesting! It looks like I misinterpreted what I experienced -- you're right it has to do with the list length and not the contents. That makes a lot more sense. I've updated the issue to include the latest information including that this was found on a Motorola G4 running Android 7.0. It seems to has to do with when items need to scroll.  I'd be ok to close this since I think you're right there's not likely to be anything we can do.

Yeah, [this line](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/storage/DBReader.java#L1066) should be `return lhs.getTitle().toLowerCase().compareTo(rhs.getTitle().toLowerCase());`  I didn't take into account multiple languages, it's not really a major thing anyway. 
No I have this bug on 0.4.1, I don't see the v0.4.2 on play store. I think this bug is only on the streamers who have not much viewers (~50) - Username  ghostxts

Basically it just felt like something was not right.  I banged my head against this for a while, and it would only work if I wrap the TimerTask.run() call in its own thread.  If I wrap any larger unit (e.g. the whole contents of the onTimer()) it would tend to block at the first call of synchronized code.  Even though that should have worked.  It is also possible, I suppose, that there was just a standard race condition that was causing it and didn't have anything to do with the generated code.

I guess that you create new Images at some point. Just create them as static fieleds once.  instead of calling return FMUIPlugin.getImage(imgPath); every time just cache them.  See ConfigurationMapLabelProvider.getColumnImage  The images might actually already exist somewhere.  We could also just rewrite the method FMUIPlugin.getImage to cache the images in a map.

[Nuclearcraft-Test.zip](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/NuclearCraft/files/1693562/Nuclearcraft-Test.zip)  I also found another bug.

@spinscale  1) - I don't know if it's happens on a non-scripted field - I don't have any fields that are always the same ratio of another field for comparison  2)  https://gist.github.com/yehosef/f96dc491bcd5ee9bf7d3 is the query I also included the index template - perhaps it's related to doc_values.    3) I'm not sure if I can share the data right now - if you contact me at my name at gmail, I can probably give you temp access to the marvel/kibana install. Because store is off for everything, you can't see the values but it might help in the debug.  If that doesn't help we can look at giving access to the data.  To give some background - this is a testing server to test load/capabilities for a server.  We have storing all fields to "off" and are using doc_values.  It's a single 16G machine with 8G heap - 220M rows, ~60G storage. 
That build works great! Thanks!  On an off note, I can't get the project to compile with the provided POM because of a repo error - any way to fix this?  ``` Caused by: org.apache.maven.wagon.TransferFailedException: Failed to transfer file: https://repo.dustplanet.de/artifactory/libs-release-local/net/gravitydevelopment/updater/updater/3.0.3/updater-3.0.3.pom.

Yes this was the cause. Some pools use Usage instead of CollectionUsage. See my PR that fixes it, at least for Java 11 on HotSpot
In this issue I'm discussing only **non-static** fields. This problem does not occur with static fields.  > What is it that you are trying to do that triggered this problem?  I was using a final field with a PerTxBox to implement an optimization in the BPlusTree when I stumbled upon this situation. I've already found a way to work around the problem by removing final and using different initialization code...  > if it varies from one instance to another, then it is because its value depends on some parameter passed to a constructor. But then, during a future load of the object, that information is no longer accessible, if the value of the slot was not made persistent  Its value can depend not only on constructor parameters, but also on any changes made to the object. Just imagine a tail with a number of hairs; the cat can chew on its tail and lose hair (perhaps I should have used a dog instead). It's true that the number of hairs is not persisted. When a cat is fetched from the database, the number of hairs is reset. Worse - if the transaction is restarted the number of hairs is NOT reset... But the cat should **always** have a tail (because of the final semantics).  What if the programmer knows all this; that the field is not persistent and not transactional, but still wants to use it for other ends (i.e. keeping a temporary value of an intermediate calculation)? Or is the use of non-dml-fields an invalid use-case for the framework, and thus not an issue?

Yes, they are in my Quality Profile "I created a quality profile containing one rule from the findbugs repository and all of the rules from Find Security Bugs"  I see the Profile Exporter is what's used by the FindBugs Plugin to generate the findbugs-included.xml.  But the exporter is setup to only honor Findbugs and FbContrib repositories.  See -> https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-findbugs/blob/2.4/src/main/java/org/sonar/plugins/findbugs/FindbugsProfileExporter.java#L61  It seems like it would work if I could put a findsecbugs-rules.xml where it could be found https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-findbugs/blob/2.4/src/main/java/org/sonar/plugins/findbugs/FindbugsRuleRepository.java#L48  but I don't know how ServerFileSystem works.  Everything I'm seeing makes it appear I need to build my own version the 2.4 Findbugs plugin with a FindSecurityBugsRuleRepository embedded directly, but I'd like to figure out how yours is working to run without such changes. 
This is strange because for me LagGoogle add the Color automatically and everithing work fine for me....  What version of Java are you using? I use personnally 1.8.0_201 64 bit, and start my modpack with MultiMC... After that I really can't help you because I never get any issue with that mod...  Somes mods can have problem with really old version of java, but, that you possibly know, because you are java developper...

To reproduce it is if you have another mod installed with a tank, like Extra Utilities Drums, try rightclicking the drum with the oil bucket, or if there is oil in there because of pump, it can't find the bucket for the fluid.

Most of the time the crash does not happen on first startup anymore, instead on the 2nd launch of the game. It crashes with only Curios and it's addons installed about half the time, however when it crashes once it will not stop crashing no matter what until I remove it all. Somehow gets fixed after a few tries and fiddling with my mod list (removing everything then adding it back, removing curios, etc.) Currently trying the new build, no issues so far.
The latest update seems to have fixed the issue, i can see lots of pages with items when i search "EMC:" in NEI. Approx 6000 items or so vs 2000ish before 
 Thanks for quick response.  There is a prompt before doing any downloading, and after that the data is cached, so it then behaves like any other data frame. This strikes me as the sort of thing active bindings were meant for, but I could be wrong.  Writing R extensions mentions wrapping C pointers and database access as examples. Either could cause problems if done without the users intent.   > On Mar 7, 2019, at 2:38 PM, Kevin Ushey <notifications@github.com> wrote: >  > Thanks for the bug report! >  > In the case of active bindings, this causes execution of potentially heavy and interactive code, e.g. asking user if they wish to download data (hiding behind the active binding symbol). >  > This seems like a particularly aggressive use of an active binding; I wouldn't expect an active binding in general to perform heavy computation behind the scenes.

I am not sure what you are asking. Annotations have been implemented for all the Repositories. It is part of the Repository interface. It is supposed to show the 'blame' data on the file page. The problem seems to be somewhere in the generation of the web page, I cannot figure out where this is handled in the .jsp files. The very first time the Annotate link is poked generates the call to the individual Repository interface to get the data. Subsequent selections do nothing more that hide/show (via html class addition/removal).

Sorry for replying late. The point was I did not add any user. After adding a user everything was fine. Shouldn't happen, though. Maybe prevent BT connection when there are no users.

What I have is:  https://github.com/ktf/AliceO2/tree/bazel-support  where you can for example do `bazel build @root//:cling`. Given this is a subset of tensorflow (i.e. the part which builds llvm), plus some extra stuff to build parts of clang, I am surprised this is not a common issue. Notice I build on my local laptop (2015 MBP) with no external cache.

e.g.  ```Micronauts DefaultHttpHostResolver or the necessary instantiation of a HttpRequest causing Exceptions, when running in a custom runtime lambda: com.amazonaws.serverless.exceptions.InvalidRequestEventException: Invalid Request: Illegal character in path at index 13: https://null/{proxy+} at io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautRequestReader.readRequest(MicronautRequestReader.java:123) at io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautRequestReader.readRequest(MicronautRequestReader.java:48) at io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.AbstractLambdaContainerHandler.proxy(AbstractLambdaContainerHandler.java:204) at io.micronaut.function.aws.runtime.MicronautLambdaRuntime.startRuntimeApiEventLoop(MicronautLambdaRuntime.java:131) at io.micronaut.function.aws.runtime.MicronautLambdaRuntime.main(MicronautLambdaRuntime.java:77) Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal character in path at index 13: https://null/{proxy+} at java.net.URI.create(URI.java:852) at io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautAwsProxyRequest.getUri(MicronautAwsProxyRequest.java:193) at io.micronaut.http.HttpRequest.getPath(HttpRequest.java:85) at io.micronaut.function.aws.proxy.MicronautRequestReader.readRequest(MicronautRequestReader.java:79) Caused by: java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 13: https://null/{proxy+} at java.net.URI$Parser.fail(URI.java:2848) at java.net.URI$Parser.checkChars(URI.java:3021) at java.net.URI$Parser.parseHierarchical(URI.java:3105) at java.net.URI$Parser.parse(URI.java:3053) at java.net.URI.<init>(URI.java:588) at java.net.URI.create(URI.java:850) ... 7 more ```  After I got an idea what happend I tried the some test events in the AWS Lambda console which lead me to `NullPointerExceptions` of properties that should not be null e.g. the `AwsRequestContext` of `AwsProxyRequest` where my test event was: ``` {   "resource": "/env",   "path": "/env",   "httpMethod": "GET",   "requestContext": {     "resource": "/env",     "path": "/env"   } } ```  ThEn I replaced `camelCase` named properties with `snake_case` named (e.g. `requestContext` with `request_context`) and came a step further in the code.  But just from reading the code (with very basic knowledge of Micronaut) it seems, that the global `ObjectMapper` is used for parsing JSON into `AwsProxyRequest` which then lead to errors when I change the jackson config in `application.yml`.
Ok, I will let you know by tonight 
Hi, I moved to a SMTP service using port 587 instead of 465 (for this last one I tested with firewall enabled/disabled and for two providers)... and it's working. So it's ok for me ! Thanks M
> Can you provide some steps to reproduce the "not enough cards" not showing an error?  I simply tried to generate a deck for the Battle for Zendikar set to do some random testing. 
no i did not 
its create the response.json file. but inCaptureOrSimulationMode does not check properly the existence of the file. response.json file is exist it should not goes into simulation mode. its always goes into capture mode
@Siedlerchr It is fixed. Yay! Thanks a lot.
Hello @surli  @monperrus   Apologies for the late reply.  I ran the basic example today, without any modifications  ```java package com.sample.spoon;  public class App  { 	public static float test2=0; 	public static App a=null;     public void print()     {     	int test=20;     	     	String abc="";     	if(test>20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int" + test);     	} else {     		System.out.println( "Testing else" + test);     	}     	     	if(test<20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int second if" + test);     	}    	     }          private void print2()     {     	int test=20;     	if(test>20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int" + test);     	} else {     		System.out.println( "Testing else" + test);     	}     	     	if(test<20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int second if" + test);     	}    	     } } ```  The Processor I defined is  ```java public class StatementProcessor extends AbstractProcessor<CtStatement>{ 	@Override 	public void process(CtStatement statement) { 		System.out.println(statement.toString()); 	} } ```  The way of calling the processor is main method ```java public class AppTest { 	public static void main(String[] args) {  		try { 			SpoonModel spooner = new SpoonModel().addSource(new File("src/main/java/com/sample/spoon/App.java")); 			spooner.process(StatementProcessor.class); 			spooner.print(new File("output/spoonedInstrument")); 		} catch (Exception e) { 			e.printStackTrace(); 		} 	} } ```  The output I get is given below:  ```java package com.sample.spoon;   public class App {     public static float test2 = 0;      public static com.sample.spoon.App a = null;      public void print() {         int test = 20;         java.lang.String abc = "";         if (test > 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int" + test));         }else {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing else" + test));         }         if (test < 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int second if" + test));         }     }      private void print2() {         int test = 20;         if (test > 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int" + test));         }else {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing else" + test));         }         if (test < 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int second if" + test));         }     } } ```  I guess without any changes/modifications the classpath import is still prefixed to System.out.println  I have observed an other issue with this.  The new out put file if you observe closely, The System.out.println(("There are two enclosing ()")) , instead of System.out.println("The proper syntax")
What I don’t understand in this is that it runs perfectly well in Boot 1.0.2.RELEASE. It also runs on Boot 1.1.1.RELEASE but only if I manually override the version of the spring-boot-maven-plugin to 1.0.2.RELEASE.  When I compare the two jar files, I only notice a difference in the loader classes (org.springframework.boot.loader). The rest of the jars is identical. 
I restarted the phone, (I had tried killing the app time ago) but this doesn't work, this is happening since  several days ago, and seems a permanent issue, will try changing the avatar again to see what happens. 
Hi @martijnvg - Sorry! It was just a copy/paste error. I had the right description for that step, but grabbed the wrong JSON block. I've updated my issue - does it make more sense now?
I just did not want to introduce another parameter that sort of serves the purpose of the topic parameter.  I think having two parameters with mutually exclusive rule is more complicated.  It just seemed that supporting a "variable" in the topic parameter is simpler.  In the future, if we do support allowing attributes in parameter for Java operator, the code changes required to migrate is smaller.  Once a parameter is introduced, it becomes an API.  I do not want to have to support this extra parameter when we support attributes in parameter in the future. 
it was because i declared the UpdateChecker object as a static variable. sry in Android Studio i wrote as solution:  import com.rampo.updatechecker.Notice; import com.rampo.updatechecker.UpdateChecker;  ```     UpdateChecker checker = new UpdateChecker(this);     //noinspection AccessStaticViaInstance     checker.setNotice(Notice.NOTIFICATION);     //noinspection AccessStaticViaInstance     checker.start(); ```  package i use in gradle is: compile 'com.github.rampo.updatechecker:library:2.0.0'  let me know if you want to know more 
They are `javax.naming` classes. Adding  ``` -dontwarn javax.naming.** ```  bypasses the issue for the `example/routeguide` project. For my project I'm getting:  ``` Warning: com.google.protobuf.CodedInputStream$SkippedDataSink: can't find referenced method 'int access$000(com.google.protobuf.CodedInputStream)' in program class com.google.protobuf.CodedInputStream Warning: com.google.protobuf.CodedInputStream$SkippedDataSink: can't find referenced method 'byte[] access$100(com.google.protobuf.CodedInputStream)' in program class com.google.protobuf.CodedInputStream ```  Ignoring `com.google.protobuf` gets me past the issue but then `minify` borks on writing out the jar file because of duplicate entries:  ``` Warning: Exception while processing task java.io.IOException: Can't write [.../android/app/build/intermediates/transforms/proguard/development/release/0.jar] (Can't read [.../android/app/build/intermediates/transforms/desugar/development/release/107.jar(;;;;;;**.class)] (Duplicate zip entry [107.jar:com/google/protobuf/AbstractMessageLite$Builder.class])) ```  So it looks like the issues are slightly different, but similar. 
no, nothing else the uxguide your read as well and the monitor I'm looking at :-)   There's a table about fonts which states the color of the main instruction for the normal theme - but don't know how/where to get it if users had changed it on their system.  Also, there seems to be a bug in Swing's lookup of default font: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11309861/bug-or-feature-swing-default-gui-font-incorrect-for-win6 - as a side-effect, the typeface of the main instruction is wrong (should be SegoeUI, not Tahoma)   
It could be possible, to write such kind of test, but I'm not sure.  The point is that you need 2 different threads, which are calling `getTypeDeclaration` from the same type reference at the same time, so they both enter here: https://github.com/INRIA/spoon/blob/10e983b20f7bbf793e87d965f2e1730f48f35bc8/src/main/java/spoon/reflect/factory/TypeFactory.java#L555  BTW, does it seem like a bug to you, or `getTypeDeclaration()` is not supposed to be thread safe?
Well I dont know much about the key modifiers used in Windows/Ubuntu, but the whole seemed quite consistent for me on Mac. Now, I barely use the arrow keys.   Of course we need to rationalize them (so that the same modifiers have the same effect on both mouse and arrows).  No problem for me (if it is documented) to remove the menu for switching between rotate/translate with the mouse.  The ROI is quite ugly at the moment, but potentially VERY useful. I will probably open a whole new issue (or we stay on this one). It works like in the movie below. I think this possibility to have a way to draw an area (in 2D or maybe 3D ?), to measure its size, and to select a whole set of agents is really interesting.   Now, its limitations are mainly that it only works in 2D. Having the same in 3D would be awesome (but clearly too much work, not on the OpenGL side, but on the logic side of the display of agents: we dont record in OpenGL where each agent is drawn and so the ROI bases its calculation on the shape of the agents, which is not always true).  ![screencast 2016-04-02 12-58-15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/579256/14224808/92fa1acc-f8d3-11e5-99a4-340889e74b1f.gif) 
@DhavalShewale I am using 2.1.6 Version for SBA. Could you please share me the exact location where the new label gets positioned?
oh yes we have examples, I'm currently working on a PR for AbstractClusteringManagementTest and EhcacheManagerToStringTest But I think @gibsong  also listed others.  That said, I did not have your issue on windows... 
Removing toString might work, it could just potentially break some backward compatibility (e.g. transform map files which map "Undefined" to something else).  And it does not solve a deeper problem: If you post UNDEF on a StringItem, it will not reconstruct an UnDefType, but a StringType instead. So I wonder if we might have to introduce some reserved keyword and put the UnDefType at the top of the acceptedDataTypes in StringItem...? 
Calling the @golang//... is doing it, but I'm saying it's not happening when you use a target that depends on that repository.   I'm getting this with rules_go. I have this is in my WORKSPACE:      new_http_archive(         name = "golang_linux_amd64",         build_file_content = "",         sha256 = "bb8fe0d81161e4a8b0a8b2145ee5f8a60370baf5d48c07a83f6f09e1ad253bec",         strip_prefix = "go",         url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8rc1.linux-amd64.tar.gz",     )      new_http_archive(         name = "golang_darwin_amd64",         build_file_content = "",         sha256 = "faf2530afbc78d8fa64054960a130f10aa2b183abd5879cdfd2ec1a4bca01ff3",         strip_prefix = "go",         url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.8rc1.darwin-amd64.tar.gz",     )      git_repository(         name = "io_bazel_rules_go",         remote = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go.git",         commit = "d0142854a22a0dd98306280e897e64086289a0de",     )      load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:def.bzl", "go_repositories", "new_go_repository")      go_repositories(omit_go = True)   The `omit_go` allows me to use the golang repositories I specified instead of rules_go using an older version. And I have this in a BUILD file:      go_library(         name = "go_default_library",         srcs = ["main.go"],         visibility = ["//visibility:private"],         deps = [],     )      go_binary(         name = "something_nice",         library = ":go_default_library",         visibility = ["//visibility:public"],     )  And if I change the two golang repositories to another version, and run `bazel build //path/to/something_nice`, the new versions of the Go repositories are not downloaded and used.
yes it will be fixed. should be fixed now (via https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1964)  On Fri, Jul 1, 2016 at 3:17 PM, David Bernick notifications@github.com wrote:  > I'm running gatk-launch which generates this commandline.

now it's fine 
Here is the top match of the search:  http://pastebin.com/x3caXrVg 
I fixed the link. Also, I have just verified that this problem occurs only on a linux box but not on a Windows box. 
That seems like a reasonable solution. Should I reopen the issue for now then? 
Yes, you are right. Some days ago I installed original 2.0.0 Google mi fit (automatically updated). And now Hart rate sensor don't work. As you can see,  every app says,  that I have hr version 0.0.0.0.  I tried to downgrade, install the same software. I have only one error message "problem with transfer  Metadata"   I think problem with sending software (or getting it by mi1s).   Hope you understand my mind)  About logs - I've already attached it)   I found that this bag is very old, and some people put MI band in refrigerator for some hours. I've tried it, but it's doesn't work :( 
Spring 4.2.4. I am afraid we are not using spring-osgi. I tried to add some dependency for spring-osgi but that led to some compilation errors within our code which should not happen of course.
I did not find any other command with the same problem. 
I can reproduce with both enabling and disabling the chunkloading in the config. When disabled, it's fairly easy to do. When enabled, you just need to reach the chunkloaders limit, which is pretty easy in a public SMP server. 
Added a full log, it contains a bit other related stuff too but please have a look here: https://gist.github.com/drindt/9c7e40d5798b94fdf69e  If you need further information or i can do something please let me know. Thank you! 
Thanks for the pointer.
Yes that's right. Just tried the lock screen and that works fine. The buttons in the drop-down (notifications) also work fine. But still not the main player (after selecting the episode). 
Same mistake
Sorry, I corrected it so I should have closed it ! 
Not really, but I get spammed a lot by this message: `Loading FXML document with JavaFX API of version 11.0.1 by JavaFX runtime of version 10.0.2` whenever I mouse over a game on the game list. I'm using jdk 10 installed separately to /opt, so I don't know why it's complaining.
Was finding the logs earlier, and have added them to the original post (had some issues with adb disconnecting, not related to tvheadend or the app). I doubt this is a network issue, as surely that would affect the "Media Player" player as well?  I can go over my networking kit's logs (all enterprise stuff) if you want. 
If they are placed with async ways and aren't stuck to a block they get destroyed
Because it worked OK in Chrome 38. fitBounds in Leaflet seems to cause this. In leaflet changelog there is one bugfix for infinite loop when changing map center after setting map center. Maybe this is it. Fix is changing Leaflet from 0.5.1 to Current 0.7.3. I'm working on PR and testing if this breaks something else. Currently it seems that everything is smoother now. 
Disable auto-build does not sound like an option. We rather need special treatment and problem markers for these cases.
Yeah, give me a minute to launch the game. Also, as another note, the auto GUI setting is actually bigger than large in my case. 
I am running 3.6.7(by the plugin/yml) but i feel like i just updated it yesterday. Yes they respawn back to the main spawn, but with whatever item they had in creative inventory when they joined. 
Yes, I set it to maven. If I right click on a module pom and press update then sometimes it becomes a java project but only until the next restart 
yes i do i have both iron chest and iron shulker boxes installed
From the log, the failed test  uses 9558 and 9557 ports. But before the failed test ends, there is one more test started the gateway at port 8555. The tests are run differently for ssl as we wanted to set a security property before JSSE is initialized. We specify forkCount=1 in surefire plugin config in transport.ssl/pom.xml  But my guess is that parallel execution may not be the issue here. There is some exception happened as you can see in the log, but the cause is not posted on the logs (4363 [New I/O worker #35] DEBUG transport.ssl.accept - Error on SSL connection, closing connection: java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException)  ## See below interleaving of two gateways  2826 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Starting services 2827 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:9558 2827 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - tcp://localhost:9557 ... 4083 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Starting server 4083 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Starting services 4084 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:8555 ... 4388 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:8555 4388 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Stopped services ... 4392 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - Stopping services 4392 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - ssl://localhost:9558 4392 [Time-limited test] INFO org.kaazing.gateway.server.Gateway - tcp://localhost:9557 
It is the same phone. First with CM 4.4.1 and now I installed a new ROM because I had some issues: http://forum.xda-developers.com/devdb/project/?id=7565  Because the RAM is limited processes are closed very fast after switching the window.

@azatsarynnyy that would be awesome. parametrized task is ok for now, I guess
I've completed the changes for this, but I don't believe I have the right permissions to complete a pull request.  ```Permission to cucumber/cucumber.git denied to KyleFairns.``` appears when I try to push to a new branch  There was only one file changed for the code, and three tests were removed that tested the escaping of square brackets (however, they are now special characters in terms of cucumber-expressions).  Is there a way for me to gain those permissions, or would you like me to just post the changes below?
I tested without DS and SF, and still happened. I'll do some more tests to see what mod is breaking things. The odd thing is that it worked correctly in a similar setup (that had DS and SF), so I'll run a diff between the modlists and see what's different.
If I have no log no problem ^^ but once log start coming it freezes, no need to have much in my case. But append every time 
I see this from time to time. I don't know where it comes from. 
It should look like this (customizable in messages.yml) ![2019-11-22_23 59 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50475262/69466405-3dafd880-0d84-11ea-8e0d-075cbebeb672.png) 
Default textures aren't patterned so you don't see the overlap, however in the interests of resourcepacks it really needs to be addressed. 
Yeah, [this line](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/blob/develop/core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/storage/DBReader.java#L1066) should be `return lhs.getTitle().toLowerCase().compareTo(rhs.getTitle().toLowerCase());`  I didn't take into account multiple languages, it's not really a major thing anyway. 
> Hi hvsimon, >  > I think this issue might be related to timezones or a day boundary. Do you mind providing the timezone of your device and about what time of day you found this bug?  The timezone is UTC+8 and I found it at 14:12 UTC+8. 
I just tried creating a new game with the same modules active (all that potions is dependent on) and i was unable to reproduce it as well. I think it is safe to close this issue since it was most likely a local issue with that specific save. I'll keep an eye out for it occurring again when i use the game later tonight.
is there any mod else i need to download for Agricraft to work ? 
Here you are.  Yes, I know I should have used JMH instead of caliper, but somehow my mvn got borked, thus JMH doesn't run ATM. Still, the results are so far off that I think there must be something amiss & it should be easy enough to reproduce.

I am logged in with ver. 0.2.1. No issues. Still tagging PokeStops and everything. 
i added a caldav sync adapter account connected to a radicale caldav server running on a vps of mine. i get a message saying that it was successfully added, and then i go to the calendars view, and see that no calendars are found yet. but then in a few seconds of navigating around menus, i see one calendar show up in the list. then maybe 30 seconds later (or even much later), i see the other calendar for that account show up in the available calendars list.  one of the times i tried this, i saw three calendar events show up. each event was for a different month. another time, no events showed up. after being first added, the account detail in the system preferences shows that it is syncing for a long time.  what i expected was for both calendars to appear when the first calendar appears, or within a few seconds. i also expected all of my events to show up, since i have more than 3 events on my calendars.  as for the original bug report, eventually all calendars showed up. also, i don't think that i actually merged in the ssl patch anyhow ( #83 ). i am using a cyanogenmod 10.2 nightly on the i9100 (galaxy s2) and am mostly pleased with its stability.  thanks! :-) 
@vietj works with my test suite, so seems to be fine.

It only happens when I have sentinel added to its traits.
Yeah, that's the idea, use the saved information from when they logged in and try to authenticate when the app starts. What do you mean log in information though? We cannot save username and password, we don't have access to that. We only have access to the token. If you check out [this line](https://github.com/jorgegil96/All-NBA/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/jorgegil/closegamealert/View/Activities/LoginActivity.java#L106), I have already saved the token in shared preferences. What you need to do on startup is use that saved token to get a new valid one, you can use [OAuthHelper.setRefreshToken(String)](http://thatjavanerd.github.io/JRAW/docs/0.7.0.2/net/dean/jraw/http/oauth/OAuthHelper.html#setRefreshToken%28java.lang.String%29) followed by [OAuthHelper.refreshToken(Credentials)](https://thatjavanerd.github.io/JRAW/docs/0.7.0.2/net/dean/jraw/http/oauth/OAuthHelper.html#refreshToken%28net.dean.jraw.http.oauth.Credentials%29) to retrieve another valid access token, where String=saved token and Credentials is [something like this](https://github.com/jorgegil96/All-NBA/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/jorgegil/closegamealert/View/Activities/LoginActivity.java#L42).  This logic would go inside [this method](https://github.com/jorgegil96/All-NBA/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/jorgegil/closegamealert/Utils/RedditAuthentication.java#L34), before starting the current UserlessAuthTask you check if there is a token saved, if there is one then you try to authenticate with it by making a new "UserAuthTask" AsyncTask, if there isn't, then you strat the UserlessAuthTask. 
nice ! 
I'll try to make a small example asap. Thanks! 
Thanks for confirming.    +1 for (evil) default silent credentials
So maybe this is related with data. I'm abroad right now but later I'll try to get more info for you. This could be related also with the number format  #,##   I've got a lots of values where the third place is important  0.051 0,053  I think this related with creating the axis.  Please try this on a list with numbers like:  0,21 - 0,29 0,031 - 0,050  The in 2.2.4 Axis is not showing (as you can see on the image). Everything works fine when you have bigger numbers.  I didn't change anything else to create the screenshots - just the 2.2.2 -> 2.2.4 update. I'm back on 2.2.2

@yurem, I can't find the package in the repo anymore, but I have been testing Ubuntu 16.04 with **gluu-server-3.1.4_1.Beta2** and at least this issue seems to be fixed.

Of course (I removed non relevant fields):  ``` json {     "title":{       "type":"string",     "analyzer":"french"   },   "stores":{       "type":"nested",     "include_in_parent":true,     "properties":{         "id":{           "type":"string",         "index":"not_analyzed"       },       "location":{           "type":"geo_point"       }     }   } } ```  In my documents `stores` is an array of objects. There are usually 50-200 nested documents per root document.  I didn't use the "nested" query in my previous message, because it doesn't change anything to the performance issue. But I still need to use "nested" in my case (I have other fields). 
According to my friend, c:geo hasn't asked him about storage permissions, because "it was ok".  Also from the system information I can see `Write external storage permission: granted`, so it should be fine

Thanks @mikecroft   However need a clarification  We updated from glassfish3 to payara some time back For glassfish3 we used to disable chunking on the http-listener and not admin-listener  Is there any specific reason for change in functionality ?
Spider eyes look normal, with a slight glow to them, sorry bout not getting back to you sooner.
I see - this makes sense of course. I just was concerned, something referring the code was not correct. Using the ON/OFF buttons of the initial typical's node-screen would result in a recent change of sliders position after changing to the'manual screen'.  Your suggestion above concerning the state feedback sounds very interesting. If it's not to much work it would be nice.

deegree version is 3.3.18  I would rather have a fix for 3.3.x than wait around for 3.4 since we are planning to make use of Deegree for our national public delivery of datasets with WFS 2.0 and GML 3.2.1 
There are no additional log rows saying the index was completed and the system is still very slow/unresponsive. 
Will check it!!!! 
Yes, this was a one liner fixed as part of #703 
I tried building in Android Studio, but it fails with what looks like Java 9 dependencies.  I just switched to IntelliJ and that seems to be working.

[logCatOutput.txt](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/files/1951686/logCatOutput.txt) Hi, Here is a logcat output of the problem on my phone... This seems to be the same issue as #2498: ``` 04-26 16:48:51.031 15992 15992 E AndroidRuntime: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0 04-26 16:48:51.031 15992 15992 E AndroidRuntime: 	at android.support.v7.widget.GridLayoutManager.calculateItemBorders(GridLayoutManager.java:324)  ``` 
the MAC Address was not available when being set in .bashrc. I figured it out thanks to @mikagika  that it should probably be in .bash_profile instead of .bashrc . i can explain the diff to you if you want. I have opened an issue to make the change #135 . and i have updated the wiki, https://github.com/olentangyfrc/DeepSpace-2019/wiki/Getting-MAC-Address-from-Roborio 
An unenchanted Vanilla bow received Mending III only, an unenchanted vanilla fishing rod received Mending III and Lure VI (my memory might be off on this power of this enchantment?), and a book received Mending III only. I'm in age 5 so past any relevant gates. I had a look at https://github.com/HellFirePvP/AstralSorcery/blob/master/src/main/java/hellfirepvp/astralsorcery/common/registry/RegistryConstellations.java and noticed that some constellations further down have .setIgnoreCompatibility() , so maybe that's missing for Pelotrio?
Yah i can send you a screen shot but may take a minute.
@foghina  the device crashed is ASUS T00J. Since the API of the Fresco are different between 1.3.0 and 1.5, and our project originally use 1.3.0, I do not try to upgrade to latest version.  I tried to rebuild the 1.3.0 by adding the flags '-mstackrealign -mincoming-stack-boundary=4', but the output library libstatic-webp.so has nothing different in the size and the function entry, and the app still crashed when using that library. I guess that may be not the esp disalignment leaded to crash. 
jensopetersen described very well the problem. 
yes 
Hi, @yfuks  I didn't override ReactActivity.onCreate. So I think the problem is related with RN. My code is below: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7940552/12816443/83221cae-cb87-11e5-9487-6c31a3839ffd.png) ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7940552/12816456/98091b2c-cb87-11e5-9f4b-453f545c1efb.png) I set two breakpoints in MainActivity.onActivityResult function, but the program did not go to there. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7940552/12816511/d5a5293a-cb87-11e5-8ef3-9084b6f04823.png) So the showImagePicker has no log.  But I test several times, sometimes it works well, the showImagePicker can get the uri. 
Its most likely some kind of firewall, however I wouldnt know what plugin would cause it. I've gone trough the plugin list and asked to disable all the ones that I tought might change something about placing blocks but didnt come up with annything.
no error messing in the gui, and I can't see anything related in the server log. I'm trying to change the triggers selected altering which check boxes are selected but changes aren't being saved. Also As I now have 2 notifications I tried to delete one but it didn't delete.   I have tried editing from global manage addons link then configure, and also by selecting pull request notifier from repository settings page.   (I don now since seem to have been able to delete one of the notifications, but not sure which page it worked from as no change was apparent at the time I clicked delete, but after leaving page and then going back to it the item was no longer there, also now the remaining item I can see from the repositories page, but does not show up on the manage add ons configure page for pull request notifier

I can't reproduce this any more. I had the problem with the Maven plugin 3.2.1 on a complex schema. I've since changed the schema to avoid this. I haven't been able to generate a test case that does it.  I'll close this and if I managed to reproduce it, I'll re-open it. Thanks.

![Screenshot_20200111-142044](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1694705/72209554-aca0d800-347d-11ea-9475-12db24cd891e.png)  I've already listed the steps to reproduce. It should be quite straightforward.
There are two places where info is recorded: there are the  sets of IRIs (one for classes, one for restrictions, one for each kind of property, etc).  These are only kept for the duration of the parsing. Then there is a multimap, which records guessed-at types, removing them if an explicit type is seen. This is stored in the format that is kept in the ontology manager.  The hack of  pretending that the cons cell is really a class or a datatype does not need the multimap.  This class and the triple handlers should be refactored. I believe it will have precisely two :-)

Vlad, I am not sure how to reference what you have called 1.1 RC. I am using the OpenGrok that is on the main branch here at GitHub.  I tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. They all exhibited bad behavior of jumping to top of page after selecting folding icon. I then modified the mentioned line in the code and tested again in those 3 browsers and they behaved more as I expected, lines associated with the fold disappearing without moving the page.
I don't know. Happens in FTB Beyond 1.8.1, MC 1.10.2
>  >  > does the issue happen without authme installed?  Yes, i'm using java 11. Thanks for the helpful link, it helped me solve my issue. owo
@h3xstream you're not asking me, are you?   I guess the basic problem is, why a `getClassName` call returns a method name. That sounds awfully wrong to me. 
Using the existing fork would be fine, a new branch with a unique name would allow multiple iterations which usually will happen if the app is actively developed, maybe you can simply number them 1, 2, 3 or add a date-string, so they are easier to distinguish/put in order.
Metadata obiuvsly is in the module not in the app that is using library :  ``` <application         android:allowBackup="true" >        <meta-data             android:name="QUERY_LOG"             android:value="true"         <meta-data             android:name="DATABASE"             android:value="mobilesdkinternal.db"/>         <meta-data             android:name="VERSION"             android:value="1"/>      <meta-data             android:name="DOMAIN_PACKAGE_NAME"             android:value="com.mylibrary.sugarobjecs"/>   </application> ``` 
Take one of our caches; GC3HJ8Q. Here the displayed cache owner name is displayed as "Cecilie & John Magnus". This is not my real username, witch instead is "john.magnus".   When selecting "Caches hidden", c:geo (at least visually) tries to load caches from a with the displayed name and thus fails to load any more caches.
I'm always for properly documented and flexible configs. Can never say no to that.   I went through most of the fluids and had a couple of question: **Helium/Deuterium/etc.**  Are Helium and Liquid Helium both recognized as a fluid by forge? Or is one registered as a gas and the other is a fluid? Mostly asking for CraftTweaker reasons for processing blocks like the SuperCooler.  Would I need to use Mekanism gas tubes/gas tanks to store Helium, and then use Thermal Dynamics fluiducts to extract the output? Same with Deuterium and any other 'gasses' that have a fluid counterpart?  **Fluids** Do the fluids have any functional in-world use? If I use the configs to disable the registered fluids, will the player be missing out on any gameplay that you have in the mod? (aside from burning themselves in molten plasma). I'm open to in-world mechanics (eg how Big Reactors uses fluids to cool its own reactors), but I just wanted to weigh off opportunity costs with the Block ID's (eg. the ID's used up by fluids could be used for adding PnematicCraft instead).  **Steam** Is NC steam oredict'd to steam? Is steam produced from reactors also functional with turbines from other mods (Extreme Reactors/Mekanism/Advanced Generators, etc)

Yes the response was missing "token_type" and this is more a bug of the Authorization server. Just a little surprised that this cause app to crash.

Yes when I checked the version in the command prompt it correctly says the version is 0.975.1
No, just a network timeout in the client log.  ``` [09:41:15] [Netty Client IO #4/ERROR] [FML/]: NetworkDispatcher exception io.netty.handler.timeout.ReadTimeoutException ```  Basically what happens is the client goes near the Buildcraft builder. Everything is working fine, and you can see the builder "spitting out" blocks as it is building. But a few seconds later everything stops, and then you time out. I also recorded CPU spikes of around +80% for the server when this was happening.  The builder was tested with the same blueprint in singleplayer and there were no issues.

Looks like there's two problems:  On one machine, it's a JVM memory issue error code 137. One another machine, it's the git clone on the host that has unknown userid/group.  ``` user@moby:~/che-build$ ls -la /home/user/che-build/dashboard/src/app/colors/che-color.constant.ts -rw-rw-rw- 1 1359488130 1359479297 1315 Jul 30 17:03 /home/user/che-build/dashboard/src/app/colors/che-color.constant.ts ```  Going to git clone inside the container ( correct userid/group is set ) and rebuild from there.
@apc999 yes, it affects both 2.0 and 1.8 
The first stack is obfuscated and the second is non-obfuscated. This issue definitely not occur if i don't apply proguard. And it seems only happened on OnePlus A0001(4.3) .

0.1.1b Latest one was looking similar altho no notifications makes it bit hard to understand completely 
It looks like it is the lightwell. Going from a Seared Gauge->Portable tank with the same settings and 288mb of fluid worked as expected.

I download the zip file and simply trying to build the code > mvn clean install -DskipTests Giving me above error. If I simply clone the project, then it doesn't give me any build error.  With the .zip project. How to fix the error ?  
Here is the code.  https://redocly.github.io/redoc/openapi.yaml   The problem occur when I edit the source code after I have imported the Swagger code.  Follow the steps to reproduce: 1. First I imported the code by paste the url. 2. Then I clicked on "edit api" and "live documentation". I everything works fine. 3. Now I want to change the source code, so I clicked on the buttion "source code" and changed the title (just added one more character). Then the error occur when I click on "live documentation" agian.  The error message: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8996276/63435240-db62d700-c426-11e9-89cb-2a0531e16bf6.png)  In advance- thanks for the help.
Version 1.2.2 
So from your experiment we can conclude that a value was printed which had a different in-memory representation than the reference value. Hypotheses:  * an equals method which was implemented wrongly (producing false where it should have produced true)    * this may happen sound like something about annotations went wrong, but that would have been the inverse situation I believe. `equals` should include annotations (and isEqual not).    * we forgot to override `equals and hashCode` somewhere, like in one of those annotation or keyword parametere wrapper classes    * we have a rarely triggered bug in an existing equals method, let's say one of the locations or the datetime implementations.
This is a general problem in our current architecture that's why we should discuss what to do. 
Umm, I think I described the bug badly. I wasn't referring to the searching of numbers. Let's say I have a number saved, e.g. `*101#` which allows me to check my prepaid balance. I then search for it, e.g. `bal` and it shows result `Account Balance *101#` along with two icons, one for direct message and one for direct dial. I click the direct dial, and instead of dialling `*101#`, it instead dials `*101` without the trailing hash.  PS: I'm from South Africa, and yes I can compile from source here :) 
1.12.2-0.9.5 of ID and 1.12-2.3.6.13 of thermal, looks like the newest ones.   Attaching screenshot of my current setup - without repeaters signals in redstone writers was chaging, but servos did not respond to that change. After some time even repeaters stopped working - on screenshot both are off, and one writer has simple negation of boolean in the other one.  ![2017-11-10_10 57 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17276063/32652923-4797f200-c606-11e7-9bd2-483ed5ed6ca6.png) 
@Midhun07 Sorry I wasn't clearer! Generally, forms post to the server URL that is in the settings. The XML of that form looks like this.. ``` <model>    <instance> ``` Forms can also post to form-specific URLs. This is required when using encrypted forms, but you can also just set it in regular forms. ``` <model>    <submission action="https://nafundi-test.appspot.com/submission" method="form-data-post"/>    <instance> ```  So in the case of a form submission where there is a form-specific URL and credentials are required, it'd be good if the error message referred to that form-specific hostname.   To test, set your device's server to https://opendatakit.appspot.com. Confirm this is working by getting blank form. You should see forms like Biggest N of Set, Birds, Cascading Select.   Now, rename this form ([custom-url.xml.txt](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/files/848378/custom-url.xml.txt)) to custom-url.xml and [manually push it to your device](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/#testing-a-form-locally). Note that the form XML has https://nafundi-test.appspot.com/submission as the submission url.  With your computer's browser, log into the https://nafundi-test.appspot.com with admin/admin. Go into Site Admin, then preferences, and uncheck all permissions for anonymousUser. Save Changes.  Now fill out the custom-url form on your device and try to send it in. It should show an alert that says you should enter the username and password for opendatakit.appspot.com. But that isn't correct! The server should be nafundi-test.appspot.com because that's what is in the form.  And to be extra sure things work when you are making your changes, try creating another user on the server with Data Collector privileges and make sure those credentials work.  When you are done testing, re-enable permissions for anonymousUser.
I changed the HWOrder to webclient,cbfs4,LanmanWorkstation,RDPNP,webclientc but it's the same behavior. Even after a restart of windows.
Just managed to solve it last night.  Was going through the PHP API forum and someone quoted a command with "value-name" parameter for unset functionality.  I tried it on the JAVA API and it worked.  Therefore, the command must be as follows:  `/ip/firewall/filter/unset .id=*9 value-name=time`  Thanks for replying.  Rgs Etienne
Thanks Alexander,   I don't know, how can I check if both components are synchronized?
[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/JfqNvlk.png)  It's overlapping the first line. 
Here are my gradle dependencies snippets for applicable libraries:  ``` +--- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web: -> 2.0.2.RELEASE (*) +--- org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-zuul: -> 2.0.0.RC2 +--- org.springframework.restdocs:spring-restdocs-mockmvc: -> 2.0.1.RELEASE +--- org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-wiremock: -> 2.0.0.RC2 ```  I think there is an incompatibility with how MockMvc handles forwarded requests. I see it's not really suported. But, it generally works from the restdocs perspective when I pass querystring params in the url, and when I pass the form content as body. If I try using `post(...).params(...)` then I can only make assertions on the `MockMvcResultMatchers.forwarded*` related parts.
Ηι, Sorry for the delay in answering. All timeplans we have are private and i can not share. I asked yo send me an example but this can be opened with warnings. Maybe the file length is the problem. We have mpp covering years and are a bit long.attached the small to see the warnings. Snother issue is that Gantt fills a lot the TEMP DI of windows (appl-local). The issue is that when the program is closed some temp.Gantt files remain.

I could do that, but it most likely depends heavily on client's machine, slower computer = bigger lag = bigger detection (?). So the value that is right for me might be bad for someone else.
No worries, i was loading the list items before and everything was near identical to the sample. I've since decided against AdMob altogether, please don't concern yourself! :) 
I was using the 2.0-SNAPSHOT. 
@sjudd This problem is caused by the mobile phone system. The mobile phone manufacturer has solved this problem.
Many thanks for fixing it! Currently I have a work around in place so a new release is not urgent at all. 
@krzyk I've edited the description and removed info about duplicate. And yes, I don't think we should punish with any violation people following rule described at http://www.yegor256.com/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html.  And stacktraces won't be much longer, it's usually just one more line per every rethrow. 
Sure, this is the file that needs reverting: https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer/blob/master/store-implementation/proxy-store/src/main/java/uk/gov/gchq/gaffer/proxystore/ProxyStore.java
Hey thanks for the quick reply!  Yep, `show_column_numbers = False` fixed the crash :+1: 
No, I call cancelDrag() from onPause() method, and release() from onDestory() method. onPause() should be invoked earlier than onDestroy().  
Hello, I´m sorry for responding late. But it took me some time to work with that tablet again. I made printscreens (including tablet version and type) see attachement.

We can set any environment variable, but we need to know what to set it to. I don't quite understand how the version code is computed. It would be best if the version name and code in F-Droid and in the PlayStore are the same.
1. Go to any comic that is not the last 2. Select "night theme" in the overflow menu in appbar 3. Select again "night theme" in the overflow menu in appbar 4. You are at the last comic
Its on the latest version of ATM 3 Remix running version 4.2.3 of Electroblob's. Tried it on multiple worlds and still get the same result.
I just have `B:GenerateAsteroids_true=true` at `endasteroids` section in config\GregTech\WorldGeneration.cfg, so they are generated in the End around central part. Also you can change `I:AsteroidProbability` to increase asteroids amount. 
Ok you can make the bug work right away. No filtering needed. Just get the second page and click on the item's icon. The recipe shown is the one from the item in the same place on the first page.
It's your fault! You spotted that stupid boxed Boolean bug and so got me wondering about static analysis. So I ran findbugs on our source code. You know what? It found a bunch of bugs! It also provided the insight behind #1625. 
Just tested with ImmersiveEngineering-0.12-89.jar but it does not seem to happen with just IE, JEI, and Betweenlands. I checked the IE config for the word "bucket" just in case, but did not see any relevant entries.
In my mod OMT I use 2 systems, one that tracks all listeners (on the server inventory container, detectAndSendChanges()) and just distributes a custom network message (simpleimpl) to each listener per tick. Explanation for the other is down further. They both make GUI information that is not inventory (since minecraft handles that itself) super smooth and doesnt impact performance nearly as much as block updates do.  For the first system that can be used for GUIs that have an inventory container: https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/openmodularturrets/client/gui/containers/TurretBaseContainer.java#L140-L149 https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/openmodularturrets/network/messages/MessageTurretBase.java   And I have an additional system that works for GUIs without inventory containers. It is a tiny bit more complicated and uses my Library mod. Basically the Tileentities that use it need to implement an interface, and have a list variable that gets updated through that interface. In their update() method they send a message to each member of that list containing needed information and additionally they scrub that list every 20 lists or so (checking player distance from block) in case a crash occurs or the gui did not close properly.   https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OMLib/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/omlib/network/ISyncableTE.java  This interface is then used by 2 messages that get sent during init of a gui on the client and on gui close: https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OMLib/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/omlib/client/gui/TrustedPlayersGUI.java#L75-L80 Those messages are really simple, they simply grab the listener list via a function on the interface and either add or remove a listener based on the contents of the message.  Sounds a bit complicated but this solved all the sync issues / performance (due to block updates/ unneceesary information flow) issues in my mod(s).
Yes, in my case it happens in a single thread.
Ok, I'll look into it 
I put the notifyClusterListener function in a new thread and everything is working fine. https://github.com/smulikHakipod/zigbee4java/commit/45336411bb7e24d34ddeb26b862ceb23e3d10d4c 
@RagaRBM no, I am using the latest build 
Group Manager.
I am not familiar with jstack but will try to take a look at it next week.  Forgot to mention that some of my digging I listened to the okhttp events and most of those 8 seconds are being while it is writing the http body. Also I can say that it is trying HTTP/1.1 and one of my tests was with this portocol only.

I have write fanart and poster, overwrite fanart and poster, write actor images, and write extra fan art when writing data....., and rename movie file. I already have most of my stuff scraped from data18 with the xbmc data 18 scraper. Your scraper brings in a much better poster image. higher resolution. And I use it to rename the folder to movie name with year. So if I scrape a movie with the standalone scraper it pulls in the better image but when I click write it doesn't overwrite the old image. It does everything else. Like change the folder name and overwrites the .nfo and the actor images. Other than it being the old crapy poster when I go back to the movie, I notice that the file size is still very small and the modified date is from the previous xbmc scraping. 
The config file is the same. I think it might have to do with the Mouse Tweaks mod, I think it was mentioned in the log.
Yes, but I think this has nothing to do with my issue; it's supposed to solve the problem when _children_ views are catching the events, not _parent_ views (ie. drawer layout in my case).  I am thinking that if there was a getParent().requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true) somewhere in the onTouchEvent code (eg. after we make sure the ListView should handle the event), it might work.  PS. I just got your reply through ajax while writing this and I see what you mean about usability; I have already implemented list item removal through a popupmenu, the swipe functionality will be a bonus eye-candy :-) 
Sorry I didn't mention my spring boot version. It's 2.0.0.M7 . Version 2.x should support Java 9.
Hello,  Yes i confirm that with the latest release it's ok 
haven't tried to recreate it with just actually additions but taking off my back pack makes it stop plus it does it with every tile entity being placed on another tile entity, must be a problem with iron backpacks, sorry for wasting your time dude XD
When the client starts there is a loding time. In this time i wanted to resize the window. When i resized the window by dragging from top border it moved and resized in height.  So when i started resizing the bounds were like  x:300 y:100 w:400 h:600. After resizing it was about x:300 y:183 w:400 h:517. While resizing it moved the window by the same amount the window got resized.  I think it could be resize and drag at the same moment, based on the window size. Because the windows forms top border was ca 83px under the mouse after dragging.  P.S. Not real numbers and i can not reproduce it because my pc is without os atm.
We had the parameters the other way around:  ``` this.properties = new CompositeValueMap(super.getValueMap(),overlayProperties); ``` If you fix that it's ok :-)
I can't find IT, IT maintenance staff told me not to use this software, which occupied the background resources seriously
Hi! Thank you for answer to my issue! There're no android session in the Personal Sessions sections, right know the only session is "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Saf..." where I'm browsing the UI And the client is installed from F-DROID https://f-droid.org/repo/com.owncloud.android_20200000.apk By the way, the unauthorized responses:  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <d:error xmlns:d="DAV:" xmlns:s="http://sabredav.org/ns">   <s:exception>Sabre\DAV\Exception\NotAuthenticated</s:exception>   <s:message>No 'Authorization: Basic' header found.

The GCal binding (not really a binding) could implement its function without the ConsoleInterpreter.  It has a simple syntax ([wiki](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/GCal-Binding)) where the description field of a Google Calendar entry is in the format:  ``` start {   send|update <item> <state>   ... } end {   send|update <item> <state>   ... } ```  or just  ``` send|update <item> <state> ... ```  At the start and end time of the calendar entry, it will either send a command or post an update to the named item with the given state or command.  So GCal could be made to work correctly under OH1 and OH2 if a subset of the ConsoleInterpreter code were incorporated directly into it.  In fact, it would make more sense not to use the ConsoleInterpreter, since the ConsoleInterpreter sends messages to the console, as if someone is issuing commands there.  Another reason not to use the ConsoleInterpreter is that it performs more function than what is documented in the wiki, which seems unsafe in terms of what the user might expect. 
If I bind a Component with setter = null, the field is readOnly per default. If I call binder.setReadOnly(false) afterwards, the field gets read/write suprisingly.  The create time rule used (fields with no setter are readOnly) will be ignored. That is the problem from my point of view.  An IllegalStateExceptions would make Binder.setReadOnly() useless in all cases with null Setters.  I would suggest to support the bind time rule (no setter ->readOnly) inBinder.setReadOnly(). 
Hello. Yes, it works without GP. Here is the fresh video: https://youtu.be/poIN8xXgelA
I tried it with yesterday  and also @jvasileff , but let me try again right now  
OK, that's what I want to suggest.
@briandealwis This doesn't happen for _Run As_.  ~~I tested the wip-498 branch, but it almost all the time hit the JDWP/JVMTI error at startup. (There have been a couple of occasions it started without the error, but it gets the same error anyway.) I think you should be able to reproduce it.~~  UPDATE: it works in the `wip-498` branch works. See https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-eclipse/issues/604#issuecomment-242123350 below. 
In India common plans start from 1GB per month and aren't that expensive.  As I said earlier WiFi coverage is limited to a small proportion of users.  And I have observed that if we upload data after scanning is complete instead of sending after specific interval then data use is less. 
Oh forgot this again. On 1.11.
Sorry, I cannot attach it as Github allows attaching images only. However, you can simply take the html that is used in documentation: http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/demo/examples/templating/templates.html  Here is the direct link to the source code: http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/eXide/index.html?open=/db/apps/demo/examples/templating/templates.html  The issue appears in both 2.1 and 2.2.RC1. 
That's fine by me. The snippet from Sponge is MIT-licensed, so you can use it wherever you want (as long as you attribute it to Sponge)
Hello, I find it quite simple to use the API and I appreciate the flexibility one has to handle a specific situation (e.g. I could read the first bytes of the body to check for a specific version of a file format). I find it way more interesting and flexible than the alternative `Map<Type, Function>`.  However, I am not convinced of the _call the next_ strategy. It means a programming mistake in one parser could prevent the ones following in the list to be executed. I personally think this should be a responsibility of the underlying infrastructure (e.g. the parser could return an `Optional<Object>`: `Optional.of(...)` if the parser can handle the request and `Optional.none()` otherwise).  What are your thoughts on that?

No, it doesn't seem to happen in the latest nightly (new UI), but I have only run it for a few days so I can't be absolutely sure yet since it didn't happen often before either. 
I thought that would be clear by:  > Making a change, pressing "Apply" applies the changes, the "apply" button even gets disabled. Yet the Web UI asks to discard changes when moving away from the service.  As this is an issue which sporadically appears (at least I haven't found a pattern yet) I cannot give you a set of instructions to replicate this with with 100% certainty.
Lemme give that a try right quick...  EDIT: Using build 1110 of TT and the latest MCPC+ build (245), setting "B:allowWorldUnloading=false" stopped the errorspam from MoCreatures and allowed me to log into the test server.  Also, and I don't know if this will be a factor, I've disabled ChickenChunks since it seems to be a problem child in a lot of FTB server setups. 
Hi. All of sudden Chromecast Audio started to appear again. Not sure what the cause was. 
hey i left the office right after opening this issue. if it is ok i'll check on monday on one of our other eclipse installations.

Strange, it's consistent for me even with the latest build (58e60970e18a00ff54cd223d905ce6a158031b27).  Regardless, is it possible that two calls to edit for the same role (initiated on different threads) could cause this issue even after your fix?  I just took a look at the source code and it doesn't look like the request is asynchronous, but how is the result of the role updated? Is this sent later on by the Discord server?
Cannot test it directly as that was production system :)  But `glassfish-corba-internal-api 4.0.1-p8` still creates ThreadPoolExecutor with unbounded queue. So unless JCA WorkManager uses different thread pool manager, the bug must be present. And the thread manager is not different in .173:  https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/master/appserver/connectors/work-management/src/main/java/com/sun/enterprise/connectors/work/CommonWorkManager.java#L118  https://github.com/payara/Payara/blob/32f9e683cf01ed0b96de79648dafefa0a6087aa2/appserver/orb/orb-connector/src/main/java/org/glassfish/enterprise/iiop/util/S1ASThreadPoolManager.java#L192 
1.- I just try to enter the admin console and it fails. The problem: a bad built javascript file. 2.- Maybe I only found this on a tomcat behind an https only apache. (can't remember all the cases, it happens since last week) 3.- /srv/eng/admin.console 4.- No... how do I know this is done? I will try 5.- I think I add it automatically, let me try again with explicit prod profile 
Steps to reproduce: 1. Open transactions list. 2. Scroll down. Scroll is working as expected. 3. Try scroll up. Refresh spinner is drawn instead scrolling. 
I will try later today and reply asap.  Thanks!
I think it happens as you put the country of origin and sponsor again, so guess I shouldn't pass the full template perhaps ?  ![index-out-of-bounds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/727626/71527586-fe6d2e00-28d3-11ea-9950-0446bc394701.png)  maybe just have ` -template:1 `and leave it that ?  ![mars-command-box](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/727626/71527617-1c3a9300-28d4-11ea-89d6-7315d9da2bc2.png)

I got this: http://9giga.sfr.fr/n/50-17/share/LNK99974f7ac563e8db8/ 
I did a little research and testing, and didn't come across the ad infinitum problem. If my fix works on your phone, go ahead and close this ticket.
I am not sure  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14033756/34301134-87b0289e-e72b-11e7-9f95-ea4596623b28.png) 
I'm sorry I can't: it's quite a big project and I don't even know where to begin to isolate the problematic code.  But I suppose it's some bean unable to be instantiated, maybe because it can't configure itself from config/application.yml  If you have some hints on how to proceed I'm all hears: for the time being I just develop using RC1.
i wonder if i delete the .jason file and restart tinker time if it might work 
@ronblum In the case of the variable extraction that appears to be correct. However, in the case of the function extraction it doesn't appear that a valid call to the newly created function is added. Moving the function would result in this code:   ```r sub_fun <- function(Petal.Length) {   Petal.Length - 123 } iris %>%    mutate(new = ) ```   When something more like this is actually expected:  ```r sub_fun <- function(x) {   x - 123 } iris %>%    mutate(new = sub_fun(Petal.Length)) ``` 
I mis-typed. I had this bug occur several times, figured out how to fix the units, did so, but attached a save with only one damaged unit when the bug recurred.   Gm editing the damage on the unit not appearing in the repair bay also causes it to reappear. 
@markharwood @jimczi did you reach any conclusions regarding the retry policy?
Whatever amount you try to invest, it claims you do not have enough money. 
Sorry for the late reply, folks. @rmbarnett-rice, thanks for the input.  @jajajaqlt, there is no output because the DOM driver only extracts data from public methods. This is because only public methods are meant to be used by API clients. Sorry that I didn't notice this in the input before. Change the method signature to `public` and it works.

Thanks for the clarification.  You can click/change the state when it becomes "Disabled" or "Temporarily disabled", but not "Permanently disabled". The state is disabled, and not clickable (see below screenshot).  <img width="807" alt="dump_2018-12-30_23 11 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/359918/50551999-80f3eb00-0c8a-11e9-91cf-515217568c43.png">  <img width="557" alt="dump_2018-12-30_23 27 13" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/359918/50552001-86513580-0c8a-11e9-9037-27dbd42d581c.png">  I'm no Bootstrap expert, but the button seems to be disabled via code;  ``` <div class="bootstrap-switch bootstrap-switch-wrapper bootstrap-switch-off bootstrap-switch-disabled bootstrap-switch-animate" style="width: 235px;"> ```  Happens in both index view/list, and when trying to edit a specific indexer.
Hi @drmDev    I had 14 creatures (Consecrated Sphinx, Oracle of Mul Daya, 8x plant tokens, Bloom Tender, Deepglow Skate, Baleful Strix, Primeval Titan) 3 untapped - Deepglow Skate, Baleful Strix, Primeval Titan  Dude attacked - with normal Nacatl War-Pride - 14 tokens tapped and attacking Each has 'Can't be blocked by more than one creature' Each has 'Must be blocked if able this turn'  I was blocking one with Primeval Titan, *another* one with Deepglow Skate and *another one again* with Baleful Strix  After saying 'Done' on Select blockers, the popup box ending in: "which not has to be blocked as a requirement.  Existing block removed.  It's a requirement to block Nacatl War-Pride"  509.1c The defending player checks each creature he or she controls to see whether it's affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature must block, or that it must block if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal.   I was fulfulling 3 requirements and not breaking 3 restrictions -    aka requirements - 3* blocking this turn if able   aka restriction - 3* blocking with not more than 1 creature  I think this was the most number of requirements I could address in the block and I wasn't disobeying any restrictions.  
> Yes, it's indeed a bug. Would you like to contribute a PR to fix it? You may refer to the instruction here: https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/%E5%BC%80%E6%BA%90%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97  ok，my pleasure.I will privide a PR to fix it right away.
They mails are expunged on the server (checked with two different clients). But if I manually use the function "Expunge" in K9 then the inbox show the correct mails. Is there a way where I can set this Expunge to work automatically?
User does not get anything, except cache list without any data. (The real problem was show on map does not work). And it's completely repeteable with non-PM user. 
We have a primary key on the mapping table. And a custom order activity that removes and re-adds offer codes based on some attributes, using just the order side of the relation (standard OrderService method). Most of the time it worked fine, but occasionally it would cause a duplicate key constraint error. 
Hmm, I just tested this thrice, twice with the attached volume settings, and once with the last audio setting (Media, video, etc) turned down, the ringer blared through on the first two tries. Only the final attempt resulted in the phone vibrating rather than ringing.  What phone and version of Android did you test on? I'm on a T-Mobile beanded LG V30 H932 running Android 8.0  On another phone I borrowed it appears the ringtone setting is respected, but it is a Moto Z2 Force running Android 8.1, specifically some sort of LineageOS 15.1 rom (of questionable sourcing). I'll test on another stock H932 this weekend and see if its an issue on more than just my device.
yes, I already tried with teardown thread group, and it works that way
The CAPS are use in a CONTROLLED fashion so your point on that was a waste of typing, and there is no attitude just hate repeating stuff now for the 3rd time it seems!  I understand that the NPC files are created with a RANDOM uuid. I also understand specifically from the lastAccountName value!  So the question is WHY or WHAT plugin could be creating this?    I type no commands this is RANDOM and it just generates this files daily!  Today i just deleted 1,300 of these files and when i posted this i just deleted like 3,400 previously.  The server as NOT been restart/rebooted since this post, and I/nor any mods have any commands what would create any such files.  Here is a list of my plugins you can view from this timings report, if you think some may or may not be compatible.  http://www.spigotmc.org/go/timings?url=14407071  Please don't tell me stuff i already know, if you have a question ask and i will answer, but WHY/WHAT would be generating all these NPC (fake/accounts)?  Thanks 
@gdude2002  This doesn't happen without ProtocolSupport.

@eivantsov what stack did you test? This is happening for us on the ubuntu base stack. Using the SSH into workspace option (i.e. on a custom port) it works just fine.
Yes to 1.0.4b, and yes I do have the logs.  I unfortunately don't know exactly when the problem happened, because I didn't notice the problem at first, so my apologies for that.  Here is a ~2000 line gist of the logs, from startup until a time where I know the problem should have already happened by: https://gist.github.com/gth828r/1ddb13ed89ba57de8015  I suspect the problem occurred toward the latter half of the logs.  I am working within the "samevlan" slice, and the "diffvlan" slice intentionally doesn't have a controller for the duration of this test.  Here is my fsfw config file as well, in case it is useful. https://gist.github.com/gth828r/126827c92cd3c34a2bc0  This was one stress test against the various tests against fsfw in a series of them.  If you want to know more about the steps leading up to this test, I can describe it.  FYI, I have not been able to reproduce this again, but I'll be trying many times, and I'll report back if I see it again (hopefully with a more narrow log snippet!) 
It's a Sony Xperia Z3 compact with custom Rom.
I have compiled the latest code. It is working perfectly now. Both the collision and the raycast. Thanks.  ![ezgif com-crop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13336387/64060499-13b6a200-cbeb-11e9-822d-809802570bed.gif) 
What doc said.  Chunks were loaded. 
Yes, that what i mean. I have not tested with a button yet to see in the button works (will do tonight) but what i'm seeing right now is this:  When i flip over to a certain page i'm seeing my image and below it my progressbar (which is not moving). So this is the snapshot being taken on demand after my image finished loading (the progressbar is not hidden afterwards). I release the page and the page stays the same. When i move this page again the screenshot during the animation is still this same page with the stationary progressbar (spinner).  so whether i'm moving the page and watch the animation or after i release it. In both cases i see the exact same page with the progressbar at the same position. So my conclusion is that i'm looking at the same screenshot in the animation and when i'm not in the animation. And i would expect that after the animation, the actual page must be visible in which case the progressbar should be spinning 
Same issue with our fork than with your fix, there was a misobservation when trying our fork.  The misobservation is really strange.  When executing TWICE this command:  ``` shell gradle -q sync-load-balancer:dependencies --configuration testCompile --info ```  First, we get:   ``` +---

Yeah, Sorry I wrote this thread before I knew that option existed. It worked and StellarSky's skybox is now showing, but no one can see the constellations from AS now, So not sure on that front.
It appeared just once, but I haven't seen it since then, even if I updated some other (ubuntu) packages while having RStudio open. I provided the list of updated packages in case they are somehow related to RStudio internals
@nallar still same issue with concurrent network ticks, enabling it actually seems to increase the effect, can't realy enable tt on my server atm due to it making all the ue wires act wierd 
[2020-01-01-1.log](https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedDynamics/files/4015910/2020-01-01-1.log)  I could'nt paste the whole file on pastebin, that's why, is it working like that ?
I decided to handle your examples as bugs and fixed them. In the next release, your unit tests will pass. I started the whole project because other DOM libraries were missing convenience and "automagic" features. So the whole point XMLBeam was from the beginning to have a "do what I mean"-library. Unexpected results should be avoided.
Happens when I use OldDays and not when I use SSP. 
> I execute only Cleanup: Move files to file directory + make links relative  cleanup is fine and does not do this. I see this behaviour when moving manually: in `General` tab of the entry by right clicking on each .pdf and the `Move file to file directory`.
sorry, for commenting back so late. Yes, thanks, with the new jtgt-version it works now.  But should we keep this issue open until we exactly know what caused this in `RmsLsfDistortionComputer`?
From where can I download a jar file? 
Yes,I tried different theme.But this problem exist in all of those situations.In my view,you can change the text color to make it different from the drawer's background color. 
Yes, I did a full server restart. Yes, my luck perms is using H2 database.
I'm OK with that.  But I think it's used in the impl. When the new UI is created it gets the Locale from the session :  ``` protected UI createAndInitUI(Class<? extends UI> uiClass,             VaadinRequest request, VaadinSession session) {         UI ui = ReflectTools.createInstance(uiClass);          // Initialize some fields for a newly created UI         ui.getInternals().setSession(session);         ui.setLocale(session.getLocale()); ```
I downloaded the App via F-Droid.
I can't verify at the moment because the code doesn't compile on my debian with up to date default-jre from apt repositories. I'll try to get the code to compile and I'll let you know as soon as I do. At the moment I'm still getting six errors, but I'll be working on this code about an hour every morning this week.
``` sql select * from a; select * from b;  -- TODO:  -- select * from c; ``` 
Sadly not because it's code from my company... But it would be somehow like this...  `this.EntityManager.GetEntity(entityId).GetValue(xmlId);` also tried it without this before that... same problem.  EntityManager would be a C# Property so no pure field declared like this: ` [Inject] public IEntityManager EntityManager { private get; set; } ` the rest are parameters from the function.  Maybe it also good to notice that the member belongs to a namespace?  And I encountered that watches are not working in general as long as I seem to execute a function. But only with this code I got a exception popup. The other cases only show a red error in the result of the watch 
chrome Version 31.0.1650.57  I have seen it on other plugins/pages as well.  
I'm now registering log the following way:  ```dataflow:>app register --type sink --name log --uri docker://springcloudstream/log-sink-kafka-10:latest --metadata-uri maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:log-sink-kafka-10:1.1.1.RELEASE```  also set the Maven repo on the server like this:  ```SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON:				{ "maven": { "local-repository": null, "remote-repositories": { "repo1": { "url": "https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot"} } } }```  Still get en exception:  ``` 2017-02-16 15:58:09.488 ERROR 1 --- [nio-9393-exec-8]

@vdpdev if you want to use `"react-native-keychain": "3.0.0"`, there is no problem. Bu using 3.1.0 or 3.1.1, there is problem

Crafting the hoe does not crash the game anymore but it only dirt blocks 
@OriRoth  Correct tests fail and I added a TODO for those so you can examine them. I *did* specify the problem...
Thanks. We are not migrating to `not`, we are migrating to Elasticsearch 2.3.5 and the `not` filter is already used in a legacy application. Sure, it will be necessary to replace the `not` filter eventually, but we would prefer to not have to do it now when we are still on version 1.7.5.

I am not explicitly using a GString anywhere. Apparently in newer versions of Gradle, when referencing a property you get a GString instead of a String. The `${something.version}` property is a regular property defined in my `gradle.properties` file.
I use windows normal shell. I always use this. I think the reason might be indirect to this test cases.

Hi @robfrank ! I try version 2.2.-beta2.  Incorrect example  public static Number getSequence(Connection connection, String seqName) {         Number nextValue = null;         String query = String.format( "select sequence('%s').next()", seqName );         try {             Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();             ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery( query );             if ( rs.next() ) {                 nextValue = rs.getLong( "sequence" );             }         }         catch (SQLException sqle) {             throw log.cannotExecuteQuery( query, sqle );         } catch (OCommandExecutionException oe) {                         throw log.sequenceNotExists( seqName, oe );                 }         return nextValue;     }  Unfortunately, answer to your question is: see classes Statemet,ResultSet, PrepareStatement  P.S.  It is not critical for me. But ....it is JDBC contract 
The `handler` is initialized only [when the map is loaded](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-demo/blob/master/MapboxAndroidDemo/src/main/java/com/mapbox/mapboxandroiddemo/examples/labs/AnimatedImageGifActivity.java#L75), so if you close the activity before the callback fires, you'll get a `NPE` from the `onStop`. I didn't analyze it further and not sure why the bear was not showing up. 
We currently import 20 microschemas and 19 schemas
Unfortunately I can't share my source, but the problem seems to have to do with config.xml when it contains the following:  ``` <aggregate type="full" title="Full Coverage Aggregate">             <matches>                 <include nodeType="rep:AccessControl" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:Widget" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:WidgetCollection" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:EditConfig" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:WorkflowModel" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="vlt:FullCoverage" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="mix:language" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="sling:OsgiConfig" respectSupertype="true" />             </matches>         </aggregate> ```  instead of  ```         <aggregate type="full" title="Full Coverage Aggregate">             <matches>                 <include nodeType="rep:AccessControl" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="rep:Policy" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:Widget" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:EditConfig" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="cq:WorkflowModel" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="vlt:FullCoverage" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="mix:language" respectSupertype="true" />                 <include nodeType="sling:OsgiConfig" respectSupertype="true" />             </matches>         </aggregate> ``` 
I should have mentioned, this exact same code works fine when using the '3.1.0' version of the library.  All I did was swap the library to use '4.0.0-beta1'.  > Could you give a step by step instruction?  Sure, I called the library using the code I listed above: 1. The dialog opens as it did in version 3.   2. I clicked on a folder, which opened up to list some files on my device 3. I selected a file and hit OK  As a test, I created a new Android project with a single button that calls the Intent as shown above.  I used the default style and Activity declaration as shown in your README.  I'm getting the same exception on both an Android 5 and Android 7 device.

It fails in decode mode by saying:   Invalid dictionary entry format (missing separator). If you take the dictionary at:  https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/tree/master/languagetool-language-modules/pl/src/main/resources/org/languagetool/resource/pl/hunspell  then it won't be dumped properly. The problem is that the frequency as a flag is unknown to the dump tool. See also https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool/issues/34 
I do not see the file in my phone's collection.media; it appears to be working on desktop, however, I do not seen the file in my desktop's collection.media either and both collection.media's have the same amount of files (8106) so I'm guessing are identical; the smallest file in desktop's collection.media isn't silent.  What do you think is going on here? Please help.

@kkarra This works on fields that do not contain commas and semi-colons, so I believe we are handling the delimiters incorrectly. I will fix! 
The problem seems to be with the bazel in the docker image gcr.io/cloud-builders/bazel.  That version of bazel is release 0.17.1.   (Found by adding a build step that does `bazel info release`.)   As it happens, 0.17.1 is what I have installed on my local machine, so I can easily provide reproduction instructions that don't use cloud build. ```` git clone https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel.git cd bazel bazel build ... --keep_going ````  If it's confusing that bazel is both the build system and the thing being built, use tensorflow as your reproduction example: ```` git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git cd tensorflow bazel build ... --keep_going ````
Yes, please restore the old behavior.
@eivantsov do you mean like http vs. https?  I did figure out what the problem was with websockets as well as a related problem with Keycloak not recognizing https. It turns out that ELB Layer 7 cannot do websockets. However, if you start using ELB Layer 4, then Nginx Ingress cannot send all the needed http headers to Keycloak, specifically x-forwarded-proto, which makes Keycloak mix http/https. So either path with ELB will break Eclipse Che/Keycloak. So I switched out ELB with ALB (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller), and it seems much better so far. The ALB goes directly to Keycloak and Che, but also on path (/server*) to the nginx-ingress-controller so Che can keep adding in ingress rules.  WSS is still a little bit flakey, but I am able to connect now.  So Keycloak seems rock solid now, and the Eclipse Che UI seems great as well, but I am still not able to create containers. Actually, I did not even get to the stage of the command being issued to Kubernetes. It seems to get stuck on not being able to create ingress rules now. From the Eclipse Che catalina.out:  ``` 2018-07-06 21:08:20,486[nio-8080-exec-3]  [INFO ] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceManager 459]    - Workspace 'mbjorkman/wksp-9erm' with id 'workspace520fhejaqaqqk87g' created by user 'mbjorkman' 2018-07-06 21:08:30,596[nio-8080-exec-8]  [INFO ] [o.e.c.a.w.s.WorkspaceRuntimes 329]   - Starting workspace 'mbjorkman/wksp-9erm' with id 'workspace520fhejaqaqqk87g' by user 'mbjorkman' 2018-07-06 21:08:30,752[aceSharedPool-0]  [WARN ] [i.f.k.c.i.VersionUsageUtils 55]      - The client is using resource type 'ingresses' with unstable version 'v1beta1' 2018-07-06 21:13:30,910[aceSharedPool-0]  [WARN ] [.i.k.KubernetesInternalRuntime 192]  - Failed to start Kubernetes runtime of workspace workspace520fhejaqaqqk87g.

I've send you an email containing a sample .msg.
This happens with nginx/docs/xml/change_log_conf.xml, with a recent 0.12 on OpenBSD, although it seems like code.metager.de doesn't have this problem (dunno why). 
Tried it on Windows: Included rt.jar - everything worked, Gui, including. Process started then: Java Heap Space - out of memory Error. Maybe the obfuscator  just not working on linux. Do you have a solution for the windows error above? thank you.
@Keridos I will try it in this week, and btw the halt actually doesn't happen everytime, it happens twice with the same `NullPointerException` in `latest.log` (because the VM just halts but not game crash), so I think it is not a random issue. Anyways will catch you up when I tested it

`updateTitle()` calls `handleWaypoints()` https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/blob/28b96982271221688548014fbbb628ec3ca6b50d/main/src/cgeo/geocaching/maps/mapsforge/v6/caches/AbstractCachesOverlay.java#L221, which will eventually call `showWaypoints()` that triggers `syncLayers()`.
 what we see is the che server comes up successfully.  We can create a workspace.  the problem is the che server kills the workspace after a few minutes. This is due to agent not repsonding in time.  if i jump into the workspace pod using oc rsh and perform a curl against the local agent endpoint (http://localhost:4401)i  receive a 404 back from tomcat  I may be wrong but we suspect the workspace is not given enough time to start up and would like to know how to configure the che server to allow the workspace time to come up.   I came across these configs in the config map but as far i could tell from the entry point script they are not referenced and the entrypoint always initialize the server on the default vales   che-wsagent-ping-success-threshold: "600"   che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_conn_timeout_ms: "6000"   che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_delay_ms: "6000"   che.workspace.agent.dev.ping_success_threshold: "100"

Thank you for the response.   I've narrowed this to a more reasonable reprex. The issue still persist in v1.2.1522. What I find curious however is that the issue does *not* occur when interacting directly with R *nor* with RStudio 1.2.1335. It only occurs with version *after* the current RStudio stable release. Below is some console output. You might be right that this `.000` that comes from a failed installation is from devtools. Whatever the case though this only fix I've found is to uninstall R and then manually delete that file then re-install. I think the central issue is that `R CMD INSTALL` is not running correctly with RStudion v1.2.1522 as the package builds fine. 🤷‍♂   <details> <summary><strong>Call with RStudio 1.2.1522</strong></summary>  ``` > devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcdata", force = TRUE) Downloading GitHub repo bcgov/bcdata@master √  checking for file 'C:\Users\salbers\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp8AgZEi\remotes4d283b4f35be\bcgov-bcdata-2b31535/DESCRIPTION' (811ms) -  preparing 'bcdata': (940ms) √  checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ...  -  checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts (470ms) -  checking for empty or unneeded directories Removed empty directory 'bcdata/inst' Removed empty directory 'bcdata/vignettes' -  building 'bcdata_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz'  Installing package into 'C:/Users/salbers/R/win-library/3.6' (as 'lib' is unspecified) * installing *source* package 'bcdata' ... > library(bcdata) Error in library(bcdata) : there is no package called 'bcdata'   > devtools::session_info() - Session info --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   setting  value                        version  R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) os       Windows 10 x64               system   x86_64, mingw32              ui       RStudio                      language (EN)                         collate  English_Canada.1252          ctype    English_Canada.1252          tz       America/Los_Angeles          date     2019-05-21                    - Packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   package     * version    date       lib source                        assertthat    0.2.1      2019-03-21 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                backports     1.1.4      2019-04-10 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                callr         3.2.0      2019-03-15 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                cli           1.1.0      2019-03-19 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                crayon        1.3.4      2017-09-16 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                crul          0.7.4      2019-03-28 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                curl          3.3        2019-01-10 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                desc          1.2.0      2018-05-01 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                devtools    * 2.0.2      2019-04-08 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                digest        0.6.19     2019-05-20 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                fs            1.3.1      2019-05-06 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                glue          1.3.1      2019-03-12 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                httpcode      0.2.0      2016-11-14 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                lobstr      * 1.0.1.9000 2019-05-13 [1] Github (r-lib/lobstr@05935dc) magrittr      1.5        2014-11-22 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                memoise       1.1.0      2017-04-21 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                pkgbuild      1.0.3      2019-03-20 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                pkgload       1.0.2      2018-10-29 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                prettyunits   1.0.2      2015-07-13 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                processx      3.3.1      2019-05-08 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                ps            1.3.0      2018-12-21 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                R6            2.4.0      2019-02-14 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                Rcpp          1.0.1      2019-03-17 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                remotes       2.0.4      2019-04-10 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                rlang         0.3.4      2019-04-07 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                rprojroot     1.3-2      2018-01-03 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                rstudioapi    0.10       2019-03-19 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                sessioninfo   1.1.1      2018-11-05 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                testthat    * 2.1.1      2019-04-23 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                usethis     * 1.5.0      2019-04-07 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                withr         2.1.2      2018-03-15 [1] CRAN (R 3.6.0)                 [1] C:/Users/salbers/R/win-library/3.6 [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-3.6.0/library ```  </details>   <details> <summary><strong>Call R from cmd</strong></summary>  ``` Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.706] (c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation.

Gave it a go looks like it worked. Thanks. 
Both iOS and Android. The iOS client is built with Tabris 1.4, the Android one is older (don't know the exact version).

Yes, their is other core mods. AE2, Blood Magic, Botania & Matter Overdrive (May be removing MO) and All of Tesla...
Yes, it supports NMEA, outputting various versions of it, currently set as 4.1 version. Do you want an NMEA output log?   No, I couldn't find other app on the playstore working with USB devices, when this one is properly detecting the device and naming it.   Ublox GPS chips works with three protocols: NMEA, proprietary UBX one, and another one (RTCM if I remember well). Here are protocol specs for mine, M8 series, which supports notably GPS, Glonass, Beidu and Galileo: https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/products/documents/u-blox8-M8_ReceiverDescrProtSpec_(UBX-13003221)_Public.pdf    ----- Mail original -----  De: "Oliver Bell" <notifications@github.com>  À: "freshollie/UsbGps4Droid" <UsbGps4Droid@noreply.github.com>  Cc: "Nicolas Derive" <kalon33@ubuntu.com>, "Author" <author@noreply.github.com>  Envoyé: Vendredi 25 Août 2017 10:33:43  Objet: Re: [freshollie/UsbGps4Droid] UsbGPS stopped: too many connection problems (#7)     I see this device supports NMEA. Is it possible I could get a log? I have only been testing this on http://usglobalsat.com/p-688-bu-353-s4.aspx .   Do any other apps in the playstore work with this device?   —  You are receiving this because you authored the thread.  Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub , or mute the thread .   
Thanks,I will check in next release. sorry,but It is too difficult to build from latest master.

I see tests passing on JDK11, so we can close this issue. 
Yeah I'll make a video soon
Unfortunately it's rendering exactly the same in 0.3.10. That version was the first version of your app I tried and where I first spotted the issue but didn't report it. I saw 1.0.0 and hoped this may have fixed the issue, especially with the note about headings, but I saw it was the same and thought it was about time I reported it!  Note that my workflow, when converting these previously text-only files to Markdown is generally just to add headings, i.e. ## in front of lines, and that is when things seem to go wrong.  If you would like a non-redacted version of the .md file, for easier reading, let me know a non-public way I can get it to you.
Latest version that was available from Curseforge at the time. Um...  EDIT: EnderZoo-1.8.9-1.1.2.jar 
how do i go about getting the logs? I tried the same area with all my plugins disabled as well.
I'm sorry, I'm needing to launch my server like today and don't have the time to test it myself. If nobody else has the issue I can cross the bridge later when I try to get it live again. Wanted to give an opportunity to see if it was on your side and make you aware of it. Thanks for your consideration and great work on an awesome mod!
"Docker version 18.09.2", "18.06.1-ce" I am not sure it has to do with the version.  I created my own Dockerfile based on yours and it works fine I think.  The difference is that i clone your repo inside the builder instead of copying folders.  
Will do. Thx.
Yeah I know, it's difficult to say... I have so many mods that mess with rendering and I'm just gonna hope that the issue goes away if I update some of them...
Tested and it's working fine. Thanks! 
Yes, I have
This issue is from @rdayal I just copied it over here.  My first guess is that this has nothing to do with us, and just happened to occur at the same time due to other things in a new Eclipse install.

I don't have the file that caused the trouble anymore, but I redownloaded it and cancelled the download after a few megabytes. Here it is, but I don't know if this corruption of the file actually causes the same trouble as it did for me:  http://www.adwin-downloads.de/nsfw071-togglewarnung.m4a  Regards, and thanks for looking into this issue, Thomas 
Yes. I'm just testing it and no combination of buttons (that I've tested: q, x, Esc, Ctr+x, Ctrl+w, Ctrl+q) seem to make it close. Being a "real" modal window, I can't click on anything back in the app.  (I say "real modal", because the welcome window doesn't capture the action, and you can keep clicking back in the app, so that isn't so critical for me)
Sorry for the late reply,  The First issue seems to be fixed, thank you.  I've opened a new issue concerning the second issue
Only sometimes. 
@kingoleg Sorry, I don't know any workaround and thus downgraded to 3.5  @gbenmansour I cannot reproduce the issue with version 3.5 and the bug in the source code was introduced with 3.6. Maybe your problem is slightly different and has another cause. 
Both commands work. Resetspawns won't do anything if you don't define the arena obviously and also if you haven't disabled the arena, but I imagine that's how it's meant to be. 
@tobiasKaminsky yes You have to repeat steps 2-5 for many times it depends of images weight   I send you the logcat  `04-19 11:13:36.351 27838-27838/com.nextcloud.client E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL

Looks better when (almost) in sync, yes.
I am unable to test this. My logs are filled with error and other spam at the moment making them really hard to read and that error didn't seem very regular. 
Right now both are with `common.handle_all_urls`. Thanks!
F-Droid is where I get Gadgetbridge from.  ![screenshot_20180208-132615](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13565841/35990967-bf0a599a-0cd3-11e8-85e1-abab63377450.png) 
Startup log: https://gist.github.com/ipr0james/4893cfaf4a5c96f24e8eb2cddcd814bc  To test this theory, I've installed zPermissions and given myself essentials.spawnerconvert.Creeper which is the mob type I have been testing with, this doesn't seem to have made a difference and I am also op.  I'm not sure if the method of obtaining spawners has changed with the 1.8 editions of the latest essentials. I am still using /give {player} Spawner:50 1 as I could not find documentation on how else to obtain it.   After doing some searching, then checking for perms with debug enabled it should log that I had the perm when I came to placing the spawner, after trying to place multiple types of spawners I still don't see the debug message being thrown as if it isn't making it to this check.
Fire ticks would do the same thing as `is burning`, as you can check if it's `0`, so I don't think both would be needed.
I will try with 3.0.0 later today and update you. Yes, the /var/run directory is on user root. but neo4j is trying to create a directory under /var/run as this: /var/run/neo4j/neo4j.pid So I created the /var/run/neo4j manually but the stop script is deleting this directory.  is it ok to run neo4j as root user? and disadvantages or security risks?  Thanks

We could identify the problem. While we encoded the text itself, we missed to encode the surface forms. Here is an example for a text that created an HTTP error:  ``` XML <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <annotation text="++++Updated%3A+New+York...">     ...     <surfaceForm name="Merrill Lynch & Co." offset="2161" /> </annotation> ``` 
The error still came even I removed the whole section `format 'misc'`. Same happens in gradle 3.4 too
First of all, Thank you for you support !  The tutorial MzIdentML you provided passed the OpenMS integrity test.  However while processing the MzIdentlML file I get the following error:  RuntimeError: the element 'Glu->pyro-Glu (E)' could not be found  Probably resulting from this line :   cvParam cvRef="UNIMOD" accession="UNIMOD:28" name="Gln-&gt;pyro-Glu" value="-17.026549"  I suspect that OpenMS itself is responsible for this issue, and will inspect this. I will update you when I find the source of this issue.  Thank you again for your outstanding support 
Thanks, Will test it as soon as I can... 
[Mods/Plugins](http://bit.ly/2MdaatD) At me the nickname consists of Russian symbols "Ярослав". Maybe because of this?  P.S. I checked with the usual nickname, same error. (But seen only in the survival mode)
I dont think manus is an official flans modpack  I got manus modernwarefare and manus civil pack installed, other flanspacks I have installed dont have vehicles in them. So I dont know who's code is causing this bug 
For your convenience, I have [generated sample certificates](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-plugin/files/107507/docker-internal-certificates.zip) for 1 server and 1 client.  Those certificates were generated with `OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015` on Mac OS X 10.11.2.  I have production certificates which were generated by `OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013` on CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core).  Both seem to replicate the issue.  I'll attempt to write up a test case though my Java skills are pretty weak.  I'm a lot better at reading Java than I am at writing it (if that makes sense).  ---  Additionally, your hypothesis about "caused by multiple docker-java libraries from different plugins in your jenkins installation" is likely incorrect.  I newly provisioned Jenkins today (and yesterday).  The only plugins installed other than the built-in are: git, github, github-oauth, docker-plugin.  There's no other docker-related plugins installed. 
@krzyk done, thanks for pinging 
I did indeed miss out the `groups-treated-as-primary` but that doesn't seem to be the cause of the error.

@thc202 yes. 
Definitely. Here's the sample project: https://github.com/ocarey/ShapeableImageView-GIFs  Shapeable & App Compat Image Views work fine with Glide & static images: ![Screenshot_1578615062](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37121709/72115085-a7ffe680-32fa-11ea-9a13-8aebb650ff08.png)  However, Shapeable Image View won't render the Gif with Glide: ![Screenshot_1578614722](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37121709/72114986-345dd980-32fa-11ea-8361-1af39d9243d7.png)  Looks like it's falling into this conditional statement in onDraw(): ``` // only supporting BitmapDrawable for now. if (!(getDrawable() instanceof BitmapDrawable)) {    Log.e(TAG, "Shapeable Image view does not support the provided drawable. "       + "Only BitmapDrawble is supported");    return; } ```  Thank you!
In the case of our own code and our own tests, we already use `doPrivileged` in any locations which I'm aware of. But even if we weren't, we give our own code permission to read any system property.  Actually, we give JUnit the permission to read any system property as well, but _because it isn't using `doPrivileged`_, callers further down the stack get checked as well, and apparently no matter what we put into the security policy, those ones can't be marked as trusted.  We use the security manager to stop code (both libraries and our own code (since this is a testing framework, it seems reasonable to get extra checking for free where possible!) doing various things we don't want them to do, but mostly to stop them writing data outside of where we tell them to or exiting the JVM (yeah, it has actually happened before...) The former could theoretically be done by writing a custom NIO2 filesystem which wraps the real filesystem, but it would be a lot of work to make it support absolutely everything the real one supports. The latter is impossible to do any other way, at least as far as I am aware. 
@Theobald93 Yes,I tried,it resoled #379 
so the client can get data like the seed from the server? :P but yes already removed the mod from the server for us, still an issue that should be fixed
I can provide more information if needed, but basically it seems to be impossible to make it NOT happen if you use Map Matching for the request.  When this happens, converting the response to a DirectionsRoute using toDirectionRoute() leave voiceLanguage as null.  When this is ultimately passed to NavigationInstructionPlayer, languageSupportedByMapboxSpeech will be false (line 25).  Therefore when initInstructionPlayers is called, line 91 will not be executed, and so mapboxSpeechPlayer will not be initialised - which is the only place is could be initialised.  From that point on, any calls to setMuted, onOffRoute, or onDestroy will crash.

I just reorganize files in Unity, trying to achieve same file structure as in my own project. Not sure if it was some concrete move. Just create new folder in Unity and drag and drop old files to new folder structure. 
Interesting. Thanks for the info. 
Hello, thanks for your help.In my 'new voice' folder there is no database.config file, but only an importMain.config file. I am using Mary 4.3.1 because I couldn't find any Voiceimport in the Bin folder Mary 5.0 version, so I assumed that the last version if the Voiceimport is in Mary 4.3.1... am I wrong?Anyways , I tried to insert that line in importMain.config but the erro popped up the same..  ----Messaggio originale----  Da: notifications@github.com  Data: 30/04/2013 12.12  A: "marytts/marytts"marytts@noreply.github.com  Cc: "zorogat"zorogat@libero.it  Ogg: Re: [marytts] Voiceimport bug (#120)  Thanks for reporting this!  The stacktrace indicates that a required property cannot be loaded from your database.config. The HalfPhoneUnitLabelComputer has only one property, which is actually dormant by default, but nevertheless mandatory.  Could you check whether your database.config file contains the following lines?  # Properties for module HalfPhoneUnitLabelComputer:  HalfPhoneUnitLabelComputer.energyBasedTransientSplitting false  If these lines are not present, could you try inserting them, restarting the VoiceImportTools, and checking if the error persists?  — Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub. 
Thanks Nikita! Awesome project:) 
ok it seems the issue was indeed the .class file not being present.  i was surprised this is a requirement to even show the class in the hierarchy view.  
The quick fix will result in an implicit `NullPointerException` if one blindly calls the `get()` methods of `ReactiveQueryResult`without doing a `hasResults()` check. So if the get methods of `UnifiedQueryExecutor` has something similar (i.e. to determine if results are present or not), perhaps throwing (implicitly or explicitly) `NullPointerException` in the interim is OK. But from an API design point, IMHO it is much clearer to explicitly throw an *unchecked exception* such as `NoSuchElementException` / `NoDataFoundException` as `NullPointerException` wouldn't convey the intention.
I'm using AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.9.4.
Yep that's correct, i was gonna use the charcoal pit mod to process all unfired clay items. It has an in-world kiln, you place down your items in a hole, cover it with thatch and logs and set it on fire.   Wouldn't be the end of the world if the porcelain brick can also be smelted in a surface, just not ideal.

Downloaded zip with sources - I can do a checkout if that would have missed something.
Solved,I updated the nukkit jar to another version, thanks
@efraespada  Thankyou for your help! But I still cannot test 0.8 version. I get gradle sync error : "Could not find com.stringcare:plugin:0.8" version 0.6 or 0.7 have no gradle sync error. Only v0.8 show me error log.  About fingerprint, I understand difference between app and library. If I use same signature for app & lib, then fingerprint also same. right? I will manage that carefully.
Hey - thanks for taking a look - the software looks really good - and works fine for a local backup. One thing that might be unique about my setup is that I am using a usb drive plugged into a tp-link router that has ftp enabled. I've been able to use duplicity/deja dup on it though with no errors connecting the the ftp drive though. Connecting from cmd line or filezilla also work fine.   When I log into the ftp manually I see it this way: ftp> pwd 257 "/driveloco/test" ftp>   If I log in using filezilla the ftp path appears the same:  Command:    PWD Response:   257 "/driveloco/test"  I've just tried to set up the backup using the following settings: matt@rse ~/tmp/syncanyremote $ sy init --debug debug Application version: 0.3.0-alpha 27-12-14 17:14:48.389 | CommandLineClie | main           | INFO : Application version: 0.3.0-alpha 27-12-14 17:14:48.860 | Plugins         | main           | INFO : - org.syncany.plugins.ftp.FtpTransferPlugin 27-12-14 17:14:48.863 | Plugins         | main           | INFO : - org.syncany.plugins.gui.GuiPlugin 27-12-14 17:14:48.865 | Plugins         | main           | INFO : - org.syncany.plugins.local.LocalTransferPlugin Choose a storage plugin. Available plugins are: ftp, local Plugin: ftp  Connection details for ftp connection: - Hostname: --------------- - Username: ------ - Password (not displayed):  - Relative path: /driveloco/test - Port (21):   And still recieve the same error message. I haven't tried mounting the ftp location as a drive, if you think that's worth trying I can test it later tonight.   I know little about java so was really hoping the error message would be more helpful. 
I'm running Windows 10. Thanks!

I did not test the behaviour @davidmigloz described. We just set a static button text like "Send Feedback". So I can't comment on this topic.  But I can confirm, that with usabilla 6.4.3 `setDefaultNavigationButtonsVisibility` is working again.
Legacy, i will try update simpleclans 
your example works until I add the config server starter as dependency    ```  <dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>   </dependency> ```  even if configuration in config server is empty or even if it doesn't connect to config server ${wiremock.server.port} is 0
Hi Joe, exactly… Thanks for the hint!
I haven't try yet. I'll see if I have time tonight.

Could it be related to ciphers? I've got both users attention for the day so I can modify the parameter set and test if you've got suggestions.
If it is going to power, it will produce a great drag. Once it ends to power, its drag will drop drastically.

I have no idea why the node_modules are located to this directory, but as you can see on my screen : there is no `nodes_modules` folder inside my ios directory.

OK, I will try 5.14. Because there is endless external file modification notification after 5.11, I have to use 5.10.

I figured that this is not related to using imported maps, but installing the german full version in `playonlinux` 4.2.10-2ubuntu1 with `wine` 1.19 on Ubuntu 16.10. 
Hi, Setting the limit to 1 is already a good workaround, as there is no need anymore to restart Eclipse to free memory.  Setting a sliding window seems a good solution, since I usualy only dive into the latest lines of (TRACE) logging. If there is a need to dig into all other logging, a logging file is a good idea, however in most cases the test has stopped at an error, so that is usualy the latest logging. Besides that, there is also the possibility to do debugging, so an external file is not a must. Thanks for the quick investigation, Regards, Evert Huijben
yes I tried, seems to be not working at all

My apologies @Yserz, not sure how I missed your message.. Would've checked this quite a while back if I'd realised you had a fix. :)  @bennyn, I don't have this issue any more with `0.0.9-beta`, only tested with `.java` files, but since this isn't something that's file specific I doubt that will make much difference. 
It applies to exec's, shell-operations and file copies.  For example: - I created a remote file "TestFileÄÖÜ.txt" using SFTP, SCP, Exec and Shell each.    In WinSCP it gets displayed as "TestFileÃ„Ã–Ãœ.txt". In PuTTY it gets displayed in 2 lines like "TestFileÃ\nÃÃ.txt". - When listing files in sshj using "ls" or SFTPClient.ls(), a file "TestFileÄÖÜ.txt" that was remotely created using PuTTY or WinSCP gets displayed as "TestFile???.txt".   Calling getBytes() returns "84, 101, 115, 116, 70, 105, 108, 101, -17, -65, -67, -17, -65, -67, -17, -65, -67, 46, 116, 120, 116". Each '?' is encoded as "-17, -65, -67".   On the other hand, all files created with sshj will be displayed correctly. - Existing files can't be found. Executing "cat TestFileÄÖÜ.txt" results in "cat: 0652-050 Cannot open TestFileÄÖÜ.txt." and only works if the file was created using sshj, e.g. when "TestFileÃ„Ã–Ãœ.txt" exists. Same for SFTP/SCP downloads 
Same exception
Ok i will try tomorrow. 
It seems that the problem is not fixed unfortunately, at least on my Android 7.1.2. In Explore: - Scroll down - Tap on a image - Press Back - Position is lost, now at top

git-Spigot-f928e7a-e91aed8 (MC: 1.8.7) (Implementing API version 1.8.7-R0.1-SNAPSHOT) i don't get errors. 
This was  unfortunate copy-paste typo when I wanted to show on simplest possible example where in real I was experiencing it on different set of loggers. Sorry for thath. The problem is still there, after correcting to `org.springframework`. As described in the issue description, the same configuration logs on INFO level (where it shouldn't) when deployed to external tomcat, but doesn't log on INFO when the identical war is run in the embedded tomcat. That doesn't sound like typo error. 
Hello @surli   I am using this maven repository core ``` <dependency>     <groupId>fr.inria.gforge.spoon</groupId>     <artifactId>spoon-core</artifactId>     <version>5.9.0</version> </dependency>  ``` I am parsing the file, and i wanted to change the package name  for example  Src Input file src/main/java/app/App.java--> the package name is 'app'  ``` package app;  Class Test{         public static void main(String[] args){                   System.out.println("test");         } } ```  The processor which I wrote to process the .java file is:   ``` public class ElementProcessor extends AbstractProcessor<CtElement>{        public void process(CtElement element) {               if(element instanceof CtPackage){                       ((CtPackage) element).setSimpleName("newtest");               }        } }  ``` The output after the process should be  if the output is give as src/main/java  The final output of the folder package should be src/main/java/newtest/App.java --> package newtest  But the output in the App.java file is occurring as   ``` package .newtest;  Class Test{         public static void main(String[] args){                   System.out.println("test");         } }  ``` With PACKAGE_SEPERATOR '.' before as shown above. Which is creating the compilation issue.  I hope I was able to explain my requirement. Your insights would help in understanding if I am missing something here.  Regards Sourabh

I believe it is being picked up because if I remove the configFileName property and leave the default one of **/src/main/enunciate/enunciate.xml**, but without having the actual file on the path, it complains it doesn't exist, like it should. As soon as I move it inside the folder, the warning disappears. The config still doesn't work, even while using this default file location. Any ideas what could be wrong? 
there is no such option or I coldn't find it <img width="1440" alt="screen shot 2017-09-24 at 5 24 36 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/689092/30784028-6d59840a-a14d-11e7-880e-933d36c475b5.png"> It starts with 1.5/6GB and increase overtime.

@overheadhunter Not 100 percent sure how you mean that, but I've tried the following: - Clients used: Cyberduck and CarotDAV - Server used: WebDAV server of box.com online storage - Transfered the mentioned files to box.com via each of the above clients. - The end result is the same as with Cryptomator. - Only difference is that Cyberduck doesn't even ask if the file should be overwritten. CarotDAV does.  One unrelated curious thing I've just experienced is that Cryptomator opened one of my vaults twice at the same time, i. e. it has been displayed as 2 separate drives in Windows Explorer (until locking). After unmounting/locking the vault in Cryptomator, there's still one instance left that I can still use. I'll leave it there until I shut down the computer tonight, so if this is of any interest to you, let me know. [Edit: Dang - too late. Somehow managed to accidentally quit the Cryptomator client, now the second instance is also gone. Sorry]. 
Minecraft version: 1.12.2 AS version: 1.7 Forge version: 1.12.2-14.23.0.2512  I assumed that losing infusion was intentional due to the last line in the "Infused Crystal Tools" chapter in the book (in Constellation; line reads "However, that also comes with the possibility that the liquid might be drained at some point..."). I've noted twice now that occasionally, when using the sword rapidly (i.e. against >10 mobs), it will convert from "Infused Crystal Sword" to "Crystal Sword," retaining all of its enchantments, size, purity, and current cutting. Advanced tooltips also show that the item is converted from astralsorcery:itemchargedcrystalsword to astralsorcery:itemcrystalsword.  I did just update AS to 1.7.2 yesterday, and have yet to have this happen again, but I haven't really used the sword much since then. I will see if I can replicate the issue.
There are reasons to do this and this actually is an issue on a production server so this is relevant and not just a theoretical case.
Certainly! It has not been pushed to GitHub though, and I couldn't find Gerald on public GitHub. Can you follow up on this one?
I think I have enough free space, my internal SD card still has 880MB and my external still has more than 10GB. When I try to generate a bug report I get the message "Bug report could not be created". Similar to the other error messages. Is there another way to get log files?

Well, when I set the Probe Retract Distance to 20mm I expect it to hit the touch plate and retract 20mm.  I thought the Probe Distance was the length of probe travel before it stopped the action and produced and error message assuming there was a problem.  I maybe wrong but I thought these were two separate functions.  Is there a reason for them to be tied together?
I think it will not solve the issue - although the net.sf.cglib.proxy.Callback class will be available at startup, it will be different to the class loaded by webapp classloader.   If your code runs from "agent" classloader (directly from the plugin), it must be launched via java reflection, because "agent" classloader does not know anything about classes from weabpp.   The other way is to call the method from modified class in webapp classloader. It is possible, because all "agent" classes are replicated into all webapp classloaders (see org.hotswap.agent.util.classloader.ClassLoaderPatcher).  Javaassist is something else - it is included only to support bytecode manipulation.

Yes and no....I looked at the raw data for the article at crossref.org and it is somehow resolved incorrectly. For example the raw data has "issue":"6" but had no "number" field. The issue shows up as number in the curl pull. There is no "pages" field but a "article-number":"064002" field that is used as page in citing.   I will report this to the journal if you can clarify to me where the problem is. Thanks.

No I can't. I should have checked what players were doing at the moment when I was getting those errors.  I tested swimming and running.  That error happened every 4 seconds.  I don't know if this is related or should open a new bug but I'm now getting every 3 seconds this:  `[20:46:29] [Server thread/WARN]: [ExtraHardMode] Task #61 for ExtraHardMode v3.7.1 generated an exception java.lang.NullPointerException ` 
I was looking up a single vertex by its long id. The getVertex API is more convenient because I just want the single vertex back, not an iterable or iterator.  I switched to getVertices, which is what will be called internally if I go through gremlin. Is it the official recommendation that all janus calls go through gremlin? I prefer to use the janus APIs directly when they make sense as I feel that some of the gremlin query re-writing can be a little un-predictable.   Anyways, there's 2 for sure bugs here that need to be addressed, using gremlin won't fix them:  1. The javadoc for getVertex is wrong as it states that it will return null if the vertex doesn't exist. Either we should fix the javadoc or we should fix the method. I would prefer fixing the method, but I'm not sure if anyone is relying on the exception throwing behavior, I would assume not as it's an undeclared assert error. 2. getVertices should not throw an exception when a vertex doesn't exist and batch loading is enabled. I get that we are skipping the existence check to help performance, but once we determine that the vertex doesn't exist, it should just be removed from the response. There's no good reason for having it behave differently when batch loading is enabled.
Really? Debugging enabled on release build?
The intention of this method is to copy all elements in the List to a new Tuple.

Yes @slemeur  I am interested to work on this feature. @sleshchenko Please do let me know how can I contribute.
I just ran this with the following files under the `0.2.2b` and the issue did not repeat.

I prefer the "throw an error" approach - `{}` already denotes nothing.

I wouldn't give list of my plugins but you can ask me if I have a specific plugin. @sgdc3 If I use build 1228 there is no this problem. The problem comes from one of build after this one. 
Thanks for taking a look at this.  Been banging my head on it for a bit.  Your screen shot shows that the browser accessed localhost:8080/elda/def/foo/bar/1.  The failure condition arises when you dereference the actual URI in the data.  Try pointing the browser at  http://example.org/def/foo/bar/1.  See the second bullet in the list of ways that does work.  If you don't want to mess with your hosts file and ports, you might try modifying the data so that the data is:   http://localhost:8080/elda/def/foo/bar/1 skos:inScheme http://localhost:8080/elda/def/foo/bar .  Though that is not how I've been seeing it happen.  If that doesn't trigger it for you, then I can try to mirror your setup.  They symptoms of the loop are: - Tomcat at > 100% cpu utilization for many minutes - fan gets loud - no stack trace - have to kill tomcat to recover - Elda logging says its about to render the result and then it heads of to never never land  I have an apache front end proxying to Elda in Tomcat7 on Ubuntu 14.04.  Have had it fail on Elda 1.3.3 and 1.3.4.  My environment is a bit unusual - I'm using docker so that could introduce an issue.  If it doesn't reproduce for you, I can try it in VM instead.    Note the XSLT renderer is working.  The Velocity renderer is working with  the .html extension and other access URI patterns. 
@oprisnik I use both rounding corners and circle rounding. Thank you for BitmapTransformation hint, I'll try it
Working example (maven project) is available on github: https://github.com/kubalavl/jooq.git. You can find there junit class Jooq118Bug.java which demonstrate problem. Hope it helps. 
This is on a S5. 
@mikepenz Thanks a lot for your quickly reply. I tried   ``` compile('com.mikepenz.actionitembadge:library:2.0.0@aar') {     transitive = true } ```  it works. Thanks for your help. BTW, It's my first time to use Android Studio. The reason is your library is using it. 
Sure, I'll test them tonight after work. Note that what I mentioned are trees, not biomes, so it's only the individual trees that cause the problem, not the biome the player is in. Another gigantic tree I'll test is the Sacred Rubber Tree from Minefactory Reloaded. 
Thank you. I need comments like yours to be sure the upgrade will help on the issues we are facing. Really appreciated.  Still wonder if for the issues we saw here and in #5920. Is there any way we can recover the database?  Thanks, -Bo 
Hi @steven-sheehy, yes importer it's running and database is up to date, or at least we do have transactions on the database and are being created in real-time.  Please see the logs [hedera_mirrornode_api_5551.log](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/files/4124601/hedera_mirrornode_api_5551.log) 
@gvlfm78 Not anymore thank you :+1: 
Note that when adding a semi colon at the end of each select; tabs are correctly named.
The yellow blocks are "Large Electrum Item Pipe" from gregtech (instantanous transport from one end to another to remove waiting time on long distances) gregtech_1.7.10-5.08.25  I tested it now with a double chest and the ISC. It puts the item into the chest but the other ISC doesnt pull it out (request with "Request Logistics Pipe Mk2" still works). edit: Sometimes it also gets stuck and cannot insert into the chest. 
When I use the "zoomToPoint" method as followed:  `zoomToPoint(getMaxScaleFactor(), imagePoint, viewPoint, LIMIT_ALL, 400, null);` in` AbstractAnimatedZoomableController->setTransform` method it calls `setTransformAnimated` method according to this code: ``` if (durationMs <= 0) {       setTransformImmediate(newTransform);     } else {       setTransformAnimated(newTransform, durationMs, onAnimationComplete);     } ```  and the method is as followed:  ``` public void setTransformAnimated(       final Matrix newTransform,       long durationMs,       @Nullable final Runnable onAnimationComplete) {     FLog.v(getLogTag(), "setTransformAnimated: duration %d ms", durationMs);     stopAnimation();     Preconditions.checkArgument(durationMs > 0);     Preconditions.checkState(!isAnimating());     setAnimating(true);     mValueAnimator.setDuration(durationMs);     getTransform().getValues(getStartValues());     newTransform.getValues(getStopValues());     mValueAnimator.addUpdateListener(new ValueAnimator.AnimatorUpdateListener() {       @Override       public void onAnimationUpdate(ValueAnimator valueAnimator) {         calculateInterpolation(getWorkingTransform(), (float) valueAnimator.getAnimatedValue());         AnimatedZoomableController.super.setTransform(getWorkingTransform());       }     });     mValueAnimator.addListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {       @Override       public void onAnimationCancel(Animator animation) {         FLog.v(getLogTag(), "setTransformAnimated: animation cancelled");         onAnimationStopped();       }       @Override       public void onAnimationEnd(Animator animation) {         FLog.v(getLogTag(), "setTransformAnimated: animation finished");         onAnimationStopped();       }       private void onAnimationStopped() {         if (onAnimationComplete != null) {           onAnimationComplete.run();         }         setAnimating(false);         getDetector().restartGesture();       }     });     mValueAnimator.start();   } ```  but after that call nothing happens because this code is called immediatly after starting animation:  ```   public void stopAnimation() {       /*       if (!isAnimating()) {         return;       }       FLog.v(getLogTag(), "stopAnimation");       mValueAnimator.end();       mValueAnimator.removeAllUpdateListeners();       mValueAnimator.removeAllListeners(); */   } ```  and where it is called is this method:  ```   @Override   public void onGestureBegin(TransformGestureDetector detector) {     FLog.v(getLogTag(), "onGestureBegin");     stopAnimation();     super.onGestureBegin(detector);   } ```  In the conclusion when you set a duration for the animation it doesnt animate, it does nothing, in fact it shoud zoom with an animation to the desired scale.  How to reproduce: call this meethod and see it does nothing: `zoomToPoint(getMaxScaleFactor(), imagePoint, viewPoint, LIMIT_ALL, 400, null) `  I hope I answered all your questions. Thanks for your interest.

Hello Phillipus, I think i can reproduce the issue, what can i do to help you to debug ? Maybe there is a log file ?
hi, cerberus_featureflipping_activatewebsocketpush : Y cerberus_featureflipping_websocketpushperiod : 1000  FYI my tests case have a lot of step case(almost 50) with a lot of objects(almost 100) and a lot of properties (almost 50 and 100 inherited).
I don't have to do anything in SQL editor to reproduce it.  Just opening a new empty SQL editor is enough.
> My goal is to remove all mobs and only allow a specified few  I'd like to make it so that only X mob can spawn in Y biome. This would require players to travel around and gather specific materials versus just staying in one static location.  The "bug" is that no mobs spawn at all. Except the ender dragon and bats.  Here's a small "mod pack" that has all the required. https://www.dropbox.com/s/8fi5ddbzm42yc1n/MobTest.tar.gz?dl=0
I tested it on bluestacks, it gets detected as S5, idk how. Also when I test the debug version of my application on my Lenovo Tab it shows as Asus phone. Fabric really needs to get it together 
I saw this exception on my statistics platform.so,I don't know the user's operation.I thought the user maybe kills app when OkHttp initiates a network request?
1)  I receive data from a backend that I need to encode with specific set before appending them to an url later when actually loading it. Since it's on a performance critical path and dealing with many thousands, I do the encoding before saving to database. OkHTTP code fit that needs of specific sets and is way faster and allocation efficient than OS versions (Specially since I then need to do some replace in the generated string to fix the applied set)  2) Less important as less critical path, but I do need to generate simple static string urls with encoded login/password and place holders with manual encoding allocate a lot less than create a full blown httpurl and convert to string. (For that one I could use provided httpurl api) 
Sorry, that’s a typo. I’m on 1.5.6.
Hello Tobias,     It seems that my phone does send such error reports to Google directly (see attached screen shot). I have no option to change this nor do I see this message in any „Sent“ folder or so.     As the crash message was popping up several times when I work with the phone, I uninstalled the app from my phone. I’ll give it another try in some weeks or so and use M$ OneDrive meanwhile.     On my tablet (Android 8.1), things work fine, though.     Best Regards,  Gabriel.     Von: Tobias Kaminsky <notifications@github.com>  Gesendet: Donnerstag, 8.

I can't reproduce it reliably. 
Ups, I have created the two PRs together. Sorry. The fix is only one line. if you consider necessary to split it, let me know 
@akiezun using the same command lines from #1414   I get different sorting with / without --sort_by_all_columns  ``` ./gatk-launch BaseRecalibrator -I src/test/resources/large/CEUTrio.HiSeq.WGS.b37.NA12878.20.21.bam -O gatk4.tbl --knownSites src/test/resources/large/dbsnp_138.b37.20.21.vcf -R src/test/resources/large/human_g1k_v37.20.21.fasta ```  ``` java -jar ~/Workspace/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar -T BaseRecalibrator -I src/test/resources/large/CEUTrio.HiSeq.WGS.b37.NA12878.20.21.bam -o gatk3.tbl --knownSites src/test/resources/large/dbsnp_138.b37.20.21.vcf -R src/test/resources/large/human_g1k_v37.20.21.fasta --sort_by_all_columns ``` 
Have not done anything on it yet - but I will work on it today :)  On Jul 25, 2014, at 9:22 AM, Juwon Lee notifications@github.com wrote:  > @anverus thanks for reporting. Would you send a pull request for this? >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.

I hope so. Tried to find some example with same kind of functionality, but all offered just moving to another page.  That could be also included in test directory, and just load the page from file when running integration-test phase. 
Yes that is enabled and nextcloud is not on the exception list at the moment.
Obtained bow through both creative mode and survival(crafted) Enchantment books (luck and draw) thought creative mode. Was not able to test obtaining Enchantment book thought survival.  Order of placement in anvil to create the crash:  Bow then book  I will go back and do some more testing with more order of operation variants. If you have any suggestions.  Will the bow luck or draw enchants be applied to a book using the enchanting table?  By "battlemode" I asume you mean if I had selected R and had my weapons drawn. That did not occur to me, I will have to retest. 
Thanks for the quick reply! On the web interface always shows up a few different instances of the same e-mail in 'sent folder', and on k9 @ android have copies as well, but not from the tests I made today. What I mean is, the last time I have a record(more than one sent) of this, happened on 11.Jan.2017  I don't know if is relevant, but I have 'auto synchronization of emails/data' disabled. There's any way I can test the 'deleting of old drafts' to help you out?
Thank you very much my friend. I will check it out and if there are any further issues I will let ya know :D 
Works on the ea build.  Thanks to fix it promptly.
Probably a terminal is enough
Sorry, I don't think I follow. What's the issue with having an error for any no-op injection method on components, how would that be a pain in development?

@TylerJewell All of the source code were automatically downloaded through the Yatta installer. And I didn't make any change about source code.  
Yes, I have to use TextureView for renderer where using complex shader to draw final frames. I can't use a SurfaceView for my renderer because a layout contains complex hierarchy of different elements and TextureView elements among them with overlay views. A SurfaceView doesn't allow to implement that.  There is example how I use the YuvConverter:  ```java // Example ByteBuffer outputFrameBuffer = null; YuvConverter yuvConverter = null;  int outputFrameSize = width * height * 3 / 2; if (this.outputFrameBuffer == null) {     this.outputFrameBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(outputFrameSize); } if (this.yuvConverter == null) {     this.yuvConverter = new YuvConverter(); } this.yuvConverter.convert(this.outputFrameBuffer,         width, height, stride,         frame.textureId,         texMatrix);  if (this.outputFrameBuffer != null) {     ByteBuffer[] yuvPlanes;     int[] yuvStrides;      i = this.layoutLock;     synchronized (this.layoutLock) {         byte[] data = this.outputFrameBuffer.array();         int offset = this.outputFrameBuffer.arrayOffset();          yuvPlanes = new ByteBuffer[]{                 ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(width * height),                 ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(width * height / 4),                 ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(width * height / 4)         };          yuvStrides = new int[]{                 width,                 (width + 1) / 2,                 (width + 1) / 2         };          yuvPlanes[0].put(data, offset, width * height);          for (int r = height; r < height * 3 / 2; ++r) {             yuvPlanes[1].put(data, offset + r * stride, stride / 2);         }          for (int r = height; r < height * 3 / 2; ++r) {             yuvPlanes[2].put(data, offset + r * stride + stride / 2, stride / 2);         }     } }  .....```
There is no crash log. Additionally, it happened again. 
Oh sorry I haven't seen the dup.  I extended the actions generation inside the actions.js file to handle a custom type of action which I am currently developing (https://github.com/Sheldor5/alfresco-share-clipboard) and I haven't found another way than overwriting the OOTB client-side javascript file. 
The links are all reddit links with 1 exception. I'll remove it from the file and test it real quick.
You'll have to excuse my inexperience, I'm using maven to get 2.2.0 in intellij,  I've tried changing the version to `SNAPSHOT`, `2.3-SNAPSHOT` and `2.3.0` (based on the 2.3.0 milestone).  If I put in `LATEST` I get version 2.2.1 (I was using  2.2.0 before), is this the correct version I should be trying? Because it still has the problem.

It means that when you call `BuildProducer.produce()` outside of the scope of your build step, it is (probably) throwing an exception that is silently discarded.  Though looking at the code, there might not be a check for this after all.  > > Build producers can only be executed within the duration of that step's execution. >  > If that's the case then we should definitely update the `BuildProducer`'s javadoc.

You'll need another build step if you want to produce build items later.  If you want to produce a build item earlier which represents some action that should occur later, your build item could contain a function of some sort that is executed in a later build step.
yes 
We have a primary key on the mapping table. And a custom order activity that removes and re-adds offer codes based on some attributes, using just the order side of the relation (standard OrderService method). Most of the time it worked fine, but occasionally it would cause a duplicate key constraint error. 
@eivindveg I restarted multiple times, also re-installed the app. I eventually figured out through the code where the database file was and deleted it.

Aha, this is the place to set it up. =)  it's only UNITY_EDITOR DEBUG TRACE I did install the UnityEditorConsuloPlugin5.3.dll into my unity folder.  Is there any reason the constants are not sync with Consulo settings?
It's against the Benchmark. Pretty simple. Launch ZAP, paste in benchmark home page URL, hit attack, immediately hit Stop.  It did this to me 2-3 times in a row. I'll try again tonight to see if I  can repeat the result. I am running on Mac and giving ZAP lots of memory, neither of which should matter.

I want to enable title and i try a lot of times,It is not work. 
We are using Version 1.7.0. Thus, this is somehow an issue in our environment. I'm going to debug into it.  Update 1: slingRequest.getAttribute("com.day.cq.wcm.componentcontext").getParent() is not null, don't know why, still investigating. But seems not to be a  component-error handler issue.  Update 2: while calling a not existing page in CQ 5.6.1 the IncludeOptions in WCMComponentFilter are null, thus the currentPage is null and the a context stack is bulit with two component contexts (a PageComponentContextImpl and a TopLevelComponentContextImpl). I've disabled all of our custom made filters, same behavior. Thus this behavior seems to be by design. Maybe, checking componentContext.isRoot() is not enough. Maybe, an additional check for TopLevelComponentContextImpl is needed?

For example, if I have any kind of items in my inventory they gone after I login into the server! My armor, the blocks, anything that I have in inventory just miss... If the name matching my name has for example a flower in his hands, I will logon with the flower only... and in the same place that my NPC is!  Thx 
thanks for triaging, yeah it seems to be a hassle because local files aren't treated as proper modules without appending ``.js``.  VS Code's Monaco seems to be doing the job pretty well at detecting local modules. Orion seems to suffer from that syntax.
Waila 1.5.10 and Thermal Recycling 1.0.2.4 from Curse. I meant same as in same tooltip not the same block sorry if there was any misinformation I contributed there. 
Yes spring retry is on the class path and @EnableRetry annotation is in place. I do see a retry if I introduce a network failure, however do not see a retry for the status codes that I define in my configuration.  dependencies is setup in maven as follows:  ```XML  	<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-ribbon</artifactId> 		</dependency>  		<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-eureka</artifactId> 			<!-- version>1.3.0.RELEASE</version --> 		</dependency>  		<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> 		</dependency>  		<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.retry</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-retry</artifactId> 			<version>1.1.5.RELEASE</version> 		</dependency> 		 		<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.aspectj/aspectjtools --> <dependency>     <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>     <artifactId>aspectjtools</artifactId>     <version>1.8.10</version> </dependency> 		  		<dependency> 			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> 			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId> 			<scope>test</scope> 		</dependency>  ```
So adding that mutex does make the problem more rare but I could still get it to happen by the about 30th run when I had 3 requests happen at the same millisecond.  I'll do some more poking.  Edit. could not repeat this anymore despite how long I ran the test. Might have been some fluke thing related to how I created the mutex at that time. The attached PR 884 seems to fix this completely.

HI @pontusmelke  When I use arrays, I still report the same error.  eg: `CREATE (g:gps{type:"gps",location:"shanghai", coordinates:[point({srid:4326, x:30.655691, y:104.081602})] });`  ```  curl http://IP:PORT/db/data/transaction/commit -u xxxx:xxxx -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{ "statements": [{ "statement": "match (n:gps) return n", "parameters": {}, "includeStats": true, "resultDataContents": ["rest"] }] } " ```  Error is as follows： "code": "Neo.TransientError.Network.CommunicationError", "message": "Current context not an ARRAY but OBJECT", "stackTrace": "org.codehaus.jackson.JsonGenerationException: Current context not an ARRAY but OBJECT
Just tested it. With this release version, I'm having exactly the same problem. Can't undo until I open (and close) an experiment. This mean at startup of course, until I launch a simulation.  Here also, no redo even afterlauchung/relaunching experiment.  When I say opening experiment, I don't have to run any model, just go to the "simulation perspective" by choosing an experiment.

@douglasmiller thank you! I can provide requests /responses payloads or x-request-ids, any other info, just ping me.
IMO @k-wall is right, also given that we have this issue too #2863 related to resources not deleted probably due to lack of owner references I think it's worth giving this a look. Apart from that @lulf , It's maybe correct to adapt systemtests to use the documented uninstalling process, I'm thinking of a reason not to do it but nothing comes to my mind, maybe @kornys have something to say

No, indentation in the project was set to 4 spaces, that’s what I meant by RStudio ignoring the project settings. I should add that when I saw it was 4 in the project settings, I erased the value, put it on 4 again and saved the project, but that did not fix the bug. Only changing it to a different number, saving it, and then changing it back to 4 fixed it.   I do also have _Auto-detect code indentation_ turned off, but my understanding is that it shouldn’t have mattered anyway, its tooltip said that this should only apply to files that are not part of any project. In any case, having it on or off did not change anything about this bug. 
I added the app to the Samsung store with billing about a week ago and have gotten 72 instances of this error:   java.lang.NullPointerException at org.onepf.oms.appstore.SamsungAppsBillingService.queryInventory(SamsungAppsBillingService.java:190) at org.onepf.oms.OpenIabHelper.queryInventory(OpenIabHelper.java:802) at org.onepf.oms.OpenIabHelper$5.run(OpenIabHelper.java:833) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:856)  It took me a while to find out that OpenIAB expects the key to be "group_id/item_id" but I fixed that before I uploaded the app so I don't think that's the problem. I don't have a Samsung phone so I can't debug this exception. This and the other exceptions I listed above are all that I've seen in the past 7 days. 
I can confirm that version 0.5-1 fixes this issue. 
I observed the problem with the `ReferenceWrappingReducer` in [PlanReduceOperator](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/blob/master/stratosphere-java/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/api/java/operators/translation/PlanReduceOperator.java) but expect this to have the same effect in [ReduceFunction](https://github.com/stratosphere/stratosphere/blob/master/stratosphere-java/src/main/java/eu/stratosphere/api/java/functions/ReduceFunction.java).  When looping over the iterator, the final hasNext() call in the wrapping `reduce(Iterator<Reference<T>> in, Collector<Reference<T>> out)` overwrites the curr object. I think the problem is that return values are not _safe_ when returned from the user function as in the other function which serialize output values or immediately forward them to the next function.  I am currently working on a fix that copies the result of the function call into another mutable object using a Serializer. 
A user of this library might rely on `configuration.isNamespaceCleanupEnabled()` in order to cleanup their own stuff.  We were using our own flag to control this behavior, but we dropped it in favor of using arq-cube one. It doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel for such behavior.  So, we create our stuff and, in the end, we check for that flag to decide whether or not to cleanup the stuff we created.  The problem is that by default, that flag is set to `false` on arq-cube (given `DestroyNamespace` is true by default), which is semantically wrong, since its meaning is: "Should we cleanup stuff after the tests run?".  The fact the the whole namespace is going to be destroyed at the end of the suite should not affect the fact we should cleanup the stuff we created.  Example of workflow: 1. Test1 runs and creates, say, a BuildConfig named "build" 1. Test1 finishes, but we don't delete the BuildConfig above because `configuration.isNamespaceCleanupEnabled()` returned false 1. Test2 starts but fails because it also creates a BuildConfig named "build". (duplicated resource) 1. Test suite ends, namespace is cleaned up.  Note the broken behavior on step 3 above. With my patch this is fixed, because it makes configuration less subjective.
I'm using 1.0.3.  
Thanks for the quick reply! Here is the code I'm using (sorry it's in Kotlin):  ``` kotlin                 TapTargetView.showFor(                     activity,                     TapTarget.forView(name, "Tap here to name your subject!")                         .outerCircleColor(R.color.blue)                         .cancelable(false)                         .dimColor(R.color.black)                     ,                     object : TapTargetView.Listener() {                         override fun onTargetClick(view: TapTargetView?) {                             super.onTargetClick(view)                             ...                         }                     }                 ) ``` 
I still seem to get this issue occasionally, and I believe this is more due to us using multiple repositories - in the instance I had this morning, a code review I was looking at had a parent commit that was NOT in my local repository, so the object references didn't exist - if I manually did a fetch from gerrit then the plugin worked.  When the gerrit-intellij plugin does a fetch from gerrit as you click thru reviews, is that fetching directly into my local repository or just fetching in-memory? I suspect something like the later...

I filed a bug to get screenshot support in GeckoView: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462018
The problem is that the chosen-sprite.png is used in the css file to define multiple background (that I wrapped by the literal function, otherwise it doesn't work):  ``` .chzn-container-single .chzn-search input {   background: #fff url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px;   background: literal("url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px, -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%, color-    stop(1%, #eeeeee), color-stop(15%, #ffffff))");    background: literal("url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px, -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #eeeeee 1%, #ffffff 15%)");    background: literal("url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px, -moz-linear-gradient(top, #eeeeee 1%, #ffffff 15%)");    background: literal("url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px, -o-linear-gradient(top, #eeeeee 1%, #ffffff 15%)");    background: literal("url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px, -ms-linear-gradient(top, #eeeeee 1%, #ffffff 15%)");    background: literal("url('chosen-sprite.png') no-repeat 100% -22px, linear-gradient(top, #eeeeee 1%, #ffffff 15%)");  ``` 
This is on Linux with openjdk version "1.8.0_91" The launcher is version 3.2.3.1  I had a quick look at the launcher's code. It looks like you have your own code for deleting files, which looks similar to the apache commons file utils.  Would it be an option to use the original file utils for doing the job? If yes then I can do a quick test if this would fix the problem. 
after sync with master, update the server config and test again, the first issue is gone, but the 2nd issue is not fixed.

Ok great - was just about to upload the build log, but I guess not necessary now. 
So I have add this:  -keep class * extends android.webkit.WebChromeClient { *; } -dontwarn im.delight.android.webview.**   into:  buildTypes {         release {             minifyEnabled false             proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'         }     }   right?
Yes, I prefer the latter, too. Even better if you can clone the ClientInfo object and set the MediaType in the clone as the only one MediaType; so that the original client preferences remain unchanged as JavaDoc says for the ClientResource.get(MediaType) method overload. 
For me it didn't work on the beta7 version! I now changed to a signed certificate, so I wont be able to test this in the future.
Sure. Will let you know and post full logcat after a clean flash. Btw what is "noral" ? Kindly add Power Menu tile.  Thank you ! 
Nexus 6P - Stock 7.1.2 I just tried again and realised it only seems to happen on really big image files, so maybe it was just because the pictures hadn't been completely loaded in!
@cjayswal : It's a typo mistake only in the github while reporting this issue but not with my actual code Please follow the steps below:  Add these maven dependencies to pom.xml  <dependency> <groupId>com.qmetry</groupId> <artifactId>qaf</artifactId> <version>2.1.13</version> </dependency> <dependency>  <dependency> <groupId>org.testng</groupId> <artifactId>testng</artifactId> <version>6.14.3</version> </dependency>  1. Create an excel file(excelfile.xls) and sheet name as (excelreader) with columns as (name,address,email) and one row with some values. 2.Point this to QAF dataProvider and give the sheetName as well. 3.In the @Test method, call data.get("name") and observe you will see an exception( I'm running this in eclipse with Run as Testng option).  Other Information: I'm using JDK 1.8 version. 
Yeah I agree about production but I am thinking more in terms of offering a similar experience in case of static file and URL.  I have tried to trnasform to JWKS (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/9a0b47298c807739a9eb1adfba50795e/raw/31678c9d5de9efe10207da6ce1378bb51ff12a43/quarkus.jwt.pub.jwk.json) but now I am getting `Failed to resolve a key from: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lordofthejars/9a0b47298c807739a9eb1adfba50795e/raw/31678c9d5de9efe10207da6ce1378bb51ff12a43/quarkus.jwt.pub.jwk.json` So probably I have not done correctly.

Hi @rmpestano  That is ok for me .   Don't you to extend the faces-config.xml?  `<supported-locale>en_US</supported-locale>`   And by accident I added file faces-config.NavData with commit a2dc37f which should not be required (Netbeans autogenerated file)

@eivantsov I know that if I refresh the tab ,is can works. But I do not want to refresh it ! Is there any resolutions?
I'm getting differing reports, and I'm beginning to think that it may have to do with a user's system memory, basically each file gets pumped into the ArchiveTransferManager and I think it may be that java is putting the whole file into memory. Could you guys report what size file you're trying to upload and what your system ram is? I've successfully uploaded 9 gb, but I've got 24 gb on my system.  
You didn't understand me correctly in the point 2. I was thinking about yokes and sidesticks in the cockpit of the aircraft, but I was not thinking about yokes for controlling the aircraft. 😊  As about #4 of my list, the best way to reailse this is to move separate engines' controls to the U-Panel, and when the user is using the keyboard to manage throttles, he manages all the engines' power in one time as usual.  **Also I would like to suggest point 5**: a feature for adding instruments with different sizes. For example, modern aircraft have large screens as instruments, so it will be great to have an abitity to add thicc screens to the cockpit 😏

Thanks for your response. I am not sure which line of code of my program causes the exception because the exception stack trace doesn't show it, however, there is only one SELECT statement in the program. This happens only when the following line is present in the program: sparkConf.set("es.read.metadata", "true")  You mentioned that the document id is read anyway since the returned RDD is a PairRDD, but the result of SELECT statement is SchemaRDD[Row]. Can you please clarify about the PairRDD?  Thanks, Dmitriy Fingerman 
It would have the same effect, of course. But it's not my understanding of clean code and working efficiency to (un-)comment multiple lines of code instead of using one constant for it.  That's why there exists Hugo, isn't it? At least it would have the same effect to do a manually log in each method too. But it's not as clean and useful as the @DebugLog approach. 
Jo,  Thank you for the suggestion. That appears to have been the problem. In in the past I must not have paid much attention to whether I was typing in the "Save in" field or the "Save Bag As" window, but I followed your directions to type in the "Save Bag As" window and was successful. I think it would be helpful to make it clear to users that they should click the "Browse" button and not just fill in the "Save in" field. I will be sure to clarify this step in my institution's documentation!  Jamie
I played around with [GrantPermissionRules](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/test/rule/GrantPermissionRule) and I was able to get some of the tests running. Hopefully, that's a big hint for a new contributor to take this on. 
That's right. In other words the Date Added order in the file system does not much the order in the Recently Added playlist, like it used to.   I actually had to go back to 1.6.7 because v2.0.1 wasn't 100% right, either. An album that I downloaded a week ago was shown over the new album that I had just downloaded
No and no. I am sure this has to do with the weird bug that changes plot ownership to another player at random note at the time of post this version http://ci.forgeessentials.com/job/FE/1147/

I don't have something I can provide and I haven't found the time yet to try to isolate it. Is there any logging I can enable and capture that might be useful to you?
errmmm where does when send prices to steem? I missed those. I'm not referring to SBD or STEEM, which should remain as precision of 3, just the price calculations done on the client side.

Except you can't craft the liquid infuser, as it requires 6 dark iron plates, which are made from 6 dark iron ingots that have been made into plates.
Because of this in assemly.xml  ``` <file>         <source>${project.basedir}/../opengrok-tools/dist/opengrok-tools-${parsedVersion.majorVersion}.${parsedVersion.minorVersion}${parsedVersion.qualifier}.tar.gz</source>         <outputDirectory>tools</outputDirectory>         <destName>opengrok-tools.tar.gz</destName> </file> ```  the filename mismatch.  And this is also error prone, python discards the '-' from the name so we're stuck here to 1.1rc58.
I still observe it with the version on the play store as of 20190701.  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56189/60441598-e597fe80-9c49-11e9-84bd-54b3d295f85e.jpg" width=200>  I noticed that after a while (I took a photo of the screenshot, cropped and shared it with my laptop), the device was locked and when unlocked, the 0 ETH ether card appears. Maybe it takes a while to appear?
Hi @ISchwarz23 ,  To reproduce, we just need to add those two lines into `build.gradle`, then perform sync with gradle files.  ``` groovy compile 'com.android.support:gridlayout-v7:23.2.1' compile 'de.codecrafters.tableview:tableview:1.0.1' ```  Here is the message from `:app:processDebugResources`:  ``` logcat ~/temp/App/app/build/intermediates/res/merged/debug/values/values.xml:129 : AAPT: Attribute "columnCount" has already been defined :app:processDebugResources FAILED ```  And following is the stacktrace for `./gradlew build --stacktrace`  ``` org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskExecutionException: Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.executeActions(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:69)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.execute(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:46)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.PostExecutionAnalysisTaskExecuter.execute(PostExecutionAnalysisTaskExecuter.java:35)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.execute(SkipUpToDateTaskExecuter.java:64)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ValidatingTaskExecuter.execute(ValidatingTaskExecuter.java:58)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipEmptySourceFilesTaskExecuter.execute(SkipEmptySourceFilesTaskExecuter.java:52)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipTaskWithNoActionsExecuter.execute(SkipTaskWithNoActionsExecuter.java:52)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.SkipOnlyIfTaskExecuter.execute(SkipOnlyIfTaskExecuter.java:53)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteAtMostOnceTaskExecuter.execute(ExecuteAtMostOnceTaskExecuter.java:43)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.DefaultTaskGraphExecuter$EventFiringTaskWorker.execute(DefaultTaskGraphExecuter.java:203)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.DefaultTaskGraphExecuter$EventFiringTaskWorker.execute(DefaultTaskGraphExecuter.java:185)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.AbstractTaskPlanExecutor$TaskExecutorWorker.processTask(AbstractTaskPlanExecutor.java:62)     at org.gradle.execution.taskgraph.AbstractTaskPlanExecutor$TaskExecutorWorker.run(AbstractTaskPlanExecutor.java:50)     at org.gradle.internal.concurrent.ExecutorPolicy$CatchAndRecordFailures.onExecute(ExecutorPolicy.java:54)     at org.gradle.internal.concurrent.StoppableExecutorImpl$1.run(StoppableExecutorImpl.java:40) Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/home/letientai299/Software/Installed/Android/sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt'' finished with non-zero exit value 1     at com.android.build.gradle.tasks.ProcessAndroidResources.doFullTaskAction(ProcessAndroidResources.java:147)     at com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.IncrementalTask.taskAction(IncrementalTask.java:98)     at org.gradle.internal.reflect.JavaMethod.invoke(JavaMethod.java:75)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$IncrementalTaskAction.doExecute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:244)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$StandardTaskAction.execute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:220)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$IncrementalTaskAction.execute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:231)     at org.gradle.api.internal.project.taskfactory.AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory$StandardTaskAction.execute(AnnotationProcessingTaskFactory.java:209)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.executeAction(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:80)     at org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.execution.ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.executeActions(ExecuteActionsTaskExecuter.java:61)     ... 14 more Caused by: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/home/letientai299/Software/Installed/Android/sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt'' finished with non-zero exit value 1     at com.android.build.gradle.internal.process.GradleProcessResult.assertNormalExitValue(GradleProcessResult.java:42)     at com.android.builder.core.AndroidBuilder.processResources(AndroidBuilder.java:919)     at com.android.build.gradle.tasks.ProcessAndroidResources.doFullTaskAction(ProcessAndroidResources.java:138)     ... 22 more Caused by: org.gradle.process.internal.ExecException: Process 'command '/home/letientai299/Software/Installed/Android/sdk/build-tools/23.0.2/aapt'' finished with non-zero exit value 1     at org.gradle.process.internal.DefaultExecHandle$ExecResultImpl.assertNormalExitValue(DefaultExecHandle.java:367)     at com.android.build.gradle.internal.process.GradleProcessResult.assertNormalExitValue(GradleProcessResult.java:40)     ... 24 more ```  Thanks. 
@phit yes, i go in crash coordinates - no crash without Sponge ![2018-01-08_03 04 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26658563/34655794-d1b5980a-f420-11e7-8e73-e51ded9197b2.png) 
No, not the whole map, only the caches. 
How do I generate this error log? Via google Reports? 
Sure, I could fix this by throwing exception but am not 100% sure that doing so would fully address problem.  If you look at stack trace, you'll see that I'm not directly calling constructor. I make a seemingly reasonable call to setStyleSpans(int,StyleSpans) with a non-empty StyleSpans object. I probably need to investigate what's wrong with arguments to this call. Perhaps I'm adding empty span via StyleSpansBuilder? Should that be prohibited? Whatever the case, it's probable that error condition could be detected before Paragraph ctor is invoked. 
Yes it's still a problem; this is what I had done to move on: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/8fd4337ee1160ace2aec3c1f4f61377a3db96213/extensions/hibernate-orm/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/hibernate/orm/deployment/HibernateOrmReflections.java#L111-L114
Thanks, and sorry for not noticing the conflict with #23 
After I did some more testing it turns out this is more likely a Far from home issue as I took out underground biomes and the giant chunks of stone still generated on a world without it sorry for possibly wasting your time. The previous non UB world I did with it didn't have them so I thought it was UB causing it. I will contact Far from home about it instead.
Yes i did. Nothing changes. What seems to fix it: Reconnect all laser relays with the one on top of the item interface, individually. ![setup3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9303498/20866230/4bf1503e-ba28-11e6-9561-10bb23fc3a4d.jpg)  To nr. 2: Yes that is correct. I placed the item relay from the esd on the side. Now the esd recognises the right amount of inventory slots. (one chest less then before)
I did not make further testing, i'll close this and will take time to re-test it at some point :) 
Here is a sample : https://github.com/vcariven/spring-cloud-consul-demo I run it from Eclipse STS on windows 64bit. Further explanation at : https://github.com/vcariven/spring-cloud-consul-demo/blob/master/README.md 
I have just custom world where is nobody. Protectionstone get crashed place event since 1d. Idk why, before on that version everything was okay. When i put plot as OP in console its that event but it create plot. when player put block with plot it doesnt work. Before was everything okey  Edit i fiexed it. BetterRTP have collision with it  Edit 2: i didnt fixed after restart it worked but now is sill this same error 
There you go ! https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwu5m8iw8Oc_QlFUM0pXZzJSNTA/view?usp=sharing 
We used to paint the coastline with separate rules for `closed` or not and a fixed width for all zoom levels, which didn't look very good.  Now appearance is more clear, but some may still like to have coastline in the maps. That's why I didn't remove it from `tag-mapping`, to let them paint it if they want.  The land polygons, if they are split, cannot be used easily for that without artifacts. 
OK, I have made some progress in better characterizing this issue.  It appears that the upgrade process doesn't result in a "proper" boot loop but, instead, the tablet simply takes 2-3 times as long to boot.  The short version of what I did is as follows: 1. I attempted the same upgrade (1.8.3 -> 1.8.7) after a fresh boot and got the same result (I force rebooted after being stuck on the boot screen "too long").   2. I performed the same reset procedure outlined above except that I didn't import my settings.  I then repeated the upgrade process and got a successful boot in the normal timeframe for this device. 3. Just to further nail things down, I then imported my settings and rebooted.  After it looked like the same "hung boot" results, I started to write this post.  It took long enough that, when I glanced back at my device, I noticed that it did in fact eventually boot to the home/lock screen (I then had to re-compose this post...:>).  It did take significantly longer than normal, though. 4.  From there, I performed a standard upgrade to 1.8.10.  Interestingly, the reboot time for that upgrade seemed pretty normal.  Since this is an easily reproducible issue (on my device), I am more than happy to go a few more rounds if you would like me to gather some specific data for you.  Otherwise, the underlying issue seems far less serious than I originally outlined and I am content to just move on.  Let me know your thoughts!  I think the squarely point to a problem in my settings (and/or possibly some room for improved error-checking imported settings within XPrivacy).  Regardless, based on the changes made in XPrivacy btwn 1.8.3 and 1.8.7, can you suggest some settings (i.e. apps and/or hooks...) I could look into to determine what is causing the problem?  Thanks in advance! 
Here is the mod list http://gyazo.com/6a20d04a298efc958a3ea4ea747bd887 that my server is currently running, All of these mods (With the exception of EnviroMine) are from the Feed The Beast pack Direwolf 20 1.7.10  
After more thorough investigation it was determined that jetty wasn't the cause of the issue so I'm closing it.
Yes its working now .. Thanks ..!  On Thu, Oct 24, 2013 at 5:39 PM, Yegor Bugayenko notifications@github.comwrote:  > The problem is fixed and released to Maven Central as 0.4.1.

Initially no, but I just enabled it in the current master to see if that fixes anything: The problem persists.

Go to the nigtly5 or nigtly server and create workspace from java stack for example. 
I did not @vmax. The most ideal solution is not to have to run these "initialisation" commands at all.  In Python, do we have a similar situation where we have to do something like `bazel run //:pip install`?
Alright, sorry for the long delay. so I did some testing:  **1. Fortunately without any shaders and resourcepacks it works just fine.**  **_NO RESOURCEPACKS_** 2. When I turn on my SEUS Renewed shaders this happens: [SCREENSHOT](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nvgwrhx0qesyx7j/2019-10-14_22.51.27.gif?dl=0) 3. When I turn on my Sildurs Vibrant shaders this happens: [SCREENSHOT](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mx9v5pi8rt74g4o/2019-10-14_22.56.57.gif?dl=0)  **_NO SHADERPACKS_** 4. When I switch to Faithful resourcepack this happens: [SCREENSHOT](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2z1xmqg7z967074/2019-10-14_23.08.35.gif?dl=0) 5. When I switch to VanillaBDcraft resourcepack this happens: [SCREENSHOT](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dpab3c6uofkxcbx/2019-10-14_23.13.38.gif?dl=0)  It seems like that with shaders most of the moving blocks flash for no reason and with the resource packs the belt's texture changes constantly.    
only if they spawn in the two block spaces in my branch mine they ignore me but near the entrance of the branch mine (a normal cave) they run in and attack me

Not 100% sure but I noticed it with the latest skript version. 
It is simple ... Veinminer is working in server environment without sponge. If I start the server with spongeforge, veinminer doesn't work. Sorry, but no error logs, no crashlogs, neither on server or client side.  This can be really easy be achieved by only using: - forge 2073 - spongeforge 2073...1705 - veinminer 0.34.1.1.9r571...  on server side,  - forge 2073 - veinminer 0.34.1.1.9r571...  on client side.   No additional configuration needed. Just delete spongeforge on server side and it works. 
Still the same with build 1423, On server start the loaders are not functioning. once i log in and go to each dimension all is good even if i log out for a while. i will try with world anchors later to see if its the same right now this is with chickenchunks. Any thing i can get info from for you that helps, I'm not seeing anything in any logs?

Hi Stephen, sorry, seems the attachments did not go through as I answered via email. I tried the project again today and funnily enough it worked flawlessly. Has there been any update? I was able to consistently repro it. Anyway... Will also try the insiders version. What version are you guys flighting?
is it technically possible to also maintain the rng on events like particles? it would be a massive upgrade to not loose rng when sprinting etc @Earthcomputer 
Thanks for the quick reply. Unfortunately then it compiles to:  ``` 			MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given() 					.header("Content-Type", "application/json") 					.body("value"); ```  cutting off the rest of the string 
If I remember right it happened when I exited a song right after I started it by accident. I have only seen it once 
Sry for the late answer  You wrote: _"It hangs and I get OutOfMemory!"_ That's something we experienced too .... We installed your plugin on our production bitbucket and tried it on a huge repository with a long history. As soon as we noticed that it runs very long - and our normal users cannot access to bitbucket anymore - we restarted the server to have it accessible again (so we did no experience the OutOfMemory as we restarted before). After this I wrote this report ...  Your proposed features are the same I thought about ... 
Hi I think this could be a bug because I run in another machine and works correctly then I open the same page in my pc  in edge, firefox, IE(I was using Chrome) and render properly, I clean all cookies, cache and data from Chrome but the b:selectOne render incorrectly  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49858714/69878687-39efea80-128b-11ea-8d9d-3016085f7a9e.png)

@mrniko following annotation when added is working: ``` @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "spring.cache.type", havingValue = "REDIS") ``` e.g. I don't get the exception.  I have also tied this: Instead of :  ``` @ConditionalOnClass(MeterBinder.class) ```  I have change it to :  ``` @ConditionalOnClass({MeterBinder.class, RedissonCache.class}) ``` and without putting @ConditionalOnProperty is also working - it is a bit strange because RedissonCache is a class in the same package as RedissonCacheStatisticsAutoConfiguration but it is working for me - e.g. the app do not have in it's classpath RedissonCache  So I guess the proper way should be to change this: ``` @ConditionalOnClass(MeterBinder.class) ``` to  ``` @ConditionalOnClass({MeterBinder.class, CacheMeterBinderProvider.class, RedissonCache.class}) ``` I'm adding CacheMeterBinderProvider as the class is needed for the whole thing to work and this is the class that it complains it is not in the classpath - not sure if you should add this class in ConditionalOnClass but I guess it should FYI just setting it to :  ``` @ConditionalOnClass({MeterBinder.class, CacheMeterBinderProvider.class}) ``` did not work out for me - the same exception that the CacheMeterBinderProvider.class was not found.  As for the following condition only :  ``` @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "spring.cache.type", havingValue = "REDIS") ``` The problem with this I guess is if we use redisson as tomcat session replication and in the web application we do use redis as cache but not using redisson library - so the spring.cache.type will be redis but we should not load redisson as default library to provide the cache   I saw in your test cases that you are using 'spring.redis.redisson.config' to get the redisson yml file out of the env so I guess we should use both spring.cache.type = REDIS and spring.redis.redisson.config to be set - so to end up with this: ``` @ConditionalOnExpression("'${spring.cache.type:none}'.equalsIgnoreCase('REDIS') && '${spring.redis.redisson.config:}'.length() > 0") ``` This way we should know because of the existence of 'spring.redis.redisson.config' we are using redisson as cache and because  of 'spring.cache.type=REDIS' we are using redis as cache
Hi, Could you please let me know on which server I can upload the file (~700Mb) so you can access it?
Well "Listen to events" can only be understood by technical persons imho. Replace it by "connected" or anything simple like that. A color could be good either, but I'm not sure Android allows that. And, most importantly, having at least a notification in the system tray informing the user when it's disconnecting (with some tolerance, so that user isn't spammed). You can take as example how does conversations.im works as a XMPP client.
I'll see if I can set it up and test it.  Just 0.20 or also 0.90? 
No I didn't found any as I tweaked the oregen with ThermalFoundation Worldgen options. I copied this file from the Feed The Beast Infinity PAck but the *.json file was not right formatted so there was no orespawn :D  But it's fixed now. 
What mods may / commonly cause issues with citizens?  
Sorry, but I cannot post the code as it's proprietary
Spider eyes look normal, with a slight glow to them, sorry bout not getting back to you sooner.
Just tried with 2.1-rc5 now, the issue still persists. The issue does not occur in 2.1-rc3. 
so far i understand githud (never used it before) i can only edit i file at a time. but many changes require more than one file to alter. 
I gave up on connectbot and moved to Termius.   It was just too much complicated. With Termius I was able to download the app, import my putty .ppk key from google drive and connect to my server in 5 minutes...
Unfortunately I have no idea. 
The official Barcode Scanner android app does not work. It is the same as pictured above. I did however install the released Glass barcode scanner application they have (https://github.com/zxing/zxing/releases/tag/BSGlass-0.2.1) and that works and can be called via Intent.  Apologies for any wasted time. It would be cool if y'all made your project compatible for Glass projects too since they have the library done ;)  Thanks for your time!

Hi @tglman  Actually not :-1:  i'd tested in some of case : 1) `delete from cluster:BlobStorage where @rid in (select Blob from FileItem limit 7)` throws exception `java.lang.ClassCastException: com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.impl.ORecordBytes cannot be cast to com.orientechnologies.orient.core.record.impl.ODocument` 2) `delete from cluster:blobstorage  limit 4` , works true :+1:  3) `delete from (select Blob from FileItem limit 7)` return **7** but not deleted really . it's buggy yet .  Thanks  Saeed 
@mauron85 Sorry for the late reply. I am currently using rn 29.2 and the modules version is at 0.1.1. I will try the alpha today 
@Photon-GitHub Do you need the new timings both without MassiveLag and with enabled KillauraEntity or I can disable KillauraEntity and post the timings? 
> I'm actually thinking about adding -B to the _is_gold_supported, so we use gold that is associated with clang installation.  The issue I was seeing is that there _isn't_ a `gold` associated with the `clang` installation. On Travis, `clang` was installed in `/usr/local/clang-5.0.0/bin` but `ld.gold` was in `/usr/bin`, and there wasn't an `ld.gold` binary or symlink in `clang`'s bindir. So if I'm understanding correctly, that won't help.  Since the `-B` option can be passed multiple times, what if you pass `-B <clang bin dir> -B <which ld.gold>` to those actions? Then it'll find `gold` associated with `clang` first, falling back to the default that `clang` would have used anyway if it's not present there.
@ryanjbaxter Thanks for your response. The reason being we do not want the developer to be concerned with the fact the service is a eureka client in development mode. It is a  infrastructure concern. We only want to use the service as a eureka client  in higher environments by applying a profile accordingly.  But, the concern now being it worked fine for us when we were using spring boot 1.4.5, probably something has changed in next version of Spring 1.5.3 which has caused this breaking change for us. I was not able to find anything from the release notes.  Do you mean creating a EurekaClient bean would resolve this issue. Not sure how that would do so.    
I can echo `$JAVA_HOME` on che terminal. But couldn't get it in java program.   whereas I can get `System.getProperty("java.home")` to respective jre directory.
It looks that it happens after field addition or removal in serialized class (may be without change of serialVersionUID). It is hypothesis,  it never happened without modification in serialized classes. When the problem appears, then the Tomcat's log is full of serialized data from sessions (each ~1M in size) without any additional log.

I didn't realize they were ordered now. Agreed! 
I am not blaming spigot because all the other plugins managed to find a way to cancel event without it leaking somehow. I think this can be fixed in skript by trying a different method or changing the code. As for the items breaking, it is really easy to reproduce but just not clear exactly what causes it. If you cancel event of 2 items and then put 1 in your offhand, spam click both, then they will stop working properly and ignore the trigger. It will cancel event on these items for other irrelevant clicks. I think that's the easiest way to reproduce the second bug, all though I've done it without using offhand and sometimes doing nothing at all.

Yes I am using Gradle - version 6.1.1. Android Gradle Plugin version 3.5.3. Is there any easy way to see which files does Proguard take into account? 🤔(similar to _Merged Manifest_ view in Android Studio)  In the meantime I'll try to prepare simple repro repository.

I have noticed this in multiple data sets.  I think I first noticed it  in version 1.10.2.

- open app - go to starred articles - press back* -> closes app - re-open app -> shows unread articles  \* I have found out that I am not allowed to press back, but instead I have to use the "middle" button which just suspends the app. Whit this, it also works with fresh articles for me.
I tried moving the Lathe.xml file, but it regenerated the same, and didn't fix the problem in-game. I'm using FTB continuum 1.4.1 (I updated AR+LV and IE though). I just tested a brand new profile with just AR+LV and JEI, and it still ate a stack of Iron.
Its not just an issue with 12:00, any slot which is available from 12 to 1 wouldn't render 12 as selected in time picker. This is the screen shot :   ![screenshot_20160315-095233](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4961459/13767732/e6e810b0-ea93-11e5-9492-1a59052190e4.png)  Time slots from Log :  [10:00, 10:20, 10:40, 11:00, 11:20, 11:40, 12:00, 12:20, 12:40, 14:00, 14:20, 14:40, 15:00, 15:20, 15:40, 16:00, 16:20, 16:40, 17:00, 17:20, 17:40, 18:00, 18:20, 18:40, 19:00, 19:20, 19:40, 20:00, 20:20, 20:40] 
Right, I forgot to mention this information. I use "Always".
Every time.
I uploaded the original xml file. check below xml files.  https://github.com/na-in-lee/sample   1. VMAP file  - vmap_ex.xml  : custom path line5, 12, 20   2. Vast file (vamp tag) - google_jtbcmp4.xml  
Yes, I also think that I'm using 1.0.8.  Below is the code that creates the AnimatedDrawable (or if that does not work, creates a normal BitmapDrawable assuming it is a non-animated image). Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this issue on my device by myself, but a friend of mine gets it from time to time (Samsung Galaxy S3). Also, in Google Developer Console, I get many of these native crash report; the devices are mostly Galaxy S3, Nexus 5, Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S5, Xperia Z1. Looks like it happens only on Android 4.3 and 4.4 (but that might be a coincidence).  ``` public void setImageFile(final File img, final Runnable onReadyToDisplay) {         if (animatedDrawable != null) {             animatedDrawable.recycle();             animatedDrawable = null;         }          if (img == null) {             return;         }          try {             animatedDrawable = new GifDrawable(img);             animatedDrawable.stop();         } catch (IOException e) {         } catch (OutOfMemoryError oome) {         }          if (animatedDrawable != null) {         // create regular image view (as it is not an animated GIF) ``` 
So, the end result is that I had to copy the entire assets dir to the parent directory of the JAR, and then reference it through LIBGDX normally. Since gradle exports everything inside of the `assets` directory to the classpath of the JAR, I had to put everything inside of a subdirectory called `resources`.   When launching the JAR, the assets directory will be extracted to the **working directory**. This means that if your working directory parameter in IntelliJ is blank, it will attempt to copy the files to the root of the project _I think_. Below is an example of a working JAR configuration. ![screenshot from 2015-10-21 20 51 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7645647/10646802/87a249b6-7835-11e5-8b97-8afcc289c35d.png)

1.) I use version 5.004 with a Galaxy S5 2.) Protocol Pop3 3.) I haven't seen any details. In the last days it didn't happen. I guess a Mail-Server within the cluster with an invalid certificate. But I don't know for shure. 
Sure.   `BanManager/config.yml - onlineMode: false` `/server.properties - online-mode=false`  It also may be possible because I'm using dev build of EssentialsX, I'm using this right now https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX/792/

@tolusha  My workaround was to create project first and then run `chectl` to install che. Some how chectl does not create project if one does not exist any more. 
Hmmm... Seems inconsistent, I made a simple mock setup with 2 slime generators, the RR gets stuck on one of them, but not the other... I was however, able to completely tear this system down and rebuild it and get the same issue.  Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UMdkniotE&feature=youtu.be  
@nallar   I'm not sure - Haven't gotten the error again since. 
This error was reported by players on my server, they say the pet menu didn't work and i found a lot of exceptions in the server.log, so i need to test it by myself and report you later :3 
Ahh I see, you are correct. As a sanity check I confirmed that the 0.8.9 artifact in maven was indeed targeted to 1.8. ``` javap -v ./org/roaringbitmap/buffer/BitmapBatchIterator.class | grep "version:"   minor version: 0   major version: 52 ```  I agree this is an issue with the standard library.   Doing some digging this is the path that I see- 1. Cast to Buffer in all appropriate places 2. It looks like they added --release for this very issue. http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/247   so `--release 8` would need to be specified in addition to sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility in gradle.  This will cause a compiler error for all places where the cast is needed (making it detectable at compile time instead of at runtime)  I would be happy to look into this further and submit a PR if you think this is the correct path to go down.
yes, I will post below:  ``` <android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout`     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"         xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"         xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"         android:id="@+id/list_coordinator"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="match_parent"         android:fitsSystemWindows="true"         android:orientation="vertical">      <android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout         android:id="@+id/list_bar_layout"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="256dp"         android:fitsSystemWindows="true"         android:theme="@style/ThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar">          <android.support.design.widget.CollapsingToolbarLayout             android:id="@+id/list_collapsing_toolbar"             android:layout_width="match_parent"             android:layout_height="match_parent"             app:contentScrim="@color/action_primary"             app:title="@string/hub"             android:fitsSystemWindows="true"             app:layout_scrollFlags="scroll|exitUntilCollapsed"             app:statusBarScrim="@color/color_primary_dark">              <ImageView                 android:id="@+id/toolbar_image"                 android:layout_width="match_parent"                 android:layout_height="match_parent"                 android:fitsSystemWindows="true"                 android:scaleType="centerCrop"                 app:layout_collapseMode="parallax"                 tools:ignore="ContentDescription" />              <android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar                 android:id="@+id/toolbar"                 android:layout_width="match_parent"                 android:layout_height="?attr/actionBarSize"                 android:popupTheme="@style/PopupStyle"                 app:layout_collapseMode="pin" />          </android.support.design.widget.CollapsingToolbarLayout>      </android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout>      <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView         android:id="@+id/list_main"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="match_parent"         app:layout_behavior="@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior" />  </android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout> ```

Please find attached sample test.sh in the test.zip.  I put 2 symlinks.  One is /src/test-branch/src and another is /src/test-branch/mtx/src.  When I index and deploy, both are listed in the directory list in the browser but I can not see the file contents.  It says 'Failed to get xref file'.  Under /data/xref, there is no entries for these 2 directories.  [test.zip](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/files/2700028/test.zip) 
Thanks it works, I did not know this maven trick. Maybe it would be good to mention it in the how-tos.

I'm fairly certain that I did yes, though I will try again to verify when I have some time and report back. 
Hi, thanks for trying to solve that. I am not sure to understand what I can do for helping  ...  1) create a new empty category  (OK, understood) 2) I add only items that are already in my other categories (Notepads)  ? 3) I do that for plenty items and check if some can be erased or not ?  NB : I tried to create a bug report, but my phone doesnt work correctly with Android Device Monitor (device not seen) :-(

No, it's a timezone problem ... the SimpleDateFormat instance need a defined one, otherwise some "default" is used. And the default depends on the machine the code is running on. But this only happens if the format pattern does not contain a timezone information like in "yyyy-MM-dd" 
It's not always reproduceable. But my impression is it happens more often if the numbers are not changed after they are set from the suggest button.

Ergh, I messed up. I was talking about the tanks and energy bar, but apparently somehow they'd got resized down to being tiny and I neglected to check first -.-  My bad, no bug. You can close this ~.~;; 
Yes, theres no problem, its granted till my smartphone starts ;) 
I needed to zip the file due to github file extension policy. Second thing I noticed: When I create a category automatically, it stays empty. The file size of the generated file is zero and stays empty if I click "view". [category.zip](https://github.com/ctron/package-drone/files/78818/category.zip) 
@timtay-microsoft I was using 1.3.30, which is the version one currently gets when following the quickstart from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/quickstart-send-telemetry-java  - you might want to upgrade those samples.  Then I upgraded to 1.15.0 and the problem still repros. Digging further, I found I spelled "GatewayHostname" instead of "GatewayHostName". Turns out that the Java SDK requires this exact capitalization. For any other spelling the SDK will just ignores the gatewayhostname segment and instead of providing an error it will connect straight to the IoTHub. For reference, the .NET SDK works with any capitalization of "GatewayHostName".  Btw, with the correct spelling I am hitting another error that I now need to investigate on my end first.  For this bug it seems like there are two things to fix: 1) update your samples to a current SDK 2) allow any capitalization of "gatewayhostname" - or fail if the spelling is not correct, instead of silently connecting to IoTHub, which clearly isn't what the user has intended.

Most of them seem to be related to graphics display environment. They run fine on locally on eclipse and IntelliJ. The only two _real_ failures are in `org.terasology.rendering.nui.layouts.ColumnLayoutTest`.  ``` Argument(s) are different!

For example, if there is an 8FE/t solar Flux reborn solarpanel on the battery and the battery is full then only 8 FE/t will be output. Without an incoming energy source, 2000 will be output or what you specify in the configs.

The bug is indeed fixed. 
Good morning Matthias! There is nothing in the error console, only the log message that I have  loaded my bib file. Attached the error popup. I'm on Win 7 64bits. BTW, I speculate the help files are inside the jar file, because in the  installation there is no /help/en/ directory.

Thank you for your response.  I usually suppress "clojure/rust/pascal/lambda" messages. I tried with "-l DEBUG".  If I add this parameter, return code is 0 but if I don't use, return code is 1.

@RobWin https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j/issues/645 was submitted by me, too. I am just wondering Whether @FeignClient supports fallback. https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j/issues/645 says yes. But My test says no.
I'm not sure to be honest, where do I check for that 
I could find it in the code. I have added a log message into SipCallManager.sessionEnded and SipCallManager.cleanupSession but sessionEnded does not seem to be called. 
Hi,  main issue on my side is time, not finding where the problem is. If you feel like contributing, feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request that fixes the issue.   The idea is to have the hint text aligned to the bottom of the EditText text when that one is empty.

Link to OreSpawn: http://www.orespawn.com/  That's the mod that adds the entity that I want to add. I've found a mod that has this function, but this mod adds a lot more and I want to use this one; I'm not sure if commands clash, but I'll try it.  Four other things: Firstly, as I have previously said, I'm using this in place of SPC; it adds a noclip command which lets a flying, opped player go through walls and blocks. I'd love to see that in this mod. Secondly, there should be something in place that retrieves the unlocalised names of entities (just so that people don't have to post links to mods so that you can add them in). Thirdly, the input failures are happening with this other mod that I'm testing (see above if you skipped past that). Finally, if you lost the repo, then why don't you decompile the 1.6.4 version of the mod, and then work things out from there? I know that it's hard, but there are a variety of tools that are out there to help you; just search for some Java decompilers and you'll come across something that works. :)  --EDIT--  This mod, sadly, does not work with the other, replacement mod that I'm using (it's called server commands). I've been getting internal exceptions with commands (even with vanilla commands like /help).  Github link: https://github.com/chbachman/ServerCommands  Thanks.

I can reproduce the count difference using one SSTable file. So I like to seek your help tracking this issue.  Our data is composite key + composite column names data. I choose one example SSTable files including -Data.db file about 1190323388 bytes, plus CompressionInfor.db, Index.db, Filter.db, Summary.db, Statistics.db.  The sstable2json, parsing the Data.db file, will output 195238 as count of row key. If I iterator the columns, I will get 46167243 columns from these row keys.  Now, I built the index of the above set data. After that, I wrote the following unit test code:  ``` java     public void testSSTableRowInputFormat() throws Exception {         long keyCnt = 0;         long recordCnt = 0;         Properties props = new Properties();           props.load(this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("t.properties"));         Configuration conf = new Configuration();         conf.set(HadoopSSTableConstants.HADOOP_SSTABLE_CQL, props.getProperty("cassandra.table.ddl"));         Job job = new Job(conf);         SSTableRowInputFormat ssTableRowInputFormat = new SSTableRowInputFormat();         ssTableRowInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path("/folder/"));         for (InputSplit inputSplit : ssTableRowInputFormat.getSplits(job)) {             SSTableSplit sstableSplit = (SSTableSplit) inputSplit;             TaskAttemptContext context = new TaskAttemptContext(conf, TaskAttemptID.forName("attempt_200707121733_0001_m_000000_0"));             RecordReader<ByteBuffer, SSTableIdentityIterator> recordReader = ssTableRowInputFormat.createRecordReader(inputSplit, context);             recordReader.initialize(inputSplit, context);             while (recordReader.nextKeyValue()) {                 keyCnt++;                 SSTableIdentityIterator sii = recordReader.getCurrentValue();                 while (sii.hasNext()) {                     recordCnt++;                     sii.next();                 }             }         }         System.out.println("keyCnt = " + keyCnt);         System.out.println("recordCnt = " + recordCnt);     } ```  The output is  keyCnt = 195234 recordCnt = 46167221  So using hadoop-sstable, it looks like I lost 4 row keys, and 22 columns. I have the -Index.db and -Index.db.Index files, but not sure how internal you are using the index file to generate the split and parsing the -Data.db file. Any help for debugging this issue?  Thanks 
Hi Trustin, Thanks for your hint, but the original problem was a forgotten system property -Djavax.net.debug to be removed before starting the load tests. All this print stream stuff is related to the debug logging. After removing the system property, there is no blocking anymore.  So this issue can be closed. 
I am using v4.0.9 version
Correct. An OTP can be reused several times because Yubikey table does not get updated despite the update method in CauthRealm returns "1" which means success. But actual commit is not done. This line:  https://github.com/biobankcloud/CauthRealm/blob/master/src/main/java/se/kth/bbc/crealm/CustomAuthRealm.java#L462   So in summary, when an OTP is used once, it should not be possible to reuse it again. 
It seems any lollipop devices connect with both versions, although of percentage of H2 requests is slightly higher on some devices, e.g., the h2 percentage of Nexus 5 is higher than Galaxy S6.

It affects one of the future PR which is about hiding the aws (or other object stores) secret keys. I will take a look into this issue when I am working on that PR.
It might be my client. which makes no sense since I can spawn giants and my client won't crash and my computer is quite strong. I will reinstall the jar.

thx  and sorry for not giving log files / checking this myself I have been busy the last few days  but I am happy you found it 
Thank you for your quick reply, and I apologize for my late one. I have a world which demonstrates the problem. I have the Resonant Rise 3 modpack, but I am running the latest Refined Relocation version (1.1.28)and have only used Iron chests, with RR and vanilla items.  Steps I've performed in this world:  - Place 5 sorting iron chests in a row. - Set the rightmost chest to whitelist All Ingots - Set the chest second from the left to blacklist all ingots.  Tests: Action performed: Place stacks of ingots in the leftmost chest. Expected effect: Ingots move to the rightmost chest. Observed effect: Ingots remain in the leftmost chest.  Action performed: Place stacks of ingots in the second chest (The one with ingots blacklisted) Expected effect: Ingots move to the rightmost chest. Observed effect: Ingots move to the leftmost chest.  World file is here: [NewWorld.zip](https://github.com/Dynious/RefinedRelocation/files/214357/NewWorld.zip) 
I just retested with higher Emitter Intensity and it works. My glow stone blocks were really far from what I was trying to light with them on Emitter Intensity = 13. Raised to max and it worked fine except torches on the wall turned the walls around them white >_<  
I'll have time for the weekend and then I'll make a test package focusing on this case.
@stephanrauh  I have tested and now it's ok, thank you.
Thanks for your response.  I answered you on the StackOverflow ... alternatively if you prefer I continue the conversation here.
yeah, just figured it out ...

This bug report is only about the fact, that the message should be on a separate line, to be better readable.  The error message itself is also present in the web gui, i.e. STfA only repeats it. It seems to be caused by a special character in a file name on a Linux machine in the cluster - this is not STfA's responsibility. 
Doomgull— in case you haven’t already checked, I’ll check myself now.
Thanks, new release works on 4.5  But it works only for projects with separate $GOPATH (with src, pkg, bin in project tree).  I have some projects with the shared $GOPATH (inside $GOPATH/src), but I can't debug and even run them via Run menu due to error: Process path is empty. 
The openmole gama plugin are recompiled against the latest gama version every day. I just tried this again and it seems to work.  I'll try it once more tomorow and if it is ok, I'll close the issue....
Hi - see attached debug logs. Hopefully this shows the issue. Thanks.  [output.txt](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/files/2000245/output.txt) 
I'll take a look as soon as soon as I get the chance. Just letting you know on-boarding may take some time as I have to gain comfort with Java in addition to the code base.

1) 2.1.3  2) I am not using an encrypted library 
I used the fe wand and manually specified the coordinates. The destination is being created correctly, the location of the portal itself is what the problem is. 
I will create a test application soon. 
@ThomasPohl , The line causing the issue is the second line as below: ``` 2018-07-18 18:49:46.887572    10676   UserTrace   BIP2537I: Node 'com.xyz.dbaudit.XYZ_DB_AUDIT.InsertIntoDB': Executing statement   ''SET SQL_STATEMENT = 'INSERT INTO XYZ_IIB_DB.XYZ_DB.ESB_AUDIT_IN' || '(UNIQUE_REF_NUM,ORDERID,REQ_TSTAMP,RES_TSTAMP,MESSAGE_FLOW_NAME,BROKER_NAME,SOURCE,TARGET,STATUS,TRACKINGNUMBER,JOBID,TRANSACTIONNAME,EXECUTIONGROUP,MSG_ID,HOSTNAME,ERROR_DETAILS,X_TID)                                        		Values (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)';'' at ('com.xyz.dbaudit.DB_AUDIT_InsertIntoDB.Main', '35.3').  ``` 
Nothing special, just a stone facade. I just right clicked the cables, I'm standing in front of the blocks. 
Our test environment is using Xtext load option: ``` Injector injector = new FunctionblockStandaloneSetup().createInjectorAndDoEMFRegistration(); XtextResourceSet resourceSet = injector.getInstance(XtextResourceSet.class); resourceSet.addLoadOption(XtextResource.OPTION_ENCODING, "UTF-8"); ... ``` 
Love to! The data scale is about 20*100 in general.

@Nutomic K. WIll later today. :trollface: COuldn't donm't have root to be able to log the app. 
@bclozel Yes it was what I did first. It seems that I'm able to execute my filter before or after the ``LoggingCodecConfiguration`` but ``CodecCustomizer#jacksonCodecCustomizer`` is always registered last and overrides my configuration

Yeah, it doesn't show that warning to me, but asks for the fingerprint as usual.  I'm not really familiar with mobile dev stuff, where can I find the logs?
@michaelwittig `condrestart` would restart the service if it is already running, so it would have the same effect as a `restart`.  What would be better is a `reload` (SIGHUP to reload configuration by a running daemon) but OpenSSH re-execs and daemonizes itself on a SIGHUP (which is what gets sent by a `reload`). So that wouldn't work, since the way it treats a SIGHUP is equivalent to `restart`.   This should cover the CloudFormation use case.   I'm also going to package together a .deb since I'll need to use that for my company (our setup scripts for AWS pull down deb packages from a private repo to install and configure our apps). Out of curiosity, are you manually packaging the RPM or using an authoring tool like FPM (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm)? 
I tried the to reproduce the Screenshots above but it worked correct. (I clicked on the Tag "system thinking" in the column for Jan, got to the next page and went back by using the back button of the browser. Same with clicking on one the Tag "France" and going back for the Service.) But there was again the homepage text in the wrong place, see below.  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18674205/15814010/beee1174-2bc3-11e6-98c4-1999740be226.png) Using the back button to reconstruct this, the homepage text appeared in the right column, like this: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18674205/15814028/dc7d25ae-2bc3-11e6-8d31-7db015c5a3fb.png) Then I tried to reproduce this, but all worked correct. Strange. 
That looks like the expected behavior, but it's different from what I'm seeing on my device. Here's a quick GIF:  ![20191010_060110](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8658164/66556361-f8bf4200-eb47-11e9-912c-5a46f2862da0.gif)  As you can see, the editor switches to light theme (and remains in the light theme when I reopen it) but the note list keeps the dark theme.  However, this is a fairly edge case scenario — in other tests where I added content to the new note or performed other actions the whole app switched themes as expected — so this could be a very low priority or wontfix issue unless others are running into it. 
``` select sum(calls) filter (where upper(trim(query)) ~ '^SELECT' ) as "SELECT",        sum(calls) filter (where upper(trim(query)) ~ '^UPDATE' ) as "UPDATE",        sum(calls) filter (where upper(trim(query)) ~ '^INSERT' ) as "INSERT",        sum(calls) filter (where upper(trim(query)) ~ '^DELETE' ) as "DELETE"   from pg_stat_statements  where upper(trim(query)) ~ '^(SELECT|UPDATE|INSERT|DELETE)'```
> Thanks for your report @neomatrix369! It's possible that the merge code assumes that the two fields are covered by `allDeclaredFields` without considering that this discards their `allowWrite` attribute. Can you provide command lines and source code or a JAR file to reproduce (ideally a minimal example)?  I'll try to provide some example. Quite possible and shouldn't happen since `allDeclaredFields` and `allowWrite` are two different levels of abstractions if I understand right, one if read-only and the other one allows writing.
In this very old app of mine I use it like following:      @SharedPreferences(name = Preferences.PREF_NAME, mode = SharedPreferenceMode.PRIVATE)     public interface Preferences extends SharedPreferenceActions     {         String PREF_NAME = "APP_PREFERENCES";                  public static final String userKnowsNavigationDrawer = "userKnowsNavigationDrawer";         @Default(ofBoolean = false)         boolean userKnowsNavigationDrawer();         boolean userKnowsNavigationDrawer(boolean userKnowsNavigationDrawer);                  public static final String language = "language";         @Default(ofString = "0")         String language();         boolean language(String language);     }  Should work, shouldn't it?
The cluster has since been destroyed and the change is not on master.  Let me create a cluster with that change and I'll message you on Slack when it's up.
@noahdietz  > Does your suggestion in the PR fix things?  Yes, see the following where we've added that in `synth.py`: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/blob/8c8e3606ecd214aafae4644d0ce6d4b293f32fa8/logging/synth.py#L41-L47    > Sorry about this.  No worries
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/annotation/ConditionEvaluator.java#L103-L113  I was debugging the code and it never got to evaluate if the condition matched (at a method level), because the `phase` was `REGISTER_BEAN` and the `requiredPhase` was `PARSE_CONFIGURATION`.  Returning `null` or `ConfigurationPhase.REGISTER_BEAN` on the `getConfigurationPhase` seams to make it work just fine.

Updated testcase to replicate reported scenario properly on branch `jetty-9.4.x-issue-2936-badmessage-error-handling`. It fails as reported now.
I don't think so. On android I can share my photo as before.
Just to clarify. Is this really fixed? How was it fixed? Did you remove API 17 compatibility or implement reflection? Sorry, but it's not clear from the PR info.  
Yes
Yes. It works with Traveller's Backpacks, and armors from Tiny Progressions, Tech Reborn, Base Metals, Industrialcraft2, Actually Additions, Redstone Arsenal, Galacticraft, Cyclic, Immersive Engineering, Mystical Agriculture, Thermal Foundation, and Ender IO, and most armors from Mekanism: Tools, with the exception of the glowstone armor set from Mekanism: Tools.   The mods I play with that have armors that don't work with MPM besides Construct's Armory are Botania, Draconic Evolution, and Thaumcraft (Save for Thaumium and Void sets).   If it means anything, I tested mostly just the helmets from each of the listed mods (Exception being Traveller's Backpacks, since that's not properly armor but it's close enough). I tested a couple matching chestplates, and effectiveness did seem consistent between helmets and chestplates, so I'm making the assumption that that is enough.
Here is 20 minutes' worth of data from two different stations, both of which have quiet-enough periods that I can reproduce the issue by zooming in.  [AM.RCB43.00.SHZ.D.2020.024.mseed.zip](https://github.com/usgs/swarm/files/4110217/AM.RCB43.00.SHZ.D.2020.024.mseed.zip) [AM.R24FA.00.EHZ.D.2020.021.mseed.zip](https://github.com/usgs/swarm/files/4110178/AM.R24FA.00.EHZ.D.2020.021.mseed.zip)  
I've died several times.  Also, restarting the game has no effect.
Until now I used osmdroid 4.1, which also had some of these problems, but could be solved with a workaround. I didn't switch to a newer osmdroid version due to these problems since the old workaround does not work anymore.  I was able to fix all the mentioned problems but zoom via pinch near borders. If I`m able to fix this as well, I will create a PR. Ps.: I also found that, despite my previous message, `mTargetZoomLevel` is correctly set. 
sorry for the delay response  my maven dependencies :  ```         <dependency>             <groupId>com.github.gwtmaterialdesign</groupId>             <artifactId>gwt-material</artifactId>             <version>2.0-rc3</version>         </dependency>         <dependency>             <groupId>com.github.gwtmaterialdesign</groupId>             <artifactId>gwt-material-addins</artifactId>             <version>2.0-rc3</version>         </dependency> ```  in my gwt module xml :  `<inherits name="gwt.material.design.GwtMaterialWithJQuery" />`  thats all.
hi Mario, with DEV 30/07 same happens. Just had recently taken photos and videos uploaded via cellular data.
Elasticsearch Highlighting problem (0.90.1)  I am working on  upgradion of elasticsearch from 0.20.2 to 0.90.1 and come across the following issue.

@tobiasKaminsky what should i check? cause another installation on same server works well.. 
@juliushaertl  yes, doc is enabled (otherwise it wouldn't load in the Browser)
I'll do another test with an analyzer.  My simple data is 4 500 000 documents {message: 'Харьков - 1'}, {message: 'Харьков - 2'} ... My query select expand(rid) from index:test.message key 'Харько~0.3' limit 2.  Maybe the "limit 2" is not working as I thought? And all data in processing?

I want to wrap the call to the `operation::` in a common include as we'd like to put some markup around the snippets.  ``` :operation-name: my-operation inlucde::operation.adoc[] ```  >operation.adoc ``` // My custom preamble for {operation-name} operation::{operation-name}[] // Wrapping up ```  Not sure there's a nicer way of doing that but hoped that it would work.

I checked it with a list that I had w/ 3 caches in it.  It still does the same thing.    Here are the GC codes.  There's about 15-20km separating them and it launches the map at 5300km scale bar. GC33K80 GC1TTJB GC2RD1  Regarding the quantity of usable caches in a list, in the past I've been able to open a map of a list of up to 4500 caches w/o issue.  I tried 5440 after that and it crashed, so I stepped back to 2K caches as it gets me about 10mile radius.  I have 8 PQ's running weekly that get all the caches w/i a 65mi radius of Houston, TX.  I dump this into GSAK and can generate GPX files based on my needs.  I wish my Garmin Oregon had this much capacity.  I love using c:geo for getting me to the general area, and reading logs, cache notes, sat views etc.  But for accuracy in the woods, the phone just doesn't cut it.

umm well it kinda fixed it the first round.. ish. the player came back with no inventory, and then waits.  when the game ends the players ingame inventory get set properly but the one that left + came back was then put into creative mode. when the next game starts all players keep their inventory as well as get gm 1 for the game. when the game ends, all players lose their inventory. hope this helps,

That's something product/UX should decide: @bbinto, @lime124, @brampitoyo   What we do in the WebView version is: In OnReceiveError (WebViewClient) we determine what error happened and then load our own page via loadDataWithBaseURL() [+ we set a flag to avoid calling some of the callbacks when loading an error page].

@salaboy See the change in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/pull/58. It does not increase resource quotas. The problem is that without persistent volume, all Rabbitmq data is stored in the temporary volume, When Rabbitmq is restarted or rescheduled the data gets deleted, so all queued messages get lost..
It looks like the error would be somewhere else after my associate has jumped into the topic.  Please see #8845 
Yes, please. I haven't been able to reproduce this with my local config (current Towny, Vault, Gringotts). Can you give me the versions and configuration for those plugins? 
Hello, when i first implemented an exception handler for the 0.13.0 release of java-object-diff i was fighting with lot of exceptions raised when comparing Hibernate Envers revision entities: i needed the proxied objects to get lazy associated entities to compare, so i couldn't detach them from session but, at the same time, the diffing tree invariably reached proxy attributes that raised errors when called to be compared. The exception messages were not usefull to clearly identify failing attributes because the complete node paths was missing in the exception message, so i wrote a listener (originally a single interface for both circular and read/write errors) to log offending node paths. In the meantime i reached a quite stable solution using attributes exclusion both with builder exclusions configuration and annotating entities with @ObjectDiffProperty, even if i don't like very much the annotations which pollute my persistent model with diff engine implementation details. I think the DiffNode is indeed an essential information to pass to the exception listerners. 
When I open the world, It may have something to do with other mods, but I'm not sure what it could be, as  those were the mods that seems to change textures when they were added or removed, I can give a full mod list if needed.

There are two issues: 1) When a project admin (who are not system administrators) is redirected to the system Administration page when they aren't authorized to be at that page, it is a potential security issue. 2) If the plugin only supports system administration configuration and repository level configuration, why is there a link at the project level? 
Yes, I have! But it is not connected. mongoDB plugin creates a bean called mongo and that holds a connection to a mongo, which i overriden to be a connection to Fongo. The problem I faced (I know better now) Is gorm does not connect via this bean. There is another bean called `mongoDataStore`. I needed to override that too. My new problem now is Fongo does not have the alternative of this on!   As far as my research went, the solution is to also override the `mongoDataStore` bean! I am working to create a plugin for grails that uses fongo as a data storage for really fast Integration tests. [Fongo-for-Integration-tests](https://github.com/amexsofts/fongo-for-integration-test) .  Basically, What I want to achieve is override every call to the mogo process to be to fongo. From what I see now, you have support for Unit tests only! 
I was using OpenLiberty 18.0.0.3, and profile `javaee-8.0`. Changing to OpenLiberty 18.0.0.4, it's working the way I wanted, thanks @aguibert.
@Ennosigaeon we have to release a new version of the platform ASAP. So we decided to move the current development into the [`tmp-develop`](https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/tree/) branch, fix the most important bugs and release the next version.   Moving on in this branch shouldn't make it more complicated for you to delete the faulty commits in develop, right?
Usability wise: The event field is customizable meaning it can keyword or numeric. Even if we restrict it to being a keyword: `event where condition` is queryDSL is essentially: `event_field == "event" and ...` event is a value, we just happen to escape it automatically. So whether it's only letter or numbers should not matter since both are valid values.  ``` `42` where true``` is problematic since it means `42` is a field not a value. Which is not the case.  Implementation wise: I think reusing identifiers is problematic and having a dedicated token for eventType (essentially an unescaped string) would work better.
It's happened since 1.0.24 -> 1.0.33 ( pre 82cc9a4605 ) and still occurs after 82cc9a4605. This has happened in every case.

Is the localized language wrong? When I uninstall this plugin, I get back to normal
I'm now using the latest version. And after extensive testing it seems to be working as intended.

Very well what has been done suits me perfectly. Just a small detail :  https://sandbox.fr/images/uploads/original/1509398193.png  He adds one more line as soon as there are 8 or 9 slots in the first line that are occupied.
Hi @lolodomo can I help you ? I use Openhab 1.8.0 but your jar file will work fine with this version. 
Hi! I think it might have been a problem on my end... I ended up deleting and recreating the .pgd. Works great so far, but I'll reopen if I run into problems again!
I just exported the settings, enabled NAT traversal, confirmed "restart now" and exported again.  The second export has no `<device>` entry inside the `<folder>`s, other than the Pixel itself.  I re-imported the first export and the folders were (of cause) shared again. I then enabled NAT, chose "later" and restarted with the notification. This time, the folders were still shared.

I'd completely forgotten about it... only noticed as I'm updating my example projects that use the plugins for a talk and forgot to include the other dependencies and thought to myself how is it even baking a site without them being declared. 
I can confirm that. Fixed.
Something like that. There are multiple metals left in the smeltery, because there is that stoppage in the ingot cast. I'm not sure about the metal in the cast itself, if some of that was lost or simply rerouted into the pipes or the smeltery etc.  The details are getting a little fuzzy after a while. Dealing with this multiple times is so annoying that I just switch to a redstone clock as soon as I can. 
Can i stop it programatically?  Actualy the video has not started because i have set property  player.setAutoPlay(false);
Which `a` are you referring to? I'm confused.  if you have imported module A, the common keyword `int y = 0` has been defined on X. so in a module that imported A, anything of type X should return a value for the `y` field.  if A is not imported, then I agree, makes no sense so still support the access of field `y`. 
Yes the heads work to make it! thats the not the issue! The issue is the **DROPS**. The default mechanic of minecraft, drops wither heads with a 2.5-5.5% chance without MobHunting.  Please read what I linked. https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wither_Skeleton#Drops  So what's happening, is there is the default mechanics can drop a head and ALSO MobHunting can drop a head.
@raphw Windows 10. (Version 10.0.16299.19)  About JRE, it should work fine on JRE I think, in JRE 8 you could run byte buddy agent with manually provided tools.jar and added attach.dll to command line or via reflections directly to class loader - ofc you need to choose valid lib/tools for each system etc, but it works fine. So something like this should be possible in JRE 9 too. By somehow loading `jdk.attach.jmod` (I think this is the only one missing from jre?) and that `attach` library, but not sure how to do that yet. (like I said, it works perfectly fine in JRE 8, you just need to add that libraries to your .jar or download them on startup)
A couple places in the mapping stuff. Don't worry not a result of merge or anything 
Left more info in your discord about this, but Shadows said:  "its a crash on rft's end from a failure to properly handle the wildcard meta to convert from an oredict entry back to a "real" thing you have to get a state from the item when the item has the meta wildcard (32767) and the state doesn't handle it properly, stuff like that happens specifically he's accessing an array without clamping a value"  I don't know what any of that means but maybe you'll find it useful.
``` <meta-data             android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"             android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version"/> <meta-data             android:name="VERSION"             android:value="5"/> <meta-data             android:name="QUERY_LOG"             android:value="true"/> ```  It doesn't crash the app. but exception logs are printed. 
@mrniko  Thanks for your reply. I am not sure if this is only reproducible when the cache is full.  I tried to run the lua script manually and I found that probably this line is causing error. local msg = struct.pack('Lc0Lc0', string.len(lruItem), lruItem, string.len(lruItemValue), lruItemValue); Looks like lruItemValue is returning boolean and this section is under the condition that  if cacheSize >= maxSize. Please help take a look. Thanks!  Maybe this is the reason, Redis nil does convert to false in Lua scripts. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42123757/redis-lua-script-redis-callget-nonexisting-return-value I think this could be due to I manually cleared my cache but didn't clear redisson__map_cache__last_access__set, so they are out of sync?     
Im usind Ender Energy Conduits to connect the reactors to the capacitor banks and then thers a tesseract direct to the bank 
OK I'll try that.
Is that it is just a suggestion not required at all for compiling. At least for the intelliJ plugin, that could be used for other IDEs including the --display.  The meta is to enable completions without adding explicitly an "using" clause. Without the metadata, it would be slow and displaying zillions of static public methods that probably are not meant to be used as extensions. With the metadata, it should be faster limiting the classes you are searching and would avoid suggesting lots of garbage. 
No, every time I've opened the app since, my wishlist was still blank. I tried adding a few random cards and repeatedly opening and closing the app, but I can't seem to replicate the deletion or the sudden app crash. The crash happened during an update of the database, it that helps any.
@zolotov I have it installed.
I think reported issue is my wrong usage, so Enunciate should do one of: 1. Throw exception in such a case and shut down WITH MESSAGE telling exactly what is wrong. 2. Provide general support for generated sourceSets so dev do not experiment to find working combo.  ```gradle plugins {     id("com.webcohesion.enunciate") version "2.12.0" }  tasks.withType(com.webcohesion.enunciate.gradle.EnunciateTask).configureEach {     it.sourcepath("$projectDir/src/main/java:$projectDir/src/generated/java") } ```  As you might guess I needed to include generated sources for mappers dto, query beans, as they reside in a different folder. I think there should be support for it natively. Thank you for a wonderful tool!
For sure <expected as much, replicating an ME with a few millions of items ain't a 5 minutes work>, i'll have to upload it to my google drive though coz' it's pretty big for github, you'll find my compact machine base at x:-64 y:228 z:201 overworld. Entering that CM will drop you right into my ME Interface room. (access to the entire AE2 network). I should mention that there's no Quantum links or anything alike. I have 1 backbone network running my p2p's. No subnets. So, what's visible on the terminals is pretty much all the stuff that exists. There's one auxiliar network i used just for the purpose of creating singularities <ae2> since import/export buses are somewhat faster than other item transport methods, that network is standalone.  Possibly some memory leak. That or the gadget is trying to do something funny with all the items in that ME. Since i haven't had a look at the code for that binding and what's it doing can't really say anything more.  PS: The ME being in a different dimension is not the cause of the issue, tested that already :) Also sorry for the late response.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=10ZpwRPWHa_jLJ4Lr4N__NAsM42vOnLiQ
Confirmed Firefox 70.0.1.  After further investigation, I've observed that prior to upgrading Linux WebDriver to v13, a process called _geckodriver_ opens on a random high-order port when you use the Launch Browser button, and ZAP makes the connection to it, then the browser starts.  However after upgrading Linux WebDriver to 13, geckodriver does not start and does not start a random listening TCP port.  Then ZAP times out trying to connect to the non-existent port and the logs show a connection timeout.  ZAP log below showing timeout:  ``` 50322 [ZAP-BrowserLauncher] ERROR org.zaproxy.zap.extension.quickstart.launch.ExtensionQuickStartLaunch  - org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connect to

thank you for your interest. It's appearing but pressing anything and it disappears, so far I only managed to press the "report issue" button. I will try to make a screenshot if it's possible.
My maven project is not related to Spring at all, https://github.com/makiam/SAFF  Once I installed Your plugin I see that some Application*.properties files displayed with Spring boot icon. When I clicked it to open I see this exception.

Yes, at least for Godot 2.1, it was "build successful"  I couldn't even export template for godot 2.1.4 even without the module, idk why, but it's a different problem  I haven't tried to use it in a project yet, i need some more time to understand how it works first.  Is it somehow possible to get it to work with 3.0.2?
 No, that's it.
It did load with that in the folder.
Thx for the quick reply!  I'm using Telekom's MagentaCloud software to sync my encrypted data to the cloud. MagentaCloud is essentially a WebDAV client/server system.  Oviously the ``.DAV`` folders containing the ``.dir`` and ``.pag`` files are created by the MagentaCloud software. A little reasearch on the web suggests that these files contain information related to WebDAV. I'm not sure wether these files can be deleted safely. IMHO you're quite right: The upgrade routine should ignore all files and directories not associated to the vault.
@martinbonnin Thanks you for your reply. I used apollo-android v 1.2.1 and it worked.
It will not block immediately, but after a period of normal operation, it will stop at the start method and will not continue to run. Even if other threads enter that method, they will be stuck in the start method and will not continue to run.
Added next lines:  ```typescript  componentDidMount() {    if (__DEV__) {     console.log('App.componentDidMount');   }    this.addEvents();    this.initializeBackgroundGeolocation();  }  addEvents() {     BackgroundGeolocation.on('stationary', () => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Stationary'));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('activity', (activity) => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Activity', JSON.stringify(activity)));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('start', () => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Start'));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('stop', () => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Stop'));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('background', () => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Background'));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('foreground', () => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Foreground'));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('authorization', (status) => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Authorization', JSON.stringify(status)));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('error', (error) => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Error', JSON.stringify(error)));     BackgroundGeolocation.on('location', () => console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Location')); }  initializeBackgroundGeolocation() {    if (__DEV__ || true) {     console.log('App.initializeBackgroundGeolocation Call');   }    const options = { . . . };    try {     BackgroundGeolocation.configure(options);   } catch (e) {      Sentry.captureException(e);      if (__DEV__ || true) {       console.error('BackgroundGeolocation Configuration Error');       console.error(e);     }   }    BackgroundGeolocation.checkStatus(status => {      if (__DEV__ || true) {       console.log('BackgroundGeolocation Status', JSON.stringify(status));     }      // . . . . .   });  } ``` Will send the logs, when it crash. Is this enough?  Uhh. Last time it crashed in android emulator after reload (RR). On my phone (Galaxy S8), as I remember, crashed when started from launcher. But will test it in different situations.
> What are the steps to reproduce this?  No steps I'm afraid, I grabbed this from the play store crash reports.
It's fixed! Sorry, I just back home :)
I've not written any dialogue code, I've just used the built in tutorial island plugin together with the dialogue plugin to test tutorial island. The npc head of the runescape guide wasn't moving in the  dialogue.

When I open the world, It may have something to do with other mods, but I'm not sure what it could be, as  those were the mods that seems to change textures when they were added or removed, I can give a full mod list if needed.
I did not realise that would be a problem but that could be it thank you. 
Hi, neither worked, but I follow them and found that when the F.class static initializer runs, when it gets to  ComputerThreads.NO_THREADS = Config.JAS_NO_THREADS;  this causes an exception and aborts the try, including the runnable that would do the F.COUNT_DOWN_LATCH.countDown(); - so you are right, it is not called when F.class is initialized.  Note that the app does not freeze at this point; there's only a logcat output from the catch. The app will only freezes when evaluate() is called with an operation later on.  The logcat shows:  07-14 03:02:29.792 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError 07-14 03:02:29.793 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.matheclipse.core.expression.F.<clinit>(F.java:3312)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine.<init>(EvalEngine.java:192)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine.<init>(EvalEngine.java:308)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine$1.initialValue(EvalEngine.java:72) 07-14 03:02:29.794 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine$1.initialValue(EvalEngine.java:64)         at java.lang.ThreadLocal.setInitialValue(ThreadLocal.java:180)         at java.lang.ThreadLocal.get(ThreadLocal.java:170)         at org.matheclipse.core.eval.EvalEngine.get(EvalEngine.java:82)         at br.eng.it.jsvcalc.StackItem.<clinit>(StackItem.java:24) 07-14 03:02:29.795 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at br.eng.it.jsvcalc.StackItem.setPrefs(StackItem.java:219)         at br.eng.it.jsvcalc.MainActivity.onCreate(MainActivity.java:124)         at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:6984)         at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1235) 07-14 03:02:29.796 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2783)         at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:2909)         at android.app.ActivityThread.-wrap11(Unknown Source:0)         at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1606)         at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:105)         at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:164) 07-14 03:02:29.797 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6592)         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)         at com.android.internal.os.Zygote$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(Zygote.java:240)         at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:769) 07-14 03:02:29.799 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err: Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to get length of null array         at org.apache.logging.log4j.util.ReflectionUtil$PrivateSecurityManager.getCallerClass(ReflectionUtil.java:308)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.util.ReflectionUtil.getCallerClass(ReflectionUtil.java:218) 07-14 03:02:29.800 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.apache.logging.log4j.util.ReflectionUtil.getCallerClass(ReflectionUtil.java:197)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ClassLoaderContextSelector.getContext(ClassLoaderContextSelector.java:72)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.selector.ClassLoaderContextSelector.getContext(ClassLoaderContextSelector.java:57)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.Log4jContextFactory.getContext(Log4jContextFactory.java:140)         at org.apache.logging.log4j.core.impl.Log4jContextFactory.getContext(Log4jContextFactory.java:41) 07-14 03:02:29.801 17630-17630/br.eng.it.jsvcalc W/System.err:     at org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getContext(LogManager.java:267)         at org.apache.log4j.Logger$PrivateManager.getContext(Logger.java:59)         at org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger(Logger.java:41)         at edu.jas.kern.ComputerThreads.<clinit>(ComputerThreads.java:30)   With the older version that works, this exception does not occur.  
Ahh yeah, in the web GUI it says "Global Discovery Servers" are "OK" which I assume means that the announce server is fine?  Also I do have local discovery as enabled for both (along with global discovery and UPnP) but the nodes still can't seem to see each other. I have them both configured with each other's device ID and the folder ID is the same for the one folder I'd like to sync (which is shared among them). In my firewall on the phone I can see traffic from my other device on the LAN incoming but no outgoing from the phone, and also no incoming on my other device running windows on the LAN. 
It won't double it since TMaster only runs on 1 node, so it would add 1:1 with the number of topologies we run, which is insignificant.  We use a watch on statemanger for the packing plan for a couple of reasons: - The executors need the packing plan and doing RPC with them isn't practical due to their lifecycle. Following the same patter for the TMaster is consistent. - The initial deployment should be able to proceed without a requirement that the deploying user (where the scheduler-as-a-library might run) maintains a connection to the topology for the entire startup phase. So the client puts some state in statemanager and if that succeeds it launches the aurora containers and it's done. From then on the topology can initialize itself. We don't want the production topology to have a dep on the users client, which scheduler<->tmaster RPC would require.

Good question.  We could trigger a download of all assets known by the campaign file but not already cached but that might actually take longer than the GM wants to deal with at that time.  A warning when logging in as a remote GM that only used/viewed assets will be transferred? 
Yes, I believe you are correct.  The schema (in the picture above) does not show all the properties because it is schemaless as the properties were created by the ETL process.  One fix could be to check existing schema (or data) and use the case of the imported data and not the case of the supplied "indexes" field.  Another fix could be to force schemaless properties to use the case of any indexes if indexes are already defined with the same name.  Finally, what would happen if you had a schema for your class and imported (via etl) some other data that had the same name but a different case than the property name -- I don't know that I exercised this but I would assume that it works by finding the correct property to shove the data into.  Either way, it's not a huge issue but it's still a bug that could cause someone to lose time (and hair).  ;) 
I haven't looked through the enunciate code, but I would think the parameter type (InputStream) would be the most relevant thing to look at.  Can you read the method signatures or just the annotations?

Yes, using a spawn egg on the spawner resulted in the same thing.  The spawner spawns one creature then reverts to the original spawn setting.

Basically i am getting this for my Spring related tests. I have defined one step def as below- @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:spring/api/application-context.xml") public class SpringSystemTestSteps {     @Before     public void SetupCucumberSpringContext() {         //dummy method so cucumber will recognize this class as glue         //and use its context configuration     }  }  The other step definitions doesn't have the - @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:spring/api/application-context.xml") defined anymore. Its just the tests. I am getting this error.  I also have other stepdefinitions where Before and After hooks defined for all step defs. This error is even present there.  Please let me know, if i need to do something different now.  
I've installed and tried them now, and they seem to be working fine. I had to set the locale to other languages for the test (I tried French and Galician), since I did not translate them in Sardinian yet, but dandelion and Cherry had the same problem with those languages as well (with all languages, actually). So right now it looks like this:  Stringlate, Markor and Memetastic: OK  Cherry and dandelion: ERROR

It shows the GUI but like, the modules themselves don’t work in the new block, like the quarry doesn’t pump fluids, the replacer module doesn’t replace blocks, and the XP module doesn’t work

Unfortunately I haven't had time to look into again. Hopefully I have this week.
Correct, if it is less than 8 chars then account validation function gets confused. As long as it is equal to 8 chars it is fine. It does not even needs to be POSIX compliant.  Though having it as POSIX compliant would help in case of integrating it with an LDAP server or federated authentication in future... 
just copy-paste the following code to the ide  ``` c #ifdef __AVR_ATtinyX5__ const byte LED_PIN = 3;   // gamba 2 const byte RECV_PIN = 1;  // gamba 6 #else const byte LED_PIN = 3; const byte RECV_PIN = 10; #endif  void setup(){ }  void loop(){ } ```  compile for any board and you'll get (also tryed with uint8_t):  ``` sketch_jun13a:4: error: 'byte' does not name a type sketch_jun13a:5: error: 'byte' does not name a type ``` 
In a simple answer: because it's not consistent with the rest of the library. I can't think of any other `Glide...load(???)` that will crash the whole app. Just because an image is not available it shouldn't crash, that's why we have `.error()` and `onException`. I think the strongest argument is that `null` doesn't crash it, which is a worse value for a resource ID than 0.  This is actually not a theoretical issue. I ran into it yesterday. I have the images for categories as `res/raw/*.svg`. The items in my DB can have a category associated to them by a column which refers to the above mentioned svg files by name. The name is then resolved by calling:  ``` @RawRes int imageiD = context.getResources().getIdentifier(imageColumnValue, "raw", context.getPackageName()); ```  which is then handed to `Glide...fromResource()...decoder(svgDecoder)...load(imageID)`. The resolution with `getIdentifier` also helps to avoid maintaining an ugly in-code map like:  ``` put("image1", R.raw.image1) put("image2", R.raw.image2) ... (50 times) ```  Now, the everyday usage is covered because if the `imageID` is a valid `R.raw.*`, it works; but there may be some cases when the resolution may not work and then if you check the [`getIdentifier` javadoc](file:///P:/tools/android-sdk-windows/docs/reference/android/content/res/Resources.html#getIdentifier%28java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String%29) it says:  > **Returns** `int` The associated resource identifier. Returns 0 if no such resource was found. (0 is not a valid resource ID.)  The current hack is that I check for 0 and replace it with `null`, because I know that works as I want it (displays `.error()`). Adding little workarounds like this starting to lead to cyclomatic hell around the image loading as, I, for example also have to check for `null` images because it is not handled as should be: #268.

@a93h Thanks for the response! Sorry it's taken me a while to reply, but it's hard to really get answers for you. It's not often I actually play music on my phone, so it's hard to know what's changed between instances. However I can say that one time I played a full album which was successfully scrobbled, and then a minute or two later I played a song by a different artist and it didn't scrobble. Definitely no reboots or anything in-between.
Is that it is just a suggestion not required at all for compiling. At least for the intelliJ plugin, that could be used for other IDEs including the --display.  The meta is to enable completions without adding explicitly an "using" clause. Without the metadata, it would be slow and displaying zillions of static public methods that probably are not meant to be used as extensions. With the metadata, it should be faster limiting the classes you are searching and would avoid suggesting lots of garbage.

Thanks for that.  I just tried to use that latest jar, did a complete clean setup of the proxy I built to query verdict and it still failed unfortunately.  I'm running the following query just to try and get it to work: ``` SELECT * FROM uptime WHERE regexp_like('1a 2b 14m', '\\d+b') ```  `uptime` is a simple table, with a single `string` column and a single row.  I've tried a few other variations as well but it's not working unfortunately.  Are there perhaps other tests I can try? 
Sorry, I don't have a simple example I can share. I have hit this bug when using Py4J to call Pyhon on Apache Spark workers from Scala. I was not able to reproduce it under a simpler scenario.   However, when I added the locking around `connections.addLast(cc)` call, I stopped seeing this bug.

> Which permission plugin are you using?  Aquatic Perms 1.0  It's a permissions plugin that allows the user to give permissions to any player. I only use this server as a private server to play with my friends. Previously I had no permissions plugin but I added this one since I started having this problem.   Commands: /perm add <User|*> <Node> -- Add a permission to a user or everyone (*) /perm remove <User|*> <Node> -- Remove a permission from a user or everyone (*) /perm test <User|*> <Node> -- Test if someone has a permission /perm list <User|*> -- List someone's permissions  I don't know what the "permission nodes" for MarrigaeMaster are. 
The pattern doesn't capture the `#`, but there's also the `ivoa://` instead of `ivo://`: no idea where that comes from.
i'm sorry about that. it's hard to catch this issue as it is not happen oftenly. will update you once i have this issue again.  
Still the same like described in https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/intellij-haxe/pull/610

cgeo version 2014.09.18 Date format: I tried different formats. I'm from the Netherlands so everything on my phone is dutch format. But I also tried other date formats on my phone and tried "use english format" in c:geo. Nothing helps. See attached image, not very clear sorry, but I hope you can read it. The logs give the name of the writer, the log type, the number of found caches by the writer, and the log itself. But no date... ![20141101_122901](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9497175/4871524/90fefd0a-61bc-11e4-82e2-5f2980082558.jpg)

With the dev build(328) the game doesn't crash when I use Scheme 1 anymore. And the Scheme 2 works but I had to replace the id 0 interface for three exporters for each machine set to the corresponding channels. Also the interface which was used for item inputs(Scheme 2. middle column) to the network one(storage system) from other networks(in this case network 2) has to be set to the same channel as the interface attached to the drawer controller, I supposed this was a fix for https://github.com/CyclopsMC/IntegratedTunnels/issues/163 . As for providing the environment where the crash happened - I was playing Enigmatica 2 Expert 1.64d modpack. I don't understand, do you need a backup of my game world?  Edit: I did more testing with the dev build and in the Scheme 2. only interface with ID 1 seem to accpet items from its corresponting item importer, others only work if interfaces and importers are set to ID 0 or 1.  Edit2: There's also this unusual output in the log, I don't know what could this be related to  > [16:18:10] [Server thread/WARN] [Cyclops Core]: Slotless source to destination movement failed due to inconsistent insertion behaviour by destination in simulation and non-simulation: org.cyclops.integrateddynamics.core.network.IngredientChannelIndexed@32742577.

It started a long time ago but just now finally narrowed it down to what the issue was.  I had avoided the issue by looping things differently in past.  But I would say I first ran into the issue at least a year ago but it may be older than that

My first assumption is that it can not access the gitlab repository in https://git.project-hobbit.eu:4567. But i still do not know why.  [Exception while bechmarking locally.txt](https://github.com/hobbit-project/platform/files/1918744/Exception.while.bechmarking.locally.txt)  
     what field type did you have on the data in ES?  Most are keyword, but the source field is {"type":"text","analyzer":"analyzer_keyword","fielddata":true}      does that happen always on all fields or only on that single one?  I'm seeing it with every field I try. I first saw it with my top hosts widget, which is using source. If i do a 5 minute search and try doing quickvalues on various fields, all that I try will have random duplicate entries and the majority won't be sorted correctly.      is this reproducible at any time?  So far it is. 
No, you don't understood the problem, this event works fine when I open all the inventories but not for the inventories of players. :/ The "open inventory" is broken for the inventory of player.
@clintongormley Not yet, but I'll try to ascertain whether this is still happening by doing a ton of cluster restarts with and without the plugin. I'll reopen if I find this is still an issue. Thanks :) 
Still the same thing happens, I even tried changing Anisotropic filtering .  Also I always have it set to "off". 
The problem is that pumps don't recognize it as a valid fluid and won't pump the oil geysers. I tried Buildcraft and Immersive Engineering's pumps.
I tested it that way. Because that link is shared on other apps too and it works well. only email on ios is having problems. the link is a dynamic link. so it has several params to open needed page later when app starts

Hmm, I missed the `@JsonProperty` annotations last time I checked the generated code. I think I expected them on the method parameter, rather than the method itself. Or maybe I was just tired.  So... it seems to me that indeed, just adding `@JsonIgnore` is enough! I've filed a PR, in which we can discuss the implementation details: #466. With this PR, all of the above tests pass. 
@MarfGamer I doubt it would be due to my code because sometimes the user is disconnected even before the first packet is sent.

(most of the times it gets disconnected until the last PlayStatusPacket is sent, but almost every time it gets disconnected even before the server receives any packet from the client!)  As you can see in the log I shown above, the client is disconnected after the "System.out.println("Client from address " + session.getAddress() + " sent packet with ID 0x" 						+ Integer.toHexString(packet.getId()).toUpperCase() + " on channel " + channel);" code but before the "System.out.println("Pocket Packet ID: 0x" + Integer.toHexString(packetId).toUpperCase());", that's why it is strange, nothing happens between those two things except logging (and getting the PE packet ID)  But what's even more stranger is that the code sometimes works, and sometimes it doesn't.

> How exactry did you launch Baritone (which doesn't support forge after 1.12.2) on minecraft forge 1.14.4 ? It seems to be the reason it crashed to be exact. You need to be running Fabric for baritone to work on 1.14.4.  I used this, https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/issues/797. I used to use this on Windows, but as soon as I used it on Ubuntu 19.10. It no longer works and crashes like above. I can confirm that it still works on Windows 10 as I dual boot. Also can you now run Baritone on Fabric?

I don't yet.  I just got a bunch of parts to start breadboarding.  I'm not sure I'll be able to wire something up before I get busy for a week.  I'll let you know when I get a chance.

@salaboy See the change in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/pull/58. It does not increase resource quotas. The problem is that without persistent volume, all Rabbitmq data is stored in the temporary volume, When Rabbitmq is restarted or rescheduled the data gets deleted, so all queued messages get lost..
I found this to be true on both the master and develop branches. I pulled them both just now and see the same behavior on both.
``` $ git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar $ cat .gitignore ... # Avoid ignoring Gradle wrapper jar file (.jar files are usually ignored) !gradle-wrapper.jar ...  ``` 
Yeah, it has been fixed a while ago.
player keeps jumping when you press forward, no idea what's causing that, might be mod incompatibility with something. It only keeps jumping if you move forward, not backgwards.
does not help. if i have a file with lombok annotations open the exception occurs as soon as the indexing is finished.

I ran `bazel coverage --test_output=streamed path/to:testTarget`  I'm not sure how to describe the project.  It has several maven jar dependencies. It uses [rules_protobuf](https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf) to implement a gRPC server.   The test is mocking a few things and testing certain http calls would have happened. 
I can't do that because the toolbar is in the main layout and the recyclerView is used from a fragment. I use a padding for the recyclerView because I am hiding/showing it on scroll.

hi @akaroml, I can't provide you my project, I've tried to create a sample project but can't reproduce the issue. I found in Language Suport for Java output this warning when relaunching the program:  [Warn  - 10:58:50 AM] Feb 12, 2020 10:58:50 AM Failed to destory launch files, will retry again.
Now I can no longer reproduce the problem.  This morning I tried to insert the profile picture and it works.  Now I try to reproduce the problem.  What I know is that last night I didn't open the screen to crop the image.  🤔
@deathbeam It happened while I was using Konduit as well, but I don't know the proper upstream to report to. This issue only started about a month ago.
Uh ! I think you're right @lucaswerkmeister  :/ It seems I can also reproduce exactly  ceylon/ceylon-compiler#1712  with NPE, and I should not be able to do that... Well I don't understand, I've used `ant clean publish-all ide` in ceylon-dist... 
Also, this is very very terrible: http://prntscr.com/7zlxoh 
Hi @erikandre  I uploaded a zip file containing three of the test images.  [images.zip](http://6d0dbc33a6c02.cdn.sohucs.com/foobar/images.zip) Please download and unzip the file, then put the images into SD card, and call setImageURI(Uri.fromFile(file)).  Those images are test cases of my project, to test corner situations. I can reproduce the issue with those images in Fresco 1.7.1.  Hope this post may help, thx!

Is a screenshot necessary? I simply can't pour Invar or Lumium onto an arrow shaft placed on a casting table. I click the faucet and the metals just don't want to pour. I'm an experienced Tinker, I've checked that I'm not making a rookie error like forgetting to put the metal to the bottom of the smeltery.  I can, however, pour invar and lumium into normal tool parts. My regular tools were invar for a time and my crossbow is currently lumium. I decided to make my bolts from manyullyn instead, but it still should be fixed.
It looked it worked well with 1218.

I'll rephrase the second comment: fixing the BaseKeyOperation constructor by assigning "k" to "this.binaryKey" won't be enough to make binary keys work in Dyno. [TokenAwareSelection](https://github.com/Netflix/dyno/blob/master/dyno-core/src/main/java/com/netflix/dyno/connectionpool/impl/lb/TokenAwareSelection.java) only uses BaseKeyOperation.getKey() and ignores the getBinaryKey() method. 
@CodeCrafter47 Nope, and vault variables are broken as well on latest version.
Unfortunately I do not know. I suspect the problem occurred from an import.  I won't be able reproduce but the one was obviously generated abnormally since I was not both in 1970...

It depends. If you add a Jabber contact (non-Kontalk) from a desktop client, it shows "unknown" because it can't map it with any contact in Android. If you receive an invitation (or a message) from an unknown phone number, it will show you unknown because of the missing number in Android contacts. 
It totally was an error on my part, I shouldn't have set it up like I did.  Thanks again for the Forge config tip. 
It always included the line break.  The only difference is that the separator is guessed correctly saving the user having to specify it manually.

@joschi VMware is just an example, I'll fetch some more. My suggesstion is more general. if you read RFC5424 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6) you will find this  ```       HEADER          = PRI VERSION SP TIMESTAMP SP HOSTNAME                         SP APP-NAME SP PROCID SP MSGID       PRI             = "<" PRIVAL ">"       PRIVAL          = 1*3DIGIT ; range 0 .. 191       VERSION         = NONZERO-DIGIT 0*2DIGIT ```  which means a RFC5424-Syslog message **must** start with the Priority followed by the version and a space character.  VERSION must be a number with one to three digits and must not start with zero. adjusting the static pattern to detect RFC5425 conform messages would automaticly stop applying wrong filters to vmware messages.  Examples:   ``` <166>2016-01-29T16:37:46.644Z srv01esx27.corp.local Hostd: --> } <166>2016-01-29T16:33:30.567Z srv01esx24.corp.local Hostd: --> "992" <166>2016-01-29T15:49:19.934Z srv01esx29.corp.local Vpxa: [6269EB70 verbose 'VpxaHalCnxHostagent' opID=WFU-bea1521f] [WaitForUpdatesDone] Received callback <166>2016-01-29T15:49:19.934Z srv01esx29.corp.local Vpxa: [6269EB70 verbose 'VpxaHalCnxHostagent' opID=WFU-bea1521f] [WaitForUpdatesDone] Received callback <166>2016-01-29T15:49:19.926Z srv01esx29.corp.local Vpxa: [6269EB70 verbose 'VpxaHalCnxHostagent' opID=WFU-c04d02e0] [VpxaHalCnxHostagent::ProcessUpdate] Applying updates from 7313825 to 7313826 (at 7313825) ```  Best Regards, Jörg 
I suspect below is the cause, that is because of providing a comment of 345 characters length in migration script.

@TonyLo1 These issues are related. I am not quite sure about the technical details - I would prefer to write and experiment with the interpreter. Just to see if this is a better solution to the issue which I am seeing here. It's just a suggestion.

Sure, I can file provide a fix with unit tests for this issue on 2.2.x branch and file a pull request.
@Siedlerchr It is fixed. Yay! Thanks a lot.
Yes, we'll fix this after FOSDEM in the next release, whatever version that is. Sorry about the breakage, we didn't have test coverage for from-source bootstrapping on Windows.
@jansupol Thanks for pointing us to the corresponding TCK test. I created the original Jersey issue before the TCK was transferred. I'll see if I find any difference.
@wvpaf ok, thank you. We will try soon.  @fredgc yes, of course we can play different content on our Nexus Player. The same stream (but not encrypted) is playing good.

I think it happens because you use the link text over the actual URL in the link to retrieve the card information. Same thing also happens with "Return (card)", and I'm sure a few others.

I haven't got a self contained example but have a look at the constructor of StompClientConnectionImpl.  ``` java public StompClientConnectionImpl(Vertx vertx, NetSocket socket, StompClient client,                                    Handler<AsyncResult<StompClientConnection>> resultHandler) {     this.socket = socket;     this.client = client;     this.resultHandler = resultHandler;     this.context = vertx.getOrCreateContext();      FrameParser parser = new FrameParser();     parser.handler(this);     socket.handler(buffer -> {       lastServerActivity = System.nanoTime();       parser.handle(buffer);     })         .closeHandler(v -> close());    } ```  and ...  ``` java            log.error("Disconnecting client " + client + " - no server activity detected in the last " + deltaInMs + " ms.");           client.vertx().cancelTimer(ponger);           disconnect();  ```  If the ponger times out, it will call disconnect(), which calls the closeHandler, which closes off the socket, calling the closeHandler again.

@sohelsarder having to share credentials in a center sounds like it goes against passwords best practices and also makes it hard to do data audit. @maimoonak @sohelsarder Differentiating what data the user should access looks like it's more of a sync and user modules feature in that during sync the server side logic should be able to determine which data is provider centric and which is patient centric. With this distinction there seems to be a couple of options we can explore on the client side that will enable users share the same device. 
This is just a logic thing in the sampler, not an SDK issue

Hi,  sample streams below, with HD streams this issue is more noticeable, in our case the delay is not a big issue, is almost the same as with Mediaplayer, and it think is related to GOP in multicast video streams, but we need to find a solution how to make the next video start immediately and do the caching while keeping the last videos frame.   > Stream #0:0[0x3f3]: Video: h264 (Main) ([27][0][0][0] / 0x001B), yuv420p(tv, bt709), 1920x1080 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 25 fps, 50 tbr, 90k tbn, 50 tbc >     Stream #0:1[0x3f4](eng): Audio: mp2 ([4][0][0][0] / 0x0004), 48000 Hz, stereo, s16p, 128 kb/s >     Stream #0:2[0x3f7](alb): Subtitle: dvb_subtitle ([6][0][0][0] / 0x0006) >     Stream #0:3[0x3f8](eng): Subtitle: dvb_subtitle ([6][0][0][0] / 0x0006)   or:  > Stream #0:0[0x3fd]: Video: h264 (Main) ([27][0][0][0] / 0x001B), yuv420p(tv, bt470bg), 704x576 [SAR 16:11 DAR 16:9], 25 fps, 50 tbr, 90k tbn, 50 tbc >     Stream #0:1[0x3ff](alb): Audio: mp2 ([3][0][0][0] / 0x0003), 48000 Hz, stereo, s16p, 128 kb/s >     Stream #0:2[0x3fe](sqi): Audio: mp2 ([3][0][0][0] / 0x0003), 48000 Hz, mono, s16p, 128 kb/s  thnx
After I sent this I realized I didn't give you much detail to go on.  I'm currently using ActiveMQ 5.11.0 and I've tried hawtio 1.4.47, as well as 46 and 45... the problem varies a bit between releases but I didn't remember having this problem until recently.  Could definitely be AMQ.  I can send more detail if needed.  It happens in the latest karaf and only really seems to affect the camel component.

Made a full test here:  Insanely slow: ``` command /test0: 	trigger: 		remove all items from player's inventory  [15:02:38 INFO]: [Skript] # /test0 [15:02:38 INFO]: [Skript] # test0 took 12.803814 milliseconds ```  Reasonable, but slower than manual clearing ``` command /test1: 	trigger:	 		clear player's inventory  [15:03:24 INFO]: [Skript] # /test1 [15:03:24 INFO]: [Skript] # test1 took 1.709404 milliseconds ```  I think it's slow for just 4 items ``` command /test3: 	trigger: 		set {_a::*} to diamond sword, iron sword, iron axe and stone shovel 		loop {_a::*}: 			give loop-value to player  [15:03:54 INFO]: [Skript] # /test3 [15:03:54 INFO]: [Skript] # test3 took 1.852104 milliseconds ```  Most performance-friendly inventory clearing: ``` command /test4: 	trigger: 		loop all items in player's inventory: 			clear loop-item  [15:04:27 INFO]: [Skript] # /test4 [15:04:27 INFO]: [Skript] # test4 took 0.475441 milliseconds ```  0.6 ms for one item. ``` command /test5: 	trigger: 		set {_i} to diamond sword of sharpness 5, knockback 2 named "TEST" with lore "HEY" 		give {_i} to player  [15:10:58 INFO]: [Skript] # /test5 [15:10:58 INFO]: [Skript] # test5 took 0.645621 milliseconds ```  Not bad, but could be better I think. ``` command /test6: 	trigger: 		if player can hold 64 stone: 			broadcast "CAN HOLD STONE"  [15:11:38 INFO]: [Skript] # /test6 [15:11:38 INFO]: CAN HOLD STONE [15:11:38 INFO]: [Skript] # test6 took 0.533713 milliseconds ```  Faster than looping, so fine ``` [15:12:22 INFO]: [Skript] # /test7 [15:12:22 INFO]: HAS DIAMOND SWORD [15:12:22 INFO]: [Skript] # test7 took 0.455576 milliseconds ```  ``` command /test8: 	trigger: 		broadcast "%number of diamond sword in player's inventory%"  [15:14:56 INFO]: [Skript] # /test8 [15:14:56 INFO]: 5 [15:14:56 INFO]: [Skript] # test8 took 0.404589 milliseconds ```  ``` command /test9: 	trigger: 		remove 64 diamond from player's inventory  [15:17:53 INFO]: [Skript] # /test9 [15:17:53 INFO]: [Skript] # test9 took 0.372805 milliseconds ```  I am comparing only player's tool, I don't think it should take 0.5 ms. ``` command /test10: 	trigger: 		tool = diamond sword 		broadcast "IS DIAMOND SWORD"  [15:20:04 INFO]: [Skript] # /test10 [15:20:04 INFO]: IS DIAMOND SWORD [15:20:04 INFO]: [Skript] # test10 took 0.439022 milliseconds ```  **Another thing:** If I give this sword to player `give diamond sword of sharpness 5, knockback 2 named "TEST" with lore "HEY" to player`, then use `player has diamond sword of sharpness 5, knockback 2 named "TEST"` it won't work, because the lore doesn't match.  The same works for NBT, if I add ANYTHING different in NBT, it won't match the item, even though it matches the conditions.  Using only name and enchantments, it'll match normally.  `inventory of %player% is empty` doesn't work too.  That's it basically.

Ah ok. The problem I was having was when logstash wasn't setup correctly. Given that you set `enable_failover: true`. When an executor failed for some reason, it wasn't restarted. Eventually there would be no executors at all and the scheduler wouldn't start any. What's worse is that when I restarted the scheduler, it still didn't restart any executors, like it had some bad state.  The way I got it to work was to set `enable_failover: false`, correct my mistakes in configuration, and then everything has been working ever since. 
Always the latest. In case of EnderIO both the official release and dev version of 1.6.4 
promregator.discovery.hostname is not set in my instance. I will try and test it soon.  When the prometheus server scrapes the /discovery endpoint (CURL job) the json is returned with the prometheus servers hostname in the targets array. when I test it with my laptop the returned json has my laptops hostname in the targets array.
1) I tested render issue only with: - NEI (+ core + addons) - CoFHCore + CoFHLib - EnderIO (+ core) - AgriCraft - FastCraft  I confirm that issue: AgriCraft Farming Station doesn't render in world and cause FPS lags when it's rendering in inventory. And I noticed, that model of this machine contains strange green [rotating?] object inside. May be that part of render cause lags. But (as I said) I don't see machine in world; I also noticed, that black frame of blocks near AgriCraft Farming Station become white...  2) I know, why I haven't recipe for Farming Base Module: I enabled hard recipes in Ender IO and disabled resource crops in AgriCraft. Please, use for crafting items, that are always registered (regardless of configuration of mod). 
I am connecting to the Caché database using its JDBC driver. Everything works great: SELECT, DML, calling procedures, ER diagrams. The only thing that doesn't work is stored procedure return values, either as the return value of the procedure itself, or as OUT or INOUT parameters. So the snippet above is the only snippet that there is. I'm trying to execute this: ? = FCE_Operations.ATM_GetAmountOutAndFee(100,0.5,?,?)  FCE_Operations is not a table; it's a container for stored procedures only.

Nope. This must be the lack of API testing. 
Local testing, since it is under 'unstable', so there is no immediate need to fix it yet. 
https://cryptomator.org/downloads/#winDownload  The SHA256 listed on the website for Cryptomator-1.3.0-x64 is indeed: `6970c7b40f3e87b415a80bfe2c9b906effba3518c2d9672724cf5c9c5bc0de18`  But the SHA256 I'm (was) getting is different.  Tried downloading it using a different browser than Opera, and the hash matches. Somehow downloading it on Opera with the built-in VPN enabled screws up the download. Oddly enough though, the first time I downloaded it, I was using Chrome. It also didn't match back then. But I'm getting the correct one now.  I'm still curious as to why the signature has also disappeared from the binary that was already installed.

Well problem is that it crashes the R session in RStudio before I can ask for a traceback() - so it just gives me a window "R Session Aborted"... But the problem should be easy enough for you to reproduce...
I recreated your steps and the megatorch worked as intended. The issue seems to come from Forge. When I use Forge 14.23.3.2659 like in my sp world, hostile mobs spawn despite the megatorch.
A quick chat with @wilkinsona indicates that the problem is likely to be around the dependency on a `-SNAPSHOT`.  Our guess is that Aether is trying to resolve a newer version of the dependency using the _entire_ repository chain.  Since trying to run a `grab`, offline, against `-SNAPSHOT`s, that have been populated into `~/.m2`, but nowhere else is probably an edge case, I'm going to close out the issue.  At some point you guys are going to have to deal with the on-prem case (access to internal repositories, but not external), but there's no need for that to be today. 
Thanks @GideonLeGrange, I will try soon..

Thanks for looking into this! Yes I'm using mm=100%, but the word healthy is in documents. When I was testing, synonyms would only be expanded if they were the first term in the search phrase. 
@javanna Makes sense to me.
@allanneves @wilkinsona Thanks for these two observations  Yes.. Looks like the issue has something to do with Intellij. I went to intellij settings & delegated build actions to gradle & the application works as expected. If I uncheck this box & run the app with intellij, then issue is consistently reproducible

I am *so* sorry I haven't had a chance to check this out. I don't think I can do it on the boxes where I'm using it "in anger", but I will try and at least spin up a nano or something with a similar config and give it a quick whirl.
Yes, will raise a pr when I find the time 
Still no fix, c'mon it cant be that hard! 
Thanks for the response!  The instabug-reactnative is the only dependency in the project. It should be reproducible by creating a new project, installing instabug, linking it, and then running on Android.  I’ve reproduced it in two separate apps (example app linked to above).

Unfortunately I do not, apologies.
Attached is sample test that i executed: It works fine when running. Test case is PASS. Gives internal error when started in DEBUG mode.  [test.txt](https://github.com/nokia/RED/files/539207/test.txt) 
grbl v1.1e, stopping mid job works perfectly with smaller files. This is the g-code: [holes.txt](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender/files/1034217/holes.txt) I don't remember exactly, but i think it was generated by jscut and then panelized/tiled using bCNC.

Yes, you are right. Some days ago I installed original 2.0.0 Google mi fit (automatically updated). And now Hart rate sensor don't work. As you can see,  every app says,  that I have hr version 0.0.0.0.  I tried to downgrade, install the same software. I have only one error message "problem with transfer  Metadata"   I think problem with sending software (or getting it by mi1s).   Hope you understand my mind)  About logs - I've already attached it)   I found that this bag is very old, and some people put MI band in refrigerator for some hours. I've tried it, but it's doesn't work :(

Hi! I use  Release 5.9. But this exception i saw in the latest version. 
Maybe because of this https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/DBE-4050
In the Inventory itself it does work yes, but in the world when placed, no.  Also, machines too.  https://gyazo.com/fb1e8de418abd5f6c276e383bed5966a
I am separating stdout from stderr already. The issue is that the message is included in both streams.  Regarding stdout vs. stderr and expectations, if the programmatic contract with the CLI is expressed via both stdout and stderr, then both should provide structured responses. If the contract is always communicated via stdout, only it should provide a structured response and stderr can be free-form.  I integrate other CLIs with the IDE, notably the Salesforce DX CLI, and when you run it with a `--json` argument, the exit code determines which stream you should consume, both of which are written in JSON format.  If PMD is only intended to write a structured XML response to stdout when run with the `-f xml` argument, I agree that it doesn't matter how stderr is formatted. The contract just needs to be communicated/documented enough for integrators. 
We're on openfire so this is obviously similar to #521... 
Hi Bartosz, problem resolved when i added lines "                 if(list.isBoolean()) {                     return Boolean.valueOf(jsonElement.getAsBoolean());                 } " thank you for the quick response. 
> Does this bug occur in all games?  with a quick test it seems it only happens with touchscreen games. Currently playing GT Racing 2 The Real Car Experience and Spider-Man Ultimate Power and both have the same problem. but Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party doesn't suffer the same problem, but it's a non-touchscreen game

This happens if I just type the name of the class and then a period. Once it starts, autocomplete starts breaking for everything in the script. I'm just seeing the error in the workspace log so I'm not sure how to get a stack frame.
Logs here: [debug-logs.zip](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/files/409548/debug-logs.zip)  All of the logs are against the squid proxy with authentication enabled (required).  The URL used as an HTTPS target was `https://www.reddit.com` and the non-HTTPS target was `http://www.wired.com`.  When I was debugging, I also saw something similar as was reported in #408 where @smatei says:  > It seems that in HttpRequest.BuildURI, an URI is created from "www.google.com:443", that has no protocol.  Of interest in _debug_log1.log_ is this line (resulting of the BuildURI issue):  ``` 2016-08-10 02:20:38.950:DBUG:oejc.AuthenticationProtocolHandler:client-10: No authentication available for HttpRequest[CONNECT www.reddit.com:443 HTTP/1.1]@39f5ea27 ```  In _debug_log2.log_, when the lines:  ``` java proxy.getIncludedAddresses().add(..) ```  are **removed**, the authenticator _is_ found, but still blows up later, after authentication.

In English Thanks for the corrections and have added some things.  The release date for films is not actually used, but when I used the scraper in Kodi added the Director Tag and then edited all nfo's to use as serial (TV Show), because at least for me is more beautiful and more organized. The dates also help to give the right order in the episode, since we do not have a website to organize videos using to episode has a certain number (example: s01e35 or s2015e35).  Thank you again.  ---  Em Português:  Obrigado pelas correções e por ter adicionado algumas coisas.  A Data de lançamento para filmes não é usado realmente, mas quando eu usava o scraper no Kodi adicionava na Tag Diretor e depois editava todas as nfo´s para utilizar como seriados (TV Show), pois pelo menos para mim fica mais bonito e mais organizado. As datas também ajudam para dar a ordem certa no episodio, já que não temos um site que organizar os vídeos usando para episodio tem numero certo (exemplo: s01e35 ou s2015e35).  Obrigado novamente.

Forge version: 14.23.5.2815 Electroblob's Wizardry 4.1.4 I forgot to mention that I saw them in JEI and not in normal gameplay, so here's my JEI version 1.12.2-4.15.0.268  
That would fix the test case, since it is predictably running touchDown during the LifecycleListener's pause event, but I don't think it would prevent the issue from happening in practice if a Timer could still possibly be created during the "danger period". What about suluke's suggestion from #1548? Setting Timer.thread to null during the pause event seems like it would work.

Yep that's correct, i was gonna use the charcoal pit mod to process all unfired clay items. It has an in-world kiln, you place down your items in a hole, cover it with thatch and logs and set it on fire.   Wouldn't be the end of the world if the porcelain brick can also be smelted in a surface, just not ideal. 
Thankyou for your response  No the app doesnot crash, yet I am facing a problem where the rtsp link works on my home network but always fails when multiple clients are connected in the same network i.e the live stream shows up on the player when in home (my device connected alone) and the stream doesnot show in the university.  The link works perfectly on VLC media player irrespective of the network it is in.

Hi @Galigator, the version we use is 2.6.0. Well, the rule does work with the Pellet reasoner in Protege, so, I assume that the rule itself is correct. I'll attach the turtle-file as .txt. [bigtu-wapa-model+instances.txt](https://github.com/Galigator/openllet/files/1352558/bigtu-wapa-model.instances.txt)  Hopefully, you can use it to find out what the problem is.  Thanks again, Jack

I tried the latest build Network drives seem to operate faster but  Selecting a new file still takes like 2-3 seconds and the more you select the slower it will get until it freezes for a couple of seconds (little annoying but much better than before) Scraping of 4 videos takes 1-2 minutes.(which seem okay) Writing files of 4 videos takes about 1-2 minutes. (ok as well)  In explorer the network drive is explored in an instant and files open instantly as well. The cursor does not change when the program freezes while selecting files.  The network drive uses the SAMBA protocol on a ARM router (Asus RT-N66U) running modified Asus firmware "Asuswrt-Merlin" with the Linux kernel 2.6.22.19. Accessing is quick and without any freezes on OSX, Debian, Win7, Win8 and Android 
Attempting to use the laser to increase the stats of fluid does work. However, it destroys a significant portion of the fluid each time a catalyst is used. This is a serious issue because it makes making decent crystals basically impossible unless I want to spend hours trying to do it. REAL world hours! The catalyst was nether stars to note. 
I was using 2.3.2, and it still happens with 3.0.0. My graphics card is an Nvidia NVS 3100M in a Dell Latitude E6410 https://www.techpowerup.com/gpudb/1468/nvs-3100m up-to-date Driver Version 21.21.13.4201 (ForceWare 342.01) Beta / Win10 64 Driver date 2016-11-14 The problem may be that, while directx 12 is installed, the card supports directx 10.1. By the way, because blinky quake works on this computer, it is not impossible for this to be made to work as well.

Yes. There's one sentinel cluster managing many redis masters. Each master has a slave.  Masters (and their slaves) belong to different projects, have different passwords, different configuration and should have nothing in common.

I think we probably want to make the load balancing strategies pluggable. I’m generally not into pluggable things (why not just include a good implementation in the box!) but in this case I think being pluggable gives us options we can’t build otherwise.  One strategy I really like is from what gRPC calls an external load balancer. https://grpc.io/grpc/core/md_doc_load-balancing.html https://grpc.io/blog/loadbalancing  
I can not use that yet, I'm using maven 0.5.2
I'm using 0.4.3—I actually avoided upgrading because the cpp input pruning code change looked unstable—but from code inspection it looks like the issue has been present since the dawn of Bazel through today. (You have to get into a very special state to see this issue.) This issue looks like a problem with `PersistentMap` and doesn't involve anything fancy like input-discovering actions as #2490 does.
@krzyk yes, let's make one decision and be consistent. Either enforcing or prohibiting this newline works for me

It basically stopped placing blocks.  Say for the building gadget, the ghost preview of the placement of a column would render but when right clicking nothing would occur.  No blocks would be removed from inventory, nothing would render into the world, and no blocks would be placed.  I've got some free time today to try to isolate and repeat the issue.

That looks like the expected behavior, but it's different from what I'm seeing on my device. Here's a quick GIF:  ![20191010_060110](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8658164/66556361-f8bf4200-eb47-11e9-912c-5a46f2862da0.gif)  As you can see, the editor switches to light theme (and remains in the light theme when I reopen it) but the note list keeps the dark theme.  However, this is a fairly edge case scenario — in other tests where I added content to the new note or performed other actions the whole app switched themes as expected — so this could be a very low priority or wontfix issue unless others are running into it. 
- No message, just the generic insuficient permission message. And as I said, no error in console... :( - I do have economy enabled. Sorry... what else can I say? It's very strange.
I added sdk to Settings app. It's a system app in kitkat. We can't compile Settings app use Eclipse or other IDE. We must use: . build/envsetup.sh lunch [your device] make Settings But Android Kitkat use ProGuard, version 4.4. So, compile will failed. https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/proguard/+/android-4.4.4_r2/src/proguard/ProGuard.java 
The idea sounds good. But what if the bore head is indicator for the size of the hole?  So there are 5x5 and 3x3 bore heads. But the actual problem that you can't go at the side of the tunnel bore with a 3x3 head would be the same. Also that you can't see what's ahead. So I think we need an redesign of the model. A little more curves at the head (I know it's not vanilla design style) 
Woops, `player_leave` and `player_join`

Yeah i got a regular output... i don't think it is an actual bug. It's just how it is intended to work. Requirements for merging are too strict... you should probably just check owners, at least one owner in common between the two areas. If you want you could make this configurable...  merge:   matching_all_owners_required: false   at_least_one_owner_required: true   matching_members_required:  false   matching_flags_required:  false   ...
It was missing failures= and errors= fields due to a bash typo, which was fixed by 8dc0810.

@sleshchenko my installation of Openshift does use https, at the minute it is using certificates signed by Openshift while I wait for certificates signed by our private CA, nonetheless once I get certificates signed they will still not be signed by a public authority.
this worked previously under 0.6.2 for me.  I just succeeded with a workaround in getting the reference data - I dumped the schema normally using the dropwizard CLI.  I then downloaded liquibase 3.0.1 and ran :   ``` java -jar liquibase.jar --changeLogFile="./data/dataChangeSet.xml" --diffTypes="data" generateChangeLog ```  which got my reference data changelog.   I then manually changed the xsd in the liquibase generated changeset from 3.1 back to 3.0 so that I can use it under dropwizard. 
Thank you for giving me a chance to explain this more clearly, I'm genuinely bad at communicating with people.  What I was really trying to say is: I strongly believe Flyway should never ever touch the session state, _nor should migrations_, nor should other application code. Session state should be considered all set up and read-only once the application obtains some JDBC Connection instance from a DataSource.   I actually don't want Flyway to compensate for any problems caused by altered session state, `current_schema` just being a subset of that state.  If I'm not mistaken, Flyway setting `current_schema` was introduced for #1108. I disagree with its author about the part where Flyway should be responsible for reversing a session state change it didn't make.  If some migration really needs to temporarily alter session state because there's no equivalent to Postgres' `set local`, it should do so in a try...finally block.  Those documentation "ideas" otoh are probably just me trying to make the other option (=Flyway taking responsibility for session state) look bad. Sorry about that.

We were on `1.11.106`.

Great to hear that! I had no chance to try master yet. Is the master branch based on 6.x? I'm really looking forward to try 6.x too.
Yes for sure.   I also noticed that the file is placed in `.stagging/www/js/plugins/AppAvailability.js` while other plugins are placed as `.stagging/www/plugins/com.plugin.name/www/Name.js`  
Started new server, I only had luckperms, essentialsx, vault and authme installed, issue still occurs when I leave the server in front of a skeleton and then re-join skeleton still tries to attack me
Yes, the .symlist have `$`-signs in them, too.  Here, for example, is CRSXC_CD.symlist:  ``` $ {"D-check-sort$1",&descriptor_M_D__check__sort_s1}, {"D-check-sort$2",&descriptor_M_D__check__sort_s2},$ {"D-check-sort$3",&descriptor_M_D__check__sort_s3},$ {"D-check-sort$4",&descriptor_M_D__check__sort_s4},$ ```  Not everywhere, as you see, but almost.  P.S. This is all on a debian 'jessie' system with - sed (GNU sed) 4.2.2 - GNU Awk 4.1.1, API: 1.1 (GNU MPFR 3.1.2-p3, GNU MP 6.0.0) - /bin/sh → /bin/dash 
Maybe we can just use --dicomweb_address and update our readme to use the new param. The old param can just exist in the flags file for now, and we can handle it on the server side for now, but all new users will specify the --dicomweb_address.
I'm not currently in a position to build the client in the timeframe you're interested in.

Rather sporadic, yes. Only happened once.  https://gist.github.com/Sunconure11/75237792a443823ec8032870d056087f
No, and it doesn't just happen to me, it's the whole server...
they updated to the whole log   thats   from the window that the launcher give u 
Tested BM and PM and its working both for me. Asked user for some more details (e.g. try the same on the geocaching website). 
@davidfestal this went from 100% reproducible (over multiple days/weeks!) to 100% non-reproducible :(  With an error like:  > The Ceylon Java backend compilation failed"  it's really hard to know what the precipitating factors are.  I guess we should just fix https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon/issues/6730#issuecomment-261806500 (correct the `target=7` config in ceylon-sdk) and see if people complain?

LinagesOS 15 (Android 8) but I also have the same problem on my tablet that is running on Android 5. For me it doesn't look like a problem that is related to the Android version. I think you can reproduce the problem on any Android version by just rotating your device while you are in the station list of radio channels.
it shows the normal response.  if replace initRedisCluster(); =>   initRedisSingle();   the log didn't show exception  :( but it also didn't return the result.  
Apologies, I have recreated the issue with more info in the correct place. 
Sir i have a question also about how can i convert audio file to text in android i can find any sample in the sdk only microphone sir need help
it leaves the inserters inventory and doesn't reappear if I take stuff out of the chest, I can make a quick video if you want.

Sorry for the late reply, I right click my small slime  Click the slime ball size button thing Chose 4 (large size) press the book and It puts a pair of shoes on my cursor 
The config has no effect. Yea it just appears the same before you configure
Here's the issue on google's issue tracker, it contains a sample project in the third post (should be visible after clicking on the link):  https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/111594366#comment3
Uploaded the file I used: http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=84548486154945986593.  Also it looks like it gives a Tundra half the time and Tundra Wolves the other half. 
No swords involved on my side, neither on crafting any block nor equipped. Will post crash log to woot, too. 
@farodin91 Please check https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/pull/1829
Thanks @GideonLeGrange, I will try soon.. 
If you mean the option "Autosave local libraries" in Options - File, then no, this was not checked.  However, I just noticed that there is a setting that may have made this a bit less frustrating: under "Library properties" there is the option "Refuse to save the library before external changes have been reviewed" which appears to have been set by default. Unsetting this will at least let me simply save the library even when JabRef incorrectly thinks for some reason it has been modified on the disk.
@tonihei, thanks for the response! Yes of course, here are the test media(**mp4** is loaded in the device storage):  http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerBlazes.mp4 https://video-dev.github.io/streams/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8  In fact, it does not matter what files, you can take any **mp4** and **m3u8**.  **Logcat output**  ``` 08-21 00:33:00.373

I test this with nightly version, it works correctly. After that, i will try to find out a stable version.
Hi Joe, exactly… Thanks for the hint!
Here's one: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/feeds/all.rss.xml
I attached an example [example.json.txt](https://github.com/jsurfer/JsonSurfer/files/3287031/example.json.txt) 
I see they are fine, i.e. before and after the issue 'fwmconfig.xml' contains paths corresponding to user 'A' and 'B' in their respective paths.

actually you could have spotted a different issue. i.e. that of having nbest in the log of server  I meant the problem that the parameter "v" in the config file is not handled at all.  I create a new issue for the "wrong" output of the nbest. This issue keeps related to verbose parameter.  Nicola 
we have ten servers with:     Intel E5(4 Cores, 2.4GHz)     24 GB RAM     2 TB HDD  must I set up a coprocessor in hbase? does the geoserver parameter coprocessorJar need to be set?
We did find this on an older version (1.1.1.RELEASE), but even when I pulled the latest snapshot it seemed to still be happening.
Botania r1.6-190.jar 
I had it installed through F-Droid.  Uninstalled and installed the Google Play version and the issue is still occurs.  I sent the crash report.  I'm using it on a LG G4 running CM13.  I was using Firefox but installed Chrome and removed Open by Default but it still crashes when hitting Open in Browser, I don't even get to select a browser to open in.   
> hi @rotorboy , > unfortunately, cannot understand your issue. could you add screenshots that will make your issue more clear? > thanks in advance  Photos likely won't help but I will provide more detail to better explain the issue;  Query-produced Integer fields displayed in data editors, by default, appear as "grouped": e.g "1000" is displayed as "1,000". There is a checkbox option in preferences->data editor->data formats preference panel titled "Use Grouping" that toggles between displaying the comma or not.  If a data editor is already displaying an integer, and the checkbox state is changed, even if the change is "applied", the CURRENT data editor integer display will NOT be changed to respect the new "use grouping" setting. This means that if the editor is displaying "1,000", and the checkbox is cleared in the preference, the editor will CONTINUE to display "1,000". To effect the change, the editor must be closed and reopened, and then the effect will take place, and the integer will now be displayed as "1000".  I hope that provides enough detail...
>> Would you like to try adding that in a PR?  I  would love to, but I am swamped - I barely had enough time to diagnose this problem. Furthermore, I am not sure how the new method that handles it should behave:  * Should it store the data ? * If so - where ? how ? when will it be read ? (I did not check if S3Browser asks for it...)
@slemeur  , @eivantsov  Thank you pulling from the codenvy/che-server:nightly helped me to view the stack on dashboard. Stack Editor is very easy to edit as well.  Now I face some issues setting up the workspace agent. Where can I find the complete logs as in the editor am not able to get the complete log.   Please guide me  Regards Santhosh 
Try this demo https://github.com/AlexByte/gs-crud-with-vaadin
Fixed in v2.2-HF4. Test: - Set autoRefreshScore to something low (i.e. 1 or 2) - Enable timings `/timings on` (Spigot only) - Play with more than 1 online in skyworld for several minutes, and notice whether any lag occurs. - Execute `/timings paste` - Analyze output from uSkyBlock - values in the red (30-40ms) is acceptable, as long as the Pct. is low, values above 100ms will (potentially) introduce server-lag. 
@konradrenner exactly. 
yes! ;-) 
Photo of the different versions are taken from the following position. ![position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1726020/32622174-b9ffa620-c58a-11e7-84ff-be5f550b2f3d.jpg)  ![mtk_suomi_2c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1726020/32622173-b9ce3180-c58a-11e7-9cc9-88d02fcb3858.jpg) Photo of screen from version 2c?, unfortunately I can't remember exactly which version it was.  ![mtk_suomi_32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1726020/32622175-ba28cb36-c58a-11e7-84b0-25f37b219a73.jpg) Photo from version 3.2.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1726020/32622643-366f7216-c58c-11e7-9e25-0efaf02c7cde.png) Symbols seem to be missing from the BaseCamp version as well.   
I can share my mod list, but it definitely was running worse, because changing the tick rate to 3600 fixed it. It's really late here, so the best I can do right now is link to the modpack. I'll update with an modlist tomorrow.  Here is the version where it happens: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/smartcraft/files/2598177
Sorry, I tried to use the 1.7.10 dual wielding system, but it not work in 1.12.2 version because the mod use the minecraft native dual wielding system.
The server-side CTD on startup posted in the crash report for this issue as "ClassNotFoundException: colonies.anglewyrm.src.ServerProxy"  was fixed in Pre-alpha Revision 10c  There's a new issue  #89 for a server crash when placing items.  There's also a related commit that may resolve that issue.

I found a lead! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2972986/how-to-unmap-a-file-from-memory-mapped-using-filechannel-in-java Blacklisting all the alt contigs will results in a whole lot of file handles being opened then immediately closed (but not actually released until the next GC) hence the file handle exhaustion that doesn't happen on large input data sets even when using an order of magnitude more threads. I'll add some explicit defensive GCs into GRIDSS and see if that improves things.
Works in VSCode for me.   I was able to isolate this issue: - Made a fresh install of Eclipse 2019-06 - installed only WWD - created a `xx.yaml` file and pasted the following: ``` name: dsad description: An absolute bare-bones web app. # version: 1.0.0 #homepage: https://www.example.com #author: Jonas Hungershausen <jonas.hungershausen@vogella.com>  environment:   sdk: '>=2.4.0 <3.0.0'        #dependencies:   #  path: ^1.6.0       dev_dependencies:   build_runner: ^1.5.0   build_web_compilers: ^2.1.0   pedantic: ^1.7.0  ```  After looking around the codebase of WWD I noticed this: https://github.com/eclipse/wildwebdeveloper/blob/master/org.eclipse.wildwebdeveloper/src/org/eclipse/wildwebdeveloper/yaml/YAMLLanguageServer.java#L55 Might be related, as it seems like the `validate` field is always set to true. Instead WWD should check if the file opened has a schema registered.  Also the _Kubernetes_ schema is registered for all `.yaml` files? Shouldn't it only apply to kubernetes config files (though I'm not sure if they are identifiable?).
yes that makes beter sense please see output below  i use this program to sync photos to google photos and it usually requires several attempts for the connenction to start working properly. then, after cca 100 photos it stops anyways mand i need to restart it. i use lg g6  thanks for development, great idea and still works better than any other requiring root  ``` RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./gnirehtet run 2018-03-06 08:35:01.680 INFO Main: Starting relay server... 2018-03-06 08:35:01.681 INFO Relay: Relay server started 2018-03-06 08:35:01.681 INFO Main: Checking gnirehtet client... 2018-03-06 08:35:01.807 INFO Main: Starting client...

Hi, I was using JDK 8, more precisely jdk1.8.0_191
![screen shot 2015-06-09 at 10 52 53 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5350528/8062088/e6951902-0e9b-11e5-84a4-f708d5ff8610.png)  That's what I see. And in the code it looks like the fields in EnrichmentMapUtils are not being initialized. Should be easy to fix. 
This is now fixed.
The JFXPlugin config option was enabled by default. On disabling it the artifacting persisted. I'm not sure if that's what you were referring to when you say 'renderer' so correct me if I just disabled the wrong thing.

There is a "Save chart" button on the GUI panel, but there is nothing else there to save the rule density curve, the grammar, and the anomalies. I will push a code change right now that has some preliminary panels and fields whose functionality needs to be implemented. 
Yes, correct, we are using the HTTP endpoint.

Yup its fixed thanks!
Sorry for my late answer! I updated the gradle lib version but I am still experiencing the issue:  <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4804496/8084497/a3efc8cc-0f8b-11e5-999c-cbf6dc2be8c6.png" width="400"/>

I'm currently running version 1.5.2 (I've tried running 2.0, but am running into compile issues and can't get v2 to build) 
Hi @Himanshu507, did you try resolving this issue? Are you stuck somewhere? I can help.
No errors on Developer Tools console, the button simply does nothing, completely inactive. 
It was a server-specific issue (all servers running on CentOS), most servers were unaffected. 
I updated Golang to the latest 1.8.1 give it a try and build still fails. Might it be something related to this [issue](https://github.com/yudai/gotty/issues/18) for gotty? 
Thank you for your reply! My app is for Japanese so the crash is occurred by picking a Japanese named file. It is replicated when you pick a file named about 200 Japanese characters from Google Drive. Something like this.  ``` あいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえおあいうえお.pdf ```  I know it is not usual naming actually but it is possible so I think it is better to be fixed.  Thank you.
Didn't help. The reason seems to be that the error output shows a '?' instead of the unicode escape. When I replace the `assertTrue(t.getMessage().startsWith(...))` with `assertEquals(..., t.getMessage())` to see the differences, I get: ``` expected: <...ered at l.1, c.10: "[\u00e9" (']> but was: <...ered at l.1, c.10: "[?" ('?'), after : ""]> ``` Maybe, just remove the character from the `startsWith()` argument? Comparing messages meant for humans is anyway a bit fragile; they tend to change without warning.
Yes, it does.
Indeed, I was able to log in now. Thanks for the speed :-) (quite disappointing to spot an accent bug in a French app, though :-P) 
sure, but that will be next time i log in here. (tomorrow night) 
filename: LuckPerms-Sponge-3.0.71.jar it looks like the most recent version is .74, will update and and check to see if the problem persists.
@laa I reran the scenario and there is not much else in the logs.  I then increased the disk cache size ` OGlobalConfiguration.DISK_CACHE_SIZE.setValue(16384) ` and  the issue went away. But the problem is that our application cannot be shipped with such a high value for cache.   I am attaching the full relevant logs ..

Correct.
I still trying to fix freaking issue with Homebrew which explains why I am still awake.

No, it's not a blocker, but this is preventing us from seeing the real cause of the exception. My question is, why rethrowing a generic ZKException if the real error cause is available?
Hmm, unfortunately I do not know of any libraries that facilitate this, but I'm sure there are some. I'm currently in a location where internet access is very limited so I won't be much help in trying to identity a solution for this for a few days.

I set ```elapsedTime``` for saving the **currentTime** playing. Ahha, thank you for your suggesting. I have defined wrong way when playing again. Here is my code: ```javascript replay() {     console.log("Replay");     this.whoosh.play();     this.whoosh.getCurrentTime(time => {       MusicControl.updatePlayback({         state: MusicControl.STATE_PLAYING,         elapsedTime: time       });     });     this.setState({       play: true     });   } ```
Thanks for the quick response! Yes, this is a problem that anyone might encounter. I discovered it when I realized that the SD library wasn't finding several files on my card and narrowed it down to those with Latin characters. Here are a couple examples of long names and the Windows generated short names: 1. ¿Por Qué Te Vas_.mp3    06¿POR~1.MP3 2. Penélope.mp3    05PENÉ~1.MP3  Windows shouldn't generate short file names with spaces, but other systems may. I believe space is allowed anywhere except for the first char, but there is a separate line of code to handle that case.

It may be something wrong with one specific situation, as I can't reproduce it generally. But I can reproduce it with:  https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=35.010438%2C135.78141&point=34.973487%2C135.759628&point=34.963218%2C135.761876&point=34.962954%2C135.771103&point=34.927196%2C135.776575&point=34.908643%2C135.791734&point=34.901489%2C135.801251&point=34.900565%2C135.801669&point=34.897626%2C135.803815&point=34.895796%2C135.804588&point=34.891466%2C135.806261&point=34.890168%2C135.808026&point=34.880826%2C135.823996&point=34.869032%2C135.838223&point=34.844839%2C135.841956&point=34.807435%2C135.896738&point=34.800554%2C135.896759&point=34.796334%2C135.898798&point=34.796246%2C135.901115&point=34.797613%2C135.905278&point=34.797365%2C135.905868&point=34.794916%2C135.886867&point=34.781453%2C135.872211&point=34.765237%2C135.864851&point=34.747198%2C135.820541&point=34.851284%2C135.676133&locale=en-US&vehicle=racingbike&weighting=fastest&elevation=false&turn_costs=false&use_miles=false&layer=Omniscale  If you try to add an intermediate point halfway between `#24` and the end, I would expect it to become `#25` but it becomes `#23` .

Sorry,  OrientDB 2.1.7 
Thanks Ron for your prompt response.  In response to your questions: 1. English 2. Tried all of the suggestions. Results: a. they slowed down the system even more ( in some cases slightly) b. also tried a clean boot - but that did not help; also reduced screen resolution to 1440x 900- but the slowness persisted c. visual studio improved the speed (to normality) but is not preferred IDE :-)  3. https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/au/en/products/tablets/thinkpad-tablet-series/thinkpad-10/20c3 is the version that I am using.  Sorry for the slow response.
I found out that Restlet does not support odata v4, so that must be the problem.. 
If I delete the Cryptomator folder with the iCloud Drive IOS app on the iPad, and re-run Cryptomator, then I get the error "masterkey.cryptomator" could not be found. But yes ,the folder is re-created by the IOS app with just the readme file inside. Checking on the iPhone, the Cryptomator folder is gone (and then re-appears again).  So I agree iCloud seems to sync but not visible on iCloud.com or any MacOS devices. Seems like sync is working to me too but not to MacOS or iCloud.com. Very odd. Will keep pushing Apple, but so far they seem to have washed their hands of it. Disappointing. 
So we have Java 8 syntax support but the APIs are not (currently) ported back beyond API 24, which is Android 7.0 (Nougat).  https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features  I have altered the wdtinc code for the moment in our [vt-support library](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/vt-support/tree/feature/legacy-parser).  You can get a rough idea of what has changed in [my repo](https://github.com/snodnipper/mapbox-vector-tile-android/commit/1c4cea6a35537d6afb035c78afa7dea5bb9dcfa2).  I need to get a demo working for tomorrow (I have not got this fresh code running yet) so I'll feedback any issues.  Happy to help as necessary (e.g. PR Java 1.7 code, add CircleCI config if you'd like CI deployments in the project etc.)
@tanguyantoine I just downloaded the lib from npm the day before yesterday. It says version 0.3.4. Just did a npm update. It didn't change. And [here's the component](https://github.com/natashache/soundwise/blob/master/src/containers/Player.js) where the library is used.
This has fixed the issue @md678685  https://github.com/lucko/LuckPerms/commit/6baa472567a13c9ce2d7ef99e7d5722e99b1cdb5  If there is still something specific you would like shared from our startup log let me know (I cannot share the full log unfortunately.)
The file is: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.2.0/less/mixins/vendor-prefixes.less#L102  The line 102 is:  ``` &::-moz-placeholder           { color: @color;   // Firefox ``` 
I am not sure, sometimes my desktop Linux Spotify client is empty, I think it happens when I shutdown/reboot my computer without closing the Spotify client beforehand.  EDIT1: Another case is when I am disconnected from librespot-java client and I reconnect my Spotify desktop client, afterwards I also can't see any song selected in my playlist.
Unfortunately, the error trace/crash doesn't show where exactly this happens and I use your text field in a few places. It does not crash on compile, and I can't reproduce but quite a few users on Android 7 and Android 8 have it.

@ncorai yes, sorry, I fixed the description :)

I set "Fetch messages up to" to "any size (no limit)" a few weeks ago. It was no improvement over the 32kb setting I had before.  I was able to catch a duplicate entry at 6:17 am this morning. Attached is the log with all sensitive data removed and two screenshots. One shows K9, the other is taken from Thunderbird a few minutes later... ![Screenshot_20191014-064002_K-9 Mail_s2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4147858/66734551-d6893500-ee63-11e9-9e15-a4fe54e11aef.png) ![Thunderbird](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4147858/66734558-dbe67f80-ee63-11e9-9599-e6e49c9f7948.PNG) [k9-log1-private-data-removed.txt](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/files/3723342/k9-log1-private-data-removed.txt)
No, it doesn't work with manually installed texture pack.I redownloaded the pack serverside with /emojichat resourcepack but always the same result. I also have this problem when I use vanilla textures.
Here it is. I'm using many custom blade directives added to `Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> PHP -> Blade -> Directives`. Maybe it is related.  ``` <script type="text/html" id="user-request-form-tpl">     <div class="admin-form popup-basic popup-lg" id="user-requests-form-container">         <form class="form-horizontal" id="user-requests-form" enctype="multipart/form-data"               action="{{ route('m_user_request_create') }}" method="POST">             {!! csrf_field() !!}             <div class="panel">                 <div class="panel-heading pbn pt10 text-center">                     <span class="panel-title">@trans('management_area.user_requests.form.header_for_creation')</span>                 </div>                  <div class="panel-body">                     <input type="hidden" name="building_id" value="@jsEcho(it.building_id)">                     <div class="form-group">                         <label class="control-label col-sm-3" for="select-type">                             @trans('management_area.user_requests.form.input.type')                         </label>                         <div class="col-sm-9">                             <div class="field">                                 <select name="user_requests_type_id" class="form-control selectpicker" id="select-type">                                     @jsForEach(it.types as typeInfo)                                         <option                                             value="@jsEcho(typeInfo.id)"                                             data-sets-execute-at-automatically="@jsEcho(typeInfo.set_execution_date_automatically ?

I have now resetted the preferences and restarted JabRef afterwards. Then I created a new **biblatex** library with a new "misc" entry type. The "editor" field still does not show up.  I have then closed JabRef once again and removed the whole settings directory located in `~/.java/.userPrefs/org/jabref` and subsequently started JabRef. I created a new **biblatex** library with a new "misc" entry type. No "editor" field appeared.  For both aforementioned cases, JabRef shows the following:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987285-5ec79080-3dea-11ea-827c-8b29395372d4.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987309-6b4be900-3dea-11ea-9c30-02a133c2838b.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987372-8dde0200-3dea-11ea-9b84-13c5ed4f6b4f.png)  Then I created a new **bibtex** library with a new "book" entry type. No "editor" field could be found either (assuming there should be one, as stated in the bibtex documentation, attached below).  JabRef shows the following:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987174-21630300-3dea-11ea-9e05-5c34093b716b.png)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658393/72987466-bf56cd80-3dea-11ea-9ad6-b7c688e6d329.png)  **bibtex ([http://mirror.kumi.systems/ctan/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf](http://mirror.kumi.systems/ctan/biblio/bibtex/base/btxdoc.pdf)) states for entry type "book:**  "book": - A book with an explicit publisher. - Required fields: author or **editor**, title, publisher, year. - Optional fields: volume or number, series, address, edition, month, note
I cannot reproduce the bug anymore , so I'm closing the issue. Thank you. 
That was restored ok(can't find logic). Try to create  aa database and restore it from file. After that create bb  and try to restore it. Second restore will be to aa.
I am not developing this part of OSATE and does not have this bug - please open a report against osate-core for that. If you cannot reproduce the issue after, I will try to make a sanitized model for you. 
I'm using latest version 0.9.7  The files are located on cacheLocation dir.  postProcess() function on FileProcessorThread is called 3 times for each file and generateFileName() function is generating a new name for each one. I think you need to fix generateFileName() function 
This happens on second screen after capturing qr code in super gluu application

it happen when I am open full screen from the recyclerview item in separate activity. and when i am back to screen my recycler adapter is notified that time it give the exception.
Image: http://i.imgur.com/3hq0g8B.png  Generator has a lever on the front or sides, doesn't matter.  I shorted the multiblock down to just a generator and a generator controller and had the same results.  SSP Image: http://i.imgur.com/5tS3boh.png  After some time troubleshooting; this ends up being a crossmod interaction with.. Botania?  Removed it and sure enough, the noise persisting forever behavior goes away.  I'm not sure where to take the debugging process from here; its a little baffling. 
Inconsistent locking is pretty much always a bad practice (per JCIP).  Listener registrations can occur while a revision is being inserted.  
We tested it on @butonic’s tablet, where it occured every time. Jörn, can you check again and also provide info on Android version etc.?  I actually can’t reproduce it on my Android either (2.2 or so, on Google G1). 
@smehrbrodt  i can try.
Sorry... A `sudo find /Users/mats/ | grep Digital_` didn't uncover any files except a bunch of pdf scans of old books.
> Huh, I thought `java.nio.file.Paths` is part of core Java so it should be always present. And it seems you're running Java 8 so any modularization issues are not relevant. >  > When exactly does this happen ?  sudo cp source.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/other_name.war  Maybe this have something to do with the war rename.  and maybe I should try the rename with opengrok tools, but I encountered another problem #2810 
I'll have to give it a test in a clean environment later tonight. My production environment is quite heavy.
I activated the trace listener but I can't find how to use it, even by looking at the code...

thank you! :) 
I was using v2. Sorry for the extremely delayed response. 
@davivel   Thanks, this ended up being my DNS configuration, I assume. Using the full IP address and port worked, although I had to clear out the apps memory to be able to change the server address.  I still see nothing logged in my access_log, even now that it is working, so that must be a misconfiguration on my part.  Thank you for the prompt reply, I'll close this issue.

Sure. It's The Nerdist - http://nerdist.libsyn.com/rss  I'm referring to the large thumbnail rendered above the playback controls in the player activity. The small thumbnails in the queue list are fine.  I'm on an AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3 running stock Android 4.2.2. 
Ah, forgot, sorry. Was "A Will Eternal" on Wuxiaworld - though you might not be able to reproduce it now with the Karma system in place :/. Sorry if the report is too late to help.
Have to correct myself: Only two are archived due to woodwork. The others are residing so I was wrong. So just archived caches that are still shown on map. After killing c:geo through task manager the disc icon from the one archived disappeared.  So it is just that archived stay on map. Is this expected?  I wait for my dropbox to upload photos from yesterdays event and then I will provide screenshots.  Changed title. 
Ok my current version might be around a week outdated... If you fixed it recently then we're probably good. 
i try it on emulator and xiaomi mix 2s, it`s ok .  only on huawei nova youth report error,   maybe it's compatibility.
Yes, I was using wifi. 
Hi. Thanks for taking interest in this issue. Maybe the issue is bound to some other functionality (MediaSessionConnector or any other additional ExoPlayer classes i'm using). I managed to create simple reproduce project, that have this behavior (tested on API 28 Emulator and Nokia 8 device). In this project i'm using only ExoPlayer classes to play one online hls track. On call - playback doesn't get paused (you can see that on state textview and on notification). Let me know if i can assist you more [AudioFocus.zip](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/files/3434725/AudioFocus.zip) 
So it seems in a brand new database astar() and dijkstra() are working. But in my existing database where I have subclasses for E and V and many nodes they do not. I have put the property 'weight' on the class E itself, no sure if this is an issue.  If I do ShortestPath I get this:  orientdb {db=SpinOffIntelligence}> SELECT shortestPath(#13:834, #39:27)  +----+-----------------------+ |#   |shortestPath           | +----+-----------------------+ |0   |[#13:834,#23:74,#39:27]| +----+-----------------------+  If I do the other I get this:  orientdb {db=SpinOffIntelligence}> SELECT astar(#13:834, #39:27, 'weight')  +----+-----+ |#   |astar| +----+-----+ |0   |[]   | +----+-----+  orientdb {db=SpinOffIntelligence}> SELECT dijkstra(#13:834, #39:27, 'weight')  +----+--------+ |#   |dijkstra| +----+--------+ |0   |[]      | +----+--------+  In this case it did not throw an exception. I did set weight = 100 for ALL nodes though.  Question is why do these not return any data now?

@kevinushey The report I sent above is from work. I've seen it on my personal PC as well, but can't reproduce right now. I'll send the extra required information on monday.
Initially, I wanted to export a model from a FeatureHouse project. For testing, I also tried models of Antenna, FeatureC++ and Munge and all exports failed.  Error Log isn't containing anything regarding this export or its failure. My first guess is that some class or method in the ImageExport plugin was "refactored" and the respective call from FeatureIDE via Java Reflections doesn't get any result but I'm not sure.

Seed: "-2663283399219067512" Amidst v4.1 using both 1.9 and 1.8.9 profiles show spawn at -12,220 in a Plains biome. BOTH created worlds spawned me very close to the same place (close to the spawn location reported by NBTExplorer) in an Extreme Hills biome. NBTExplorer shows that the world spawn for BOTH PCMC versions as -3,249. Note: I spawned on a grass covered dirt block in both cases.  I realize that two data points don't imply a trend but it looks like this also manifests in pre-1.9 worlds.

Edit: I realise this doesn't show off the IC2: Uranium issue, but it's much the same. I just found it easier to test with Manyullyn  Found this in the latest release of Forever Stranded: Losts Souls Modpack.  However this was confirmed by creating a new profile and loading the mods listed below.

Thanks for reply but unfortunately, it doesn't help.  could you reproduce it?  Or i provide a demo for you later.
Tobias,  it does. But the application has an exception. So I am wondering whether the application correctly interprets the state that the phone is in. I will test things if needed, just need a hint on what should be tested.   (The #3569 seems to share the same symptoms.)

@KasparRosin exactly what @Hydrox6 said. it has it's own highlight box (idk what you call it)  Thought it might just be a simple fix so I reported it. It's not a big deal at all really
Forge 1901 (1.9)  And for the record, "current" Evilcraft is 0.9.10. 
@thboileau The problem has been resolved in 2.3.10. Thanks for the rapid response!
@anandtushar111 Sure. I'll assign it to you. Note this issue is for [Codeheat 2019](https://codeheat.org) so be sure to register first and make a PR once Codeheat officially starts to get your PR counted for the contest. You can even make a PR now nevertheless. Thanks.
@cweitkamp  Yes, sure. The issue is not with the host definition - this is the Docker container external port; the issue is the internal side of the container where openhab / the bindings are running. Basically you need two parameters to be able to resolve this, the one for the host that indicates other external devices how to contact openhab and the internal for the binding that indicates the binding how to access the container internally. You may want to look at the most current version of the Homematic Binding; they had a similar issue and resolved it by adding the internal parameter and the behavior indicated in my resolution proposal.

I believe I downloaded it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7 a while ago.  FWIW Windows declares its version as 6.1.7601 SP1 Build 7601.  Somewhat surprisingly, after rebooting this VM and trying to launch the latest daily build everything works. Given that the issue seems to have magically resolved itself I'll close this but let's keep our ears open in case we hear / see anything else from users running Windows 7.
It happens on most files. Maybe I wasn't specific enough with the extra info, but the data in the bug report is for one file, that crashed in around four minutes. However, the one I called the "Original problem" the MKV file playing on the Xperia tablet, played for a little less than 30 minutes one time, and more ore less 10 minutes on a second try.  There is also the case I mentioned about the 70MB files, that are 20 minutes long give or take, and they play without issues consistently.  Thanks, Fernando

yes without resource pack as well
yes the request is sent immediately on keyup.  i will try with the delay attribute and let you know
The issue we're trying to demonstrate is:   1.  Subscribe to an atmosphere endpoint/chatroom 2.  Unsubscribe from that atmosphere endpoint/chatroom 3.  Subscribe to a different atmosphere endpoint/chatroom 4.  Make an HTTP Request to a non-atmosphere endpoint   We're finding that Step 4 often fails.  Is there something inherently wrong with the approach we're trying to use? Is there something we missed that would cause HTTP requests happening concurrently with atmosphere calls to fail/suspend/etc. ?

Hi, looks like it was a java related issue. installed JRE and set Java_home to that and everything worked ! you might want to add that to the installation directions, at least for windows systems.  p.s. could you have a look at this ?
No they fall out of the world. Overworld the moving them back + works.

I think "playNotificationSoundURI" does not consider the case of "x-rincon-stream". I can try to fix the issue.

During the sync or the download to my PC via https i have no problems. But it looks like if i share files via https and other users from the internet download them so it could happens too and via my android phone. But i can't find the problem because the server is busy at 100% and it occures no error and i could only reboot my server. My server is running a ubuntu server 12.04 LTS on my home PC ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Thanks for explaining the presentation!   No error appears on the ErrorLog.   After a bit more digging. It seems that classes that are not inherited (ie class <name> : MonoBehavior) are working as expected and I can access transform, gameObject etc.   It's the inherited classes that aren't accessing the MonoBehavior from the parent. (ie class <name> : ParentClass). Does that help?  
Hi, I tried it again (the newest version on BApp Store).  I can confirm, that if the reflection happens **only** in the header, no issue is raised = as expected.   When I scan request which has multiple reflection, the first and only highlighted occurrence is the one in the response Header. Is it possible, that this highlight would not be present, as it should be excluded? Also, since there is only a single highlight in such a case, I would automatically miss all the other reflections = other 3 reflections in the Body. Only when I manually search the value can I see there are 4 matches (1 header + 3 body). Is this something which could be fixed as well?
Who said I was sane?! Although, it didn't cause a crash and everything was perfectly fine. I've done stuff like this just messing around in vanilla/bukkit/forge in a "just want to watch the world burn" kind of way. I wanted to see what would happen with TT. And obviously it printed out a lot of errors. Like I said, I've done this in every other environment in the past without any errors. I wouldn't have done a stress test without knowledge of the outcome in non TT environments. 
 Just in customer crash reports. And I don't know how to reappear.But it has appeared many times.
Aha - yeah isA does the job. 
when it crashed first time when I click on an item in inventory in the weapon station GUI items in the GUI weapon upgrade slots are lost  when reloading world after the first crash it crashes again after clicking on the weapon station block itself 
I tried with mysql and oracle.  I am not able to edit in both databases tables.
That issue occurred also with some builds before. I could solve it now by deleting lacells table 
1. protected CroutonMessage crtnMsg; 2. crtnMsg = new Crouton(this);  // Show when click list item 3. crtnMsg.showCrouton(Style.INFO,                         getResources().getString(R.string.main_info_nochild)); 
Hi Benny,  Yes, no problem.  This is my simplejavamail.properties file:  simplejavamail.smtp.host=smtp.production.host simplejavamail.smtp.port=587 simplejavamail.transportstrategy=SMTPS simplejavamail.smtp.username=username simplejavamail.smtp.password=1111 simplejavamail.defaults.from.address=from@default.com <mailto:simplejavamail.defaults.from.address=from@default.com>  And this is the constructor of my EmailService:  public EmailService() {     	File propsFile = new File(PROPERTIES_FILENAME);     	if (propsFile.exists()) {     		LOGGER.info("Overwritting simplejavamail properties from external file '{}'",PROPERTIES_FILENAME);     		propMap = ConfigLoader.loadProperties(propsFile, true);     		LOGGER.trace("Java mail properties read {}", propMap);     	} else {     		propMap = ConfigLoader.loadProperties(ConfigLoader.DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME, true);     	}     	mailer = MailerBuilder.buildMailer(); 	}  And I get the exception when building the mailer instance. By taking a look into your code, the property simplejavamail.smtp.password is expected to be a String but it gets converted to an Integer Object on the ConfigLoader class:  static Object parsePropertyValue(final String propertyValue) { if (propertyValue == null) { 			return null; 		} 		// read boolean value 		final Map<String, Boolean> booleanConversionMap = new HashMap<>(); 		booleanConversionMap.put("0", false); 		booleanConversionMap.put("1", true); 		booleanConversionMap.put("false", false); 		booleanConversionMap.put("true", true); 		booleanConversionMap.put("no", false); 		booleanConversionMap.put("yes", true); 		if (booleanConversionMap.containsKey(propertyValue)) { 			return booleanConversionMap.get(propertyValue.toLowerCase()); 		} 		// read number value  		try { 			return Integer.valueOf(propertyValue); 		} catch (final NumberFormatException nfe) { 			// ok, so not a number 		} 		// read TransportStrategy value 		try { 			return TransportStrategy.valueOf(propertyValue); 		} catch (final IllegalArgumentException nfe) { 			// ok, so not a TransportStrategy either 		} 		// return value as is (which should be string) 		return propertyValue; 	}  Maybe you should try to convert to Integer only the properties that need to be Integer such as port…  I hope that it helps.  Best regards.

I use version `3.8.1` because of Java 8.  Here is sample code:  ``` public class Main {     public static class RepoCollaborationsTabComponent extends FluentWebElement {          @FindBy(css = "table.t-collaborators")         private RepoCollaborationsTabComponent.Table table;          public void assertCollaborators(List<RepoCollaborationsTabComponent.Collaborator> collaborators) {             assertThat(table.getCollaboratorsData()).isEqualTo(collaborators);         }     }      public static class Table extends FluentWebElement {          @FindBy(css = ".t-collaborator")         private FluentList<RepoCollaborationsTabComponent.Table.Collaborator> collaborators;          public List<RepoCollaborationsTabComponent.Collaborator> getCollaboratorsData() {             return collaborators.stream()                     .map(RepoCollaborationsTabComponent.Table.Collaborator::getData)                     .collect(Collectors.toList());         }          public static class Collaborator extends FluentWebElement {              @FindBy(css = ".t-collaborator--email")             private FluentWebElement email;              @FindBy(css = ".t-collaborator--invite-not-accepted")             private FluentWebElement inviteNotAcceptedIcon;         }     }  } ```  When I call `assertCollaborators` the first time it works as expected. When I call it after table change (adding new collaborator) `table.collaborators` contains the previous list of collaborators and `org.openqa.selenium.StaleElementReferenceException` is thrown.
Yes, just looking through to pinpoint .  @haraldatbmw ty for the data points
I did build SDK 3 from source. I have 5.2.e platfom and share version.
Ok, on the Osmose website the bugs appear several times, too. It seems there actually are multiple identical bugs on one object. So this is rather an Osmose issue. I'm closing the thread.
Map and theme are created by myself. In order to reproduce the effect I think it's the best if you create a default map by yourself and use your default theme. Link to the (small) geofabrik extract: http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/nordrhein-westfalen/muenster-regbez.html  Regards Klaus 
@sarod when I run the build manually as you suggested Infinitest picks up and starts running tests.  The strange thing is I have "Build project automatically" setting turned on, so I'd expect it to start on it's own.
@80tf3262p8 after force-stopping the app, and starting it up again, it does indeed sync successfully. So this is another "workaround" then, similar to disabling wifi and syncing once over 4g, then turning wifi back on.
Thank you for the response.  Both getBean(Class) & getBean(String) methods are showing performance degradations.  We badly need a work around for this issue, as it is taking more than 3 min during initialization.
You are correct. The coordinates rely to the primary display. As i changed the primary display to the screen with the biggest height, the y coordinates starting on this screen at 0, on the other screens at +120.  Thank you for your help. I will now write a offset detection in the application code to work around this. Maybe this is a feature which should be done in the library directly because i think this will help others too.

I'd need a hand to keep consistent with the ReactFX stuff (I've never used ReactFX).  The problem seems to lie in this snippet:  ````java     Subscription caretPopupSub = EventStreams.combine(caretBounds, caretPopup.outsideViewportValues())                 .subscribe(tuple3 -> {                     Optional<Bounds> opt = tuple3._1;                     boolean showPopupWhenCaretOutside = tuple3._2;                      if (opt.isPresent()) {                         Bounds b = opt.get();                         caretPopup.setX(b.getMaxX() + caretXOffset);                         caretPopup.setY(b.getMaxY() + caretYOffset);                          if (caretPopup.isHiddenTemporarily()) {                             caretPopup.show(stage);                             caretPopup.setHideTemporarily(false);                         }                      } else {                         if (!showPopupWhenCaretOutside) {                             caretPopup.hide();                             caretPopup.setHideTemporarily(true);                         }                     }                 }); ````  It seems that *before* (meaning before something broke the Demo), the `Optional` wouldn't be "present" if the `BoundsPopup` was *outside* of the `area`'s bounds. That's no longer true.  `caretBounds` comes from `org.fxmisc.richtext.TextEditingArea#getCaretBounds` and its documentation *says*  > Gets the bounds of the caret in the Screen's coordinate system or `Optional#empty()` if caret is not visible in the viewport.  But that doesn't *seem* to hold true any more. Am I missing something?   [VirtualizedScrollPane Exception]: https://gist.github.com/TurekBot/51187a9bdfde85374cf6f8b2ebccf57e
Yes, I was testing your latest pull request. But this also happened before! 
It should work but it doesn't. It is an essential aspect of the migration process that the workflow candidates with most processes are at the top.
GregTech 5 was added later to the world as a GregTech 6 replacement when I have found out that GregTech 6 had no tech tree at that moment.  In fluid registry only the glue from Tinkers' Construct was found and deleted. Launching the world afterwards changed all unusable GregTech glue to Tinkers' Construct glue, which successfully was accepted by assembling machine.  The problem was solved. The issue can be closed.
@digitalgust There are some plans regarding debugging, but nothing concrete yet.  If you or anybody wants to help take a look at the ShadowFrames implementation: C-Function: https://github.com/MobiDevelop/robovm/blob/master/compiler/vm/core/src/shadowframes.c Java Compiler Plugin: https://github.com/MobiDevelop/robovm/blob/master/compiler/compiler/src/main/java/org/robovm/compiler/plugin/shadowframe/ShadowFramePlugin.java  The plan is to extend the ShadowFramePlugin to pass information about stack variables to the runtime, and store it in the ShadowFrame struct.  The Soft-Debugger which is responsible for debugging and breaking is implemented in hooks.c https://github.com/MobiDevelop/robovm/blob/master/compiler/vm/core/src/hooks.c  hooks.c implements it's own debugging protocol, on top of which a JDWP debugger has to be implemented. 
it was recent changes that caused the bug filed here

Dear lodici,   I was actually trying them simultaneously. However, I did try relaunching 1.60.770 and only downloading the playable cards and it still crashed out; I just retried it with the same result.  The crash logs are below; in both cases it seem to be the "~Azorius ?thermage”.  The playable cards “downloads-remaining" counter is at 8610.

Hi Kevin,  Attached is the diagnostics report as requested. The file path I'm attempting to save to as a testis: \\userqr\r\russ0207\Documents\test3.R None of the file\folder paths I've attempted have had any fancy characters outside of the period for the file extension. Attempting to save the file without a file extension ('test3') produces the same results. [diagnostics-report.txt](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/files/4273067/diagnostics-report.txt) 
he did tried that AFAIK, can't be sure
The normal crusher can't crush them either. And no, the JEI doesn't show it.

That's the symptoms exactly, maybe it's only other crashes and softlocks that causes it. Let me do a bit more reproduction testing. Notably, when I restart the game, I end up at my bed, so the teleport completes before the crash. Somehow.

The normal interface: http://puu.sh/gJ9s2/8b7e378987.png The interface terminal count: http://puu.sh/gJ9sM/64ab4eda25.png I want to stress that NO OTHER CHANGES were made other than the single change pictured below. The multipart'd interface: http://puu.sh/gJ9u1/1ac554560d.png The new interface terminal count: http://puu.sh/gJ9v5/5daa9cc608.png Again, only THAT SINGLE CHANGE is made. Back to the normal interface: http://puu.sh/gJ9xX/64b3709599.png And the new interface terminal count: http://puu.sh/gJ9yn/47acc460b7.png  It may do this with other blocks as well, maybe even cables.  However, I only tested this effect with interfaces.  This is very very very bizarre to me, and it took us quite awhile to figure out why all of our interfaces weren't available. 
I haven't confirmed this behavior yet.. planning on doing so today, but I wanted to put the issue up at least to investigate. 
Seems to be fixed... 
Didn't keep the original crash. Seemed to be something with shift clicking out, but I can't be sure. Will submit it again if it happens again.

The problem only seems to happen when opening the app via the widget. 
@laa I sent it to you in an email. Did you get it? Is there another way you would like me to send it to you? (I noticed that this is still flagged as "waiting reply".) 
yeah 1.3.71 and both ssp and smp ( I test it at the moment)  I don't know which version but I think .69 worked fine in SSP (couldn't test it on my smp) and I don't have it anymore :(  here some screens: http://imgur.com/csSXl8z,2iSFtfG,qmuKkXE,sWQtWyV,yybX6Q9,mEWkMRC 
1.14.2. I can do some testing soon[TM].

Where could I possibly have moved it? If so, is there a way to reset it's position or something?
I meant that I was only looking at the code for `Try`; I assumed wrongly that if the methods there contained `Class<X>...` parameters then that would cause issues - I didn't actually check. However, all those methods have a `@SafeVarargs` in place already in the 2.1.1 I'm using. So, again, the problem seems contained to `FluentFunctions`.
Using Java 8 works better (interestingly enough, since the pom file specifies Java 8 to be used?), but generates other errors as below:  ``` Tests run: 5, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5.645 sec <<< FAILURE! - in tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest testUnregisterSuccess(tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest)  Time elapsed: 0.843 sec  <<< FAILURE! java.lang.AssertionError: null 	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86) 	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41) 	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52) 	at tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest.testUnregisterSuccess(RegistryTest.java:125)  testRegisterFail(tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest)  Time elapsed: 1.229 sec  <<< FAILURE! java.lang.AssertionError: null 	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86) 	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41) 	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52) 	at tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest.testRegisterFail(RegistryTest.java:157)  testRegister(tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest)  Time elapsed: 0.836 sec  <<< FAILURE! java.lang.AssertionError: null 	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86) 	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41) 	at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52) 	at tools.descartes.teastore.registry.RegistryTest.testRegister(RegistryTest.java:102)   Results :  Failed tests:    RegistryTest.testUnregisterSuccess:125 null   RegistryTest.testRegisterFail:157 null   RegistryTest.testRegister:102 null ```
It´s a `Sony Xperia Z1`. Generally the Lollipop CM12 works pretty stable for such early nightly.  I think I could use logcat to see what happens when running AIMSICD? 
FloodLights-1.7.10-1.0.0-25 
That's the question that needs answering. Would the URL resource contain full path data so we could check that the regex `".*file:(.+\\.jar).*"` doesn't match the result?... except that wouldn't then work when running a Spring fat jar
> If this was tested with Interesting is this an interesting-related bug instead (de-scoped for current milestone). What is the behaviour with a different generation?  It was tested with interesting, but it will be an issue for any generation type for the reductive walker
Thank you for the fast reaction!   I'm using 2.1.0. I just started using (and loving it) and use it with kafka 2.2.0. I managed to get it running by explicitly removing the transitive lombok dependency.
/search?uuid=xxx does a retrieval: displays the metadata detail page.  Looks like Share and Link use the same end point, the first to share in social networks and the second to allow to copy it to the clipboard.  http://localhost:8080/geonetwork/srv/eng/search is the search endpoint, but if you send the uuid parameter displays the metadata detail page for the uuid provided. 
Hey, I cant reproduce it. But I can see it in my metrics. The app is out for 10 days (deployed in 3 versions) and it happed 6 times across all versions for 3 (of maybe 10) users.  
i guess its not essentialsx, i just went through my whole plugins folder and didnt find any debug enabled so idk
Hi, Thanks for taking a look, my following video settings are: Graphics Fancy, Smooth Lighting Maximum, 3D Anaglyph off, GUI Scale Normal, Brightness bright, Particles all, Use VSync on, Anisotropic Filtering off, Render Distance 10 chunks, Max Framerate 60fps, view Bobbing on, Advanced OpenGL off, Clouds off, fullscreen off, Mipmap levels 4. 
On mine too. It´s a crashreport from the PlayStore 
Hi, here is a tentative solution, following the same approach we use in GeoTools/GeoServer: https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/pull/106  The version numbers need to be modified on release of course, but it's a quick matter of running something like:  ``` find . -name pom.xml -exec sed -i "s/4.1-SNAPSHOT/4.1.1/g" {} \; ```

I did not, and after enabling it and rebooting my phone, on demand fixed itself, the `On demand` logs now appear, and that despite the fact I already had rebooted it 3 or 4 times, wiped caches, etc, to make sure that wasn't the problem...  Anyway, the `No field mSleeping` error still pops when I start XPrivacy, but the rest seems to have decided to work magically, so I'm fine. Sorry for the inconvenience... :/
Thank you Emanuele, understood. So I'll close this issue. Do we have something in documentation about this? If not, it would be better to have this point described. 
PR submitted - #25255
I'm not sure if this is version specific. But I remember that we had a similar issue some time ago, that was also not reproducable for everyone. Have to dig into this a bit more when at my desktop machine. 
"_sorted_without_duplicates.sam" is appended to the infile name after the extension is removed  
no, it does not appear to happen with just Stellar API 
You mean in the app? Then I see a clone of the notifications I have in the NC web interface.
Will Send you test case shortly. 
I think this is what you want... http://pastebin.com/XRnYA22h The problem is that the server doesn't crash itself, neither my client crashes, but the it shows an "Internal Server Error" and kicks me out of the server... Let me know if you need anything else

@yegor256 in general, yes, but it would be the best to have this behavior completely transparant for the library user 
Hrmpf. That’s not the only keyword that ES5 reserved… here’s the full list (from the link in the original description): - unconditionally:   - [x] `class`   - [x] `const`   - [x] `enum`   - [x] `export`   - [ ] `extends`   - [ ] `import`   - [ ] `super` - in strict mode:   - [x] `implements`   - [ ] `interface`   - [ ] `let`   - [ ] `package`   - [x] `private`   - [x] `protected`   - [x] `public`   - [x] `static`   - [ ] `yield`  The remaining unchecked keywords under “unconditionally” can still be used to reproduce this bug. Please add them too.  It gets uglier with the ones that are only reserved in strict mode. Ideally, we want to support running in strict mode (#2733). For that, we should escape these names too. However, that will be a change to binary compatibility, and unlike the case for `class`, this will break compatibility with code (albeit code with weird names) that currently works. So we shouldn’t make this change right now, I think… but it does mean we know for sure that we’ll break binary compatibility at least one more time, unless we’re happy with never ever supporting strict mode. 
I prefer the "throw an error" approach - `{}` already denotes nothing. 
sorry about the confusion,  i have multi maven modules with Go and I would like to run mvn-golang:vet In this example,  2 modules should be sufficient      common     main  main depends on common via mvn-golang maven dependency  Normal   'build' gold works, since main module can reference 'common'  via GOPATH which is set correctly ( ends with target/__dep__/common-x.y.x)  'vet' goal fail to find  'common'  since GOPATH does not have 'common' in its path
Yup, that does the trick. Results in the image gallery at http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/2016-01-18_47_-122 - Thanks! 
Actually it does.  I tested exactly these steps: ( 0. Break Zone Planner block with pickaxe) 1. Place Zone Planner in world 2. Activate ZP's UI with right-click 3. Go to fullscreen using 'FS' button 4.

@E3V3A, in fact, in "Network Information" it shows my Provider under "Network Name", but strangely under "SIM Information" it doesn't show my "Opertator Name". Same is the case with the phone of one of my friends using an HTC Desire X. Just to make sure I'm not reporting a false positive: What does you "Operator Name" show? And what **should** be shown there (examples, please)? 
@solohsu this is the log which I was success bootup after reflash Ed Xposed and Riru. Should the implementation be more inefficiency to detect old and new version (apk) while checking modules enabled from module list?
my xenforo mysql db has always been remote and when you use bungee with servers on the same dedicated server you bind the servers to localhost so players can only connect through bungeecord  when I don't bind the minecraft server it works but when I do it can't connect to the remote mysql db so I would say yes in some cases I need the mysql connector to bind to different ip than the minecraft server  Thanks JamieKG 
It would be needed in a sense that we want to know if the data is loaded but is empty. If at any time the data is not loaded that can imply two possibilities: 1. Data was empty or 2. Data was never loaded due to some other unknown issue.  In the later situation, if there were no errors or warnings by the system, one has to go and cross check why the data was never loaded. This can be avoided when we load the data into the database irrespective of its nature.  This is particularly required when there is a batch execution of similar csvs every day or every week.

yes when i start a game, and when its over its saying start.sh does not exist! and then it crash the server. So what are the problem, so i can fix it?

It's a genymotion Nexus 4 AVD using the sample app. 
@johnmcclean-aol Thanks for the fast response! This sounds great, seriously, decent pattern matching and higher kinded types are the things I miss most in Java, so your project gave me hope!  A really cool thing too would be a gist how to "idiomatically" use the typeclasses in cyclops. Tbh. I tried to implement one but gave up after being overwhelmed with the amount of additional types and interfaces I had to look into. I think that would make the project for people with fp background but not experienced with Java more accessible.   
Thanks @eivantsov for testing this. I've researched this a bit more and discovered that what I am experiencing was reported in issue #3324. The workspace structure is created properly, as you demonstrated, but the workspace container creates projects and files in /data, not in /my/data/che-data.  I believe this has been fixed in PR #3318 which has other changes. I'm trying to find a recent build that I can use to test this. The nightly build is failing because che-server creates the directory structure as root and then launches the workspaces with user 1000, so they can't properly write into the storage area.

@rachellyne I believe what's happened is the unexpected syntax (the greater than symbol) causes the webapp to misread the widget config and discard it.  It's reading XML so the `>` bracket is breaking it. I tried to encode but that didn't work either.   I will check the reader and see what's wrong. The enrichment widget seems to be okay with that syntax so maybe just have to copy that over for graph widgets.  Let me know your priority for this! 
Yes, it is a query where I don't care too much about the performance. But I thought you guys might want to investigate a bit further since the performance does not make sense to me. So my personal guess is that this is an error/problem.  I know that Regexes are pretty expensive. But I don't see the reason why the query planner yield such highly different results. In the end a "has(attr) and attr =~ $regex" should not be much different from "attr! =~ $regex", since both should not evaluate the regex if has or ! evaluate to false. Or do I miss something again here?  Cached results are:  ``` SQL START n=node(*) WHERE n.username! =~ '.*Satoshi.*' RETURN n ```  ~120-140s  ``` SQL START n=node(*) WHERE n.username! =~ '.*Satoshi.*' RETURN COUNT(n) ```  ~115s  ``` SQL START n=node(*) WHERE HAS(n.username) AND n.username =~ '.*Satoshi.*' RETURN n ```  ~8-9s  ``` SQL START n=node(*) WHERE HAS(n.username) AND n.username =~ '.*Satoshi.*' RETURN COUNT(n) ```  ~8-9s  The result was always 1 node, that has 2 two short attributes. So networking was not an issue. Results are varying due to other programs running (there are still plenty of cores unused). I cannot produce any "real measurement" for the next days.

@ronblum I actually saw this in Firefox 69.0 (64 bit). I use Firefox on both Windows and iOS systems. I will try to check the latest RStudio Preview for the above issue and let you know.
the source server uses eXistdb 2.2 master d447d01 and java 1.7.0 IBM J9 VM the target uses newest 2.3dev and java 1.8.0_45 from Oracle  I renamed the file externally, reloaded it via Dashboard as   UKK_Seitenfuss.jpg, deleted the old version and changed the references.

could be also a solution. 
Sorry.  I don't know what this one is either.   
@Tajnymag im actually reading through them right now.  First day commenting, still learning the flow. And i currelty have 1.5.4 version , but still same problem  
At GapiTestBase.java L105: String fileName = snippetFileName.split("\.")[0].split("/")[1];  This assumes the snippetFileName contains a "/" char. (e.g. testdata/snippet.snip) I don't feel this assumption is correct since it will cause an out-of-bound exception if the file name does not follow this pattern (e.g. snippet.snip). 
updated ticket with a better gif and explanation
Seems to be only SMP issue, i am using Big reactors 0.4.0 RC8 and forge .1208 / .1217 
It seems that the option "deleted" still isn't working, but "moved to app folder" is. Also the moved files are shown in gallery now.

I did update to 1534 but the error message is still there. What I did:  - Thing removed / Binding uninstalled - Cache & Tmp Folders cleared - Reinstalled Binding  I have to correct myself here: _...as soon as I add the thing "Tracker Device" to my system..._  It doesn't matter if the thing is added or not. It's just related to the binding installation. Can I help somehow with a debug? But most probably it doesn't help to debug the gpstreacker-binding?
Good point; I just tried updating to 1.0.2.RELEASE but I see the same behaviour.

I'm in fullscreen in 1920x1080 and my gui scale is set to 2. (when I posted, I was in 1.15.1)  I make some further tests (always with the same resolution and gui scale). For all test I updated my game to 1.15.2 and the mod to 0.1.0.96: - with forge 31.0.14 and it still here - with forge 31.0.16 and it still here - with forge 31.0.16 and try to play with default resolution (1024x768) and I have the issue too.

Sure, I have here Android System Web view version 74.0.3729.186
The minimal change in https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/issues/823#issuecomment-229991143 looks to have stopped threads becoming stuck in CPU loops in our opentsdb 2.2.0 instances, we do not have plans to upgrade the opentsdb version at the moment so I am sorry I am unable to test the change against more recent versions.  I could make a PR against https://github.com/OpenTSDB/opentsdb/tree/v2.2.0 , would a v2.2.1 release with the change be appropriate?  Or would such a change only go into the master branch and next release?  I will make the same change to `keepers` next week and test the code on the hosts exhibiting the behaviour.   I am happy if someone else wants to make the change(s).  Thanks. 
I have English language set systemwide, but I use it in Poland.
Just a quick update: I changed from the old cyanogen mod install to newest lineage OS and it works now. After selecting the account, there was a dialog if Nextcloud Deck should be allowed to access accounts. On the old install, it crashed before that. Maybe that helps with finding the issue. New android version is 8.1.0, API 27.  > Sorry for the slow progress btw, I'd wish, we could have more spare time for this...  I really appreciate that you guys spent your spare time on this, absolutely no need to apologize for giving your time for free to the community ;)
Small code in Kotlin, using attached file ``` import mt.edu.um.cf2.jgribx.GribFile import mt.edu.um.cf2.jgribx.grib1.Grib1Record   object Test1 {     @JvmStatic     fun main(args: Array<String>) {         val file = GribFile("C:\\temp\\C3_2019112600_CLCL.grb")         val record = file.records.filter { r-> (r as Grib1Record).bds.isConstant }.first()                println(record.forecastTime.toInstant())         println(record.getValue(31.93, 34.7))     } }  ```  [C3_2019112600_CLCL.zip](https://github.com/spidru/JGribX/files/3906368/C3_2019112600_CLCL.zip) 
@Fabrice-TIERCELIN I am using the AutoRefactor plugin from the command line (https://github.com/cal101/AutoRefactor). I added support for delta debugging https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/dd/. This reduces test cases but that does destroy formatting. Everything is done from the command line withoud the eclipse GUI involved. What I need is some CODE snippet how to call the eclipse API to do formatting. 
With the latest version, the problem has changed. Now the constellation continuously pops in and out of visibility for what appear to be single frames, moving each time. This also happens on all worlds, not just the original world with the problem.
It's happens with all of link from Flickr.

I do not quite understand what a custom (manually created) driver is. I use the **MS SQL Server / Microsoft Driver" that is supplied by _DBeaver_ and downloaded within _DBeaver_.  Should I used another driver, downloaded a driver from other source, or should I have specified the command line parameter differently?  On that the bug only happens with Generic driver in _DBeaver_ 4.3.4+ seems odd, since the fault already existed in _DBeaver_ version 4.3.3.1.
com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.5.2 https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.4.1-all.zip
version is 2.1.4 I sent you in email the data. 
appliedenergistics2-rv3-beta-6
That opens it.
I'm using the 16.20 Teradata driver, but will check for a newer version.  I had no issues like this with 6.1.3.  I should note I have been using Homebrew to install and update dBeaver.  Should I switch to download and install?
Of Course:  ``` <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"       xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">     <item android:id="@+id/action_open_door"           android:title="@string/open_door_tab"           app:showAsAction="ifRoom"/>     <item android:id="@+id/action_permissions_door"           android:title="@string/sharing_tab"           app:showAsAction="ifRoom"/>     <item android:id="@+id/action_logs_door"           android:title="@string/logs_tab"         app:showAsAction="ifRoom"/> </menu> ```  If run a sample project generated by AS, it's work well. If generate same view in project, the error still there.
Now the beds work properly, thanks! 👍 
Fixed
Only hostile mobs are invisible. The wolves are there to kill the skeleton. The wolves were able to kill the skeleton and you can see the drops, but the skeleton itself is invisible.
We're using the default forge for FTB Infinity Evolved, let me go see... Forge 10.13.4.1614, by the looks of the debug screen. oh, right: Fastcraft is installed too. I know that can cause abnormalities, totally forgot to mention that last time, my apologies.  Also, I wasn't overloaded, the ability itself was functioning, reflecting both damage and projectiles, but it would fail to negate damage to me. Hitting me with it on would still hurt the other, and would use some of my cp and give me some overload, but I'd take the full damage of the attack. I was wearing Quantum armor from IndustrialCraft2, which negates a good bit of damage; When hit by an electon beam with the armor on and reflection off, I'd take half a heart of damage, but if I was hit by that with the armor on and reflection active, I'd take 6 hearts of damage, completely ignoring the fact that I was wearing the armor. Damage would only bypass my armor when the skill was active, if it was off the armor would function like normal. That being said, we've since removed kCauldron, and reflection is working once again, so its not a pressing issue for me anymore, but it does further incline me to believe kCauldron was the culprit.

@eivantsov I have downloaded the latest version. And i am running it Vagrant. 
Mod version : placeableitems-3.3 Forge : 1.12.2-14.23.5.2838 MC version : 1.12.2  Video  : https://youtu.be/UYggJb4Z8u4 Basically all you have to do is keep spamming to place and break the sword and it will duplicate.

Hello, @swankjesse, no only one copy of OkHttp3, if you mean this line: `testImplementation testDependencies.okHttp3` I removed it and tried and still get the error. One is `implementation` while the other is `testImplementation`. However, other than those, there isn't any other copy of okhttp, I also removed the `testImplementation` one so there is only one implementation in the build.gradle.   Here's a screenshot of the error I am getting:  ![url](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22520376/65778547-774fd300-e189-11e9-9760-ae68412eeba3.png)  And here's a screenshot when using `.url()` instead of `.url`:  ![sss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22520376/65778830-f7763880-e189-11e9-9704-3001928480db.png)

Here is the link to Total mayhem 1.30  http://faforever.uveso.de/TotalMayhem(AllGameVersions)-v1.30.rar  and heres the thread to it http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=12248  and yes seems to happen only with that ( my guess its the size )  any idea how i can use the changes ? like drop files into my downlords install ? to test if its fixed ?  Btw Old Total mayhem ( 1.20 ) is in the vault... so either there wasnt the problem . or it got bigger or something.
There is a "Save chart" button on the GUI panel, but there is nothing else there to save the rule density curve, the grammar, and the anomalies. I will push a code change right now that has some preliminary panels and fields whose functionality needs to be implemented.

It is indeed different than I first thought. I have just seen that on repeated refresh of the same list of caches still some pictures are loaded, which made me think they are loaded multiple times.  I retested it today and from what I can see, the first refresh loads quite a lot of images and on the sedond refresh also images are loaded (but these have not been contained in the first refresh as far as I checked). Why is that?  Both refreshes have been done a few minutes apart. Here are the logs:  First refresh: https://www.dropbox.com/s/joo7hp9byiy2nnw/firstrefresh_89caches_issues4578.txt?dl=0  Seond refresh: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmugewj5ynwn39j/secondrefresh_89caches_issues4578.txt?dl=0  Please kindly have a look. 
I've found my bug, a convertion from the old versions to the new versions can cause this. Thank you! 
> PR is coming from forks, because the environment variables are not used  Yes it's actually related to this: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#Pull-Requests-and-Security-Restrictions  And we cannot do anything against it directly.  I propose to take those actions:   1. Prepare another CI like Jenkins - with proper authentication - to run on PRs, then we'll have two distincts diagnostics   2. We should **REALLY** refactor the test of repairnator-pipeline, we only use integration test and they're ugly   
Yes, first time i have configured it have saved all signed blobs. But not the new one yet.
I can confirm that the latest Early Access build (01-Jul-2019 17:26) did not resolve the issue.   Looking at the 2 modules files.  The one included in the Early Access package has a size of 23,608 KB The one included in the OpenJDK11U-jre_x64...11.0.3_7 has a size of 91,049 KB Interestingly to me, I do not find a modules file in my Oracle Java installation so it must be specific to the OpenJDK software.  ![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33190780/60456084-ec991f80-9bfd-11e9-970c-f3122c41b90c.PNG) 
I ran it with a localhost http server, but you may try with http://www.wikipedia.org, GQuery falls into the same situation. 
I can verify that the latest snapshot works fine. Both in our real service and in the sample application above. Great work and many thanks for a super quick response!
Looks like Bazel is not included in the repository as you mentioned. Should I do apt-add?
Well, as I stated before, The Utility Worlds mod adds the ability for players to craft portals to their very own private mining, garden, or void worlds.  EVERY time that a new portal is created, so is a dimension, similar to mystcraft.  This is not such an issue with the mining worlds, HOWEVER, the garden worlds are only 5 blocks deep, 4 blocks of dirt/grass and 1 of bedrock.  Your mod is biting chunks out of those dimensions leaving gaping holes to the void when it tries to generate the lush caves because there is not enough depth for them to generate.  The Utility Worlds mod author is at a loss as to how it can be blocked.  I have seen mods in the past retain the ability to use either a whitelist or a blacklist so the server operators can decide which they need to use for their modpack servers based on the mods included in the pack, this is usually in the form of a simple config option that allows you to choose 1 for blacklist or 2 for whitelist and they utilize the same list in the config of dimensions for either one.  I am not asking you to remove the blacklist for players that need them, but it is not very useful for anyone using the Utility Worlds mod or any other mod that allows for dimensions to be added at any time.  As it stands, if I add say dimensions 5, 6 and 7 to the blacklist today, by tomorrow I may need to add 2 or 3 more and restart the server for the list to take affect and by then the damage may already be done, you want to talk about annoying, that's rather annoying as well.  Perhaps then if you can't be bothered to add a simple whitelist, then you can make it so that Lush Caves do not generate in dimensions added by Utility Worlds mod by default which would also solve the issue of the gaping holes in the ground.  It's ultimately your mod either way and at least I can turn them completely off for the server.  [Utility Worlds Mod](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/utility-worlds)  [Other users with same issue](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/utility-worlds?comment=54)  ![2016-09-17_18 48 33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1578429/18611444/7d757d0a-7d07-11e6-8c62-8ef6a79e2f7d.png)  ![2016-09-17_18 48 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1578429/18611445/8b82bffc-7d07-11e6-9e1f-b2686586da11.png) 
I have 5 items placed. Now I've tried on a different phone, and it's working fine. This working device is running Android 6.0 (Sony Z3Compact), the other one Android 5.1 (Huawei G8). I've noticed that it happens with 4 items or more and it also occur with your bottombar application sample:  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17174870/21991324/68d94286-dc12-11e6-9326-2df5f8d31087.png)    
It's an error that shows up within Android Studio because of the pom file hack. Removing the hack fixes it.  The error comes up when someone imports the android tracker to their app in Android Studio.  The idea is that we document for the initial release that we need to add tracker-core. We then release a 0.1.1, where we push a change (in the works) that fixes this requirement. On the other hand, if we have some time before the 0.1.0 release, I'll try to get a fix for it before release.  Here's a screenshot of my IDE when I build it with AS after adding the android-tracker (I renamed it to `android-tracker` with version 0.1.1 in this test, just ignore that for now): ![screen shot 2014-09-03 at 8 09 32 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1370580/4133797/49b4382a-3363-11e4-834c-15108c06b729.png) 
> only the keys are compared  In the worst case we need to define two comparators. For example:  * `HashMap[Set]` - no comparators required * `LinkedHashMap[SortedSet]` - it is necessary to determine values comparator * `TreeMap[Seq]` - it is necessary to determine keys comparator * `TreeMap[SortedSet]` - it is necessary to determine both comparators 
Nope, it doesn't  occur with grass or any vanilla minecraft flower. I can further add that this happened on FTB Infinity 1.8.2 with Botania updated to the lastest version.

yes it does.  We have an upcoming 1.18.1 release on Weds which should fix this and a couple of others.

Could be. However I certainly feel like a token based auth approach would be better. Do you know what I mean?
Hi again,  thanks for your analysis efforts. I added some logging to our test environment and this is a stack trace of when a new connection is added to the `nodeConnections` map:  ``` at org.redisson.connection.MasterSlaveConnectionManager.lambda$connectToNode$0(MasterSlaveConnectionManager.java:274)  at org.redisson.connection.MasterSlaveConnectionManager.dt_access$1258(MasterSlaveConnectionManager.java)  at org.redisson.misc.RedissonPromise.lambda$onComplete$0(RedissonPromise.java:187)  at org.redisson.misc.RedissonPromise.dt_access$237(RedissonPromise.java)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.notifyListener0(DefaultPromise.java:500)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.notifyListenersNow(DefaultPromise.java:474)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.notifyListeners(DefaultPromise.java:413)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.setValue0(DefaultPromise.java:538)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.setSuccess0(DefaultPromise.java:527)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultPromise.trySuccess(DefaultPromise.java:98)  at org.redisson.misc.RedissonPromise.trySuccess(RedissonPromise.java:82)  at org.redisson.client.RedisClient$2$1.run(RedisClient.java:232)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.safeExecute(AbstractEventExecutor.java:163)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.runAllTasks(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:416)  at io.netty.channel.nio.NioEventLoop.run(NioEventLoop.java:515)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$5.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:918)  at io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74)  at io.netty.util.concurrent.FastThreadLocalRunnable.run(FastThreadLocalRunnable.java:30)  ```  So it doesn't seem to originate from the SentinelConnectionManager really - I thought so because all the connections in the `nodeConnections` map were for the sentinels, but apparently it's just from normal client usage, I guess? Then the question would be why the connections are not re-used, or rather, why they are never removed after usage?
@lgou2w Not solved yet... But I feel.. I was using a dev build?... I test that Paper Spigot version and my friends said bukkit was better that it..  I think I should wait for the full version of 1.14 Paper Spigot, so I closed the issue.. 
It is the complete stacktrace, as recorded by firebaseCrash analytics. Also, googling for the stacktrace shows other people who have similar stack trace[not related to this lib].  I had 100% crash rate using the steps that I outlined.  There may be two cases I can think of   you remove the bottomsheet after click, in the app code.  or your phone removes the activity a bit late [low spec device] or the bottomsheet is removed before the activity is destroyed[high spec device]. Not very useful diagnosis.   
STT service was provisioned and model was created a couple of days ago, Watson SDK I am using the latest stable 3.8.0. Can I get SDK snapshot using Maven or do I have to download? Sounds like something worth trying.
By "intersecting but not overlapping", I meant that the two layers touch each other but don't occupy the same coordinates. For example, I drew the void layer, and I drew the water layer with a filter except on void.  Here's a world file with the bug. It's not the one on the picture, but the same bug is visible. http://www.mediafire.com/file/s87dblmg2ewbqru/Bug.world  Here are the settings for the water ground cover layer. ![https://gyazo.com/5f2d50a1e3a31e5d0355a41c609e52c2](https://i.gyazo.com/5f2d50a1e3a31e5d0355a41c609e52c2.png)

> @daniloercoli do you know, when you tested on a real device, if the rate of typing had any effect on whether you encountered this issue, i.e. did this only occur when typing fast?  Interesting consideration. I had reproduced the problem several times on a real device, Nexus 5 with Android 7 attached to AS. I also remember that I was able to reproduce the same problem on a Samsung S9 (Android 9) attached to AS. Would you mind to test on a real device, and see it the problem happens?  Let me know, otherwise  I can try do replicate the issue on Monday.
Switching to row mode did not seem to address the issue. I will work on getting a repro setup.

But inside this method `mAdapter.isEnabled()` returns **false**.  This  ``` @Override 	public void onClick(View view) { 		if (mAdapter.isEnabled(getFlexibleAdapterPosition()) && isViewExpandableOnClick()) { 			toggleExpansion(); 		} 		super.onClick(view); 	} ```  come to this  ``` public final int getFlexibleAdapterPosition() { 		int position = getAdapterPosition(); 		if (position == RecyclerView.NO_POSITION) { 			position = mBackupPosition; 		} 		return position; 	} ```  and this method returns **-1**. `getAdapterPosition(`) retruns **-1** and `mBackupPosition` is also equals **-1**.

Sorry, should have specified that. I'm seeing it in the repo view while trying to scroll the readme.

In the inner class inside of Multimaps class: ``` public static final class ImmutableMultimaps {     public final ImmutableListMultimapFactory list = new ImmutableListMultimapFactory();     public final ImmutableSetMultimapFactory set = new ImmutableSetMultimapFactory();     public final ImmutableSortedSetMultimapFactory sortedSet = new ImmutableSortedSetMultimapFactory();     public final ImmutableBagMultimapFactory bag = new ImmutableBagMultimapFactory();     public final ImmutableSortedBagMultimapFactory multimap = new ImmutableSortedBagMultimapFactory();  ``` One of these does not look like the others.
could we just keep things simple ?  We just want to give the ability to kill/stop process that have been started by a user through a task. If the user is launching a process that will start other processes, ok ... it is his responsibility to kill the other processes and avoid that situation.  User would know about the fact that the action will just kill the process like we would run the command kill. Could the user run a kind of supervisor if running such a process ?  Let's cover that problem when we face it and not over designing. 
At present, graph spectrum needs a tuning panel to retrieve the note from; it can't retrieve one Fingering object from an XML view.    You aren't likely to see this problem with the other tools, because I don't know how to provoke an exception, or an early exit, from any of them.  By rights, Graph spectrum should be greyed out when the XML view is shown, because getSelectedFingering is returning null, but for that to happen, WIDesigner  would have to call StudyView::updateActions(), which is currently protected, when it calls XMLToggleView::toggleView(). 
I mean with this that an error message appeared, without the error happening.

Example :  This model is the one asking to the user to write a message and display it in the console. (The experiment works)  ``` model user   global {      init     {         create user number:1;     } }  species user control:user_only {        user_panel "Default" initial: true {     transition to: "Write" when: cycle mod 20=0;    }    user_panel "Write"    {       user_command "Activate"  continue: true color: #blue{         user_input "Target" returns: message type: string<-"None";         write message;       }       transition to: "Default";     } }   experiment anExp type:gui {     float minimum_cycle_duration<-0.1#s;     output     {     } } ```  This model is the co-model (but with only one model for the moment)  ``` model comodel import "user.gaml" as model_user  global {     bool activated<-true;     init     {         create model_user.anExp number:1 ;     }     reflex update     {         ask first(model_user.anExp).simulation         {                 do _step_;         }     }  }  experiment test type: gui {     float minimum_cycle_duration<-0.1#s; } ```  Normally, we expect the co-model to do as the experiment in the micro-model, which means that the user interaction contained in the micro-model, once the panel appears, will stop the experiment until the value of the user_command is set. However, it just continues to do the step, and doesn't even allow to set the value, as it is updates every cycle. I know that the ask within the reflex in the co model forces the step to pass, but so does the step by step button. But in this case, when launching the experiment in the micro-model, even pressing the button doesn't pass to the next step.  That's why I was hoping to "stop" all the simulations once a user_panel appears, just like for the micro model. 
I tried more than 3 months old commit and it was still broken. 
So they have respawn on one of my staff island. I do not have any respawn plugin, even Essentials as u can see above, just when they die thay are respawing on another island not on thairs one..  I am sorry for my english is not well.
@k88hudson No, it's definitely not caused by tapping within the bounding box around a transparent image. Were you not able to reproduce with the steps above? What it seems like is even if you move an element, it leaves a phantom, tappable area in the center of the page.  I'll get on the latest build, attempt to reproduce and let you know. 
That's pretty perfect to be honest! Thanks for the good work! 
Ack, sorry, it was my bug.  But on a sidenote: is there any way to mark a field in order for it to not be serialized? 
@omehegan : sorry, did the tests and forgot to post the results. I couldn't get builds to fail with JUnit, i redid the tests with xUnit instead  - same result after removing the `echo` step - a Jenkins failure isn't sent as a failure status to Gitlab. I did the test with and without `echo` step.

Hi @DaveCTurner ,   Thanks a lot for your answer.   And is there any command like `elasticsearch-traslog trim` for translog merge?  Because before merging all the translog ,my ES node recovey very slowly even can't start (too many open files.)
The difference seems to be Micrometer **tags**. The existing meter have the following name and tags: ``` MeterId{name='kafka.consumer.outgoing-byte-total', tags=[tag(client-id=kafka37-test-listener)]} ``` While the new meter has an extra tag: ``` MeterId{name='kafka.consumer.outgoing-byte-total', tags=[tag(client-id=kafka37-test-listener),tag(node-id=node--1)]} ``` This situation causes an exception here https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/implementations/micrometer-registry-prometheus/src/main/java/io/micrometer/prometheus/PrometheusMeterRegistry.java#L379  I don't know why and where it could be fixed.
@kalessil It becomes `static::staticBlock()->getTitle("CONTACTS")`
Correct, not using the GZIP option as of now.  Might be worth pointing out that we also set the dispatch interval to 0 as per the customers request (via tracker.setDispatchInterval()).  We saw this on a Pixel (1st generation) with 8.1.0 and a Nexus 6P with 8.1.0 but did not actively test the scenario on other devices at the time.  Currently we don't have a minimal example available, if I find the time to create one I'll add it here.

I ve noticed it when we have 2 tabs. The "left" one is scrollable (since theres content) and the "right" one is empty,(maybe only the first card over the image).  I will bring you an example ASAP. 
It works somewhat, though I had to modify the `TokenClickStyle.Select` case a bit to toggle my button and not fall through to the `Delete` case.  Basically my custom Token view has a Button with `visibility:gone` and then in the `Select` case I toggle the visibility. 
@Scottmitch yeah adding allocator settings works fine for poolsubpage 
It is tested. Work like a charm. Thanks
I suspect it was introduced in the CECP code, so it should be fine in CE/FATCAT. 
It is in Eclipse (“Luna”) and could be reproduced easily with attached files. I am using beta 3, if you can’t reproduce it I guess it has been addressed in latest code. 
I'm located in Croatia. I experienced the same issue in Czech Republic. It seems that content country does not have impact. It was working fine until the last week.
I'm using Firefox 44.0, which doesn't show a date picker on the mentioned link. Chrome seems to support it, so it's probably just a browser incompatibility. 
Thanks Luis. I'm facing a problem though. The project that contains the `ParamFineGrainTest` depends on the parser so I can not use the `ParamFineGrainTest` in the parser without introducing a dependency cycle. Now Maven is complaining. Can we do something about this? 
When I simply open Terasology and click on Single Player nothing happen. When I open in terminal using ./run_linux.sh Single Player don't work either, but in console come out this error message that i gave. 
I think I have got to the bottom of this one and it looks like user error so I'm sorry for wasted time.  I've just noticed I had duplicate broker Things point to the same MQTT Broker and I think I was getting a discovery result for the same topic on each broker Thing e.g:  ``` 2019-07-29 22:17:18.919 [me.event.InboxRemovedEvent] - Discovery Result with UID 'mqtt:homeassistant:mymqttbroker:0x0017880103c929a5_linkquality_sensor' has been removed.  2019-07-29 22:17:21.539 [me.event.InboxRemovedEvent] - Discovery Result with UID 'mqtt:homeassistant:broker:0x0017880103c929a5_linkquality_sensor' has been removed. ```  Closing.
Updated main post, it seems to fail converting the List. The List I return is made of Object. Hawtio version : 1.2-M24 The values are String. 
@erdemguven   Hi, I am using Nexus 5  Android 6  I select the media with multi audio then pause in demo app then seeking with scrubber to end of stream  you will see ENDED is not fired  only if you select play it will be fired  in hls media without multi audio seek to end will be ended with ended event  it happens also in other  multi audio streams we have   10x GIlad.  
Sorry I have restarted traccar and now the idling times have changed and yes the dives report thier positions properly.I will take a close look and see whether  the idling time gets updated.Thanks again. 
the version of my git is 2.17.2 I follow the "Batch Import from Knowledge Base" of the document (https://sap.github.io/vulnerability-assessment-tool/vuln_db/tutorials/vuln_db_tutorial/#batch-import-from-knowledge-base)   run `bash import_vulas_kb.sh http://localhost:8033/backend/` can see the error @Naramsim 
I can not change version because it is an automatic installation of omgserv
Thanks for fixing this issue so quickly. :)
@paoloantinori just create any integration, e.g. Db->Db and publish it. `ActivationHandler` is checking with `isBuildStarted` [method](https://github.com/rhuss/syndesis/blob/9c51ce8ed5cf19e24c2be24747db7534ee2f6b95/app/rest/openshift/src/main/java/io/syndesis/openshift/OpenShiftServiceImpl.java#L140-L143) and expcetion is thrown from client.  But you should get in touch with @iocanel that already started to investigate also.
It happens with directory icons. See video. When I scroll down and after scroll up, icons have changed.   [bug_in_folder_icons.mp4.zip](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123/FilePickerLibrary/files/60426/bug_in_folder_icons.mp4.zip) 
Here is the video of it working, it seems like it is an issue that only crops up just after install. Now (as you can see in the video it DOES update itself on the apt-get-update-periodic task.  https://erayan.com/shared/2016-02-08_17-53-33.mp4  So it seems something is off with the timing on time of install. 
Aha, I wouldn't guess to look there :) You are right, it's a Java error :  !ENTRY fr.univnantes.termsuite.ui 4 0 2016-11-23 11:18:08.196 !MESSAGE An error occurred during alignment !STACK 0 java.lang.NullPointerException 	at eu.project.ttc.utils.AlignerUtils.translateVector(AlignerUtils.java:75) 	at eu.project.ttc.engines.BilingualAligner.translateWithDico(BilingualAligner.java:326) 	at eu.project.ttc.engines.BilingualAligner.alignDistributional(BilingualAligner.java:150) 	at eu.project.ttc.engines.BilingualAligner.align(BilingualAligner.java:219) 	at fr.univnantes.termsuite.ui.services.impl.AlignmentServiceImpl.align(AlignmentServiceImpl.java:213) 	at fr.univnantes.termsuite.ui.menu.AlignHandler$1.run(AlignHandler.java:71) 	at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)

Hey Mario,  The 5 calls are not problematic - I'm actually loading 5 different content types for our home screen. It's those content space and content type querying calls that are strange, because I'm always passing the explicit content type to load.  For example, this is how I'm loading the whole content type:  ```         ObserveQuery<CDAEntry> query = mContentfulClient.observe(CDAEntry.class)                 .where("content_type", contentTypeId)                 .where("locale", mConfigurationManager.getSupportedTranslationLocaleIETFString());          if (filterKey != null && filterValue != null) {             mLogger.debug("using filter key = " + filterKey + ", value = " + filterValue);             query.where(filterKey, filterValue);         }          return query.all(); ```  As I said, I do this for those 5 different content types, so I would expect 5 different calls like this, but not 15.
As a first step, changing the error message is enough for us. 
Well, this is interesting. I reinstalled the 2169 and I can't reproduce the freeze problem anymore 🤔 I cleared the logs & caches multiple times before the updates, so I don't have the logs unfortunately =/ I'll send you the logs if I can reproduce the freezing again, sorry =/ And thanks! 😅
No , never.  Do you have a estimated time for a fix-update? because everyone in HCF needs to make pots.  Thanks :)

Hi, it was on iOS wallet.
No, just tanks, engines and satellite bay. 
I have no idea why it would be `null`, but this is happening long after server initialization.
Hi,  ```    Setup a simple server with web-server mod only, after this, at ```  client side, do the following:  ```         1. Execute "bus.send('test', {})": server handler at "test" ```  address will receive the message             2. Execute "bus.send('test', { sessionID: 'test' })": server handler at "test" address won't receive the message.  ```     The above won't happen if auth-mgr is deployed and requires_auth is ```  false for the address. This is actually a workaround but, IMO, pretty misleading.  ```      In my project, I removed the auth-mgr deployment and all of a ```  sudden no message as getting passed just because I was using the sessionID attribute... as the cause and effect is not trivial, it took me hours of dev 'till I could find out what as going on...  Cheers...

This issue still occurs using most current version form curse
Here is an example. login object is parsed as null when header is Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 but works when header is Content-Type: application/json I got around it by changing the client library (okhttp).  Controller.     public Response login(models.Login login) {  Model. Excluding getters and setters public class Login {     String usr;     String pwd;  Headers: Accept: _/_ Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 POST body: {"usr":"someuser", "pwd":"test"} 
Example: 5v5 are playing / Time elapsed 05:00 - Anyone drop connection/have lagg then disconnect and join again. After this, when he join again his team, nobody the server can see him. 
I have Windows 10. No, I don't use remote terminal, it's locally. Before open properties tab, you must resize DBeaver to small window and then open properties with columns to see bug. 
Well, I have the editor open, putting the cursor to arbitrary position reveals the outline to the right node. Thus, the locationmap must be valid somehow. But when I right-click and call getElementsAt it's empty for some reason. In other EMFText-generated editors the same scenario works as expected. With "between two parse runs" you mean just right before another parse run? I assume a parse run is only initiated as a consequence of ocurred changes, isn't it? In this case I must answer with no because I'm just selecting some text without changing something. 
I've build jar with `nobody`. Here it is https://bintray.com/artifact/download/thestigger/generic/elasticsearch-mesos-scheduler-1.0.0-withDependencies.jar Or you can build by your own.

My code works with any Java debugging. Please try and tell me if it works for you. To benefit with this mining, ypu must enable `Show variable values inline while debugging` from the `Code Mining` prefernces page.

Hi @davidecaroselli ,  Thanks for your reply.  Running: ` extras/javamain.sh PreprocessorMain -s en -t ja <<< "Open your web browser and go to the Fresh Cloud website: <codeph>http://fresh.cloud.com</codeph>" ` returned:  `Open your web browser and go to the Fresh Cloud website : <codeph> http://fresh.cloud.com </codeph> `  This looks fine.   Trying the second command is a bit tricky in a Multilingual engine setup.   I am not sure if I can pass -s and -t parameters in a Multilingual engine. Is this possible? If not, then I think this should be added to the translate command.  I tried, and it didn't work though.   I used this one instead though:  `curl -X GET http://localhost:8045/translate \      -d "source=en" \      -d "target=ja" \      -d "q=Open your web browser and go to the Fresh Cloud website: <codeph>http://fresh.cloud.com</codeph>" \      -d "engine=multilingual" \      | python -mjson.tool `  The output in node.log is: `2018-02-28 17:10:28,499 INFO  eu.modernmt.rest.RESTServer$Router [qtp41465-657] "GET /translate?source=en&target=ja&q=Open your web browser and go to the Fresh Cloud website: <codeph>http://fresh.cloud.com</codeph>&engine=multilingual" 200 89`  Here is also a screen shot of the terminal output as well. In the terminal, the URL is malformed in Japanese.   Thanks again Davide for taking the time to look into this issue.

Take a look at the code I mentioned; these are hardcoded constants that are not influenced by the configuration.  This is a `@SpringBootApplication` with the `@Import(KatharsisConfigV3.class)` annotation.
> Does the same problem occur with JDK13 builds?  Yes, it happens with OpenJ9 JDK13 and doesn't happen with Hotspot JDK13. NPE is an aftereffect of other exceptions: `ClassCastException -> Method.invoke (InvocationTargetException) ->  NPE`. I will post more details in the context of Jython later. 
I tried to refresh whole workspace, but it did not help and double-checked that all projects exist. Unfortunately there is nothing in the Eclipse error log (checked both view and log file on disk). If you do not have any clue what the problem is, I could try to compile and debug the plugin from sources. 
It's almost like the CPU is being bogged down at consistent intervals. so if a video is playing the video playback will stutter slightly and resume. Audio is not affected. Same thing with Gifs, in which they will stutter slightly. I'll test it tomorrow and give you the timing. The problem is solved by ending the program with task manager.

I couldn't repro with regular hoppers, just the vacuum.
world.step(1 / 45f, 6, 2) each draw call.  I tried different approaches from here: http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/  Its every time the same and only occurs in release build. I also thought about that its maybe because the CPU/FPU have different behavior in floating point calculation.   But as you see in the video, thats a huge difference. Maybe a bug in Box2d JNI Wrapping? I try to debug trough  NDK to examine, where it comes from, but im not familiar with debugging with NDK and JNI.   Maybe important is, that it seems working sometimes the first 10 seconds and only affect rotation forces -> if something is tilt. 
I didn't look at the code too good but yea you must be doing something wrong, this just fixed it for me  
Using Forge 13.20.0.2285, LittleTiles version 1.4.8. This is on 1.11.2 of Minecraft. Basically use the hammer to make blocks into the little tiles blocks (i did 16x16x16 in the hammer) place those blocks down and then break those blocks with a vanilla pickaxe and you get 2 blocks when you break the block.
Yes, that's one option. The other is to list the top n developers in the about box of the app. I'm not sure where to put the cut off (top 5, top 10, top 20?), so maybe in the meantime we do as you suggest and possibly come back to it later.
I don't have neither of both. If I reinstall the app, is it possible   to recover the data that is anywhere in the memory phone?   Thanks  Citando OliE <notifications@github.com>:  > Did you have a backup or a CSV export? > >  This is already fixed in the latest dev build. > > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub[1], or mute the thread[2].

Just added you to a circle, if you add back you can select me to start a hangout and it'll ring me. Similar to Skype. It's also a messenger for quick stuff. 
Thanks for explaining.  From your comment and a little bit of back and forth in chat, it now sounds like we should do the following in Titan:  Vertex features: - supportsNumericIds=true - supportsUserSuppliedIds=[value of graph.set-vertex-id in the underlying config] - all other vertex feature support methods, including supportsCustomIds=false  Edge features: - supportsCustomIds=true (because edges are identified by a specific non-numeric, non-UUID, non-String relation ID type) - all other edge feature support methods=false

Where can I download snapshot version? I'll try to test on Tuesday, but since I encountered these issues on our production server, I might not be able to repeat them on our QA server, where I would install the snapshot.

It is under my fork of TeclaAccess under the SEP branch. The error occurs in the check for whether SEP is running in TeclaPrefs.java (line 765 - 770)  Here's the link to the repo. https://github.com/k22mak/TeclaAccess/tree/SEP 
It's overworld. superflat .redstone ready,and I also got this once at a another normal world Though I think it may has something to do with forgotton nature too. Forgotton nature seems override the worldprovider or something of overworld and didn't register it correctly. It always cause Dimention door got crashed and make Biosphere can't generate any world(if I install forgotton nature after biosphere,the exist biosphere world will not generate any new area). And sometimes it say that it can't find a spawn-biome for unknown reason.(especilly start a new myscraft dim, but didn't affect anything else) But I didn't found anything with forggon nature. So I am not sure about that. 
Works with the dev version of `{rstudioapi}`, thanks ✅
That's a great guess, but I've already compiled most, if not all, of my static dependencies PIC.  I'm out sick today, but one example is that dyld won't be able to find the shared library for gtest-main.  Bizzarrely, that's a Bazel-built shared library completey unrelated to the other dependecy with the static child (which happens to be gRPC).  So in this unit test example:  ''' cc_test( ...   deps = [    "gtest-main",    "gRPC", # depends on static foo.a   ], )  ... the so for gtest-main will not be found unless I set linkstatic=1 on gRPC.  Strange but true.  
@h3xstream  In some cases we will not have compiled classes available for java files. In this case we does not want to fail the sonar analysis and continue with the WARNING message from findbugs. 
```  hi josh,  can you verify if the server_init action is a python program. also can you check if the first init finishes completly. the issue might be, that if you send a command via mdsip requesting a reply. the server will try to interrupt the task once the client disconnects. in case of a python program it will eventually mess up the python GIL which will cause a subsequent task to get stuck trting to acquire it. if you do not intend to stick around for the reply. can you check this by instead of exoting the first mdsip, putting ctrl+z it and bg it to a background process. alternatively, you could just wait for the task to finish before exit. does it still get stuck on the second try? ``` The thing being called is a TDI fun which writes a file. It does complete Waiting before exiting does not help  The behavior is seen if the client (doing the dispatch on the node) is TCL, Tree.Tcl, or Node.dispatch().    The behavior is always fine if the dispatching program stays running.

My code looks something like that:  ```Java switch (inputFormat) { 	case ImageFormat.NV21: 		imageFrame = new Frame(width, height, Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE, 2);  		// This results in a wrong output, it only works if I set it to avutil.AV_PIX_FMT_NONE 		pixelFormat = avutil.AV_PIX_FMT_NV21; 		break; 	case ImageFormat.FLEX_RGB_888: 		imageFrame = new Frame(width, height, Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE, 3); 		pixelFormat = avutil.AV_PIX_FMT_RGB24; 		break; 	case ImageFormat.FLEX_RGBA_8888: 		imageFrame = new Frame(width, height, Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE, 4); 		pixelFormat = avutil.AV_PIX_FMT_RGBA; 		break; }  [...]  ffmpegRecorder.record(imageFrame, pixelFormat); ```  When the inputFormat is NV21 then setting the pixelFormat to AV_PIX_FMT_NV21 results in a wrong output as you can see here:  ![wrong-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1509163/30374272-96e0d142-9884-11e7-9c67-78dcee66d910.png)  However, when I change the pixelFormat to AV_PIX_FMT_NONE in this case then everything looks normal. Therefore I think this block in [FFmpegFrameRecorder](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv/blob/master/src/main/java/org/bytedeco/javacv/FFmpegFrameRecorder.java#L880)...  ```Java if (pixelFormat == AV_PIX_FMT_NONE) { 	if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE || depth == Frame.DEPTH_BYTE) && channels == 3) { 		pixelFormat = AV_PIX_FMT_BGR24; 	} else if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE || depth == Frame.DEPTH_BYTE) && channels == 1) { 		pixelFormat = AV_PIX_FMT_GRAY8; 	} else if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_USHORT || depth == Frame.DEPTH_SHORT) && channels == 1) { 		pixelFormat = ByteOrder.nativeOrder().equals(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN) ? 				AV_PIX_FMT_GRAY16BE : AV_PIX_FMT_GRAY16LE; 	} else if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE || depth == Frame.DEPTH_BYTE) && channels == 4) { 		pixelFormat = AV_PIX_FMT_RGBA; 	} else if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE || depth == Frame.DEPTH_BYTE) && channels == 2) { 		pixelFormat = AV_PIX_FMT_NV21; // Android's camera capture format 		step = width; 	} else { 		throw new Exception("Could not guess pixel format of image: depth=" + depth + ", channels=" + channels); 	} } ```  ...might needs to be changed to:  ```Java if (pixelFormat == AV_PIX_FMT_NONE) { 	if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE || depth == Frame.DEPTH_BYTE) && channels == 3) { 		pixelFormat = AV_PIX_FMT_BGR24; 	} else if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_UBYTE || depth == Frame.DEPTH_BYTE) && channels == 1) { 		pixelFormat = AV_PIX_FMT_GRAY8; 	} else if ((depth == Frame.DEPTH_USHORT || depth == Frame.DEPTH_SHORT) && channels == 1) { 		pixelFormat = ByteOrder.nativeOrder().equals(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN) ?

Ok, so i gathered some info. The pigman that made me crash was in the nether, and the crashed happened while I was in the overworld close to my nether portal (so it was probably loaded with the vanilla portal check thinghy [ I bet it's not relevant]). So I went to the nether and next to that position there was a blight pigman, but he also was a Infernal Mob from atomicstriker's mod. About retrying to play... I might do that later, but I downgraded the version to the previous one and haven't crashed since (been playing for ~1h). Here's the culprit maybe: ![2020-02-26_16 33 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41645690/75380580-0a667380-58b6-11ea-8838-0a4de738ea26.png) 
Need to think about this a bit more. I think the difference might be that we call loginSilent on each API call, allowing the underlying auth client to decide whether to get from cache or make a network call. In your example you call getSession() which I think would always be static.  The pattern we use is based on the pattern for ADAL recommended by @vibronet - call acquireTokenSilent every time and let the lib decide what to do.

Hi Snickermicker,  I understand the workaround. The problem is with this items configuration: DateTime Date   "Date and Time: [%1$tA, %1$td.%1$tm.%1$tY %1$tT]" { ntp="Europe/Berlin:de_DE", knx="11.001:5/1/2, 10.001:5/1/1" }  The config transmits the time to the knx binding at a set inderval.  This results in formatDateTime(DateTimeType dateType, String dpt) receiving dpt 10.001 with the (line 579) Calendar cal=dateType.getCalendar(); calendar instance fully populated. And from this it is supposed to extract and format a TIMEOFDAY, which according to knx documentation also includes a day of week.  When the code then uses 'if (cal.get(Calendar.MONTH)==2)' to exclude the day of week formatting, it fails in March in my example since March is month 2.  10.001 might not have any date information, but in order to calculate the day of week in formatDateTime for TIMEOFDAY, there needs to be room for a fully populated calendar instance. Hence using the calendar.month for flagging 'no-day' should maybe reconsidered. If the case was that the calendar never had any date information, then (line 584)return dateType.format(Locale.US, "%1$ta, %1$tT"); might as well be removed.  I might be overlooking something here, so please just consider this my observation and correct me if i am wrong  :) 
Hi Dan, thanks for the quick acknowledgement. No crash dialog or prompt to submit a report. Seeing this on an Honor 10 and on a Mediapad M5 8.4. It only occurs if I try to check a box without first tapping elsewhere to bring up the keyboard. If I bring up the keyboard, dismiss it, then try to check the checkbox it works as expected. Not sure if it'll help but I can try watching adb logcat while it and see if anything useful appears.
Example project at https://github.com/Artur-/spring-tutorial  Tested in Eclipse by  1. Launching `TutorialApplication` (Run as -> Java Application)  2. Opening http://localhost:8080/ in a browser 3. Adding a newline to `TutorialApplication.java` and save to force an application reload  If you add a breakpoint on `NotSerializableException` you will see it happening and how it gets to the logger, which ignores it   There is no `ClassCastException` on startup in this example, so that one is probably related to where in the serialization chain the problem occurs

I have not installed any set up file in my PC. I have opened the code in NETBEANS and run the project. I inserted the breakpoint in GT06Protocol. But it is not getting called.  What do i need to do for me to debug the Live data sent from device to the project running in NETBEANS. Is it possible.  Regarding tracker-server.log ......after installation of setup file only it is updating.....but when i run the project in NETBEANS ...there is not log file created. 
I think the most recently added should be the most specific.  It already has a pater of default overrriding so I would follow that  So adding them to the head of the list seems best to me 
Sure. The main issue is the "jump" handling when you need to go more than one item forward on any side. My previous code example represents case when I need to set 6th index active by default right after component initialization. Basically it can't jump from 0 item to 6 in this case, instead it will set item with index 1 as active.   I've slightly updated sample code with this block for component init: ``` final InstaDotView instaDotView = findViewById(R.id.instadot); instaDotView.setNoOfPages(20); instaDotView.setVisibleDotCounts(7); page = 6; instaDotView.onPageChange(page); counter.setText(String.valueOf(page)); ``` This code will result in: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3258374/34249682-45be54da-e643-11e7-9692-f87ca41e0bf6.png)  Root of the issue is in the `setupFlexibleCirclesRight` and `setupFlexibleCirclesLeft` methods, they will make a jump only one dot further regardless of actual difference between current and previous indexes because of:  ``` dotsList.get(position + 1).setState(Dot.State.ACTIVE); //setupFlexibleCirclesRight ... dotsList.get(position - 1).setState(Dot.State.ACTIVE); //setupFlexibleCirclesLeft ``` Technically, listed blocks related to "jump from the edge" cases only. Jump from other positions in the middle does not work either.

Hello @icbaker and thanks for the help. I am upgrading from 2.10.4 -> 2.11.0. I did not have any issues creating signed APKs before, so those messages are new to me. I am only adding the ui and core to my project:  `implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-core:2.11.0'` `implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-ui:2.11.0'`  I have just tried enabling R8 instead of ProGuard, and I was able to create a signed APK without issues. Though, I favor ProGuard because it handles one aspect better. Note that I am only playing offline files on my app.  Does the demo app use R8 or ProGuard?
Hi @pascalav, thanks for looking into this, and for your detailed analysis.  First, I don't think we want to change any of the logic around when `isValid` is called, primarily because the existing `of` and `with` methods have a specific contract, which always returns a valid `InterledgerAddress`.   Here's a summary of the current naming conventions:  *  `Interface.of()` methods are like a constructor, whereby you supply all of the required fields to construct an object, and you get a fully-constructed, valid, immutable object back (typically a static-method on the Interface). * `Interface.from()` methods are like a factory-method, whereby you supply some "raw materials" that can be used to derive everything necessary to call `.of()` (typically a static-method on the Interface). * `Interface.with()` methods are called on an already-constructed object, append some information or data, and return a a fully-constructed, valid, immutable object (typically a non-static or default method on the Interface or abstract implementation of an interface). Note that most interfaces in Quilt do not have a "with" method, because most objects are not appendable in the way `InterledgerAddress` is. * `Interface.builder()` methods return an instance of an immutables-project-generated builder that can be used to mutate data before actual construction. For example, `InterledgerAddressBuilder`. * `*Builder.from()`: This has a specific meaning in immutables-project-generated builders. See [here](http://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#builder).   With that in mind, `InterledgerAddress#of` is  meant to function more like a constructor, and _not_ like a builder. In other words, when you call "of", you will receive a complete, fully-valid `InterledgerAddress`. Likewise, the contract for `InterledgerAddress#with` will always start with a valid `InterledgerAddress` and result in a new ILP address with an additional suffix.  Thus, in order to accomplish something closer to the builder-pattern that you identified above (where callers can append portions of an ILP address before actual construction) we have several options:  1. Do nothing. Force callers to construct their ILP address as a String before calling `InterledgerAddress#of`.   1. Extend the builder generated by Immutables to support this functionality, and then just have developers call `InterledgerAddress#builder`, and use that thing with the new "just append a part of your ILP address" extension method (Unfortunately, I don't think [Immutables](immutables.github.io) supports this in the builder out of the box, but it might worth investigating. If you can't easily customize the generated builders, perhaps it would be worth logging an enhancement in the immutables project). 1. Define our own custom builder that extends the Immutables-generated builder, and is then returned from the static method `InterledgerAddress#builder`.  Overall, I haven't run into a case where I've wanted to gradually assemble an ILP address using the `InterledgerAddress` or `InterledgerAddressBuilder` classes. Instead, a much more common use-case I've encountered is where I have an ILP prefix String (already assembled) that might look like, `g.us.foo.`, and I need to append an account to it (e.g., "myaccount"), so I will often only be doing this:  ``` // prefix is an already-assembled ILP address containing "g.us.foo." void doSomething(InterledgerAddress prefix){    InterledgerAddress myAccount = ilpAddress.with("myaccount");    // ...  } ```  With all that said, I vote for Option 1 above, since I've never encountered a use-case for option 2 or 3 and it's not clear if Option 2 is even possible.  Thoughts?

So in my UI designer, a workaround for this issue is to add a menu in the first index like so: - New Menu - Menu1 - Menu2 - Menu3 ...  Then I re-size the New Menu to zero (not null, sorry for the confusion) and then the font is fixed. Just a simple workaround.

Here is the checkbox:  ``` xml <carbon.widget.CheckBox                 android:id="@+id/coordinates_check"                 android:layout_width="wrap_content"                 android:layout_height="wrap_content"                 android:layout_below="@id/description_field"                 android:layout_marginLeft="16dp"                 android:layout_marginTop="24dp"                 android:checked="false"                 android:drawablePadding="16dp"                 android:paddingLeft="0dp"                 android:text="@string/activity_add_check_coordinates"                 android:textAllCaps="true"                 android:textColor="@color/stone_normal"                 android:textSize="14sp"                 app:carbon_fontPath="Roboto-Medium.ttf"                 app:carbon_tint="@drawable/checkbox_color" /> ```  And here is the selector:  ``` xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">     <item android:color="@color/carrot_normal" android:state_checked="true" />     <item android:color="@color/stone_normal" /> </selector> ```  I have tried almost all states in selector but nothing seemed to work. The only solution I have found so far is to change the theme of that particular activity containing checkbox and include colorControlNormal and colorControlHighlight colors like that:  ``` xml <style name="AppTheme.AddActivity" parent="AppTheme">         <item name="colorControlNormal">@color/stone_normal</item>         <item name="android:colorControlHighlight">@color/stone_normal</item>         <item name="android:statusBarColor">@color/spring_dark</item>     </style> ```  Now my checkbox has gray borders while unchecked and accent color fill while checked. I've managed to reach necessary behavior but it seems a bit wrong way for me.  
Yes, it's only on first and second characters. No, **I saw this problem only in markor todo list.**  This problem only happen after horizontal lines be visible. Before horizontal lines appears, the letters view are correct.   
Here is a trivial example. Just change the version in the pom.xml file to make it work/fail  [dummy.zip](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/files/1788627/dummy.zip) 
Android 5.1.1, Samsung Galaxy J3.  For me, any use of the back key—either in the app or on the phone—works as previously described.  Not sure how to figure out whether it's my phone or a bug.

I'm sorry. ```java  @Column(name = "USER_ID") private Long userId; ``` ```xml spring.shardingsphere.sharding.tables.my_friend.table-strategy.inline.sharding-column=USER_ID spring.shardingsphere.sharding.tables.my_friend.table-strategy.inline.algorithm-expression=my_friend_$->{USER_ID % 10} ``` Looks ok, but error: `java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke method mod() on null object`  Now let's change that: ```xml spring.shardingsphere.sharding.tables.my_friend.table-strategy.inline.sharding-column=USER_ID spring.shardingsphere.sharding.tables.my_friend.table-strategy.inline.algorithm-expression=my_friend_$->{user_id % 10} ``` run well.  The issues is simply that inline.algorithm-expression don't support uppercase.  It's a minor problem, It just doesn't look consistent. 
I will try this later today, thank you.
Hi elharo, to answer your questions:  1. Were you using Maven or an Eclipse native project? Eclipse native project - like this: a. Click the Google Cloud Platform icon - Create New Project - Google App Engine Standard  b. Enter Project name, Java package (nothing else) - click Finish c. Deploy the generated HelloAppEngine  - works fine d. Modify the generated HelloAppEngine as shown in my original post - with a reference to Query.Filter e. Deploy again - it fails  2. Did you try deploying this app with gcloud from the command line? Yes, I tried like this - but it still throws the error: ``` cd D:\path-to-eclipse-workspace\my-project gcloud app deploy src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\appengine-web.xml -v v1 ``` 3. What other imports did you need? No other imports - just the standard template project - and added the imports for Query: `import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Query;` I attached my java class.  [HelloAppEngine.java.txt](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-eclipse/files/1844431/HelloAppEngine.java.txt)  Thanks!    
Hi,  I have this in my code:  ``` 	@ApiImplicitParams({ 		@ApiImplicitParam(name = "apiKey", value = "User's api key", required = true, dataType = "string", paramType = "query"), 	}) 	@GET 	@Path("languages") 	@Produces("application/json;charset=UTF-8") 	List<Language> getLanguages() throws Exception; ``` This is what I get in the swagger.json: ``` "\/languages" : {       "get" : {         "tags" : [ "GavagaiApi" ],         "summary" : "This method returns all supported languages.",         "description" : "This method returns all supported languages",         "operationId" : "resource_GavagaiApi_getLanguages_GET",         "produces" : [ "application/json" ],         "parameters" : [ ... ``` No matter what I do, I cannot get the generated swagger.json to change the "produces" value to include the charset. Consequently, when I do my call, I get this:  `curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'https://localhost:8180/v3/languages'`  and my api responds with  `{"message":"Please use application/json;charset=UTF-8 for Accept header.","resultCode":"NOT_ACCEPTABLE"}`  Thanks. 
I'm using 2.6.13 quest world Spigot 1.12.2 When I set the money reward and the xp reward ,when the quest is done for example catch 5 fish = reward 200 money and 10 exp  Clicked the auto claim  When I finish the quest fish it says you finished the quest but there's no reward. Neither message where it says you got 200 money and 10 exp 
It would have the same effect, of course. But it's not my understanding of clean code and working efficiency to (un-)comment multiple lines of code instead of using one constant for it.  That's why there exists Hugo, isn't it? At least it would have the same effect to do a manually log in each method too. But it's not as clean and useful as the @DebugLog approach. 
I was referring the the double-blind problem we discussed. 
As far as I'm aware there doesn't seem to come up anything special in console when it happens.
Hi @mzelzoghbi, Thanks for investigation. In our case, we use a foreground service (that must have its own notification)(not really sure that there is a difference in this case). We are pretty sure that the problem is several processes because we started getting crash reports with this issue right after releasing an app version with the foreground service. It is 30 times more frequent than the next reason in our top crash reasons list.

I'm implementing actions for Ashley. I want to keep the possibility and syntax of adding parallel events to entities just like its done with gdx actor events where you can write things like  actor.addAction(action1); actor.addaction(action2);  and they will work together as parallel actions.  In my implementation there's one ActionComponent and one AcionSystem. You can add an action to an entity with this kind of syntax  Actions.moveTo(entity, x, y, duration);  The static method adds the logic to the ActionComponent, but before doing it, it checks if the entity already has the ActionComponent and ads one if it hasn't. So turns out if I add 2 actions to an entity in a row, the second one won't know that the previous one already scheduled the ActionComponent creation and instead of adding only logic to the scheduled component, it will schedule a new component creation and overwrite previous one.

Sorry, it seems to be my fault. I made new pairing with my miband and the sync started to work after that. Curios that the alarm was working without that.  Update: The problem is that you cannot use both apps (Gadgetbridge and Mi Fit). The tracking data get lost after using Mi Fit so Gadgetbridge can't update it. 
No mixing, this happens in my dev workspace. Apparently a type's name is null, but I don't know why.
Hello Paul,  thank you for your quick reply. I have tried to build the library yesterday for the first time, so I cannot say, if it was already happening before.   Best regards,  Joerg

Sorry about that, I thought the related PR has already been merged. Doing it now...
@sunix I added error to the description.
Looks like 3.0.2 
Looks like it only happens when `git-as-svn` detects a new Gitlab repo (branch) that should be exposed via svn. If I restart the daemon the error won't appear again.
No, I didn't! I haven't worked with jni before and wasn't aware I had to recompile it manually.   Anyway, I recompiled and now it seems to be working, thanks! 
If you made changes after the release, then it probably is fixed.  I'll test it later this week when I get chance to get the most recent source.    Thanks,  Dana 
The full query would be something like select top 10   'smth' + dp_id + 'smthelse' as thumbnail,           'this' + access_url+ 'that' as download from ivoa.ObsCore  where dp_id is a varchar (a custom column not part of the obscore standard),  and access_url is a CLOB. 
I'll test it an give an feedback. Is there already a plan when the version appears?

@ahmedaljazzar It's okay if I use directly `setLocale(locale, context)`. Restart activity with correct language. But when I use ChangeLanguageDialog, restart activity with current language. Nothing has changed. Still showing current language in language dialog in next time activity launch.
Ok, i've checked. When i've tried to use FirebaseAuth directly with the same ActionCodeSettings — everything was ok. I've received correct sign-in link on my email.
I cannot check that because the download link in README now returns 404. 
Yes, other running Jenkins-jobs (not on my local machine) are deploying artifacts to this channel. It seems, the index-files of some channels becomes irregular after this exception. I tried several times to rebuild the channel-metadatas also with restarting package-drone, nothing seems to help. So I have to clear the influenced channels completely and redeploy all artifacts. I returned to the 0.10.0m2 after this problems yesterday, where all channels (after complete rebuild) are working now (but with slow deployment).

SCOM is a monitoring framework made by Microsoft and similar to Nagios. I wrote a SCOM agent which logs into the scheduler and submits a job to verify that everything works properly. 
The content label is used when `DialogPane#contentText` is set, but `DialogPane#content` is not set. The content label is created in `DialogPane#createContentLabel` with this code:          Label label = new Label(text);         label.setMaxWidth(Double.MAX_VALUE);         label.setMaxHeight(Double.MAX_VALUE);         label.getStyleClass().add("content");         label.setWrapText(true);         label.setPrefWidth(360);         return label;  Current code from `ExceptionDialog`:      // --- content     String contentText = getContentText();     Label contentLabel = new Label(contentText != null && ! contentText.isEmpty() ? contentText : exception.getMessage());     contentLabel.setWrapText(true);     dialogPane.setContent(contentLabel);  I don't understand, why reading content text here. The code is taken from constructor, so content text can not be set at this point. Why creating a new label?  I would code this:      // --- content     setContentText(exception.getLocalizedMessage());  Also I use `exception.getLocalizedMessage()` instead of `exception.getMessage()`.
Yes, i tried, and also deactivated themes, but same result.  Some friends have same issue on Linux
@tsmaeder I see this in both Che 5.10.0 and Che 5.14.0
@marcphilipp Thanks a lot! It works as expected now. As a side effect the config's error tolerance has been changed. The next example has passed the test in the past but fails now (see the lack of ampersand in the lastest value): ```java   @ParameterizedTest   @CsvSource({       "'1abc', '1abc'", // closed Strings       "'2abc', '2abc"   // last String unclosed (config error)   })   void eolInCsvSource(String in01, String in02) {     assertEquals(in01, in02);   } ```
The spaulders do not go into the slot, and I can load the world again. Seems like they disappear afterwards sometimes. 
DITA-OT 1.8.5, transtype pdf, pdf2 and pdf5 (AntennaHouse). 
This appears resolved in the latest branch. 
Running a quick test, not only can I confirm that I'm not calling the global registry to create an NPC, I'm [not calling the global registry _in my entire project_](https://i.imgur.com/kFFtBar.png).  The NPC is created within an `NpcController` abstract class which is shared amongst all my NPCs. The only difference between the type of NPC which is being saved to `saves.yml` and the others is that I'm using pathing for this kind.  **Creation in `NpcController`:** ```java     public NPC getNpc() {         if (this.npc == null) {             this.npc = getRegistry().createNPC(EntityType.PLAYER, this.getSkin());             this.npc.data().set(NPC.NAMEPLATE_VISIBLE_METADATA, false);             this.onNpcCreate(this.npc);         }         return this.npc;     }      protected abstract String getSkin();      protected void onNpcCreate(NPC npc) {      } ```  **`onNpcCreate` from Guard:** ```java     @Override     public void onNpcCreate(NPC npc) {         npc.getNavigator().getPathStrategy();         npc.getNavigator().getLocalParameters()                 .baseSpeed(0.8f)                 .pathDistanceMargin(0)                 .distanceMargin(0)                 .range(50);     } ```  **`updateNavigation` from Guard:** ```java     public void updateNavigation(boolean onSpawn) {         final GuardConfig config = this.getCachedConfig();         if (config.getPath().size() < 2) {             return;         }          if (config.getPath().size() <= this.goal + 1) {             this.goal = -1;         }          if (!onSpawn) {             this.ensureSpawned();         }          final NPC npc = this.getNpc();         if (npc.isSpawned()) {             npc.getNavigator().setTarget(config.getPath().get(++this.goal).toLocation(npc.getEntity().getWorld()));         }     } ```  Note that GuardConfig is entirely separate from NPCs. All I'm pulling from it is the predefined path for the NPCs to follow. Perhaps not the most elegant solution, but certainly nothing (that I can think of) which should be making any saves to the global configuration.  EDIT: To clarify again, GuardConfig is something stored elsewhere in the project. It's not something to do with NPCs that I've merely renamed.
You're welcome.  Sorry for the dep resolution problem, I have fixed it, you can pull. If having further problems or a fix which I should test, please call.....  Cheers Markus

We need to do synchronisation on a finer level since the eager update and the periodic refresh happen concurrently. There are rules associated with how the additional fields should be read from/write to that if future methods follow should fix the problems in general, provided that the client's physical clock is sufficiently accurate.  That's from what I reason about it at the moment but I could be wrong.

I ran the basic example today, without any modifications  ```java package com.sample.spoon;  public class App  { 	public static float test2=0; 	public static App a=null;     public void print()     {     	int test=20;     	     	String abc="";     	if(test>20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int" + test);     	} else {     		System.out.println( "Testing else" + test);     	}     	     	if(test<20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int second if" + test);     	}    	     }          private void print2()     {     	int test=20;     	if(test>20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int" + test);     	} else {     		System.out.println( "Testing else" + test);     	}     	     	if(test<20) {     		System.out.println( "Testing int second if" + test);     	}    	     } } ```  The Processor I defined is  ```java public class StatementProcessor extends AbstractProcessor<CtStatement>{ 	@Override 	public void process(CtStatement statement) { 		System.out.println(statement.toString()); 	} } ```  The way of calling the processor is main method ```java public class AppTest { 	public static void main(String[] args) {  		try { 			SpoonModel spooner = new SpoonModel().addSource(new File("src/main/java/com/sample/spoon/App.java")); 			spooner.process(StatementProcessor.class); 			spooner.print(new File("output/spoonedInstrument")); 		} catch (Exception e) { 			e.printStackTrace(); 		} 	} } ```  The output I get is given below:  ```java package com.sample.spoon;   public class App {     public static float test2 = 0;      public static com.sample.spoon.App a = null;      public void print() {         int test = 20;         java.lang.String abc = "";         if (test > 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int" + test));         }else {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing else" + test));         }         if (test < 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int second if" + test));         }     }      private void print2() {         int test = 20;         if (test > 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int" + test));         }else {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing else" + test));         }         if (test < 20) {             java.lang.System.out.println(("Testing int second if" + test));         }     } } ```  I guess without any changes/modifications the classpath import is still prefixed to System.out.println  I have observed an other issue with this.  The new out put file if you observe closely, The System.out.println(("There are two enclosing ()")) , instead of System.out.println("The proper syntax")
Hi,  sure, I will.   thanks Chris   edit: credentials sent!   The thing is: I don't think the account makes any difference.  The first screen on the android app requires the server url.  I enter here something like https://my-domain/nextcloud (no username, no password) - is this ok? As soon as I enter the url, I get the error "wrong username or password", but I did not enter such info. I don't even get to the point where I must authenticate.  thanks for your help!

When `shouldUseDummySurface` is returning false the ANR doesn't occur.
Sure ill will download developers latest and compile it, although build # 77 isnt that old 24-oct-2014 3:09:00  Here is a zip with my current permission, but as I said before they are the default ones,  https://www.dropbox.com/s/pkc5fq6mlizrtj1/Permissions.zip?dl=0) 
Yep, that makes sense. 
Thanks for the follow-up and questions.  Before deciding how the TCCL should be used - it would be useful (to me anyway) to understand why it was introduced in the first-place, especially for the logging-case.  Is there any brief write-up (other than in the following linked issues)?  History: `FeatureDetector` and `ClassUtils.isPresent` first learnt to be passed a `ClassLoader` in https://github.com/flyway/flyway/commit/8c800dfcb954840d52ab7c6c271e049162c301a7 and it seems issues #626 and #696 were drivers.  Before that the normal classloader was used.  I figured logging in Flyway code (and location/configuration of logging-apis) would be mostly an internal-affair, but I do notice that at one point logging was moved from the internal to public API - maybe to support extension and plugins (I'm not familiar-enough with Flyway to know)?  Note that `LogCreator` and all of `LogFactory` is static.  If it is allowed to be deployed to a shared-classloader and called by multiple applications/modules with their context-classloaders, we could end-up with a race where the first-caller to `getLog` brings their available logging-API.  So in-summary, I'm interested in knowing what the TCCL provides here.  Maybe it is access to resource configuration-files for the logging API that only exist in the child/context classloader.  Just seems like for something as fundamental as logging, Flyway should be self-sufficient within its own classloader.
Much better, thanks! 
Eu uso Virtual Devices... testei nos modelos Nexus 5 e Pixel na API 17 e ambos ocorre o problema. ![erro_api_17_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41294201/42761471-0dc4e4c4-88e4-11e8-95d8-bc78248c16c1.png) 
yeah for me it did; some pics will follow once I'm in the corresponding situation 
Thank you for your response. In the server logs I can't see anything interesting, just a bunch of failed parsed messages:  ``` 2015-02-06T14:32:30.144+01:00 ERROR [GelfCodec] Could not parse JSON! com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unexpected character ('<' (code 60)): expected a valid value (number, String, array, object, 'true', 'false' or 'null') ```  The issue seems to appear in some days, usually is gets back to normal when the index is deflected. We have 30 indices with 20 mil entries each. 
The behavior should stay exactly the same. The binding is done according to the input name if there is no default value. It only means that we won't populate the expression if the author didn't specify it directly. 
There's really nothing. When I equip milk, it adds nothing.   `emilk` with milk being fmil1 -> `46 (+0)`  46 was my health when I tried it. 
Whoops, yeah that looks incomplete.  1. create a text field with index_phrases = true 2. create a custom search analyzer with the synonym_graph filter 3. Index something and do a query with the analyzer created above  (I'm currently on holiday away from my workstation, but the above should result in the error)  
> Can you check the latest snapshots?  Yeah sorry I forgot to specify that I did try with `2.1.3.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` and got the same result.
There were still some files left after uninstalling Popcorn Time, so that was the reason why installation failed. Managed to install it now. But now I get this message:  "Uhoh! You're using the wrong version of Popcorn Time for Android. The right version is being downloaded right now, if possible..."
@sourabh-joshi This fix should go out Monday.  Yes, I believe so.
Would it be possible to make the fishing rod knockback mechanic more of a projectile similar to snowballs instead of standard player hit? As it throws out Failed Combat Reach violations with NoCheatPlus and assuming other anti-cheat plugins when outside the standard sword hit range.
There exists a race condition (exhibited in the stack trace) where the service was started before the target is set. I can't reproduce it either, but from the code the race condition exists. 
That seems to have fixed it. That also explains the lack of errors in my program output window.  Thanks. Now to recreate my workspace and projects. 
Possible -- this wdl worked a month or two ago, on cromwell 22 or 23, maybe 24.
until now, staff members have been in the island top. I just recently gave the negative permission. The `is top` is only calculated when a player performs the command.
I tried bazel example projects and I got same error I tried this examples [examples](https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples)
My mistake, I am confused. Normaly those issues in the conversation are listed as issues here in github, and resolved in commits. But commits and open issues didn't list it. It's a philosophical question. Keep up the good work. ^^ 
It works fine without optifine ![2015-08-20_10 52 26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8294697/9388225/c62e18dc-4729-11e5-91fd-e6d9cbd9096e.png)  and It's AgriCraft-1.7.10-1.4.0-beta-1-1.7.10 
I can't run our server without sponge, as it's a live (production) server which people play regularly.  Also, it is difficult to reproduce the bug on purpose, although the bug was happening multiple times per day (10 on the day I entered this bug).  We had to remove Astral Sorcery to stabilize the server.  I'd like to report an issue to [SpongeForge's github](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeForge/issues/), but was wondering if you guys could give me some insight on what exactly to report.

Different device IDs. Thanks for checking it out!
I will check if some of my bundles are in waiting state later today. 
I've tried with the latest version 11.0.1, this issue is still there! And yes, it's responding on the fill area even if it has fill="none"!
Yea I was going to take a look into the code on the train  On 20 September 2016 at 15:39, Atomic Leopard notifications@github.com wrote:  > This looks like a pretty easy fix, it's just an assumption about the kinds > of throwable that propagates up.

It's happening here, on installation.save(...):  ``` void saveInstallation(final LocalInstallation installation) {      installation.save(new Model.Callback() {          @Override         public void onSuccess() { ... }          @Override         public void onError(final Throwable t) { ... }     }); } ```  We are calling it in our MainActivity, all this code is taken from the android example app: https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-component-push/blob/master/example/android/src/com/google/android/gcm/demo/app/DemoActivity.java  Running on Android 5.0.

I'm sorry for the delay for providing more information.  Most of our team's PCs are 32 bit and include a small ClassMate (and all team PCs are Windows 7).  I was happy GRIP ran on the ClassMate.  When you distributed GRIP v1.1.1 temporarily without 32 bit support I was able to borrow our 64 bit machine to continue evaluation of GRIP but now the 64 bit machine is being used elsewhere.  When I'm able to get the 64 bit machine again, I'll respond.  Or maybe you will distribute the 32 bit version before I am able to use the 64 bit machine.  Thanks. 
Either of the two Chisels do it - most items seem to cause it. I'm on Chisel 0.0.5.28 on MC 1.9.4.  [Here's a video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXHIMsA8Pw8&feature=youtu.be)  EDIT: Uploaded to YouTube, MP4 was too long for most services. 
This issue was reported by automated testing.  I never reproduct it too. Can we try  `expTable[((logTable[a] + logTable[b]) % (modulus - 1) + (modulus - 1)) % (modulus - 1)];` to solve the problem?
http://mcpeuniverse.com/texture_packs/0-13flows-hd-shader-music-v1-0-by-bdx/ I don't know if it caused it to use too much memory. It worked fine stand-alone, but when I opened Blocklauncher, it crashed. (No mods) It worked in safe-mode, I believe because when it is in safe-mode, no sounds are played. 
I don't think YCM causes this, because I looked into the YCM log(which I had attached above), and here is the formatted received message from jdt.ls by ycmd.      {         "jsonrpc": "2.0",         "method": "textDocument/publishDiagnostics",         "params": {             "diagnostics": [                 {                     "code": "570425421",                     "message": "The value of the field HomeController.datastoreService is not used",                     "range": {                         "end": {                             "character": 51,                             "line": 23                         },                         "start": {                             "character": 35,                             "line": 23                         }                     },                     "severity": 2,                     "source": "Java"                 },                 {                     "code": "570425394",                     "message": "LOGGER cannot be resolved",                     "range": {                         "end": {                             "character": 14,                             "line": 37                         },                         "start": {                             "character": 8,                             "line": 37                         }                     },                     "severity": 1,                     "source": "Java"                 }             ],             "uri": "file:///works/TestUnusedImports/src/main/java/com/halodu/HomeController.java"         }     }

I'm using kolab notes 2.0.8 on Android 6.0. The export function generates the following data: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><note xmlns="http://kolab.org" version="3.0"><uid>edcbad34-c93e-441a-b154-b0b3f96a46e3</uid><prodid>kolabnotes-java</prodid><creation-date>2016-06-20T13:25:11Z</creation-date><last-modification-date>2016-06-22T11:25:11Z</last-modification-date><classification>PUBLIC</classification><summary>Test</summary><description/><color/></note>`  I've looked at the code and found the following: - When choosing export from the menu, the `AsyncTask` named `ExportNotebook` from `OverviewFragment` is executed. - Here, in https://github.com/konradrenner/kolabnotes-android/blob/e8ac5992c78de6bd841986da425be9b500e48ed6/app/src/main/java/org/kore/kolabnotes/android/fragment/OverviewFragment.java#L1403, `NoteRepository.getFromNotebook(...)` is called to get the Notes from the Notebook. - Then, all columns from the note are loaded: https://github.com/konradrenner/kolabnotes-android/blob/e8ac5992c78de6bd841986da425be9b500e48ed6/app/src/main/java/org/kore/kolabnotes/android/content/NoteRepository.java#L165 - However, `cursorToNoteWithoutDescription(...)` is called: https://github.com/konradrenner/kolabnotes-android/blob/e8ac5992c78de6bd841986da425be9b500e48ed6/app/src/main/java/org/kore/kolabnotes/android/content/NoteRepository.java#L176 - ... which does not take into account the description attribute (the method name gives already a hint)! 
i used the messageCodec like this  ``` public class GameMessageCodec extends MessageToMessageCodec<ByteBuf, AbstractMessage<?>> {      private IMessageRecognizer<Player, Short> recognizer;      private final static Log log = Logs.get();      public GameMessageCodec(IMessageRecognizer<Player, Short> recognizer) {         this.recognizer = recognizer;     }      @Override     protected void encode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, AbstractMessage<?> msg, List<Object> out) throws Exception {         ByteBuf buf = ctx.alloc().buffer();         msg.setBuffer(buf);         msg.write();         out.add(buf);     }      @Override     protected void decode(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, ByteBuf in, List<Object> out) throws Exception {         if (in.readableBytes() < IMessage.HEADER_SIZE) {             return;         }         int expectLen = in.getInt(in.readerIndex());         int buffCurLen = in.readableBytes();         if (buffCurLen < expectLen) {             in.resetReaderIndex();             return;         }         int msgLen = in.readInt();         short msgType = in.readShort();         IMessage<Player> _msg = recognizer.createMessage(msgType);         if (_msg == null) {             log.errorf("msgType[%s] defund", msgType);             int msgContentLen = msgLen - IMessage.HEADER_SIZE;             if (0 < msgContentLen) {                 in.readBytes(msgContentLen);             }             return;         }         AbstractMessage<Player> _baseMsg = (AbstractMessage<Player>) _msg;         _baseMsg.setBuffer(in);         _baseMsg.read();         out.add(_baseMsg);     }  } ```  the initChannel method is this  ```     private static final LoggingHandler LOGGING_HANDLER = new LoggingHandler();         private final GameServerHandler SHARED = new GameServerHandler();     @Override     public void initChannel(SocketChannel ch) throws Exception {         ChannelPipeline pipeline = ch.pipeline();         pipeline.addLast("LOGGING_HANDLER", LOGGING_HANDLER);         pipeline.addLast(new GameMessageCodec(new SCMessageRecognizer()));         pipeline.addLast("handler", SHARED);         pipeline.addLast("heartHandler", new HeartHandler());     } ```  but i think it cased by this code  ``` pipeline.addLast("LOGGING_HANDLER", LOGGING_HANDLER); ``` 
Hmm it does not break molgenis, it only messes up the excel people download, so probably a feature, Il make a story for it. 3448 is in the backlog 
No jetifier. No MultiDex in release builds. Yes, the WorkManager is used by android-job. ProGuard in debug builds.   The crash happens on both debug and release builds.  Another example: ``` JobRequest.Builder("my_tag")     .setExecutionWindow(1, 1)     .setRequiredNetworkType(JobRequest.NetworkType.CONNECTED)     .setRequirementsEnforced(true)     .setUpdateCurrent(true)     .build()     .scheduleAsync() ``` produces: ``` java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No virtual method build()Landroidx/work/OneTimeWorkRequest; in class Landroidx/work/OneTimeWorkRequest$Builder; or its super classes (declaration of 'androidx.work.OneTimeWorkRequest$Builder' appears in /data/app/com.my.app-RZ1hW1OBMDqZinwQqxbSEw==/split_lib_dependencies_apk.apk)         at com.evernote.android.job.work.JobProxyWorkManager.plantOneOff(JobProxyWorkManager.java:54)         at com.evernote.android.job.JobManager.scheduleWithApi(JobManager.java:244)         at com.evernote.android.job.JobManager.schedule(JobManager.java:199)         at com.evernote.android.job.JobRequest.schedule(JobRequest.java:426)         at com.evernote.android.job.JobRequest$2.run(JobRequest.java:455)         at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1162)         at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:636)         at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:764) ```
@machour you can go ahead and take care of it if you dont mind.
> why don't you use an HTTP lib to download?  Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean? What should I be doing? This is just the way I always see to do it
I have verified that this issue has been resolved. 
No, I did not rotate the images in CEWE. There are rotated fotos in the pdf document that are landscape in the original file and in the foto book, others are landscape but I chose only a straight formatted part of it in the foto book. 
@scholzj Thanks Jakub, I cleaned up and started from scratch, and this time all worked like a charm, could be a glitch with AKS, the good old restart fixed it 👍  ``` kubectl get all -n kafka ``` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/640759/74367227-cbbebc80-4dd1-11ea-9fac-9107f0fd896d.png)  I am closing the issue, just noting about including the Cleanup procedure in the quick start manuals.
@TiTo-418 Thank You!

@kiview Thanks for your quick reply ! I opened the bug here because I thought there could be another way to get the ip without having to access the logs of a container. I think the logs command is not even supported by docker itself with the syslog driver so I don't know if raising the issue to docker-java would help, I will check that anyway.  To help me moving forward, do you know if it's possible to override the gateway ip using an environment variable or java option, I tried to look for that without success reading the code / doc of the project.
I think this is small https://github.com/filippor/osgi.enroute.examples.remoteservice/ The -runblacklist on https://github.com/filippor/osgi.enroute.examples.remoteservice/blob/master/osgi.enroute.examples.remoteservice/app/client.bndrun it fails to resolve otherwise resolve include service implementation that I want to provide through remote service
I can't reproduce it either.

I already tried to switch to every single version of citizens and bukkit/spigot, In my web host and in my computer. They usually disappear when I join another server and come back to mine, it's not an issue with any other plugin too, because I already tested citizens completely free from any other plugin in the server, and this still happens. But my server is currently running spigot 1.8.8 R0.1-SNAPSHOT, but I can ensure it's not an issue with the jar server or my client. 
Hello, i suspect that you mean the logcat output of the crash? I'll do that in a separate issue because it seems to me that this is not related to the non-updated location/signal values. https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/300  Here I could give you my output .csv if you want, but i'd rather send that privately because of all the geodata included. 
Thanks @pejovica, I confirm that the proposed patch fixes it.
I delete the old world folders any time I make changes to PlotSquared.
Let me pull out a simplified dataset and code example that reproduces the issue.    The key hashing is consistent and immutable and the transaction is disabled. The value isn't immutable.  But I can make it be.  I will also give it a try with the cacheDisabled 
You are correct! `./compile.sh` took care of it for me. 
not sure if it's #1 trying to piss me off due to knowing I'm sitting here ready to F2, or #2 because i realized that I had set green and blue as outputs while green was actually the input with blue and black being outs, with yellow as pass through.   when i had green as output, items would enter, but after that particular sorter, the items labeled with a green would be tossed in random directions with other sorters even when they didn't have the itemex having only Granite on a blue would also let bone or arrows into the chest         From: AlexIIL <notifications@github.com>  To: BuildCraft/BuildCraft <BuildCraft@noreply.github.com>  Cc: Raghalin <jmtvcks@yahoo.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com>  Sent: Monday, June 12, 2017 12:40 PM  Subject: Re: [BuildCraft/BuildCraft] 7.99.4 diamond pipes (#3667)     Can you screenshot your diamond pipe GUI and in-world and put them here?

I've checked out this repository: https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui and imported all projects (excluding nested test bundles). I've not set any workspace preferences or project properties for CogniCrypt. I have only installed and run it (on all projects of the workspace). Basically I was just doing an initial evaluation to see what kind of warnings I might see with CogniCrypt after watching the Eclipse.org channel Youtube video about it.  I'm not exactly sure anymore, but I think I had several closed projects in that workspace. I opened the first, which triggered a workspace build, including CogniCrypt analysis. While that build was still running, I openened further projects, thereby triggering further workspace builds.
Thanks for the fix. For completeness; I am using the PostgreSQL driver.
I agree that it might be hard to fix (especially for all corner cases), but I was surprised to see that overriding the getter with the explicit return type didn't work either...  ```java @ConfigurationProperties("foo.bar") public class GenericProperties extends AbstractPropeties<Foo> {  	@Override 	public Map<String, Foo> getProps() { 		return super.getProps(); 	}  } ```  We still get `T` in the metadata.  (I tried overriding both the getter and setter with the same result).  Perhaps a reasonable compromise would be to at least make this work?
Thanks for your support! So here is the first one with "--Full" where German is not working and English is working.

I am using subzero-all-0.6 jar , It is working fine on my local machine but when I am deploying on production the deserialization is not working , The serialization is not giving any issue but when I am doing get operation on Map in hazelcast it is throwing this exception .  
I'm really sorry, I should check this in advance. Affected version is `9.1.6.v20160112` (and at least `9.1.2.v20140210`, so, I assume, all 9.1.x versions). In 9.3 everything looks fine.  I think, it was fixed in this commit: https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/30123607c66627f74c8e8f7bed372f6e9b99ec31.

@JakeWharton Just a regular bindings: ```java @BindView(R.id.text_view) TextView mTextView; ``` Here is a simple application that you can inspect: [MyApplication2.zip](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/files/1212184/MyApplication2.zip)  > MyApplication2/app/build/generated/source/apt/debug/com/android/myapplication/MainActivity_ViewBinding.java Error:(23, 43) error: incompatible types: View cannot be converted to TextView Error:Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'. > Compilation failed; see the compiler error output for details. ```java   @UiThread   public MainActivity_ViewBinding(MainActivity target, View source) {     this.target = target;      target.mTextView = source.findViewById(R.id.text_view);   } ```
Yes, this fixed it. Thank you!
Please forgive my ignorance but what is the best method to acquire the 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT? I'm currently using the Maven Central Repository via Gradle to acquire my dependencies. Should I build the 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT from source or specify a different repository?  Thanks! :) 
I'd rather we go with a similar value as Ethereum.
Great? verified with 1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and it works even better than 2.1.x.  Thank you @violetagg ! Looking forward for official release.
I don't kno why, but i now have no errors ! (i think it's because i updated a plugin but i'm not sure)  If this bug comming another time i comming back :)  thank for all 
Yeah, just saw that link, will test the most recent version. Thanks for super fast response :+1:  
The ResultSetUtil#convertByteArrayValue method references to MySQL JDBC driver 5.1 version, it just checks first of byte array.In 8.0 version, it changes to byte array -> long -> boolean, you can find the implement in [here](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/blob/release/8.0/src/main/core-impl/java/com/mysql/cj/result/BooleanValueFactory.java#L78), I’m not sure which way is better, what do you think? BTW, this method has only been verified in the MySQL database, I don't have an environment for other databases.
Yes. Both, file and folder with the same name within the same parent directory. And yes, I'm familiar with vaults and can assure the problem is definitly related to file structure. Moreover, there are a lot of other files and folders (beside the corrupted ones) in the same parent directory which are absolutely clean. 
It is working well in all cases except for layout in ViewPager option I am sharing the screenshot. Please check   (I have checked from the sample app on Playstore)   ![screenshot_2017-12-10-19-54-25-417_com alexvasilkov gestures sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30948046/33805955-880e0ee4-dde6-11e7-9de2-075f646c818b.png) 
I have tried it based on the wiki that you created in **_[this link](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/wiki/Compatibility-of-Android-O-Service)_** regarding foreground services, and the references that I use to bring up notifications on **_[this link](https://github.com/lingochamp/FileDownloader/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/com/liulishuo/filedownloader/demo/NotificationSampleActivity.java)_**. I matched this code with the one in the reference I used, but the notification didn't appear but the download process continued.  It looks like something is wrong with your library, especially on the **NotificationManager**. I tried to use the **NotificationManager** without this library and the notification appeared. My advice, try adding it also for the use of foreground, I've tried it this way  ``` FileDownloader fileDownloader = new FileDownloader(); fileDownloader.startForeground(getId(), builder.build()); ```  and succeed.

I declared that code in the index.js file  since I want to use it as  a Global listener.  IOS works well.. only Android has that issues.  most of all SideMenu disable doesn't work
ADB logs as soon as I can reliably recreate the issue. It's sporadic 
Hi @mkulesh, thank you for your quick response and for pointing me to the new firmware. Actually, I'm not using the latest firmware and I wasn't even aware that it has been released.  My current firmware is: 2120-3000-0000-0010 Latest firmware released in Nov. 2019: 2140-5000-0000-0011  However, there might be some very serious bugs in the new firmware, see: [http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-272-6905.html](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-272-6905.html)  - Post No. 8 states that Onkyo has confirmed the issue. - Post  No. 9 indicates that R-N855 is probably also affected even if the initial post refers to another Onkyo product)  I will have an eye on that issue and once they fixed the bugs in their latest release, I will upgrade my receiver  accordingly. After that, I will share my experiences here. In the meantime, I downgrade your app to 1.2 as I really don't want to brake my R-N855 and App version 1.2 was already quite good - close to perfect :)!

I think it's done (i'm not famliar with github merging, sorry if i did a mistake). 
@wb9688 If I adjust any of track bars separately the end result will be stuttering of audio. I use audio-only playback, I forgot to tell that. I just checked and the same thing happen if I watch a whole video. Maybe it's because I use fairly low-end android phone. Is this speed up computation heavy?
The expected behavior is that it would give mouse_drag events for the button that's being held down. However, what's happening is that I drag one mouse button, drag/release another, and it will give me drag events for the latter instead of the former. That's the issue here.

TBD. 
Railcraft_1.10.2-10.3.1  and   ImmersiveEngineering-0.10-61 
I do not know if it helps, but before this issue occurred there were cases in which wrong very small values returned at any time during an experiment (e.g. memoryUsageSum=612265984 or fsSizeSum=98304) which was the case when resources were requested after system's termination.   Now, such cases are not occurred. I suppose that have been replaced by the aforementioned issue (`null` stats). And If I try to request the resource usage information after the system has terminated there are no small values returned but the `info` of `ResourceUsageInformation info = req.getSystemResourceUsage();` is `null`
As far as I know, iron and gold are the only two that have rendering issues. What's funny is the diamond and emerald connected textures utilize the same method and work completely fine. So do the stained clay textures.  Forge Multipart microblocks did have errors with the wood textures, but I don't know what exactly caused that, and I can't remember if that was solved before or after I removed BuildCraft from the testing environment.
@lpatino10 Sounds great! Let me know.  @germanattanasio I would love to create the patch if I am allowed to.  My manager was really excited about me getting the chance to contribute to the SDK.  Don't know if you saw but I work for IBM Watson on the public sector implementations team so it would be a great experience to get under the hood of something that we use so frequently.
I can reproduce it on my pixel 2 with Rocket 3502
Ops. Forget. https://pastebin.com/pjTECjPU
It's not that. Screenshot 1 and screenshot 2 are from same database, same single table, screenshot 1 with DBeaver 4.6.2 and screenshot 2 with DBeaver 5.0.2
Sure :)
You misread that: "when the cursor is outside of the window" (actually I meant the SceneComposer Frame to be precise). It seems that if you press g then counts as "mousedown" just like it does in blender.  Edit: Oh and I'm tagging @Dokthar since he wrote the gizmos, maybe he has any insight.
I'm not sure about the explicit change that broke it, but the code in 0.6.2 that supported the windows certificate store was here: https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/v0.6.2/dropwizard-core/src/main/java/com/yammer/dropwizard/config/ServerFactory.java#L228.  I'd have to poke around in the current code base to see if I can find out what happened. 
@zfi  -  ;-)   @MatzElectronics  - The problem is a bit more serious. When I correct and save the project - exit to the home page and my projects and reopen the program - the error (time corrected from seconds to milliseconds) has returned and is present in the newly opened code
I'll send a PR. Just wanted an open issue to reference in the PR 👍 
Hmm.. Not sure why it is not working on mine. To test a clean base, I downloaded the latest lightadmin-demo module and packaged/ deployed on Tomcat 8.0.3 and I do not see the custom side bar even though the /WEB-INF/admin/sidebars/**.jsp is there. See this screenshot. Am I assuming something wrong?  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3812472/3556455/2ece3c18-0924-11e4-8afc-533d384613d1.png) 
Hey there turbo,  I looked up last nights logs and it just shows the launching messages and some chat - it seems the crashes didnt generate a report. It seemned to me that they were memory errors.  Today (because I have the fusion reactor chunkloaded) I could log in to a base without power. And without graphical lag.   here is my setup: https://imgur.com/a/4ePof , the advanced powercells output 20k rf/t , and they were fully charged. I have the electrolysers equipped with 30 speed upgrades and unlimited water from the sink.   Hope this helps, building the fusion reactor was great fun (I think it's an amazing mod, great work!)  
I downloaded the play store version a couple days ago, I'd have to reboot my LG to check for sure. Is the link yoiu sent different? I'm not great at github haha
My players use replaymode and can not use direct video recording all the time, because it significantly reduces FPS
yes..sir

Applying the `no-cache` tag to a target when building with  ``` --spawn_strategy=remote  --genrule_strategy=remote  --strategy=Javac=remote  --strategy=Closure=remote ``` makes it fall back to `local` unsandboxed execution (is this expected?), which does not use remote caching. We would really like to continue sandboxed building of the targets we want to exclude from remote caching, so this wouldn't be a good workaround for us.

To me, the use of BibTeXML is not imperative. In the usecase at hand, I export a JabRef library to BibTeXML and process it with XSLT to generate XHTML. I'm happy with any other XML dialect. 
@tolusha  I solved it by adding the following env to the containers field part: https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/e3999fcc8b040a537c11300de178358acaef4396/deploy/kubernetes/helm/che/custom-charts/che-jaeger/templates/deployment.yaml#L32  ``` yaml env:   - name: JAEGER_AGENT_HOST     value: jaeger-agent   - name: JAEGER_AGENT_PORT     value: "5775" ```
Yeah, exactly as I tought and yes both DBS and portal frames. 
same behavior on both the ASUS Transformer Infinity and Samsung Galaxy Relay running CM 10.2.1.  this might be related to having a firewall up but both firefox and apktrack are allowed through.

Well this is quite peculiar, I set it back up the exact way it was before and no crash now. Below is how it was set up though. Not sure the difference between hooking it up today and hooking it up 3 days ago though. _shrug_  The connection with the transfer pipe was accidental and I didn't mean for it to connect but failed to see it when I first placed the transceiver down  ![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5308389/1323508/28664214-3484-11e3-84f4-d298d0565aa8.png) 
Yes, of course. Three reasons this makes sense: - it's currently guessing invalid credentials and hurting the user experience; - using the provided root credentials is what the OrientDB console does when you create a new database (see the resolution of #6564); - it's consistent with the existing behavior -- the existing behavior was to log the user in as an admin, and the root credentials have admin-level access to the database. 
@mhlopko As the first screenshot shows, 4 lines below red ERROR sign, I think gcc 5.2 is used.  How can I check which gcc is on PATH?
One specific spell from arcane essentials causes the server to crash when used, and after i started the server again wehn i removed the mod that has the buggy spell in it that error pops up

Hi Guys, Is there any alternative link for these tutorials? I am looking for something, where on spring rest API calls, I can run any process or task with data. Instead of too much conversion of data.

Thank you for the workaround @TatuLund, it works. I'd just expect a simpler way to get the layout chain, maybe not through the `RouteRegistry` but in the navigation events. Something like:  ```java @Override 	public void beforeEnter(BeforeEnterEvent event) {         var target = event.getNavigationTarget();         var layouts = event.getLayouts();     } } ```
Yes, i can't run my app with it, i need to remove ReactNativeAudioStreamingPackage() from MainApplication.java and all related code in android/settings.gradle and android/app/build.gradle to run the app without react-native-audio-streaming

Perhaps they are vengeance spirits, I'm not sure of the nomenclature. I can assure you that the ghosts are not part of another mod.  The ghosts which I'm discussing are the semi-transparent clone entities that appear after you kill a mob with the EvilCraft mod. IE if you kill a pig, it'll spawn a semi-transparent pig with altered sound effects. Normally these "ghosts" are only visible if you're in creative mode or using an item from EvilCraft in survival.  I haven't been seeing either the expected ghosts or the glitched dragonflies myself. The provided screenshot shows what one of my users has seen - a mysteriously appearing dragonfly that I theorize is a mistakenly identifying the ghost entity type as another ID (the dragonfly). Since the entity takes the form of whatever it was killed when a living mob was slain that's the best guess I've got.  Again of course I'm no expert. This seems to be exclusive to EvilCraft and doesn't happen with it removed - though I have no doubt that it is due to an interaction conflict bug with another mod.  If I provided a console log would that be at all helpful? Like I said it isn't causing crashes or anything, its purely a cosmetic issue. I will keep an eye on the console in the mean time and see if anything catches my eye.
@IanChilds It isn't worked,and i coundn't found any exception in logcat. 
Hi Tobias, how can I send you an encrypted email with your user credentials for my Nextcloud server? I searched for your public key on hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net to use PGP email encyption w/o success.  Please advice.
Hello @mcomella   I first noticed the bug by going to outlook.com to see my mails but I tried it with numerama.com to be sure that the bug is not linked to outlook.com and it also happened. So the generic steps are: 1. Go to a website W 1. Connect to this website 1. Access your profile (or whatever data that need you to be connected to be seen) 1. Use the notification to clear you navigation 1. Go to W again  Expected behavior: You should reconnect to see your profile.  Actual behavior: You do not need to reconnect to see your profile.
Sorry for the late answer, I did some tests First I reset the scale only and it seems to work, but only once actually... After that the same behavior happened.  So I did reset both the scale and the app. But since then, that's even worse since the scale doesn't recognize me anymore and there's still no data saved into the app  ``` 2020-03-02 20:05:19.058

I have tried this in **EA 29-Jan-2019 20:26** and this works **OK**. My guess when you fixed case #5058 it fixed this misbeaviour as well. **Great Work**  **PS**. As far as I am concerned, you can close this isse now.
Yes, it is shown as registered device. No, there is no error on the CNL itself.  It's not my own CNL (I'm just the fascinated friend), but I can provide more detailed logs on wednesday.

Very strange that it could not be reproduced in a small example, but it did happen in real case where intricate mappings are defined in recursive way, the problem is it tries to use Boolean.parseBoolean(aToString(a)) instead of a2bool(a) in generated code, not sure why ? 
I can still reproduce it with 2.2-SNAPSHOT  >   += o.e.j.w.WebAppContext@14a65c6{/webapp,[file:///C:/Users/test/git/jetty-omnifaces/target/testwebapp-1.0.0/, jar:file:///C:/Users/test/git/jetty-omnifaces/target/testwebapp-1.0.0/WEB-INF/lib/**omnifaces-2.2-SNAPSHOT.jar**!/META-INF/resources, jar:file:///C:/Users/test/git/jetty-omnifaces/target/testwebapp-1.0.0/WEB-INF/lib/javax.faces-2.2.12.jar!/META-INF/resources],**UNAVAILABLE**} - STARTED 
https://pay.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/2pot2q/changelog_for_2014dec18/cmyx761  Essentially, trying to print more than 5 pages fails. I've updated the title of this issue. Also need a price drop as outlined in link. 
The .project file was somehow broken i guess. After deleting the .project file it started all right.
Hi @otaviojava the `@AQL` annotation is fixed, but the settings in [jnosql.json](https://github.com/JNOSQL/artemis-demo/blob/1b3fc256b9/artemis-demo-java-se/arangodb/src/main/resources/META-INF/jnosql.json) is not fixed yet for both examples ```java "settings": {     "couchbase-host-1": "localhost",     "couchbase-user": "root",     "couchbase-password": "123456" } ```
Thanks for looking into this! While in fullscreen, with and without tmux, this is the result: ``` [~] stty size 138 512 ```  However, I cannot open another tmux pane in Termux right now, while in fullscreen on my 4k display without Termux force closing, so this isn't specific to just `htop`.
Downloaded and manually installed 3.7.4 from github.  Unfortunately, no change with 3.7.4.

Thanks for the quick response, @svenjacobs .  As you suggested, I created a simple button group using plain HTML/Bootstrap/JavaScript to try to reproduce the issue.  In my example, I used the Glyphicons instead of Font Awesome, since I was trying to follow the basic example found at http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/ , but I don't think this would make a difference.  Here is my example HTML:  ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head>   <meta charset="utf-8">   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">   <title>bootstrap html test</title>   <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">     <!-- HTML5 Shim and Respond.js IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries -->     <!-- WARNING: Respond.js doesn't work if you view the page via file:// -->     <!--[if lt IE 9]>       <script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/html5shiv/3.7.2/html5shiv.min.js"></script>       <script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/respond/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script>     <![endif]--> </head> <body>     <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->     <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>     <!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed -->     <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>    <div class="btn-group">     <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-original-title="" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="PLUS Tooltip on right">         <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></i> Plus     </button>     <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-original-title="" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="CLOUD Tooltip on right">         <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-cloud"></i> Cloud     </button>     <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-original-title="" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="STAR Tooltip on right">         <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></i> Star     </button>   </div> </body> </html> ```  This example works as expected, and I was NOT able to reproduce the issue of the buttons shifting and jiggling as the tooltips are displayed.  Please let me know if you have any questions, and thanks again.

Yeah i did, also repeated the test twice to be sure. 
@Banbury I think it's because the game is arbitrarily adding 5px to the height of the window in a lot of its calculations. I cannot confirm this because my swing knowledge is still lacking.  Happens in every game I try with multiple panels but only when using look and feel settings other than Metal (default) and nimbus from my Debian system.
sorry , i am a Novice .  i  will not  send a  pull  request.... 
No we have tested with many mods... I will find out exactly what my friend did to get the server to crash. Here is the whole crashlog:  Edit: sorry, i miss read.

Hey @brettwooldridge, you're right, that's a bad practice. We realized that issue recently and tried to debug it. 1 total connection is not normal so I put a breakpoint where Hikari tries to throw the timeout error and realized that both log entries for 30 connections and 1 connection belong to Postgresql.  I actually tried a bunch of different configurations for lifetime and leak detection threshold and none of them worked. Most probably maximum lifetime value was 60000 in this example (I tried 60s because I thought that the socket connection might become unreliable after some time) so I was wrong when I said it uses the default configuration. It's likely that Hikari tries to connect the database for 60 seconds and then expires the connection. However, when I disable Hikari it works smooth and it shouldn't take 60s for Hikari to connect the database.  OK, I fixed the pool name issue now and restarted the server. I will paste the output when it throws the error again.  
@thadguidry Nice catch. It seems that it is related to the Adblock+ extension  for Chrome. Thanks !
v0.2.1.35. I've also used WorldEdit to remove a lot of stone blocks on several occasions, the most recent being a few minutes ago, and still haven't seen any ores before: https://i.imgur.com/64lOo5I.jpg https://i.imgur.com/htUbQKq.jpg If it helps, here's a latest.txt log file: https://pastebin.com/q3FrRTb8
umm well it kinda fixed it the first round.. ish. the player came back with no inventory, and then waits.  when the game ends the players ingame inventory get set properly but the one that left + came back was then put into creative mode. when the next game starts all players keep their inventory as well as get gm 1 for the game. when the game ends, all players lose their inventory. hope this helps,  
I am pretty sure we did not changed anything in regards to this so it should still be an issue. I was never able to reproduce it but I got it from logs of someone on release.
Please go ahead I won't have time to fix this. Best of luck :)

@serge-rider   According to [the release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/release-9-2.html), the change happened on 9.2 [E.51.2.6. Monitoring](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/release-9-2.html#AEN123771). Also, CTEs weren't available until 8.4  pg_locks view didn't change, I believe.   Where can I get the query used by DBeaver to edit it?
@polyfractal: Thanks for your clear reply. Indeed increasing the `shard_size` parameter from 20 to 200 gives me a more accurate result. I was not aware of this limitation, it is present but a bit hidden in the documentation.  So it is not a bug after all, just for me unexpected behavior. I think it is more fair to future users if the limitations of ElasticSearch are clearly communicated in any feature page like the README of this repository. People need to make a decision which database to choose based on this kind of information. They do not, and in fact cannot read the entire documentation to make a well-informed decision.
Yes, the fix will be included in 2.7.0. Probably next week, if there's no issue with the release candidate.
The problem's solved! Now there are no more fluid losses.  Thanks man!

Use case is a offline playback device (in-car tablet), and this is one of our test files.  People might connect other data sources to our product (USB sticks, SD cards, recording devices), which themselves have raw, unprocessed, video files. 
Yeah just checked and French appears to actually be UTF-8 unlike Spanish's ISO-8859-2. Going to see if there's a simple solution on the loading side but we might need to convert these/find alternatives.

SO yeah could not replicate it btw CP. had like 40 spawners going over night with just as many killer joes no crash. I am thinking it is tied to Random Things Blood moon event. http://randomthingsminecraftmod.wikispaces.com/Bloodmoon

Hmm no I didn't specify any DNS servers myself, I just run `./gnirehtet run` (or `cargo run run` when running from the source directory and not from a release).  Patching the server with  ```diff diff --git a/relay-rust/src/relay/ipv4_packet_buffer.rs b/relay-rust/src/relay/ipv4_packet_buffer.rs index 97d80ff..38989fd 100644 --- a/relay-rust/src/relay/ipv4_packet_buffer.rs +++ b/relay-rust/src/relay/ipv4_packet_buffer.rs @@ -41,8 +41,7 @@ impl Ipv4PacketBuffer {        fn available_packet_length(&self) -> Option<u16> {          if let Some((version, length)) = ipv4_header::peek_version_length(&self.buf) { -            assert!(version == 4, "Not an Ipv4 packet, version={}", version); -            if length as usize <= self.head { +            if (version == 4) && (length as usize <= self.head) {                  // full packet available                  Some(length)              } else { ```  "fixes" the issue, but doesn't explain why the client would send an IPv6 packet...
The stack is fine (at least it appears to be fine), but the sample application `aspnet-web-simple` doesn't pull in any code and the project type is blank instead of C#. I've added a screenshot and updated the issue description to try and be more clear.    
No, how can i do that?
@AlexejK I don't know what you mean exactly with refresh, but if I synchronize the project, the problem remains 
I am using bucket4j-core 2.1.0 and bucket4j-jcache 2.1.0. 
Just tested the build, and can verify the bug is no longer present. 
Yes and it doesn't fix the problem.  
Yes, that sounds good. Do you want to send a PR?

It's happen all the time, and this command it's always in error on execution on production.   The stack above is on the logs of the server. And yes, it's same version of java and orientdb on server and client.
Thanks @serge-rider!
There's only shown "Event Cache" (not Earth Cache as I wrote at the beginning) in the filter panel above the list.   The switch button solved my problem. Now I can see all caches again.  So I think the "recycle bin" icon is not supposed to clear the filter if it was set on the main screen?  
My bad. It's my JDK environment corrupted. Reinstall, then it worked. But seems not working behind the proxy. Will raise another issue. 
I cannot readily reproduce it, like I can in Runelite. A lot more sporadic in the official client than in RL.
Both http and socket(socket.io) service run on my server side,and they listen the same port. When I run the socket.io java client, it just vist access the http server~thx~ 
you apparently answered your own questions :P 
@adirzoari I couldn't solve it, i leave it on stand by.
I tested the behaviour like this:  ``` <command>ls xxyy 2>&amp;1</command> ```  Even though the exit code is 2, no error is detected by Wagon SSH just because I redirected standard error to standard output. But your assumption is still incorrect because Wagon _is_ able to detect exit codes. It just does not handle them when nothing is logged on standard error. Proof:  ``` <command>ls xxyy</command> ```  This yields the following output:  ``` [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:wagon-maven-plugin:1.0:sshexec   (exec-ssh-script) on project xx.yy.aggregate:   Unable to execute remote command: Exit code: 2 -   ls: cannot access xxyy: No such file or directory   -> [Help 1] ```  See? "Exit code: 2". Wagon gets the exit code, it just handles it wrong. So please improve the plugin, would you? Thank you. The correct behaviour would be to ignore output on standard error and look at the exit code instead. This is true both on Linux and Windows. It is the canonic way to handle errors in shell scripts or other executables.

The dimacs export creates a dimacs file with the wrong number of clauses: `p cnf 33 57`. The correct line is `p cnf 33 58`. 
Maybe we can implement a thread-safe wrapper that extends PrintStream (or OutputStream?) and then put the AnsiOutputStream inside? 
i do not think it is a better idea to do change to the licence file. better specify the "or later" in your LICENCE 
Hi Fupery,   Apologies - I just realised how little info I gave you - I was super tired at the time.  I'm running CraftBukkit 1.11.2 API 1.11.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT  In this console output I  I right clicked the easel before typing /artmap:     Paste of error http://pastebin.com/W5JfMWMf   edit:  and no error log in plugins folder.
It is hard to reproduce, and although I run this plugin frequently, I couldn't reproduce reliably enough. 
This is a reduced program from the R8 compiler: https://r8.googlesource.com/r8  R8 generates optimized code and will re-use locals when available.  
No, any chest at all.  The one in particular was not connected to the ME.  It was just a standard chest.    And Yueh, the server owners have a system that allow you to actually purchase points to buy kits that will basically just creative in items for you.  That is how I got my ME drives.    I did some further testing and just can't figure out what is causing it.  I have the exact same set up on an SP world and have not seen such an issue.  Got another guy on the server that has an ME set up, no issues.  I have used AE since Unleashed and never seen anything like this before.    Restarting the server is like an on off switch for it.  After the items dupe, they remain duped until the server restarts, at that point when it comes back online the items literally undupe unless I have pulled them from the ME and placed them in my inventory.  I am at a loss.  
I just requested the infos. What he wrote me is that it happens all the time on any device he has access to. He told me it happened at some point after he used the app for some days. He is using the latest version from the market. 
updated to include error 
I've tried reproducing this with regular machines with no luck. Seems like it only happens to the digital miner, but I'll give it another go.

The point is not about reproducing this specific issue because it is a general class of problem -- there is no useful feedback during the Web UI intialisation process. I can give you a command which will reliably cause CHE to fail but this is not about fixing that failure, it is about making sure that the users know what is happening:  `docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /tmp/che:/data -e CHE_MULTIUSER=true -e CHE_SINGLE_PORT=true eclipse/che start`  This will try to start up and run but the front-end code will fail to talk to all sorts of things properly, such as the websocket.  And please do not say that this isn't a supported configuration. That isn't the point. It is just an easy and reliable way to induce errors in the initialisation process.
A weekend has passed... Have you release the new build? 
Hi @otaviojava the `@AQL` annotation is fixed, but the settings in [jnosql.json](https://github.com/JNOSQL/artemis-demo/blob/1b3fc256b9/artemis-demo-java-se/arangodb/src/main/resources/META-INF/jnosql.json) is not fixed yet for both examples ```java "settings": {     "couchbase-host-1": "localhost",     "couchbase-user": "root",     "couchbase-password": "123456" } ```
@aesteve it might be the case, since we also disabled CBOR for localstack.
Tried to reproduce it myself. Run into the same problem but with different project this time.  ![zwischenablage-8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5330357/14672469/5356709a-06f8-11e6-9c00-b3ba0f15530f.jpg) 
I am using v1.3 (from f-droid). I have used the app since 1.1.3, but have always had this issue. The station names are displayed in the map view though. The same package on another phone does not have this issue. Removing and reinstalling has no effect. Neither does selecting another bike network.  ![screenshot_2014-09-20-15-57-39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4056484/4347874/70d8d702-416f-11e4-837b-982c1382c35f.png) 
Jaime,  Sorry for delayed reasponse. I think its just matter of adding right FSM in AsImpl. Please find attached testcase and AsImpl fix that I believe is sufficient.  [telscale-jss7-m3ua.patch.zip](https://github.com/RestComm/jss7/files/871338/telscale-jss7-m3ua.patch.zip)  
Yes I have, but I was still not seeing the messages sent to Event Viewer. No worries, I'll just use JNA for now. 
yes, in the newest build it works thanks 
I am using saxon. I am using the full easy install version of the toolkit.  java -version returns: java version "1.6.0_37"  Thank you  Bertrand 
pointing string|bool, clicking string problem is, that all str function returns false on failure but i usually have some if before, so it's false positive
I try to delete the cache directory,  and those images can be displayed correctly without errors. I guess Fresco caches the dirty data in the disk for unknown reason. It is better to clear the cached data if an error has occurred. 
I did a fallback manually...maybe @Bananeweizen should tell if he can fix it or we should roll back his commit (so that we get a working NB tomorrow) ?

@SquidDev sorry I didn't see you asked me to show my setup they are using a modified cc jar on that server which may be the issue so I don't feel it would be appropriate for me to post an issue here
Here you go: [Chaos Legion30170101.zip](https://github.com/MegaMek/mekhq/files/2270513/Chaos.Legion30170101.zip)  Just checked again, FWIW - this happens in all my saves; I´ve attached one that doesn´t need a heap of customs in order to load. Here´s the log for the attempt with this save:  [mekhqlog.txt](https://github.com/MegaMek/mekhq/files/2270524/mekhqlog.txt)  Also - this bug has appeared both in fresh 0.45.0 campaigns and those carried from 0.44.0 or earlier.
Install ant, run "ant" in current directory (builds the .jar file).  "ant clean" to remove everything, and "ant test" (TBI) to run unit tests 
They are 2 blocks high. The top half is the filter, bottom half is dangling below the filter. There are 2 filters side by side. Nothing above or below the filters. It was meant for them to drop down a 2x1 shaft all the way to the void. So yes they seem to be stuck in the filter suffocating.

Hi,  Let me explain , if I have added a device with its "Unique Identifier" as some email like 'aadsadas@gmail.com' or any other , then any attempts to track it via android traccar client fails   It always show send failed for indentifier such as email or numbers greater than 6 digits 
Hey..   I haven't tried the fix yet....I'll give it a shot soon.  ``` > How are you adding the item? ```  I'm adding items with `addItem` function without calling `notifyItemInserted` after it.

Attached a strace log.  And noticed strange entries, such as:  ```   stat("/opengrok/data/index/foo7/foo552", 0x7fc4c189b810) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) ```  Here, foo7 and foo552 are separate projects, so I

Yes, only 3.6.9 3.6.6 works fine 
I am using ->        GMD = 2.0-rc5        GWT = 2.8.2       Chrome = any mobile device       OS = Android/iOS
`mensagem.setRecipients(RecipientType.TO, destinatario.map(e -> Email.getInternetAddress(e.getKey(), e.getValue())).toImList().stream().toArray(InternetAddress[]::new));`  javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage.setRecipients needs a array. A empty array is just to get a typed array.  I've used stream as alternative.  
``` ImageRequest request = ImageRequestBuilder.newBuilderWithSource(Uri.parse(srcString))         .setPostprocessor(new BlurPostprocessor(background.getContext(), srcString))         .build();  PipelineDraweeController controller = (PipelineDraweeController) Fresco.newDraweeControllerBuilder()         .setImageRequest(request)         .setOldController(background.getController())         .build();  background.setController(controller); ```  Where `background` is a SimpleDraweeView. 
I tried with and without the battery saver mode, still the same issues.
After further testing I've found it happens when legacy mode is enabled. 
1.12, is where i'm testing this. I don't know about the others.

The problem for which I created the issue has occurred in the screenshot by PaulWestphal. I have also marked the places which I see the problem again in the attachment.  Regards, Manoj  
@vRallev looking good, just tested it on a few scenarios and works well! 
@davidjgonzalez Hi David, its DAM Update Asset. I'm doing some tests for a future migration which will be at a much larger scale.
Sorry, this was fixed in official 0.7.
@farin: the chat window was in use during one normal game, and one test game. It never showed any text. I could not see my own nor other players' text. When I say the panel flashed black, I mean the area above the chat input box - the input box was still visible. The version used was 8abd756.  Java on Mac is tricker than java on Windows in some ways. - The default java version on Mac OS X 10.10 is `1.6.0.jdk`. Apple [made java selection harder](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57986/multiple-java-versions-support-on-os-x-and-java-home-location) than it used to be since OS X 10.8, so it can be assumed "all" Mac users use `1.6.0.jdk`. - As a developer, I could also change JDK to for example `jdk1.7.0_45.jdk`, but this is an exception.  Looking at files in use by the process running JCZ it looks like `1.6.0.jdk`.

Ok...  I think I'm an idiot x)  It's ok now, the problem is solved.   It was a shovel problem ^^ the builder didn't accept the diamon shovel
Sure, the current openhab's weather binding (all versions) is not working when Yahoo Weathe is choosed as service. The API command used to retrieve the weather information from Yahoo returns always the error 503 Service Unavailable. Thank you. 
I see, the problem is the different names in Preferences, versus on Drawer:  On **Drawer**:  ``` Toggle Attack Detection Toggle Cell Tracking ```  In **Preferences**:  ``` Cell Tracking Cell Monitoring ```  At this point I have no ****ing idea what is what... And if they are the same or different. 
I do not think this is urgent. Just wnated to trace it.

It seems that it does work now, the script keeps connected to the correct event without issuing any crashes.  However, I found a similar issue with renaming a condition. After renaming a condition, a script using the condition inside an inline event will now reference to a complete different condition. I would suggest to use IDs to link conditions to scripts if possible, this may can prevent problems with renaming.
Works fine on 14.3.0(1081-da691d74e30a47)

I guess I use the default camera from google, and the error is just after the intent is fired, but from the operating system. Something with `with revoked permission android.permission.CAMERA` 
@sgdc3 set noTeleport to true and the player spawns in their proper quit location. 
just went into my test world and now its working correctly with Minecraft Enderio and NuclearCraft
YES!!! It worked, sorry about that lol. :)

The missing input file is because you need need to prebuild the compiler via `scripts/prebuild-binaries.sh` or build with `--define yaspl_bootstrap=true` to actually build the main compiler using the bootstrap compiler. My bad for missing that in the instructions.  It looks like it is still broken with 0.18.0.  ``` $ ~/proj/bazel-release/bazel-0.18.0-darwin-x86_64  build --nobuild //... --incompatible_disallow_filetype --define yaspl_bootstrap=true  Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...

Yeah sorry about that. You're absolutely right. here's the method that builds the MergingMediaSource: ```java private MediaSource getMergedMediaSource(String fileName, String language) {     Uri videoUri = getMediaUri(fileName, MP4_EXTENSION);     Uri audioUri = getMediaUri(fileName, MP3_EXTENSION, language);     MediaSource videoSource = new ExtractorMediaSource(videoUri, mDataSourceFactory, mExtractorsFactory, null, null);     MediaSource audioSource = new ExtractorMediaSource(audioUri, mDataSourceFactory, mExtractorsFactory, null, null);      return new MergingMediaSource(audioSource, videoSource); } ``` Hope it helps

Hmm, I just returned from a trip where I had relatively poor reception throughout, and despite having check-in and GCM disabled after posting that issue on Friday, I ended up running into the high CPU bug about 6 times. I also had wifi disabled, which I only mention because it might be relevant?  @bonanza123: I hadn't realized the xposed module might be an issue or I would have saved the logs, but I'll definitely save them next time before restarting my phone.  I'm installing the latest build and will see if I run into the issue again- cheers!

I can reproduce is fairly reliably in our test environments (running it concurrently on 25+ servers makes finding these issues pretty easy).  I'll try the window length option next week.  The particular topic that experiences this issue gets a burst of traffic just after the start up process completes (priming a bunch of caches with some reference data).  This was on the latest release (Aeron 0.9.8 & Agrona 0.5.1). 
We had once a PR that claimed to make Stratosphere Cygwin compatible.  Where do we have exec commands? Do you mean the scripts in /bin ?

I think `^[a-zA-Z_]\w*:`. `\w` is a convenient shortcut for `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`
Apologies for the delayed response. Version was Beta 4. However can confirm this issue is still present with Beta 6 (latest version). Can you resolve?
Those failures are only encountered while running a travis build. Feels like a very rare random occurring bug. I prefer to proceed with #617. After that i can investigate more.
There are no error with sneak but nothing append, always stand, and isSneaking return true until we put stand.

I'm ok with giving an error message. What's the filter for 'no status label'? `-label:status.*` still works?

@rwillett My bad again. I've updated the post with the exact version. And I don't know why I can't use res:. I can use it to set the icon but it does not work for the sound. I checked the logcat and it is unable to find the file. My sound is kept in....platforms/android/res/raw/sound.mp3. I also have a copy of the sound in the www folder which I can use with file: but I want to use res:. I also dont see an example in the docs where they show how to use a custom sound kept in the res: of android.
It is set to true, but if you @ alone it take a random player, should i disable that ?

>  >  > Do you export it directly to Google drive from andOTP? If yes that could be the problem, try saving it locally on you phone first and then uploading it.  Yes, I did it directly. If done locally first, the file can be restored. But my problem is that I've got a backup saved directly and cannot restore it now. So I guess I've lost it, or is there a possibility to recover from this? 
a pre-processor would rock - even if they're evil.  I want something similar to:  ``` xml <dependency>     <groupId>net.onedaybeard.artemis</groupId>     <artifactId>artemis-odb</artifactId>     <version>0.11.0</version>     <classifier>debug</classifier> </dependency> ```  The dep would prob be handled by a profile: if default profile, go with standard artifact - otherwise use the debug-classified (!) artifact. 
@luigidellaquila Thanks. Could you perhaps also check whether OrientGraphNoTx#drop() is clearing all caches, stores etc? Luca fixed an NPE in drop() a while ago for 2.2.x see #6171 - Maybe thats related? Otherwise the issue can be closed. I already use the workaround I described. 
nothing, it's broken, it doesn't work. it should place 4 stones in the crafting table but it doesn't. 
hi @paoloantinori ,  I'm afraid your solution will work only for problem 2) where the pod starts but complains about being Unauthorized.  For problem 1) it won't work, because the deployment is in progress - it is waiting for the pods to be running - and that won't happen because the pod can't find the secret.   - Without scaling to 0,  the deployment will timeout after 10 minutes and the deployment will be marked as failed and openshift will automatically roll out older deployment (so it will roll out the original version of the pod) - With scaling to 0 first, it times out again, but because of the scaling, openshift will not roll out the original version automatically. However if you scale it up to 1 again, it will roll out the original version and will ignore the failed deployment.   And it will be probably necessary to test this with rollback as well, as currently I always end with server and meta pods in version 2 where all other pods are from version 1 (I'm using exit 1 as last step in upgrade_50_replace_template)

@testforstephen Sorry, I can't include the full argfile. Here's a potentially relevant portion however: ``` -classpath "/Users/brandon/Projects/RootFolderName/app/bin/main:/Users/brandon/Projects/RootFolderName/app/bin/test ```  It looks like both the `app/main` and `app/test` folders are being included in the classpath. Is this possibly a bug? Or is there a way for me to specify some classpath exclusion for a particular directory?

For some reason, I can connect now with a different IP address/different route to the server. I've no idea what caused the error, in both cases I used IPv6 (a double-hop VPN connection). The problem persists with the first IPv6/route. It's inscrutable to me. May be there was a IPv6/IPv4 routing issue with the one route, but that's only an airy guess. - Because I can connect now, the issue can be closed, I think. Sorry for the buzz. Thank your for looking into the issue.

@dheerajkotwani  I have already resolved this one! Please find other unassigned issue or feel free to open one, if you encounter any. :)
it appears to be random, sometimes you play whole day and it's fine, sometimes after several minutes.  Also, the message actually appears when bug manifests, not on load. 
Yes, it completely helps! :)  Thx!

Oh, indeed, double-checked and googled - found this answer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14318921/toast-is-not-shown-on-samsung-galaxy-s3-latest-update-4-1-2 And for some reason in Settings I had "Blocked" for c:geo notifications. When I changed it toasts appeared again, so now it looks fine.  Then I would suggest to reformulate this issue to kind of feature request "Inform user that there will be no toasts if notifications are blocked". Probably you could check this value from the app and notify user somehow (on the main screen or additional dialog maybe). Because it was not obvious that I need to go to Notification settings for that...
Im not sure if its related or not but my guess is that it is, and its  major security issue.   One of my players was able to lag himself really hard and spam commands until a "you are not activated" message shows and without /Login he was able to use commands, i don't have many details as hackers like to keep this stuff a secret but i do know it requires bungee... 
I made a simple database example, plz see entached file. So there is one budget on category: Food 50€ And two expenses, on sub-categories:  - Food:Dining Out 20€ - Food:Groceries 10€   The total is 30€, but the displayed value for Food category is 20€, which is the first sub-category.   Hope this helps to understand !  [Example.zip](https://github.com/moneymanagerex/android-money-manager-ex/files/498865/Example.zip)

If when the activity is displayed , it looks good, with ellipsis end When rotate device, the ellipsis not appear.

Yes i had restarted the Eclipse , actually when i am cloning the project from git using Egit plugin in eclipse the project get stored in .git folder when i am opening the project saved under the git folder then the option of FindBug is not coming but when i am copying the same project and saving it in other folder then it is coming ?  will you please help me in this ?
Unfortunately, yes.
Apparently I had [already posted](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/143#issuecomment-58651468) in #143, about this exact problem one year ago!!  [CellInfoWcdma](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfoWcdma.html) belongs to API 18 (AOS 4.3). Thus **DeviceApi17.java** should probably be called **DeviceApi18.java** and using `...SDK > 17` instead of `16`...  The lines in CellTracker.java make it unclear what is really supposed to be executed. As my understanding was that the DeviceApi17.java class should only be executed if you use API17, since we only start support from 17 and up? Instead the lines read as follows.  First [here](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/development/app/src/main/java/com/SecUpwN/AIMSICD/service/CellTracker.java#L397-L400), then [here](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/development/app/src/main/java/com/SecUpwN/AIMSICD/service/CellTracker.java#L948-L950):   ``` java  public List<Cell> updateNeighbouringCells() { ...             //LISTEN_CELL_INFO added in API 17             if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT > 16) {                 DeviceApi17.startListening(tm, phoneStatelistener);             } else { ...     public void onLocationChanged(Location loc) {         //Log.i(mTAG, "in onLocationChanged(Location loc)");         if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT > 16) {             DeviceApi17.loadCellInfo(tm, mDevice);         } ... ```  What to do? 
`BUILD SUCCESSFUL` That seems to have fixed it! 
You are right. I might have moved the map around, or zoomed out and in before I had 500 caches. Still I can pretty good reproduce (as on my home location there is only one unfound cache) that caches disappear from view.  Maybe you could try with any location by: - Open live map - Set strategy "Fast" - Zoom out or move until 500 caches are "buffered" - Slightly zoom west/east (in my case this works best) to see whether caches go missing
I tested both @asiekierka 
@AlexGilleran I've figured out why it would fail. I called `getRequestXML` directly after the request instance is created. After moving this line into the observer of the `execute` method it works perfectly.  I used to think the XML should have been usable after the request is created. :( 
Looks good to me!
I've edited the post to add the most recent version, It's happened every time I've run it overnight. I'm hoping there's a solution, I really want to see how the creatures will turn out if I allow it to run overnight.
I'm following this page https://github.com/dcm4che/dcm4chee-arc-light/wiki/Proxy-retrieve-requests-to-another-Archive The c-find requests do not contain study instance UIDs. Is this the intended behavior then?
@cemrich Actually a lot of "Planet Wissen" videos are affected (probably more tv shows I guess). For example when I search for `Planet Wissen` right now, there's a new video called `Was ist das Pferd eigentlich für ein Tier?` from `ARD`. When I tap now on the download button of "Low" quality, the resulting video doesn't have any extension. I can play it in the view from the Download Manager app (I guess because it still knows the MIME type from the just downloaded file) but I can't open it from a file manager for example because the file manager can't see the MIME type that has been sent.
I fixed my code. I used this combination during debugging. Still this should be fixed in future. pumpPresort is parameter without action (similar to cache size). Then I can choose or disable cahce. So I would expect that specified pumpPresort without pumpSource will behave as EMPTY source or without any action

@dain  I have tried both methods, text formats is correct while ORC isnt.
This is not conditional on the` catapultsString.delm`. It can be whatever. Just make it `catapultsString.delm <- "foobar"`. The problem is the "interpreter" in R/Rstudio or, maybe, Shiny, actually...

Ah, twould make sense to include that. I am using 4.8.5.147  Edited on original post for reference.
After replacing the IC2 feeder with the admin feeder, the messages stopped.  I then went back to the IC2 feeder and the messages returned like before.  This happens even when the net retains a constant 20k charge.
For a lot of my use cases, I need a fixed time interval between points.  Geotagging DSLR  photos is one case.  If I am stopping and starting a lot, then interpolating a position between GPS track points based on time is unreliable if there are too many seconds between points.  Currently, I need to carry a garmin GPS as well as my cell phone to collect the more detailed trail.  The screenshot below shows a geoparazzi file in blue and a garmin GPS trail in red.    ![Canyonleigh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5060805/67382297-9860e380-f5d0-11e9-894f-a14b60d8c5b9.jpg) 
Everything works perfectly in single player. I figured, well mcpc+ has updated a few times, there had been no mention of any enderio related fixes but, let's try it out anyways.  I placed a long run of cable (fifteen or more blocks), attached everything exactly as I had in my original picture and sure enough, it is working.   I am now using version 0.5.0.98 of EnderIO with version 4.2.1 of Buildcraft on mcpc+ version 160.   Here's a picture of it up and running: http://i.imgur.com/8BkxLnW.png  Thank you for getting back to me, I'm sorry I can't give you anything more concrete then "poof, it's working now". I've gotten used to things breaking and, subsequently fixing. It comes with the territory, running one hundred and sixty four mods together. MCPC+ of course, has always been a bit wonky.  
No sorry :( I still get crash reports because of this... 
Yup. I have to admit, I am a C/C++/kernel guy but I will look at it. I think it's a JRE thing.  Rob 
Yes, this issue occurs after registerering a single nested query. The attached pictures show results after execution of about 300 000 search requests (percolate queries). 
I am using version 1.0.3. The issue is with the "logger" definition.  When I create the logger as below, the application runs without issue: logger("com.abc.def", INFO, ["FILE"]) root(WARN, ["FILE", "cloud-watch"])  But as soon as I use the "cloud-watch" appender in the logger definition, the application fails to start: logger("com.abc.def", INFO, ["FILE", "cloud-watch"]) root(WARN, ["FILE", "cloud-watch"])
Good question - it started by setting the recovery modus and restarting the application 
Sure!  There's probably at least 2 cases to test: * image uploaded * link to image with inline preview
Yeah good call - if we convert everything to YML first, hopefully it should parse out any comments for us.
@timtay-microsoft The clients are sending at least 1 message every 4 minutes and they're authenticated with device key.  As for MQTT that's the last exception that appears, it seems there's some serious problem with the reconnect, right now the only way to make iot hub work continuously and reconnect on connection loss is to treat DISCONNECTED_RETRYING as DISCONNECTED, closing the client en opening a new one.
I do even get strange results when disabling the save actions (from enabled to disabled):  ``` diff -@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:enabled; -pages[normalize_page_numbers] +@Comment{jabref-meta: saveActions:disabled;pages[normalize_page_numbers]  month[normalize_month]  author[normalize_names]  booktitle[ordinals_to_superscript]  title[protect_terms]  ;} ``` 
I tried that, but it behaves the same way. When I use ldapsearch directly, as follows:  ldapsearch -b "dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxxx,dc=com" -p 10389 -h localhost -s one  I received the following  ecodev@mia-hq-jakku.mia.usa.sinvest:/opt/eco/ecodev/myvd-server-1.0.1/bin >> ldapsearch -b "dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com" -p 10389 -h localhost -s one # extended LDIF # # LDAPv3 # base <dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com> with scope oneLevel # filter: (objectclass=*) # requesting: ALL #  # groups, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=groups,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: groups objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole  # users, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=users,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: users objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole  # officers, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=officers,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: officers objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole  # employees, dev.xxxxxxx.com dn: cn=employees,dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com description: generic groups branch cn: officers cn: employees objectClass: top objectClass: organizationalRole          *# Affiliates, bsi.xxxxxxx.com <http://bsi.xxxxxxx.com>dn: OU=Affiliates,dc=bsi,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=comou: AffiliatesuSNCreated: 63578description: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxwhenChanged: 20160119190541.0ZobjectClass: topobjectClass: organizationalUnitstreet:: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*   and about 70 response more, all of them from the AD. Interesting thing is that the entries returned from the AD have DN, *OU=Affiliates,dc=bsi,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com *but the filter of the search is b "dc=dev,dc=xxxxxxx,dc=com", so they should not appear.

It still doesn't create directories inside my repository nor downloads any artifacts. Creating .gem\bin manually and copying the cucumber script yielded limited success. After another Maven run, further subdirectories of .gem had been created, but no gems had been downloaded.

Minecraft version: 1.12.2 AS version: 1.7 Forge version: 1.12.2-14.23.0.2512  I assumed that losing infusion was intentional due to the last line in the "Infused Crystal Tools" chapter in the book (in Constellation; line reads "However, that also comes with the possibility that the liquid might be drained at some point..."). I've noted twice now that occasionally, when using the sword rapidly (i.e. against >10 mobs), it will convert from "Infused Crystal Sword" to "Crystal Sword," retaining all of its enchantments, size, purity, and current cutting. Advanced tooltips also show that the item is converted from astralsorcery:itemchargedcrystalsword to astralsorcery:itemcrystalsword.  I did just update AS to 1.7.2 yesterday, and have yet to have this happen again, but I haven't really used the sword much since then. I will see if I can replicate the issue.
I can try building the app tomorrow evening :) Thank you for the quick response and the fix :+1: 
please see above (issue description), i shared code of DTO and Controller  
## I can indeed provide you with a plugin - I made a quick test-only plugin that houses the customdata and minimum code to auto-add it to placed tileentities and entities that meet specific criterion, and right-clicking them with a blazerod will show the data toString() , showing Optional.empty() or Optional[all-data-lumped-in-string-text].  Creative mode and specific info are displayed onlogin.  The version of the customdata included is one that a) spews the complaint about the builder not implimenting abstract something on startup  b) has a list of strings to store uuids  c) has a lot of other messy code usage.  Every time I ask for help with it, I'm told that I "should do x a different way" based on whoever is sharing info at the time about the way they like to write particular things, 'but that works too'  and much of it is cobbled from whatever snips I can piece together.  The strings-of-uuids originated from wasting a tonne of time with raw uuids back in the days when there was no native support for uuids, and when finally cobbling code from various helpful people, was botched due to byte-order switching, so I stuck with strings.   I planned to change them to UUIDs when upgrading to 1.10.2, but I've only done so with vanilla, so it may be a simple thing I did wrong, or a complex thing that doesnt work right, but a simple switch to lists of uuids resulted in the server spamming Future-task errors with stacktrace NOT pointing to lines in my plugin.  So while you may wish to criticise my choices and say "Why the fudge are you using strings, you should use native uuids, you just switch x to y its not that hard" I still wait for someone to provide a proven working example since I've exhausted my attempts at it, and can't separate my-bad from 'maybe-its-sponge' possibilities with certainty.  Criticising the rest of the custom data methods is fine, if some actual code is provided for "you need to .." that takes the guesswork out of getting the code to match what specifically 'needs to..', or to say "x method does nothing at this time, we just included it for future purposes, where you commented about "why return empty here? What is this method?" etc :smile:   That caveat stated, I did a LOT of backpeddling from making various changes thinking I was missing something, but it wasn't the various combinations of approaches that were the cause after all, and this version presented is the existing 'rollback' that was last tried, and does demonstrate the working-notworking after reboot DIFFERENCES seen between entities and tile entities and  EVERYTHING-IS-FINE working with SpongeForge  phenomenon described.  ---  Plugin JAR File  ==  http://www.ethicraft.net/CustDataPersistTester.jar  Pastebin of classes for this tester plugin: http://pastebin.com/E2atAaMu

This happend after dbeaver restart. Im not opening hude number of gui resources, this is latest eclipse ptd, with few plugins. Also I have try to add more memory in eclipse.ini  - 2gb.  If I go to one table, got error, then go to another table - then error not appears, when clicking on er diagram, just light gray background displayed in tab.  When installing DBeaver, I miss installing GEF and draw2k. Then add update site for GEF and installed both, latest versions. I guess it was possible without adding update site, just unable to find them in list of all packages and categories for oxygen.2
Yes I get normal drops from zombies and skeletons, (bones, arrows, flesh, etc) just no heads.  I have custom mods installed, quite a few really, they include Solar Flux, buildcraft, villager trade tables, extra utils, elevator mod, enderstorage, forestry, autopickup, JEI and JER, minecolonies, weirding gadget, waystones, tech expansion and torcherino, and of course, woot.  I build the T4 factory and add Tier 3 upgrades for Rate, XP, Mass and Decapitate, as i said before I know power is no problem (High Tier solar panels) and I get Creeper Heads and Wither Skulls fine, but not the other 2.
We tried Glue API and CREATE TABLE in Aurora. Haven't found any other problems yet.

@jmakeig and @clockworked247, thanks for the comments.  If I've worked long and hard to create a mapping definition in QuickStart, that definition's representation in the UI should not break if a user deletes/updates/adds documents in Staging.  I like the idea of highlighting properties that the UI can no longer find. (And that can happen currently if a user adds or deletes documents in Staging.) I also think the user should also see the type and value information that was there before. The UI can't show this information with the current data model when the property is gone.  
Hello @nlalitha... This is fixed in our latest release `1.1.1` 
Oh this could actually be it. I will test it at differently signed coordinates.
No, I have no particular reason to use Jasmin, I just followed this tutorial: https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki/Creating-a-class-from-scratch I've switched to the BafASM backend now (that's what you meant, right?), but I get the same error (see stacktrace below). I'll make a PR, as soon as I got the time.

we are currently using forge 10.13.4.1492 universal. After turning off android spawning we were able to play for several hours without incident, I transformed myself into an android and spent a good portion of that time as one without incident (although for some reason it wouldn't let me take the damage upgrade, but I was in creative at the time so it may have had something to do with that). I'll let you know if anything else comes up, and thank you for looking into this. 
@gsmet yes, this can be closed.  The main issue we saw wrt perf regression was #686 . After fixing #686 and changing the jdk build used to performance test, we are back to similar allocation rates and GC events as before.

Typo... managed bindings... as in not manually installed. That may not be the correct way to describe this, but similar to managed/unmanaged Items and Things.

For example, if there is an 8FE/t solar Flux reborn solarpanel on the battery and the battery is full then only 8 FE/t will be output. Without an incoming energy source, 2000 will be output or what you specify in the configs.
Updated question with config :)
@stychu it's not that it doesn't start, it simply hangs in the "initializing hot reload" doesn't always happen but when attached to debugger it happens way more than not.
version: { number: "0.90.2", snapshot_build: false, lucene_version: "4.3.1" }, 
The issue is solved
Hi @fmichielssen ,  You are right that it shouldn't affect the manually created service in any way, although it seems to me that it does delete the services. I've tried it with the original example configuration on minikube and with a slightly modified one using kubernetes with ACS. The problem were the same in both cases.   I've tried to collect more info about it, please let me know if I'm missing something and maybe that causes the problem.    In the config file, I use the following settings: ``` container-backend: kubernetes     kubernetes:       internal-networking: true       image-pull-policy: Never       url: http://localhost:8001 ``` After kubernetes' initial setup, I create a deployment with kubectl and the specified yaml file, then create the service the same way.   The service is the following:  ```apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: shinyproxy-service spec:   type: LoadBalancer   selector:     app: shinyproxy   ports:   - protocol: TCP     port: 8080     targetPort: 8080 ``` I can access the service, log in to shinyproxy and successfully launch the demo application. Looking at the kubernetes dashboard, everything seems fine and the started container shows up as a new pod. After I close the window and the heartbeat timeout reaches the limit, shinyproxy starts to shut down the proxy.   I've placed some logging in the `doStopProxy` function to see what's happening: ``` @Override 	protected void doStopProxy(KubernetesContainerProxy proxy) throws Exception { 		log.info("Deleting pod: " + getProxy(proxy).getPod().toString()); 		kubeClient.pods().delete(getProxy(proxy).getPod());  		try { 			ServiceList myServices = kubeClient.services().list(); 			 			List<Service> items = myServices.getItems(); 			log.info("Trying to list service items");  			for(int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) { 				log.info("service number " + i + ": "); 				log.info("kind: " + items.get(i).getKind()); 				log.info("name: " + items.get(i).getMetadata().getName()); 				log.info("cluster name: " + items.get(i).getMetadata().getClusterName()); 				log.info("creation timestamp: " + items.get(i).getMetadata().getCreationTimestamp()); 			} 		} catch (Exception e) { 			e.printStackTrace(); 		}  		log.info("getProxy(proxy).getService(): " + getProxy(proxy).getService()); 		 		log.info("Deleting proxy service"); 		kubeClient.services().delete(getProxy(proxy).getService()); 		 		try { 			ServiceList myServices = kubeClient.services().list(); 			 			List<Service> items = myServices.getItems(); 			log.info("Trying to list service items");  			for(int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) { 				log.info("service number " + i + ": "); 				log.info("kind: " + items.get(i).getKind()); 				log.info("name: " + items.get(i).getMetadata().getName()); 				log.info("cluster name: " + items.get(i).getMetadata().getClusterName()); 				log.info("creation timestamp: " + items.get(i).getMetadata().getCreationTimestamp()); 			} 		} catch (Exception e) { 			e.printStackTrace(); 		} 	} ``` This is the relevant part of the log I've got: ``` 2018-04-27 12:26:32.538  INFO 1 --- [HeartbeatThread] e.o.shinyproxy.services.ProxyService     : Releasing inactive proxy [user: testuser] [app: 01_hello] [silence: 76534ms] 2018-04-27 12:26:32.545  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : Deleting pod: Pod(apiVersion=v1, kind=Pod, ... ) 2018-04-27 12:26:32.731  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : Trying to list service items 2018-04-27 12:26:32.739  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : service number 0:  2018-04-27 12:26:32.739  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : kind: Service 2018-04-27 12:26:32.739  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : name: kubernetes 2018-04-27 12:26:32.740  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : cluster name: null 2018-04-27 12:26:32.740  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : creation timestamp: 2018-04-27T11:53:57Z 2018-04-27 12:26:32.741  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : service number 1:  2018-04-27 12:26:32.741  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : kind: Service 2018-04-27 12:26:32.741  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : name: shinyproxy-service 2018-04-27 12:26:32.741  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : cluster name: null 2018-04-27 12:26:32.742  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : creation timestamp: 2018-04-27T12:00:36Z 2018-04-27 12:26:32.742  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : getProxy(proxy).getService(): null 2018-04-27 12:26:32.742  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : Deleting proxy service 2018-04-27 12:26:33.226  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.s.c.kubernetes.KubernetesBackend     : Trying to list service items 2018-04-27 12:26:33.227  INFO 1 --- [pool-1-thread-1] e.o.shinyproxy.services.ProxyService     : Proxy released [user: testuser] [app: 01_hello] ``` In the log, you can see that before the delete operation there is 2 available service: shinyproxy-srvice and kubernetes. Although we don't have any service associated with the proxy and `getProxy(proxy).getService()` value is null, the two service gets deleted.   Looking at the kubernetes dashboard I can see that the pod is successfully deleted, my shinyproxy-service is also disappeared, and the kubernetes service is restarted(its age is just a few seconds).   I'm not familiar with the kubernetes java client, but could it be the issue that the filtering at `kubeClient.services().delete(getProxy(proxy).getService()); ` line is not working as expected and if it gets a null value it deletes every service?   It would be nice if you could do a quick test with the example config and see whether you can access the service after shinyproxy deletes the pod.      
We are launching local tests right now, we will do a PR when finished.

Yeah, certainly looks like the natives trouble (btw, the os is Windows 7 and Windows 8, both 64 bit). The cause of the exception, unfortunately, does not tell much more. There is only one cause (calling `getCause()` on it returnes `null`), and it is not much different than the original message:  ``` java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.bytedeco.javacpp.avutil$AVFrame at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:366) at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:355) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:354) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:425) at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:308) at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:358) at nest.java.JavaCVPlayer.loadFile(JavaCVPlayer.java:89) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:57) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:606) at clojure.lang.Reflector.invokeMatchingMethod(Reflector.java:93) at clojure.lang.Reflector.invokeInstanceMethod(Reflector.java:28) at user$eval1642.invoke(form-init7720092785525042840.clj:1) at clojure.lang.Compiler.eval(Compiler.java:6703) at clojure.lang.Compiler.eval(Compiler.java:6666) at clojure.core$eval.invoke(core.clj:2927) at clojure.main$repl$read_eval_print__6625$fn__6628.invoke(main.clj:239) at clojure.main$repl$read_eval_print__6625.invoke(main.clj:239) at clojure.main$repl$fn__6634.invoke(main.clj:257) at clojure.main$repl.doInvoke(main.clj:257) at clojure.lang.RestFn.invoke(RestFn.java:1523) at clojure.tools.nrepl.middleware.interruptible_eval$evaluate$fn__870.invoke(interruptible_eval.clj:67) at clojure.lang.AFn.applyToHelper(AFn.java:152) at clojure.lang.AFn.applyTo(AFn.java:144) at clojure.core$apply.invoke(core.clj:624) at clojure.core$with_bindings_STAR_.doInvoke(core.clj:1862) at clojure.lang.RestFn.invoke(RestFn.java:425) at clojure.tools.nrepl.middleware.interruptible_eval$evaluate.invoke(interruptible_eval.clj:51) at clojure.tools.nrepl.middleware.interruptible_eval$interruptible_eval$fn__912$fn__915.invoke(interruptible_eval.clj:183) at clojure.tools.nrepl.middleware.interruptible_eval$run_next$fn__905.invoke(interruptible_eval.clj:152) at clojure.lang.AFn.run(AFn.java:22) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) ```  Is there any special, not very traditional mechanism that is used to load the native libraries?

@wojteg1337  I'm using slider in video player and try to hide and display it over time or user press. I personally never seen such crashes but there are some reports on Google Play Console. These crashes seen only on Android 6 and Android 7 These are my functions to animate it: <pre> showControls = () => {     this.setState({ hideControls: false }, () => {       Animated.parallel([         Animated.timing(this.animControls, { toValue: 1, duration: 100, useNativeDriver: true })       ]).start();     });   } </pre> <pre> hideControls = () => {     Animated.parallel([       Animated.timing(this.animControls, { toValue: 0, duration: 200, useNativeDriver: true })     ]).start(() => this.setState({ hideControls: true }));   } </pre>  `this.animControls` is opacity of slider's parent and when `hideControls` is `true` we don't render slider   
Yes they are.  
OS X El Capitan, Unity 5.3 and 5.4.  I'm not sure if a GIF would be super useful, the steps are simply:  Add a break point Press Attach to Unity and select it in the list Press play on Unity  The Consulo console will say Successfully Attached to Unity, but the breakpoints won't fire.  Pressing pause in the debugger will pause Unity however, so it definitely seems attached. This is the same on three different computers of mine. 
When I open 1, 2 or any number of expandable areas all is right if I don't swipe, I can scroll freely and the text view is not affected.  I made another video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2pRXzMhlIpFRjJxaVljTUpBVlk/edit?usp=sharing  It seems the problem is directly related with swiping. 
@eivantsov  @riuvshin   Thank you for your reply!  `docker run --rm --net host eclipse/che-ip:nightly` returned `192.168.65.3`, and it work fine.  In my Docker for mac `Preferences> Advanced> Docker subnet` is set to` 192.168.65.0`. So it may can't to get correct IP by it.

Hi,  This is not a test of my (wish it was!)... it's something that start happening a few times a week, since we start making calls between desktop and mobile (3G/HSDPA/4G cellphone) users.  I imagine that can be caused by something like you describe (corrupted video), but I don't have a way to reproduce it.  Do you think upgrading to 2.11 will help ? Is there a date for 2.12 ?
Hello,  I saw the update about 5 minutes after I posted this. Worked like a charm thank you 
Thanks for the fix, update it on our side and set it to autoupdate. Basically that means as long as you don't make fundamental changes to project structure and keep tagging versions in the same scheme, everything should be fine.  We use a straightforward text file for the build instructions, e.g. see https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/HEAD/metadata/de.guerda.matekarte.txt , so just fork the repo, apply your changes, commit them and open a merge request.  Our server part at https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/ has some python script that help to check the syntax, look for updates, build the app and provide standard commit messages. If you don't want to use these tools, this is fine, too. Just keep two things in mind if you do it by hand: First, use `git pull --rebase` to pull in changes from our master. That helps to keep our repo clean from "merge branch" messages. And second, prefix your commit message with the app name (like "Matekarte: Changed description.") That way we don't have to lookup the actually changed app/files. 
This seems to be resolved in https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm/issues/87
release 2.5.1d 
Java does the shift only with distance specified with 5 bits. e.g. in Java's 5 bit shift distance 0xA0A0 << 0x20 is not 0x0000 but 0xA0A0 (equal to no shift) You should have something like "if shift distance > 31 then result=0 else result =base<<distance" 
@ascrutae   I can't provide demo now. Because it's been too long.@wu-sheng  i think so.
Pig, horse, and villager. I haven't tried other types. Only W key works -- directing with mouse works though. 
> @timurt , what is root reason of problem ? What is missed ?  Saxon has different implementations to evaluate different types of query.  So `//CLASS_DEF | //METHOD_DEF` and `//CLASS_DEF | //CLASS_DEF//METHOD_DEF` are considered to be two different types of query and they are being evaluated differently.  First type is the simple binary query, second one is more complex and uses `VennExpression` class.  Inside `VennExpression` implementation there is call to [GlobalOrderComparer.compare](https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/javadoc/net/sf/saxon/expr/sort/GlobalOrderComparer.html#compare-net.sf.saxon.om.Item-net.sf.saxon.om.Item-) method  From documentation:  > A Comparer used for comparing nodes in document order. This comparer is used when there is no guarantee that the nodes being compared come from the same document  Here is implementation of the method ``` public int compare(Item a, /*@NotNull*/ Item b) {         if (a == b) {             return 0;         }         long d1 = ((NodeInfo) a).getTreeInfo().getDocumentNumber();         long d2 = ((NodeInfo) b).getTreeInfo().getDocumentNumber();         if (d1 == d2) {             return ((NodeInfo) a).compareOrder((NodeInfo) b);         }         return Long.signum(d1 - d2);     } ``` As you see Saxon assumes that it is possible nodes to be from different trees and to verify it Saxon retrieves `TreeInfo` object from nodes. Nodes from one tree should have same `TreeInfo`.

Apparently, this is also a known issue in Java map implementation, keys can also leak if they are mutable.   I guess its the users responsibility to be careful.  
Sure thing i've added a couple of fixed items & couple regular drawer items!! By the way it's a cool library i'd love to integrate it in my new app :)     setSupportActionBar((Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar_home));         getSupportActionBar().setDisplayShowHomeEnabled(true);         getSupportActionBar().setTitle("Dash Board");  ```     setDrawerTheme(             new DrawerTheme(this)                     .setBackgroundColorRes(R.color.my_primary_light_color)      );        addItems(new DrawerItem()                     .setTextPrimary(getString(R.string.messages))                     .setTextSecondary(getString(R.string.detail_messages))                     .setImage(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.messages))                     .setOnItemClickListener(new DrawerItem.OnItemClickListener() {                         @Override                         public void onClick(DrawerItem drawerItem, long l, int i) {                             Intent toMessages = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MessagesActivity.class);                             startActivity(toMessages);                         }                     }), new DrawerItem()                     .setTextPrimary(getString(R.string.stats))                     .setTextSecondary(getString(R.string.detail_stats))                     .setImage(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.stats))      );      addFixedItems(new DrawerItem()                     .setTextPrimary(getString(R.string.emplpoi))                     .setTextSecondary(getString(R.string.detail_emploi))                     .setImage(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.scedule)),             new DrawerItem()                     .setTextPrimary(getString(R.string.accueil))                     .setTextSecondary(getString(R.string.detail_acceuil))                     .setImage(getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.home))       ); ```  only the last item is displayed when (the last item & the last FixedItem)  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10850787/8036039/dc50d1ac-0dec-11e5-99f3-bceaf4014a62.png)

We don't use guava (in the projects that I care about for this, mostly api projects that need to be broadly available, hence 1.6, and have minimal dependencies). Up until now, immutables has been generating 1.6 compatible code without guava (at least with the features I care about). 
You mean `ref`, not implementation, right? So the second example, yes. I just tried it again and got the following: First example (directly specified `@RequestBody`): ```yml   /rest/test:     post:       requestBody:         content:           application/json:             schema:               $ref: '#/components/schemas/DifferentObject'         required: true       responses:         201:           description: Created ``` Second example (`@RequestBody` using `ref`): ```yml   /rest/test:     post:       requestBody:         $ref: '#/components/requestBodies/test'         content:           '*/*':             schema:               $ref: '#/components/schemas/SomeObject'       responses:         201:           description: Created ```  Also note that the second one says content type `*/*` instead of `application/json`. This changes to `application/json` after you annotate the method with `@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON`
I'd say it's still a bug, especially if the warning is visible to the user. We generally fail tests on unexpected warnings.
We have following class RedisLock invoking the redisson lock api:      public void acquireLock(final Object object) {         getLockInstance(object).lock(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);     }     public void releaseLock(final Object object) {         getLockInstance(object).unlock();     }     public void acquireReadLock(final Object object) {         getReadWriteLockInstance(object).readLock().lock();     }     public void releaseReadLock(final Object object) {         getReadWriteLockInstance(object).readLock().unlock();     }      public void acquireWriteLock(final Object object) {              getReadWriteLockInstance(object).writeLock().lock(5000,  TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);     }     public void releaseWriteLock(final Object object) {          getReadWriteLockInstance(object).writeLock().unlock();     }      private RLock getLockInstance(final Object object) {         Assert.notNull(object, "Cannot lock or unlock a null object");          final RLock rLock = this.redisson.getLock(Integer.toString(object.hashCode()));         if (rLock == null) {             throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot get lock instance.");         }         return rLock;     }      private RReadWriteLock getReadWriteLockInstance(final Object object) {         Assert.notNull(object, "Cannot lock or unlock a null object");          final RReadWriteLock rwLock = this.redisson.getReadWriteLock(Integer.toString(object.hashCode()));         if (rwLock == null) {             throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot get read write lock instance.");         }         return rwLock;     }  This is used at multiple places with following pattern        `  try {             this.redisLock.acquireLock(object);            //  do work           } finally {              this.redisLock.releaseLock(object);         } `   Let me know if you need anything else.
Sorry no. After upgrading the OS and Xcode the build stopped being that slow. We can close this issue and I’ll reopen if I see it again. I hope I never have to deal with a build so slow it overflows an integer though. :-)

I can deal with dependencies of different version. Not a pretty setup but doable.  https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv-examples/blob/52ff65a0b58889b623bab525268d593f2a4817be/OpenCV2_Cookbook/build.sbt#L50  Here it is a bit different due to `parent` declaration. When I am trying to use artifact `opencv` it requires its parent according to what is in POM (artifact `javacpp-presets`). It is treated different than just a dependency.  My suggestion is to release parent when children are released.

Sure,  But, If I use redis server on my win7, the problem was the same, so that code does not work with not embedded redis server. 
Yup, I did some tcpdump and saw some references to segment numbers that should be sealed.  The current segment number is around ~2400 and I saw some segment metrics reported for 641 (for segment_write_bytes).  ![screen shot 2017-08-31 at 2 07 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9335655/29935839-971bd7de-8e56-11e7-9c1a-c2aa53218638.png)  My understanding with the dropwizard metrics, it just sends whatever it has in memory as a gauge to the configured statsd endpoint.  I'm assuming if Pravega isn't actively removing those metrics, then they will continue to be sent on the interval.  Also note that the 65K points per second includes our downsampling points (writing data to lower precision), so its not all pravega traffic. 
No, it only fires once. 
You were right, this is a duplicate of #1650  Session is not working properly. Sometimes it works other times not and I think I found the reason.  Start a fresh Spigot 1.8.8 server with only the AuthMe plugin. https://i.gyazo.com/e432cf56645ccd3cb66730b7e00f6939.png https://i.gyazo.com/3cc11a79246df7be3087f3ad877ec691.png  Spigot Version: git-Spigot-21fe707-e1ebe52 (MC: 1.8.8) (Implementing API version 1.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT) AuthMe Version: AuthMeReloaded v5.5.0-SNAPSHOT (build: 2153) Server is in offline mode.  Only i change 3 settings in config.yml  > settings: >     sessions: >         # Do you want to enable the session feature? >         # If enabled, when a player authenticates successfully, >         # his IP and his nickname is saved. >         # The next time the player joins the server, if his IP >         # is the same as last time and the timeout hasn't >         # expired, he will not need to authenticate. >         enabled: true >         # After how many minutes should a session expire? >         # A player's session ends after the timeout or if his IP has changed >         timeout: 1440  > maxRegPerIp: 0  > logLevel: DEBUG  For testing.  Enter with nick: md_5 and sessions work fine. Enter with nick: Xephi and sessions don't work.  md_5 it has lowercase only. Xephi has a capital letter. Session only seems to work well with nicks that are written in lowercase. AuthMe saves the nicknames in lowercase only, that is why the session never corresponds.

Sorry the pack I was using didn't have the fix, So I didn't know. 
When the client starts there is a loding time. In this time i wanted to resize the window. When i resized the window by dragging from top border it moved and resized in height.  So when i started resizing the bounds were like  x:300 y:100 w:400 h:600. After resizing it was about x:300 y:183 w:400 h:517. While resizing it moved the window by the same amount the window got resized.  I think it could be resize and drag at the same moment, based on the window size. Because the windows forms top border was ca 83px under the mouse after dragging.  P.S. Not real numbers and i can not reproduce it because my pc is without os atm.
When I try to use the previous scoreboard, I get a problem with BungeeCord. At the player's respawn, he is thrown from the server. I also tested version 1.11 and found the same bug there.

This is the line where the redirect is built: https://github.com/OpenGrok/OpenGrok/blob/master/web/utils.js#L416   I'm running 0.12.1 under Tomcat 7 behind a node proxy that I'm writing (because of Reasons). It would appear that I was having two issues: I had initially configured the proxy to follow redirects, so I'd get the correct page but the user-agent didn't end up adding the trailing slash. Once I corrected that then it appears that OpenGrok is redirecting to its internal IP, rather than that of the proxy. I shall have a dig into the code and see what headers I should be adding. 
I can reproduce it like this: 1. `create db test <root/>` 2. Insert nodes: `for $i in 1 to 1000000 return insert node <test/> into /root` 3. Replace values: `for $i in /root/* return replace value of node $i with "test2"` --> cancel during execution 4. No more queries can be executed  Sometimes it works, i guess it depends on the point of time of the cancellation. It seems that the query is still running cause executing of other database commands isnt possible too. 
Hi Sure, I have tested locally and updating the `bundleImportPackages` seems to be working. I'll submit a PR.

@clintongormley maybe not all :) does Elasticsearch have a specific allowed set of field name character? ideally it should follow that as much as it can, right?  mainly used as an example to remind me what to change. I am still in the process of investigating how to properly declare these specific unicode character types within Joni
```    private static final byte[] badQuals = { 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 61, 62, 58, 57, 56 };     private static final byte[] goodQuals = { 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60 };     private static final byte[] fixedQuals = { 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 30, 31, 27, 26, 25 }; ```  the byte arrays get modified by the tests 
I've tested it with the tank robot. Buildcraft version is 6.4.8, FML version is 7.10.103.1352, Forge version is 10.13.2.1352 1. get robot to pick up some lava from a tank (make sure the robot won't completely fill it's tank) 2. get robot to move to another tank to pick up lava 3. switch lava out with water before robot gets to tank 4. have robot place fluid in empty tank 5. water has been transformed to lava 
Yep it's there
Sure, that would work, but is this a hoop that the user should need to jump through? Perhaps it's rare enough not to worry about?
Is there a way to setup delay/throttle,something between 3-4 seconds, for active scan HTTP request? Some bug bounty program requires researchers to limit their tool, auto scanner, HTTP request. e.g. 1 request per 3 secs. As a result, text box allows testers to set delay they preferred.
Reinstalled the latest update. The Hitomi (webp file extension) source is giving me the same issue.
Yes it is by every single video without pressing the play button.  I reinstalled the latest release 1.1 that has nothing changed.

Yeah sorry. Think this was caused by a pack that isn't used anymore. Smooth sailing since then
Yes, with no problem on the other device...
If I enable the "run in the foreground" sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Syncthing running  while switching on/off the WiFi toggle.
What I'm thinking now is to check network connection and retry pulling data multiple times (it will take some time, but it's better than fail) 
Yes, Xperia M4 Aqua with k9mail.  I thought it's a easy thing (like in HTML) to add it to a special field or something like this.
Update: IOS applications is the reason!! All works smooth from android + desktop and then ... When i login from ios application and run something BOOM! --> The desktop client stop working! Very very weird!!! 
I am using version. 14.1.1-RC-3.  As for security I meant my own security issues without encrypyion as information that would be passed is sensitive I do apologize for the confusion.  As a simple request, would it be possible to add an optional password to the encryption so if you don't have the password you cannot read the encrypted data? I just want as much informational security as possible. 
I have three hard drive (C, D and E), and I have some tests, Here is the results.  - when zap.bat located at drive C, %HOMEPATH% can find .ZAP_JVM.properties - when zap.bat located at another drive except drive C like drive D, %HOMEPATH% can't find .ZAP_JVM.properties  ``` C:\Users\scofield>if exist "%HOMEPATH%\OWASP ZAP\.ZAP_JVM.properties" (echo true) else (echo false) true  C:\Users\scofield>D:  D:\>if exist "%HOMEPATH%\OWASP ZAP\.ZAP_JVM.properties" (echo true) else (echo false) false  D:\>E:  E:\>if exist "%HOMEPATH%\OWASP ZAP\.ZAP_JVM.properties" (echo true) else (echo f alse) false ```  I think maybe windows can automatically add current drive when use %HOMEPATH%. So when we use start zap in drive C, everything is fine. When we start in another drive, %HOMEPATH% is not we want.
Thank you for your quick reply. getLocations returns only one location if I remember. I didn't call getValidLocations.  I have just done another test, and no problem here. getLocations and getValidLocations return 20 entries. See [logfile](https://gist.github.com/sekiroh/ef633e5734f7c09b2906f0a8d4445fcf)  This time, wifi connection wasn't enabled when starting, perhaps a problem when previous location is obtained from network, and new from gps? 
> Did you perhaps rename or delete a world recently?  no. Thanks for fix! 
Only thing that comes to mind is a verbosity config as it's just a warning and not an error specifically. 
The latest version
Here's an export of the pack from the Curse/Twitch App. It's just some stuff I put together.  [Thaumcraft++-1.0.zip](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear/files/2336383/Thaumcraft%2B%2B-1.0.zip) 
I am using MCPC+ and asynchronous chunkloading is enabled.  This was not an issue before now.  I can try with the async chunkoading turned off if it would help however this error seems to come and go from time to time...even if I remain stationary keeping the nearby chunks consistently loaded. 
If my opinion can be useful, I'd say that, taking a look at the aim of spring-boot, a default configuration for resource filtering is a good thing to have, but it must be the proper configuration, not something that clashes with other pieces of the Spring Framework; hence my proposal.  The parent project **spring-boot-starter-parent**, as per doc, should provide "sensible resource filtering" - so I think that it's good to enable filtering. If somebody doesn't want any filtering in order to do everything manually, he can just remove the dependency on the parent project and include the pieces he wants to.  At our company we've got some parent poms which we use in a very similar fashion of **spring-boot-starter-parent** , and we like such project because we could just drop them and use spring-produced ones, which are good and well maintained. In our parent poms we employed filtering just like the configuration I proposed, and I must say it is **extremely hard** for filtering to be triggered inadvertently - if you need to filter anything, you'll have to do something like  ``` property=@some.value@ ```  Which is unlinkely to clash with anything else. And using it to match the version, the build number (like @dsyer suggested), along with the changeset, is precisely what we do (with great joy).  Don't fear the filtering :-) 
I'll upload video in next 24h. Paper 332 is 1.14.4.

This occurs for me when I open Intellij on a project directory for the first time, if I haven't run the following commands.  ``` shell cabal sandbox init cabal install --only-dependencies ```  I think the source of the problem is ghc-mod because I get a similar error in Vim which says:  ``` shell syntastic: error: checker haskell/ghc_mod returned abnormal status 1 ```  So my best guess is that ghc-mod is the source of the issue, but it would be nice to have Intellij catch the abnormal status as opposed to hanging.

@ojw28 and @andrewlewis   ### Issue description  While playing multiple videos in SimpleExoplayerView using different dimension configs, the last frame of the first video is overlapping on the second video, But Still, we are able to hear the audio of the second video.  ### Reproduction steps  1.Play a video in SimpleExoplayerView [Width: 100% and Height: 100 %] and after the video is completed release the player and change the visibility view to GONE.  2.play another video in a new SimpleExolayerView with different dimensions may be [Width: 50% and Height: 100%] then you will see the last frame of the first video being overlapped on the second video But still, you can able to hear the audio of the second video  ### Link to test content  My Demo Application source code is available in this link https://github.com/vishnuganta22/exoPlayerDemo    If you try installing my demo application on your device then you need to place any two videos named 1.mp4 and 2.mp4 in Downloads Folder. I have also screen recorded my device. You can watch this video for a better understanding of the behavior https://vimeo.com/229082192  ### Version of ExoPlayer being used  Exoplayer Version: r2.5.1  ### Device(s) and version(s) of Android being used  Android Version: 5.1.1  Device: Minix Neo X9      
Munin Version is 2.0.25  Sorry, i no longer have the page, because it was so painful to use it (On the app), that I had to change it to one level.  I could try to make some sample records. Which parte of the page exactly do you need ?

Hi @kosarko what you just described is the behaviour for UFAL theme, whereas using Mirage, I don't get a javascript dialog, but instead I choose the file using file chooser and fill the name - both on the workflow page and then submit it by pressing "Upload and add another" button. The first file uploads successfully and is shown in the list below. But when I upload the second file, the "Upload" page refreshes but the list is not containing the newly uploaded (second) file data.  The same happens if I continue an abandoned submission.  The only way to see that file in the list is to choose the same wortkflow step by pressing "Upload" button in top progress menu, or to press either "Prev" or "Next" and then return to the "Upload" section.  I tested it with fresh 5.3 build yesterday and in both Mirage and UFAL themes I get the same faulty behaviour. The .js files updated are UFAL-specific and don't seem to affect Mirage at all. 
> @fifadxj >  > 1. Can you show me the result of 'desc limit_request_0'? So that I can reproduce this exception. > 2. You put all codes there, I can't find what you have modified. Can you point out the root cause to this exception? > 3. And put codes which only you modified.  The issue happens when using mybatis to insert text/clob column with below config. **`<result column="request_json" property="requestJson" jdbcType="LONGVARCHAR" />`**   check org.apache.ibatis.type.ClobTypeHandler **`  public void setNonNullParameter(PreparedStatement ps, int i, String parameter, JdbcType jdbcType)       throws SQLException {     StringReader reader = new StringReader(parameter);     ps.setCharacterStream(i, reader, parameter.length());   }`** It will call PreparedStatement.setCharacterStream() which take Reader as argument type. But in AbstractShardingPreparedStatementAdapter, for all setXXX(), it always calls PreparedStatement.setObject() which does not accept Reader as argument.   The solution, if you check the code I pasted above, for all setXXX(), it will call underlying PreparedStatement's setXXX() instead of setObject(), so it solves the problem.  **PS: changing mybatis mapper configuration to  jdbcType="VARCHAR" may also solve the problem. My fix is just to make ShardingSphere support more methods in java.sql.PreparedStatement.**

> So they messed with the public API while keeping the private SQL structure untouched. Genius.  Pretty much.  I did a bit more debugging, it looks like the problem can be fixed by stripping all the whitespace from keys returned by 'keyFor()', commit (on my fork): 4c223cbf5384fd3a0213fba2b34797bc895a536d. I think that's not a good idea in general though.  I installed Timbre, search seems to work, it would be good to see how they're doing their search. 
Sure, for example:  目に立つ  Actually, as I just noted, the bug also occurs when one doesn't edit anything. When exporting the 目に立つ for example, the Kanji / Readings field becomes 目[め]に立[た]つ (which would have to be changed to 目[め]に 立[た]つ in order to have the furigana centered correctly), but the flashcard only displays 目つ then, which wasn't the case with the older version of Aedict.

@serge-rider Oracle does indeed have auto-generated columns, as of 12c.   See: https://oracle-base.com/articles/12c/identity-columns-in-oracle-12cr1  Also, see my DDL above.  Notice the ID column is `NUMBER generated as identity`. When I run that DDL, and then use DBeaver to try to re-generate the DDL, it generates the following:  I believe DBeaver should always skip columns that are marked as `GENERATED ALWAYS`... Or maybe just `GENERATED`.  ```sql CREATE TABLE "IDM"."PEOPLE"     (	"ID" NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 9999999999999999999999999999 INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE  NOKEEP  NOSCALE  NOT NULL ENABLE,  	"FIRST_NAME" VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL ENABLE,  	"LAST_NAME" VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL ENABLE,  	"CREATED_AT" TIMESTAMP (6) NOT NULL ENABLE,  	"UPDATED_AT" TIMESTAMP (6) NOT NULL ENABLE,  	 CONSTRAINT "PEOPLE_PK" PRIMARY KEY ("ID")   USING INDEX PCTFREE 10 INITRANS 2 MAXTRANS 255    STORAGE(INITIAL 65536 NEXT 1048576 MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS 2147483645   PCTINCREASE 0 FREELISTS 1 FREELIST GROUPS 1   BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT FLASH_CACHE DEFAULT CELL_FLASH_CACHE DEFAULT)   TABLESPACE "USERS"  ENABLE    ) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE    PCTFREE 10 PCTUSED 40 INITRANS 1 MAXTRANS 255   NOCOMPRESS LOGGING   STORAGE(INITIAL 65536 NEXT 1048576 MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS 2147483645   PCTINCREASE 0 FREELISTS 1 FREELIST GROUPS 1   BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT FLASH_CACHE DEFAULT CELL_FLASH_CACHE DEFAULT)   TABLESPACE "USERS"; ```

No, only in this version
Not 100% sure on what happened, The server crashed a total of four times, this is the first crash - https://pastebin.com/7xUBi1bX - My best guess is a player placed something which crashed the server then when it start backup it crashed again when the player joined.

Yes.  Mods:   antiqueatlas-5.0.3-fabric-custombuild   fabric-api-0.3.0-pre+build.165  https://paste.ee/p/C6sXu  Sorry that was with the one I built form source where you enabled the recipe for cloning Atlases, let me try again. will post a new comment with the proper jar
It happens on a specific kind of parse error (when the input string ends with a comma, for example when writing a list of sorting keys). Not very common but we should fix it soon.

@serge-rider Perfect job! I've already seen the new source code and I'll check it as soon as I back to office next Monday. 
https://github.com/Xephi/AuthMeReloaded/issues/627 
Sure, I can do that. I'll get to it as soon as I can, probably tomorrow. 
The native code, which was formerly in com.redhat... modules is now part of ceylon.test, and test/test-js tools call runTestTool function directly. 
Define "latest build" for me? In version 2.0.21 evokers revert to EVOKER_FANGS upon reload... I downloaded another of the latest version and I can't reproduce this "freaking out glitch" anymore, it must have been corrupted... But I can confirm that evokers disappear on reload...  Edit: I recreated the freaking out glitch... I will have a video later on how to reproduce this for you... It does not show any data in console when this happens either...
Without any change... armor value of the player is still same. With armor, or without. I tried it with iron armor... but bugged armor value override it... so it armor value is still full with armor, or without.     NBT with IRON ARMOR on bugged player: `https://pastebin.com/F1dERYz4`
Hi @remkop, glad to help picocli to get better with my 2 cents. Sorry for not being able to test the master branch with my code base. I'll try it out this monday hopefully.  Regards
joining server @Doomgull 
Well, I only discovered the bug because of my work on Junit5. I'd be more than happy to open an PR with a simple unit test for the regex.
Hi @bsideup , Initial Test "passes". But There are several logs like this.   It reproduces all the time on my PC.   But before making it reproducible, I played  around with `sc` properties and delays.   I've updated TC so it will fail test. 
The thing is that I already don't have to worry about this happening with later versions of Multi-Hotbar, it's the fact that people can still use an older version of it to do this, and have their own copies of it.   Is there any way for CarryOn to insure that CarryOn "items" will only stay in inventory for so long as they are actively selected, and always drop if they aren't? Otherwise there will always be the potential for various other mods to do this.

Here it is: https://ufile.io/08kbv None of the keystrokes are working. Ligatures should happen when I press aa, ee, ii, oo, th, sh, kk, pp, tt, mn and ff. All of them upper and lower cases.
Let me update the changelog (my achilles heel) ;-)

@alexkalderimis Can you take a look at this? Why would the query results behave in this manner? I couldn't replicate the problem after loading the same data source, and Joel is only having this problem on this BioGRID branch. 
Great, it was that! Incognito window solved my two different problems. Thank you! 
I tested without DS and SF, and still happened. I'll do some more tests to see what mod is breaking things. The odd thing is that it worked correctly in a similar setup (that had DS and SF), so I'll run a diff between the modlists and see what's different.
sure
You will find the content from the server under the windows server 2016 OS.  [test.txt](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/files/2358237/test.txt)

You are right. I have verified and with Microsoft SQLServer... not problem. With IBM DB2 yes (please see screenshot). I use the same driver that I used when the bug was not present, so it does not depend on the driver. Excuse me if my company use DB2 yet... ;)  ![connectionlostdata](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15998009/34606355-46a83348-f20f-11e7-9391-a61e501c8060.jpg)
SiteMap files were being produced with names like "sitemap1.xml.gz.gz" 
I tried multi_fiield and it works as what I wanted.  The mapping I use is similar to what @brwe mentioned.  ``` JSON {    "domain": {       "type": "multi_field",       "fields": {          "domain": {             "max_input_length": 50,             "preserve_separators": true,             "payloads": false,             "analyzer": "simple",             "preserve_position_increments": true,             "type": "completion"          },          "input": {             "type": "string"          }       }    } } ```  Thank you for the hint @s1monw . 
I have test with other mods, Minecraft crash only with schematica
Yes, I'm aware of the Whatsapp and Gmail limitations with quick reply, but the feature disappears after a reboot in cases were it shouldn't (never in Textra and when a single message is showing in Whatsapp). Everytime I reboot the phone one of those apps will lose the QR functionality from your mod, sometimes is Whatsapp and sometimes Textra, seems random which one it is.  Sometimes rebooting again without doing anything restores the functionality in both apps, but most of the times it doesn't. I have to disable Xnotification, reboot; re-enable it, reboot. And sometimes even that doesn't do the trick. I often find myself rebooting 6+ times in order to get it to work.  I haven't found a pattern and it seems to be happening to other folks in the XDA forum as well. 
Appears to have been a problem with some changes I was making in appengine-plugins-core in the same workspace.  
Thanks for the quick & helpful response.  I can change the Berksfile of my cookbooks, so fix (2) should be best-suited for me. I'll push the fix asap.  If I got this right I would change the first three lines in my Berksfile from  ``` source "https://api.berkshelf.com"  metadata ```  to  ``` Encoding.default_external = "UTF-8" source 'https://supermarket.chef.io' metadata ```  Right?  Is it intended that your Berksfiles in hopshadoop's chef repositories (e.g., in apache-hadoop-chef's Berksfile at https://github.com/hopshadoop/apache-hadoop-chef/blob/master/Berksfile) do not implement this fix? 
@jbduncan:  1. Test was written before the new parallel test support of junit 5 was released. So i thought using AssertAll gives me a handy way to run my tests in parallel. 2. The performance impact is virtually zero as only in case of an assertion error an element is added to the synchronized list of failures.  3. Non-deterministic is ok.  If an API supports streams it should also work if used with parallel streams - or, if for some reason it does not support parallel streams, it should be stated in the documentation of the API.
when i load jpg or png,that's not happen.but when load webP,happen sometimes 
Is the above hrof html file enough? or do you need original hrof file?

I'm not an expert on database design. What is the advantage of a separate table instead of a new column in the existing table? It seems like it may save a little space but would make queries slower and more complicated with "join" logic.
Yes, let me tell you how I have it set up.  I have a 13x13x13 compact machine that I have placed the controlled miner on each floor against the outlet wall with a one high mining level and have it black listing fences.  Then I have the collector on the opposite wall.  I have fore resource hogs sitting on a 1x1 cube with fences around them.  I have this set up on four different floors inside the compact machine.  My goal is for the controlled miner to break only the truffles and the cyclic collector to ship them out using the Cyclic item cables.  Every time I set the controlled miner to 13x13 it will not mine the truffles.  Only on the 11x11 will it collect.  I was using the Cyclic power cables, but have changed to flux points thinking there isn’t enough power  Get Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef> ________________________________ From: Sam <notifications@github.com> Sent: Saturday, August 24, 2019 1:55:24 PM To: Lothrazar/Cyclic <Cyclic@noreply.github.com> Cc: Roach009 <owensjd@hotmail.com>; Author <author@noreply.github.com> Subject: Re: [Lothrazar/Cyclic] Controlled Miner not working (filters) (#1202)   Can you explain this a bit mroe clearly?

Take a Notifier block in the designer, and pull out the property setter, which has textColor and BackgroundColor in the dropdown.  Use the dropdown switch between textColor and backgroundColor and look at the tooltip.  It does not change when you change the dropdown selection.

I'm running the application on Linux and JVM 1.8. I guess it is related to integer max value (2^31 = 2147483648) because we spot this pattern:  4464444523 (4.1G) got truncated to 169477227 (1.5M) (4464444523 % 2147483648 = 169477227) 10485760000 (9.8G) got truncated to 1895825408 (1.8G) (10485760000 % 2147483648 = 1895825408)

Technically nothing. The benefit is having a lot of states of one project that can be examined at one time = during one (longer) execution. Also, if we knew that the project is "buggy" which means that the master branch fails quite often, then we could verify the fail time and fail coverage. 
I've added hyperlinks to the resources. You can run into this issue when creating/updating apps through the REST API, importer or data explorer.
> AR's atmosphere's stop whenever it encounters a solid block like a door.  Would it not be possible to simply add +1 range to the check? To include the immediate surrounding blocks? I'm still learning basics of coding so feel free to ignore my suggestion.
That issue occurred also with some builds before. I could solve it now by deleting lacells table 
Sure, check this repo https://github.com/parunruaivo/stream-schema-test and run the test `customerCreatedEvent` 
Jose, thanks for looking in on this.    I've created a branch https://github.com/edlunde-dnastar/biojava/tree/mmcif-seqres that incorporates (1) the fix for the finding all chains in all models, and (2) disables the `replaceGroupSeqPos()` method that causes mis-numbering.  A unit test for 2KSA is in the TestDifficultMmCIFFiles.java.  The first listed residue ASP in chain A, should be residue 2.  This is correctly specified by the _atom_site records, but made incorrect by later changing again in `replaceGroupSeqPos()`.  I think trying to renumber by the _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme is actually incorrect/unnecessary here.  Take a look.  The first change would fix the bug (1) only.

Latest forge and AS version, I believe the issue is vampirism, but here are all of the other mods: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23699128/39675796-4a5faa90-5158-11e8-90c4-377231cb8337.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23699128/39675801-562de33c-5158-11e8-8982-bbd1b1ae677c.png) 
Yep. Removed all mods to check again. Issue is still present. Could it be the version of forge or codechickenlib? Edit: It's not the Codechickenlib version. Issue's still there. Also noticed https://gyazo.com/0e74fa8eb854c9ed21a1d7cd91af503d arms are  a bit wonky. Edit 2: Not the forge version either. It's solely the mod itself.  
@joewiz: Indeed, app.xql in the zip contains "stream-transform()" from my testing (line 19). Change that to just "transform()" and you should observe the behaviour I described.   @dizzzz: from an XSLT file stored in the DB via doc(). See app.xql in my zip.
My screen has 3200x1800 and it seems like RStudio only scales in integer  multiples.  The menu titles are not scaled correctly either. See attached.

I think updating the user guide to say replace step 1 from https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin with 'brew install gdb' and following the rest of the steps, then going into keychain to ensure the self signed cert is always trusted should be a sufficient update. I could try my hand at writing a post explaining it all later on if that would help. 
Hi, and sorry for the late reply. What kind of test case do you need? I thought the provided link to a sample maven project, which actually displays the probleme and the described steps in my post should be enough for an test case or do you need something else  ? 
I guess something is messed up between the blockdata and the block-damage-value, therefor some weird things happen. 
After I did some more testing it turns out this is more likely a Far from home issue as I took out underground biomes and the giant chunks of stone still generated on a world without it sorry for possibly wasting your time. The previous non UB world I did with it didn't have them so I thought it was UB causing it. I will contact Far from home about it instead.
I have discovered that there are two different bugs. The first is the issue above. Another appears when you call   ``` java notifyItemRangeRemoved(i, 1); ```  instead.  Moreover i changed some things and now I get the following error when i delete an item and call notifyItemRemoved():  ``` java java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: invalid position 2. State item count is 2             at android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.convertPreLayoutPositionToPostLayout(RecyclerView.java:3234)             at android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerViewHelper.convertPreLayoutPositionToPostLayout(RecyclerViewHelper.java:9)             at com.eowise.recyclerview.stickyheaders.StickyHeadersItemDecoration$HeaderStore.isHeader(StickyHeadersItemDecoration.java:164)             at com.eowise.recyclerview.stickyheaders.StickyHeadersItemDecoration.onDrawOver(StickyHeadersItemDecoration.java:54) ```  I don't know if my code is that one which contains a bug, but i checked everything twice and couldn't find anything. 
Sorry,  I cannot reproduce it on a sample project. Actually I have two projects which have extra sources, the first one work fine but the second not. The first one launch.json is as below:  ``` {       "type": "java",       "name": "Debug",       "request": "attach",       "hostName": "43.9.99.222",       "port": 8000,       "projectName": "stcws_aaaaa",       "sourcePaths": [         "D:/xxxxx/ccccc/ws/stcws_aaaaa/int/src",         "D:/xxxxx/ccccc/ws/stcws_bbbbb/int/src",         "D:/xxxxx/ccccc/ws/stcws_ccccc/int/src",         "D:/xxxxx/ccccc/ws/stcws_ddddd/int/src",         "D:/xxxxx/ccccc/ws/stcws_eeeee/int/src",         ]     }  ``` Is the problem come from my project structure ?  How can I check it ?

Yes, they are in my Quality Profile "I created a quality profile containing one rule from the findbugs repository and all of the rules from Find Security Bugs"  I see the Profile Exporter is what's used by the FindBugs Plugin to generate the findbugs-included.xml.  But the exporter is setup to only honor Findbugs and FbContrib repositories.  See -> https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-findbugs/blob/2.4/src/main/java/org/sonar/plugins/findbugs/FindbugsProfileExporter.java#L61  It seems like it would work if I could put a findsecbugs-rules.xml where it could be found https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-findbugs/blob/2.4/src/main/java/org/sonar/plugins/findbugs/FindbugsRuleRepository.java#L48  but I don't know how ServerFileSystem works.  Everything I'm seeing makes it appear I need to build my own version the 2.4 Findbugs plugin with a FindSecurityBugsRuleRepository embedded directly, but I'd like to figure out how yours is working to run without such changes. 
Not 100% sure on what happened, The server crashed a total of four times, this is the first crash - https://pastebin.com/7xUBi1bX - My best guess is a player placed something which crashed the server then when it start backup it crashed again when the player joined.
Thank you very very much for your efforts.  The second version worked. Only thing that was weird was that the migration/upgrade process took less then a minute and I read that it takes 10 to 30 minutes. But after a short view my permissions seem to be correct.  Perhaps you are interested in that I didn't have a /data/data/biz.bokhorst.xprivacy/xprivacy.db\* file.  Again thank you and best regards to South-Holland :) 
Perhaps anvil damage would have been a better term, but I was referring to how using an anvil has a chance to turn it into a chipped anvil, then damaged anvil, then being completely destroyed.
I will try to check on this later, but to continue my app I had already changed the logic to use non-null values instead of nulls.  I had actually run into another strange situation between two computers where I saw Integer returned in one emulator, but Long from the other emulator.  (To ignore that, I changed my local variables to `Number`) 
@MorrisJobke phone model and android version would be great 
@Piasy my modules is out of project dir is located like:  ``` ../projectName/app ../module1 ../module2 ../module3 ../modules/module4 ``` 
Using the Elasticsearch API. The problem is that when setting the allowed maximum number of indices in the server configuration, the web interface would only display this exact number of indices. These indices were always open (the only active buttons in the web UI were 'close index' and 'delete index' and the closed but retained indices would not show up. Not being presented with appropriate manuals made me resort to the ES API.  I'm glad to hear that this seems to be resolved in the latest beta; I'm looking forward to testing it by myself. Thanks. 
Thanks! I am using 1.0.0.Final by the way.  
Well, in 2.x map loading was done within a blink of an eye (<1s), but in 3.x it takes at least 10s. The thing is we don't want to lazy-load maps, in fact, our sw is build upon the feature that maps are loaded with all the data once and for all, at a given time. Is it possible to bring back that feature, and provide some kind of map loading policy configuration, to be able to choose whether I want lazy-loading or not?  Thanks.

After taking some time to look at this again on a fresh machine, I made some screenshots of the process I follow to create a new project.  The first screenshot shows the newly created, non-maven, Google App Engine standard project. You can see the error messages in the problems tab regarding the archive.  Even though this is not a Maven project, it still seems the project is referencing things in the .m2 folder.  ![newprojectwitherrors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36787970-2a5912de-1cb2-11e8-94e2-59abb11d81e8.PNG)  This second screenshot documents my journey inside the .m2 folder, where we can see the file size of 88kb.  ![mavencache](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788030-5cb1a4a8-1cb2-11e8-813d-ad3d9dbadd33.PNG)  The third screenshot shows what settings I selected to create the project.  Disregard the differences in the project name.  I didn't take the screenshot until after, but I assure you the settings are identical.  ![settingsleadingtobuggybehavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788063-82521b8e-1cb2-11e8-91e5-a5546ad0eca9.PNG)  The fourth screenshot shows the file on the Maven website.  Here you can see the file size of the JAR is 93kb, not 88kb:  ![93kbjarfile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788113-b8cf4646-1cb2-11e8-81d9-0369d5fe273e.PNG)  After downloading the JAR file from the Maven website, I then copy it manually to the .m2 folder, as shown in this fifth and sixth screenshot:  ![downloadedfile93kb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788167-e4de8530-1cb2-11e8-9971-7003e3f7cc94.PNG)  ![copyfiles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788172-eaa51948-1cb2-11e8-8257-2b03ea42179e.PNG)  After refreshing the project, I then create a new project, as shown in the seventh screenshot.  Here we see that the problem no longer exists with the corrupted JAR file.  (The old project; however, has error messages saying there is an unknown problem, and it's not clear how to resolve it.  Instead, we just delete it.)  ![nowitworkswithnewprojectonly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1315816/36788179-f16f35ec-1cb2-11e8-8b0f-20781adbb7c3.PNG)  **Please note:**  _This happens on every single Windows machine in our organization.  We have to follow this process with every trainee who walks through our door.  We delete and recreate new user accounts as new trainees enter the organization, and the .m2 cache repeatedly obtains corrupted JAR files after installation of Cloud Tools for Eclipse_.    I don't know if it's a problem with the Cloud Tools for Eclipse plugin or Maven, but it seems odd that the Maven website has a different JAR than the actual Maven repository Cloud Tools fetches from.    Let me know if there are any other details I can provide.  I'd like to help see this resolved, as there are people in the organization who are still clinging to the old, outdated, deprecated Google Plugin for Eclipse, and it seems the world is trying to move forward.  Again, I'm happy to help. :)      
Phil,  Thanks for getting back to me on this.  Sorry, I did not grab the error message, trying to get ready for a course delivery next week.  But one diagram would not open and the other was fragmented (could not make out any structure or interact with it).  However, I have tried to repeat the error but have not had it reoccur.  I did the rename with the pull down menu not when I created the diagram.  I will let you know if occurs again and will capture the error message/log.  By-the-way, I think you have done a very good job with the editor. This is one of the first issues I have had with it.

Hi Alex, I'm actually pretty sure that volumes doesn't do what I want since they are only available at runtime. What I want is some way of pulling artifacts out of the built VM at build time. It seems that docker cp would achieve this, but there is no binding for it. I'd be interested in adding this if you thought it was a good idea and could point me at where in the code it should sit

What's interesting, I noticed that some folders would sync while others did not. Last night I tried the same thing on my wife's phone and all worked as should. I reinstalled the app on my phone with no change. I cleared cache and reinstalled. Same issue. I did that about half a dozen times, rebooting the phone hooping that some small piece of install remained that was preventing the app from uploading photos/videos from the main folder. Changed to a new folder on the server to upload to. Nothing was happening.  Then, not attributing to anything that I did, the files were uploaded on their own.   Now, again it seems to have stalled. Force rescan does not change anything.  Yes, I am on the latest stable Android APK.
I've tried DejaVu Sans and Catarell.  DejaVu is better in the "summary" section but both are awful (as above) in the lower right (unallocated etc).  Is it possible to set font properties for this app specifically? 
Hi @laa     Thank you for your replay.    1. It's distributed.    2. Yes, did it before.    3. I'm not sure. Maybe did it before.     4. Do not.
@snicoll I tried with the execution id specific for the "main" artifact (the one without the classifier), but that did not help.  What did help however is changing the order to the following and now it works:  ```             <plugin>                 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>                 <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>                 <executions>                     <execution>                         <id>build-repackage-executable</id>                         <goals>                             <goal>repackage</goal>                         </goals>                         <configuration>                             <executable>false</executable>                             <attach>true</attach>                         </configuration>                     </execution>                     <execution>                         <id>build-linux-executable</id>                         <goals>                             <goal>repackage</goal>                         </goals>                         <configuration>                             <classifier>exec-linux</classifier>                             <executable>true</executable>                             <attach>false</attach>                         </configuration>                     </execution>                 </executions>             </plugin> ```  I'll leave the qualification of this to be a bug or a feature up to you ;-)
Yes, this should be the same across the whole site that is visible to users: start page header, footer, left hand box on editor page, user documentation (if any exists/is written yet). 
Yes nice!  When the frame appears it's empty (all white). I can see the content only when i change the window size.  Thanks.
I just used your https://github.com/xoppa/blog/blob/master/tutorials/src/com/xoppa/blog/libgdx/g3d/frustumculling/step1/FrustumCullingTest.java   and step4 code too.  Today I have played with this:  when I removed   if (currentShader != renderable.shader)  line in ModelBatch.java (flush() method at line 208), then tests seems to work.  Hopefully this helps find the actual problem. 
because I removed Actually Additions and it was shown properly, my derp forgot to show the picture: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l2c59qe9t1oy58w/Times%20Eight.png?dl=0 but it seems you figured it out already. 
To be honest, I can't reproduce it myself either. The project was created via the Spring Initializr, and I don't think I have any problematic plugins:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24881514/71690940-b6cf2200-2d6b-11ea-8495-37ea08468fd3.png)  From what I recall, the error occurred after fiddling with the `Azure Explorer` menu.
@KurtStam didn't fix `Periodic stored procedure invocation` (when you are using DB as a start connector, the input is still text, not dropdown)  But I can confirm that non-starting connectors use dropdown now :tada: 
@yegor256 that way, we are making assumptions that the underlying `Back` is using only the socket incoming data. For example `BkBasic` is using LocalAddress, InetAddress, LocalPort, Port. May be it is not a good example, but in general we cannot make assumptions on what properties of the socket will be used by future implementations of `Back`. As a proxy simulator, we should also take back passed socket outputstream to report it on the original socket. That is OK but complicates `BkReuse` a little bit. If you're OK with such assumptions, I will consider it a taken decision and close the issue. 
Vault Path = U:\Vault Vault is on network share.  Custom Drive Letter:  Z
ODB Community Edition 2.1.15 The server does not start. Error message is "The ORIENTDB_HOME environment variable is not defined correctly".  I found that this is a resulting error of java not being part of PATH environment variable. After adding the java.exe containing folder to the PATH variable it worked. 
@andreasschroth Sure that would work in this case, but it's still a bug isn't it? If you for example want to make one of the parts conditional with an if statement there is no clean way to do that.   For example: ``` $messageFormat  = 'text'; if(true) {         $messageFormat .= ' text %s text %s'; } else {         $messageFormat .= ' %s text %s'; }         $messageFormat .= ' text %s.';
The device is Samsung Galaxy S3 4.0.4 (an official rom). I noticed another thing - I didn't manage to reproduce it on a Nexus 4 4.4.2, I'll try other devices soon. I'll remove all my disposes see if this helps. 
With Nextcloud dev version 20170515 the issue still remain. I have tried the various scenario: 5 minute recording leads to about 1GB video file.  Nextcloud storage on internal SD with both video recorder internal or on the external SD card. Nextcloud storage on external SD with both video recorder internal or on the external SD card.  Both solutions (4 different configuration) fail. Transfer seems to start about 2 minutes after the movie has started recording. Out of the few video trials, the files uploaded would range between 8MB up to 148MB. I am not able to send Log file has the app is crashing trying to do so.
No problem, that would be huge if you could get an update out for that. Off the top of my head I don't know any explicit way to test for this in JEST but I'll gladly do some research for you and send over some links!  Thanks again !  -Tsavo  On Mon, Mar 11, 2019, 3:38 PM Michael Oberwasserlechner < notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Hey, > > it's a quick fix I think I can easily do it myself and release a new beta > today. > > I use JEST for testing.

Thanks for you answer. I reinstalled the plugin with version `1.3.0`, and it seems to be working on Android 8. This what I excepted from plugin before, and now it's working : `{withFingerprint: "Is0/g9fTO+TxRdZFmKltLw==↵"}` :)  Unfortunately I don't have an Android 7 to try the last plugin version  (1.3.4)
I had this code:  ``` ceylon shared void hello() {     print(process.arguments);     print("Hola"); }  shared void run() {     hello(); } ```  put the cursor on the first "hello" , right clicked and selected Rename. In the dialog that pops up it says "4" instead of "2".

Thanks for the reply @TylerJewell here's what it throws:  unable to find image 'eclipse/che-cli:latest' locally Pulling repository docker.io/eclipse/che-cli docker: Tag latest not found in repository docker.io/eclipse/che-cli.  I've no idea whats wrong here, is it possible the docs are not updated on the main site?
@jexp I'm using the version 3.0.1. I'm using this query   ``` python q = 'MATCH (s:LaLo) WHERE s.latitude = "%s" AND s.longitude = "%s" RETURN s'%(str(i[0]),str(i[1])) results = db.query(q, returns=(client.Node)) ```  So, the Neo4J insert 20% of database.In Neo4j-Browser the inserts are ok. 
Michael,  I have an index on :Document(document_ID). That is my only "entry point" to the data.  Unfortunately, I can't run anything on my end any more in 2.3.1. For my project I had to revert to 2.2.7 and so I created two Neo4j CE installations (2.2.7 and 2.3.1) and two databases of the corresponding versions. For some reason the 2.3.1 installation gives me trouble now, when I have two versions of software installed on the same machine. This was not the case when 2.3.1 was installed alone. Below are some screenshots of what's going on. I don't see any error messages in messages.log.  ![neo4j_browser_err_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9038701/11811547/2556ee16-a304-11e5-8135-0b072d87a8d6.PNG) ![neo4j_browser_err_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9038701/11811554/2c574300-a304-11e5-8840-50e3e57e14e6.PNG) ![neo4j_browser_err_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9038701/11811563/33ed6cde-a304-11e5-95df-0fdeffbe70e3.PNG)  Here's the ZIP of the test database that I'm working with. Hope you can identify the problem with the provided query on your end. (I had to append the .txt extension because the ZIP was not being uploaded) [remora.graph_2.3.1_test.zip.txt](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/files/62496/remora.graph_2.3.1_test.zip.txt)  In general, out of dozens of queries that I have as a part of my application, there are four that just halt (I initially provided one of them) and one that is borderline acceptable (running for 30 seconds now), but the rest are not really OK either. Putting these five aside, migrating from 2.2 to 2.3 made things slower for me 2-3 times across the board. I did not do any tuning and did not use any hints. This is just out of the box.  Thanks! Gene.

Then, perhaps, it is a consequence of using Jersey with SpringBoot (don't get me started on why we're using both...):  ``` @GET @Path("/parent/{pid}/child/{cid}") @Produces("application/json") @Timed(name="child.reads") public Response readChild(@Context UriInfo uriInfo, @PathParam("pid") String parentId,         @PathParam("cid") String childId) { ... }  ``` 
I think perhaps an artifact per major findbugs release. So perhaps a new tdd4b2 to support findbugs 2.x.

I'm new to this bug-reporting stuff, sorry for making it harder. I'll try and behave 0:) 
What i think is that you use the onDeathEvent. I had issues with that in my own mod. SpmodAPI. (Weird name but deal with it). And when i switcht over to PlayerDropsEvent and set the Player.captureDrops to true while my logic ran. That seems to have it fixed on my side. Because they get then spawned properly.
Yes, removing the tool if it fails, and resetting the command in order to do it again with a new name. 
Thanks for the reply.  I wasn't aware of that 1/256 in concat, and it makes sense that it was removed.   But something's still not right on my end.  The part where I was saying that transform is expecting non-normalized data is in HistoryProcessor.transform(INDArray raw): ```  Mat ocvmat = new Mat(shape[0], shape[1], CV_32FC(3), raw.data().pointer()); Mat cvmat = new Mat(shape[0], shape[1], CV_8UC(3)); ocvmat.convertTo(cvmat, CV_8UC(3)); ``` This was working prior to normalization - if I do an `imwrite` of cvmat at this point with normalized data, I get a black image. If I don't normalize the observed pixels, it get the full color image I'd expect.  From what I've read online, opencv's CV_32F is expecting 0.0-1.0, so I would have expected the opposite results but that appears not to be the case because "record" is now denormalizing the data before writing it to the mpeg.  Why shouldn't transform also be denormalizing the data when converting to CV_8UC like in record?   
I didn't find the Issues. ![20190311114402](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6191134/54099267-542f2300-43f3-11e9-9c71-e34fb7b08e26.jpg)

Hi,  I'm using a heavy modified version of gerbil 1.2.0 or 1. I didn't know exactly, but I never touched the dataset configurations or loading parts. The test is also green by me, but if I change the test file to `gerbil_data/datasets/oke-challenge/example_data/task1.ttl` (fresh downloaded) the test fails.

Oh sorry, I will bet I did F5 on all projects after git update, I can't see him in Eclipse, next time I will double check. I was surprised how it can be build without errors from mvn.  Sorry Torsten, closing 
Sorry for the lack of feedback, this issue is not easily reproducable. I'll reopen this issue (if I have the permission to do so) in case the problem occurs again.
Sure, I can do that. I'll get to it as soon as I can, probably tomorrow.

Oh there's a quirk here where `foo is after 2018-10-01T00:00:00.000` means that foo is after 2018-10-01T00:00:00.001 will be generated and that comes back as 2018-10-01.

This is strange since the build runs the same each time. I can execute the build manually ten times and a smattering will fail, guaranteed. However, it seems as though instead of printing `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: Started`, it printed `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server: jetty-9.3.z-SNAPSHOT`, and I should look for `org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.ContextHandler: Started`. What an odd thing.
Found this on reddit. Appears to be a issue on desktop as well:  https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/a080sd/firefox_youtube_60fps_1080p_dropped_frames_video/?st=JOXA734N&sh=30a4b91c  The fix in the post that could provide hints:  layers.gpu-process.enabled = false media.gpu-process-decoder = false  Also sounds like it occurres with avc1
I said it was not copying anything if the area you are trying to copy has fire in it.
//TSV parser settings defined TsvParserSettings parserSettings = new TsvParserSettings(); parserSettings.setNullValue(""); ... ... TsvParser parser = new TsvParser(parserSettings);  //Model class for CSV @Parsed(field="A") private String a; @Parsed(field="B") private String b; @Parsed(field="C") private String c;  My CSV has feilds: A\tB  So here is my scenario: If I leave a column value (eg. A) empty then an empty string is set for that as the default null value. However if the field as defined in the model is not present in the CSV(i.e C), then the parser seems to completely ignore that and does not set the default null value as an empty string.  Let me know if you need anything more from me.  Thanks for the prompt reply!!! 👍

Updating to 1.4.0 seems to have fixed the issue. Thank you!

Ok, here's the output:  busybox | grep binary BusyBox v1.21.1 (2013-07-08 11:09:23 CDT) multi-call binary.

The context: The `\u0000` marker is hard-coded in generated rules that are automatically added by the parser generator to the Rascal grammar to delimit holes. When I get it back as `\a00` it no longer parses. So the above behavior may be correct from a Unicode perspective but it causes a problem in this context. At least somewhere during the processing an inequality occurs that causes the parse to fail. 
> Did it ever work with the new binding?  I don't recall it ever working.  OTOH, the post I linked to above stated that it worked in 2.5 M2. Frankly, I don't see anything materially different between M2 and M4, other than the charset change you already mentioned.  From what I saw, even the `javax.mail` and `org.apache.commons.mail` lib versions didn't change.  As it works with the OH1 binding, there must be something different... 
Yes, that's the book, and I see the icon of my friend Mara Greengrass (http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/14216097) in the place of the cover icon.  Is there some XML output which I could send you to help diagnose this? 
Hi Hernan,  okay - no worries.  We're supplying "openid name email" in the scope now and we get back a valid firebase token.  Another thing I noticed in that code that looks a bit off is this in the `delegationWithOptions` method:  ```     NSString *api = options[@"api"];     if (!api) {       api = @"app";     } ```  But then the options map is referenced directly when the request parameters are created:  ``` A0AuthParameters *parameters = [A0AuthParameters newWithDictionary:@{                                                                          A0ParameterAPIType: options[@"api"], ```  Thanks for getting back to us so quickly.  -Richard

Thanks for the fast answer. The files are copied correctly into the temp folder, but looking into the copied ditamap of the sideDocument which includes the references, we have seen something strange.  The relative paths inside the copied ditamaps are partially changed. As a result the .dita files of the mainDocument cannot be found Here is an example: The first block is correct, while the second one has changed paths <pre><code> &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="01_subChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:2;7:39"&gt;     &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="01_subSubChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:3;8:43"&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/01_subDescription/_01_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/_01_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/01_subDescription/01.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/01_subDescription/_01_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/02_subDescription/_02_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/_01_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:2;8:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/02_subDescription/02.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/01_subWorkflows/01_subSubSubChapter/01_Description/02_subDescription/_02_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;     &lt;/topichead&gt; &lt;/topichead&gt; 		 &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="02_subChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:4;13:39"&gt;     &lt;topichead class="+ map/topicref mapgroup-d/topichead " navtitle="02_subSubChapter" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/sideDocuments/sideDocument_1/01_chapter/01_subChapter/_subChapter-side.ditamap" xtrc="topichead:5;14:43"&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/07_subDescription/_07_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/_04_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="07_subDescription/07.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/07_subDescription/_07_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;         &lt;topicref href="../../../../mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/08_subDescription/_08_subDescription-main.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/_04_Description.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:2;8:93"&gt;             &lt;topicref href="08_subDescription/08.dita" class="- map/topicref " type="topic" format="dita" xtrf="file:/C:/DEV/Repo/testDoc/Content/mainDocuments/mainDocument_1/01_chapter/02_subChapter/02_subWorkflows/04_subSubSubChapter/04_Description/08_subDescription/_08_subDescription.ditamap" xtrc="topicref:1;5:56"/&gt;         &lt;/topicref&gt;     &lt;/topichead&gt; &lt;/topichead&gt; </pre></code>

Yeah, it's only mentioned in passing in the javadoc for [EntityTransmuter.java](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb/blob/master/artemis-core/artemis/src/main/java/com/artemis/EntityTransmuter.java#L48).  
Hmm.. How can I find out?  -- I just re-ran the scan by setting "Maximum rule duration" to 4 minutes and disabling "Handle anti CSRF tokens" after reading that this forces the scans to run in a single thread.  I didn't see anything come close to approaching 4 minutes, and it completed without issue.  The entire scan completed MUCH faster -- faster than I would have expected going from 1 thread to 5.  I've reverted those two changes and am re-running to see if this is still reproducible and then will run the scan by just changing CSRF.  It has already passed the point where it hung last time.
The problem happens with custom ports. I have pages like https://my.domain:5655 which do not work. Ports on 80/443 seem to work, I tried it with google.com and it works.
Removing more player models fixed the issue for now (would like to use it), still though here is the [image](http://imgur.com/a/CDiGu)

This was fixed, but now we deal with other problems related. However this issue was not catched by autoclose.
Unfortunately there no easy example, I think it's related to the annotation being in the library with an older version.
You get kicked out of the arena and brought to the exit location. Except your inventory is wiped. Typing ```/ma leave``` does not kick you out as you are no longer part of the arena.
I'll work on the log and the versions I upgraded from, but wanted to give an update.    When I create a new world, things seem to work just fine, so it must have to do with the upgrade.

If you open the Properties dialog of an App Engine Standard project it will contain both the App Engine Deployment page and the Project Facets page. If you uninstall the App Engine Standard facet or change it to the App Engine Flex facet, the App Engine Deployment tab will not be updated to either hide the App Engine Deployment for Standard (as in the first case) or show the App Engine Deployment for Flex.

Oh, I think I said it wrong. I don't mean the white space in the code. I mean the 1px high white space between the lines. In the screenshot you can see 1px high white lines which starts at line 9. Have a closure look at the line numbers. There you will see the small distance between the lines best.  This behavior was not like this in version 0.7 M5.

> > Could this be explained by additional heat sinks being added automatically? Vehicles have to be able to sink all heat from energy weapons, so the tonnage could be accounting for the heat sinks. >  > Example, if you add an IS ER Large Laser to a blank vehicle, which generates 12 heat and weighs 5 tons (12t + 5t = 17t), tonnage goes up from 4.5t to 22t (+17.5t). This checks out since without a fusion engine, 0.5 tons of power amplifiers need to be added.  But if I have a Clan XL Engine on a 50t vehical, at 1/2 speed, granting 45 tons of room, with 20 heat sinks, an ER PPC which generates 15 heat, shouldn't weigh 11 tons.

@anishshah101 Sorry I didn't come back to you. I will try to elaborate a little bit more although as @tarelli  said if you are starting to fix some bugs this is not one of the easiest. The problem has to do with the way we are loading the DOM and executing the jquery. If you want to execute some jquery commands on a html component you usually need to embed the jquery command in a:  ``` $(document).ready(function() {} ```  We are doing something wrong because sometimes we are trying to execute a command on the Console component, i.e. [this](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto.frontend/blob/master/src/main/webapp/js/GEPPETTO.Console.js#L277) and the dom is not ready (Console is null). Therefore a js error occurs. Some components (Simulation buttons, zoom in/out, etc) are not loaded in the layout and the console can't be opened. It is a random error I guess because it depends on many things Internet speed, local js processing, elements being loaded asyncronous... This error may potentially happen in a different line also because of async execution.  If you finally try to fix this bug let me know if I can be of any help. This time I will be faster in answering you :)

My use case is actually using bitcoinj to create a transaction and broadcast it through a blockexplorer API like blockchain.info. I saw that the api returned an error and I tried to send it through Bitcoin Core and I found that it was Bitcoin Core that was rejecting the transaction. I'm on bitcoinj version 0.14.3, and Bitcoin Core version 0.12.1.  As for the dummy key,  I just put "key1" and "key2" as a dummy key because the real keys actually hold real bitcoins so I don't want to include it in my post. In my actual code I do create the transaction with the real base58 private key.  
@iocanel I played with this a bit yesterday and it doesn't seem like an easy fix, due to all the mutability inside Dekorate. My current assignment is to find bugs, not fix them, so if you could take this, that would be great :-)
It does yes. According to the wiki, `Squeezer.addRecipe` can only take `inputStack, outputStack, outputFluid`, but it actually has 4 different parameter options.  `inputStack, outputStack` `inputStack, outputStack, outputFluid` `inputStack, outputStack, int chance, secondaryOutputStack` `inputStack, outputStack, outputFluid, int chance, secondaryOutputStack`  The same goes for the mechanicalSqueezer. The duration parameter does not seem to exist. 
Updating the pack and server today, will report back if it is still happening.

@Fr4gorSoftware: Installed branch **fix-shared-qrcode** and scanning via Share intent is still not working.  This is the version I tested on ``` commit 44c64af928ff3d819fd551f0a28be904a591ae22 (HEAD -> fix-shared-qrcode, origin/fix-shared-qrcode) Author: Thore <30445568+Fr4gorSoftware@users.noreply.github.com> Date:   Sun Jan 12 22:16:09 2020 +0100      fix shared qrcode ```  The toast now appears (as opposed to before): `File not found`.

The image is a regular jpg image that can be successfully scanned by other scanners, including by secscanqr when using the camera, but sharing from the gallery app via intent is not working.  sample image: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48893368/73138500-883f2100-4063-11ea-8917-685290efef3f.jpg 
Sorry I just updated the issue. If you create a **zip** bag, the issue is reproduced. When I tested the standard bag with no zip, there is no issue there. **Expected behavior** : inside the zip bag, the "data" folder content would have their original creation date either 1) when opened as archive, or 2) when extracted.  
@djechelon created a pull request right now. It is an early proposal, without tests (yet)

Here is the same application as above but ran twice: one on 8080 (service1) and the other on 8081 (service2) by changing `server.port` and `spring.application.name`, then pointing one to the other for the calls to `/1`, `/2` and `/3` by changing the port on the `WebClient`  The same behaviour can be observed as when the app is hitting itself  ![Screenshot of Zipkin 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarkRobbo/cloud-schema-bug/master/Screenshot%202020-01-10%20at%2009.39.25.png)  (We also have this live in an environment with a large number of microservices and this obviously takes this problem to the extreme with everything being nested)

If so, what version of Glide are you using? @sjudd 1. I do not know why incorrect results has been written to the disk cache, but they really existed in cache. And the scenario we came across was that the disk cache file can not been decoded successfully. 2.

Hi,  I don't know how to reproduce it as it just happened.  I wanted to fix  the embedded newline issue and downloaded the latest source but run into  a number of failed test-cases.  I run on a windows 7 system using  cygwin.  There is no locale set that I am aware of. System is dutch.   Cygwin probably englisch.  I fixed it by changing the line to: Assert.assertEquals(DateFormatUtils.format(Calendar.getInstance(),  "MMMMM dd, yyyy",new Locale("fr","CA")),  localeAndFormatNowFunction.replaceByValue("{@function:now('fr_CA','MMMMM  dd, yyyy')}"));  The error I got was that the date: "avril" didn't match "april". April  is the same in both dutch as english.  Hope this helps.

@colings86 Thanks for your confirmation.  We are kinda already using the workaround you suggested, however it's one of those annoying things to remember especially when it's not necessarily intuitive.  We use the _meta field for a couple of reasons.  1. The date fields that we define in our mapping are all consistently stored as one format but when we retrieve from ES, we represent in various formats so we track the different formats in the _meta field so that as we are transforming the JSON we get from ES we can apply the applicable transformation before sending it further upstream in our application.  I am sure there are other ways of achieving this but this seems to work well for us. 2. We have a few nested field mappings defined and we keep track of the nested paths within the _meta field.  We have a query generator routine that dynamically generates the ES Queries based upon the fields passed in and we pull nested paths information from the _meta field so that we can determine if a nested path should be incorporated into the query or not.  Hope this helps!
Good point.   Well, I intercept only "my code" (in "my packages"), not the code from Groovy itself. "My code" does then the calls to Groovy, which are not intercepted.  The `.ignoreMethods(isGroovyMethod())` didn't work for me here in this case...   Hmmm... 
I was using window 8 with the latest Node.js 0.10.31. 
Hahaha, sorry Ray, I overlooked that the issue is only known to me :) We use ERXJDBCConnectionBroker and as part of setup() method following code is executed:  <pre> Connection con = getConnection(); try {     supportsTransactions = (con.getTransactionIsolation() != 0);     if(supportsTransactions) {         con.setAutoCommit(false);     } } catch (SQLException ex) {     log.error(ex, ex); } finally {     freeConnection(con); } </pre>  So, in this case when my connection initially setup was in autocommit = true and because using connection broker, we're reusing the same connection without really closing (connection pooling), and when the connection is in the middle of a transaction and when statement is not yet committed, invoking setAutoCommit(false) throws exception. In my opinion, the check fix the issue, which we've tested with postgresql database.

These are (currently) necessary, because the file import has to continue even when the app is not shown. And there would be no other way to see the progress. A batch import of more files can take a long time, and runs in background. What other way would there be to see the progress? Suggestions?

Fixed via #749 
@yurishkuro Yes, the case I'm concerned about is when `Service A` is traced, but something makes a request to `A` with the debug header set.   In todays world, unless all services in the chain are instrumented and reporting correctly, it is difficult to ascertain that this debug header originated in `A`. `peer.service` is only set when an inbound request has `X_UBER_SOURCE` header set, which is something that might not be true all the time (and perhaps none of the time for users that aren't uber).

there is no crash, server just hang with zero tps. At now we do some tests to find a reason. May be its bug with multistructure of alveary

I took a look in our Sentry and the oldest problem of this kind happens directly after the update of metrics from 3.1.2 to 3.2.0.  I took a short look at #1063 but found no reason, why it can cause this problem, because it just shortens the measurements map. But maybe I am wrong.
@sixdouglas I don't think this is caused by your changes. Still, I'm not sure why this has happened. Building on Travis-CI works fine. Maybe there is something on my system?
Hi @yinfeiru ,  1) I agree that this is not a memory leakage because I can garbage collect the memory. 2-3) However, my concern is more about the constant increase of allocated memory until we reach the heap size and the device automcall the GC. During my test, I just initialize Mixpanel with the `MixpanelAPI.getInstance(my_context, MIXPANEL_TOKEN);` call. I don't send push notification, track events or whatever else.  If I use the exact same application and login with the exact same account, while the app is in the foreground :  - Android 4 devices : memory allocation is constant - Android 5 devices : memory continuously increase   I can do some test for you as needed, but it seems that we can focus our investigation on Android 5+   Just let me know if you need more information !  Thanks. 
I think this is not an error. The app works but it doesn't looks good. Yes it happens always.

Main thread says "held by thread 43", and here is 43 which is also blocked:  ```ruby "glide-source-thread-1" prio=5 tid=43 Blocked   | group="main" sCount=1 dsCount=0 flags=1 obj=0x12d01f18 self=0x762cabf800   | sysTid=32074 nice=9 cgrp=default sched=0/0 handle=0x7650cbd4f0   | state=S schedstat=( 5979636 11002971 42 ) utm=0 stm=0 core=2 HZ=100   | stack=0x7650bba000-0x7650bbc000 stackSize=1041KB   | held mutexes=   at com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest.isResourceSet (SourceFile) - waiting to lock <0x0b821f0b> (a com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest) held by thread 14   at com.bumptech.glide.request.ThumbnailRequestCoordinator.isResourceSet (SourceFile:1)   at com.bumptech.glide.request.ThumbnailRequestCoordinator.isAnyResourceSet (SourceFile:1)   at com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest.i (SourceFile:1)   at com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest.a (SourceFile:62) - locked <0x07f50dcc> (a com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest)   at com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest.onLoadFailed (SourceFile:1) - locked <0x07f50dcc> (a com.bumptech.glide.request.SingleRequest)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.h.a (SourceFile:17) - locked <0x095ec1e8> (a com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.h)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.h$a.run (SourceFile:3) - locked <0x095ec1e8> (a com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.h)   at com.bumptech.glide.util.Executors$2.execute (SourceFile:1)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.h.c (SourceFile:23)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.h.onLoadFailed (SourceFile:4)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.g.e (SourceFile:3)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.g.i (SourceFile:10)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.g.j (SourceFile:4)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.g.run (SourceFile:7)   at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker (ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1167)   at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run (ThreadPoolExecutor.java:641)   at java.lang.Thread.run (Thread.java:764)   at com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.executor.GlideExecutor$DefaultThreadFactory$1.run (SourceFile:8) ```  Unfortunately thread 14 is not logged, list goes from 13 and jumps to 15.
I tried the goto station action. To no avail.  It was with version 7.0.3.  This is more a suggestion then a bug I suppose. It is not an issue when I define a work area.  
i try to change the resolution, mean i type in "1024x768" but the canvas doesnt changed their size. It happens most the time. It only works 1 time.. 
I prefer leaving our own fetching (although flawed), but adding Javadoc to that method disclaimering we are not a fetching library, thus the fetch faults are not necessarily the parsing faults, as well as wrapping the fetching line with a try-catch segment logging out a short exaplanation that the sitemap failed the fetch not necessarily the parse.   I do think there are/will be many cases where people will need a fast sitemap parsing and they won't want to delve too deeply into their own fetcher etc, they will look for a quick and dirty sitemap fetch.
Hello @miguno The version is **0.4** 
Kotlin 1.0.5-2
I'm using Windows, and the files are associated with Notepad++ (any type fails including lirc). Also it worked before. Happening since i am using the latest build. (Java is oracle JDK on windows)  I will now update Notepad++ and Java just to be sure though 
I did actually. Now that you mention it. From 1387 to 1388, which completely removed the edited .jar file after installing forge prior 1387. As in there's no .jar anymore.   Guess it's back to 1387 again. 
Version: 1.7.10 - 2.2.8.381  Yes, fastcraft is enabled but optifine is not. 
Checked with 2 Nexus 5x, 6.0.1 and 7.0, all good! Thanks

Yes you are completely right, starting at line 318 (which follows a line containing Unicode characters!) the highligthing is messed up.

This is a paid dockerhub account with private dockers support. Not sure if this matters. 
I have firgotten to mention that I am using the Insight pump. May be that is the reason why the system fails because I have read a post on gitter about it.
@iirina - yes, it is a cc_binary  here is the contents of our glfw.BUILD file:  ``` config_setting(   name = "linux",   values = { "cpu": "k8" }, ) config_setting(   name = "osx",   values = { "cpu": "darwin" }, )  cc_library(   name = "glfw",   srcs = glob(["lib/*.a", "lib/*.so*", "lib/*.dylib*"]),   hdrs = glob(["include/GLFW/*"]),   includes = ["include"],   visibility = ["//visibility:public"],   linkopts = select({":linux": ["-ldl", "-lGL", "-lGLU", "-lX11", "-lXrandr", "-lXxf86vm", "-lXinerama", "-lXcursor", "-lpthread"],                      "//conditions:default": []}),   linkstatic = 0, ) ```
Yes, it's still the same issue in v2.1.4 as of today (10.10.2015). 
Yes it is reproducible for the CPU view only. With large 4-5 minutes traces, I get it for all CPUs, but to see the problem faster, I get it from the os-events benchmark trace (http://archive.eclipse.org/tracecompass/test-traces/os-events.tar.gz) for CPU2 only.
1.1.0 but it was the agora I could already solve I did the update to 1.4 then to 1.7 and now to the latest version and no bug is ( PS : I am using the translator google I am Brazilian , sorry for English errors)

The version with the issue was 4.2.4.  I few minutes ago, i've build the driver with your commit and tested it in our application. Your bugfix has solved my issue. Thank you very much for your quick response. 
Should be done, give the latest nightly a try!

yea, that's it ... changing the description 
Hi @csnyulas, unfortunately that is not the case, I don't see the class if I scroll.
OK, I suppose that you're right, I was just a bit tired of working with translations :-) For me your proposal of string is good. In Spanish I think that I will write "Origen o destino están fuera del área cubierta por la red de transportes" but I suppose that your approach is better when writing in English.  I think that if we do it is better to do it right and also change in all the translations and ask @rjfv and @mentaer to translate or just review one more string once again. Maybe is easier to simply tell them the line, in this occasion, to allow them to see what they had written before and don't change their files. For the other languages, including English, I can make the changes. 
Hi @hideki, I don't use the PhoneGap plugin. I have a HTML/JS frontend running in a WebView and some background services written in Java that are listening to changes in the database . Because most of this code is also used in a desktop environment using Apache CouchDB the frontend and the Java based backend access the database using the REST API. The LiteListener is started in my own Android service.  To reproduce the issue generate many changes in a database and try to request a continuous changes feed. I created a little demo app: https://github.com/fpum/deadlockdemo It basically runs a loop from 1 to 1000 that in each iteration creates and deletes a new document and tries to get the changes using a continuous feed. You would expect it to run till "Created change number 1000" and "Found 1000 changes" but it gets stuck on the way. 
@rsudev I suggest to keep the fix for #7118 on master.  Regarding the RC: While I can see another occurrence of #7122 with 2018.08.14 on September 2nd there is no such report at all for 2018.08.28-RC. Seems the fix is working. Lets wait some more days and then publish.
No, I could use "Suaer" properly.  > Maybe because the VNC Viewer only have one cursor?

Fixed by #1802.
It is transport client. I use scala 2.12.  That's all the code left. Then I ran `lsof -p pid | grep TCP | wc -l` every second. The count increased by 3 exactly the same number of es servers configured for the connection. ``` // BjConfig is configuration object.     val esServers = BjConfig.EsHosts.zip(BjConfig.EsPorts) // Build host and port pair.      val esSettings = Settings.builder().       put("cluster.name", BjConfig.EsClusterName).       put("client.transport.sniff", true).       build()      val esClient: TransportClient = new PreBuiltTransportClient(esSettings)       esServers.foreach(es => {                         esClient.addTransportAddress(new InetSocketTransportAddress(InetAddress.getByName(es._1), es._2.toInt))                       }) ```
> I also have this issue. Which react native amd opentok Android SDK version are you using?  Hello @BenAllenUK, i use react native v0.60.3 and opentok v0.12.0. Anyway, I already fixed this bug, please follow the [pull request](https://github.com/opentok/opentok-react-native/pull/326) to temporary pass the issue and wait for the official merged version. Hope that will help you guy! 
No, only the RPC threads. I tried manually closing them somehow in the NepeheMiniCluster but had no luck.

the failure duration is 2 minutes, I'm running this command on the master: redis-cli -p 6379 DEBUG sleep 120  And I use the default values (retryInterval 1500ms * 3 retryAttempts).   So I assume it's ok to have some errors (like "session cannot be null" and "RedisConnectionExption") during failover and 1-2 minutes after  But I still have:  > org.redisson.client.RedisTimeoutException: Unable to send command: (HGETALL) with params: [redisson_spring_session:cb50538c-5244-4cb2-953d-77b733fe5814] after 3 retry attempts  20 minutes after the failover, why ?  
Yea, but I can also only test it on an emulator. I had a real KitKat device, but I recently updated it to lollipop..

No.  They both find the same errors.  The problem is with the ability to EXCLUDE those errors.

@opticod  yes sure :) 
I will when its not so late for me (I'm UTC+10 - 10.30pm )   And i tried both cone modes (narrow and wide) - both have similar effects in different areas where there was no floodlight in the area (i moved 30 chunks away for each one)  The only way i can "destroy" those rogue light sources is placing blocks down until the block placement removes/destroys the light "entity"  But I will say that world save was from a version FloodLights-1.7.10-0.6.8-96.jar -> FloodLights-1.7.10-1.0.1-110.jar 
I am using the "Modern" desktop theme. The behavior is the same when I use the out of the box "Breeze Dark" theme. Currently, RStudio is the only application that has this problem. Everywhere else the dark theme is working correctly with the menu text, etc.
@nathankleyn Thanks for the quick reply. Yep its working shard-id was removed due to some tests running in background. Plus my original issue was due to java object serialization of value. My value was being saved as xac\xed\x00\x05t\x00\x03123  May be you could put it in FAQs :smile:  
@ShamsUlAzeem Works fine now. thank you!
@olgakup somehow I missed the first comment (sorry!)  Yeah you finally changed what I was referring to (so +100 to you!). For the Number of Pending Txs history event I remember we said that we're not going to implement it (at least yet) mostly because when we are syncing the number is always 0. In any case it should be a live event and instead of showcasing a graph just only a number (but I suggest to move this to M2).
ok, i make little video..  
Forge version: 14.23.5.2815 Electroblob's Wizardry 4.1.4 I forgot to mention that I saw them in JEI and not in normal gameplay, so here's my JEI version 1.12.2-4.15.0.268  
I'm using the version, which has ben released in the play store yesterday evening (2013-07-02) 
Yes, in university we have to use the flags `-Mtp -gl -Criot`!
It shouldn't have.   We had no issues before I updated towny and the rest of towny changes get saved.  It's all the same database, just different tables.  The issue also occurs on both our test and public servers, which have completely separate MySql.  I can try wiping the towny tables on my test server and reverting towny to my old version there and make sure the problem doesn't exist.   (I can't revert with the data I have as towny really doesn't like it.)   
Well, as I stated before, The Utility Worlds mod adds the ability for players to craft portals to their very own private mining, garden, or void worlds.  EVERY time that a new portal is created, so is a dimension, similar to mystcraft.  This is not such an issue with the mining worlds, HOWEVER, the garden worlds are only 5 blocks deep, 4 blocks of dirt/grass and 1 of bedrock.  Your mod is biting chunks out of those dimensions leaving gaping holes to the void when it tries to generate the lush caves because there is not enough depth for them to generate.  The Utility Worlds mod author is at a loss as to how it can be blocked.  I have seen mods in the past retain the ability to use either a whitelist or a blacklist so the server operators can decide which they need to use for their modpack servers based on the mods included in the pack, this is usually in the form of a simple config option that allows you to choose 1 for blacklist or 2 for whitelist and they utilize the same list in the config of dimensions for either one.  I am not asking you to remove the blacklist for players that need them, but it is not very useful for anyone using the Utility Worlds mod or any other mod that allows for dimensions to be added at any time.  As it stands, if I add say dimensions 5, 6 and 7 to the blacklist today, by tomorrow I may need to add 2 or 3 more and restart the server for the list to take affect and by then the damage may already be done, you want to talk about annoying, that's rather annoying as well.  Perhaps then if you can't be bothered to add a simple whitelist, then you can make it so that Lush Caves do not generate in dimensions added by Utility Worlds mod by default which would also solve the issue of the gaping holes in the ground.  It's ultimately your mod either way and at least I can turn them completely off for the server.

This was working on a previous version. But I just checked the linked issue and it looks like the `lib` directory will go wherever the final build directory is, which I guess it's wherever the `finalName` config setting points to?  That will work for my usecase.
Yes, I can try to implement what I suggested, by mid next week. Will that be OK with you?

1) you restrict templates to come from the DynamicCities module: https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/terasology/dynamicCities/buildings/BuildingManager.java#L107  2) the map entry has only the prefab name as key, so two prefabs with the same name coming from different modules would overide each other: https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/terasology/dynamicCities/buildings/BuildingManager.java#L109  3) you are comparing only the strings to match. you should consider something like the asset resolving mechanism (maybe can reuse it?) that is used when querying blocks, for instance.  https://github.com/Terasology/DynamicCities/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/terasology/dynamicCities/buildings/BuildingManager.java#L220 
Turned out to be a generally rare circumstance that wouldn't affect a server operating "normally"  If you loaded the plugin while the server is up and you are logged in at the time the plugin is loaded, you are not added to the actors internal database, and any database insertions that require a non-null actor throw an exception. Logging out and back in again fixes the issue.
They return false for `listWithNulls.occursAt(-1, null)`  And in fact, now looking at `firstOccurrence`, which doesn't optimize away invalid indexes (but should I think), it looks like you'll get `-1` for `listWithNulls.firstOccurrence(null, -1, maxInteger)` since it is defined in terms of `occursAt` 
minecraft:1.12.2 mod:1.1.5
I still have the same issue 
Thanks Axel.  Two reasons:  1. Oracle database 12.2 version provides a set of functions that you can use to manage the complexity of passwords.  https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/dbseg/configuring-authentication.html#GUID-F09749BF-2881-4EE5-B59D-041E4796BAC4  On enterprise level, it is quite common to use these, or customize them as per the organization security requirements.  2. Not sure if I'm looking at the correct source code file, but I feel it is hardcoded to "flyway". In my opinion, it should be at least configurable parameter. https://github.com/flyway/flyway/blob/master/flyway-core/src/main/java/org/flywaydb/core/internal/database/oracle/OracleSchema.java
I did, and I'm not sure why it didn't work right from the start. Wiring was always cross-checked. Maybe a intermittent contact failure in the pin header contact though. First Idea was about a driver issue because of the other Wire1 issues I already had reported and which are still defective on either Due.

Again, the mod is checking permissions, I even posted 3 ways one item on project e tests for permissions before breaking a block. As for the plugin to cancel the drop, considering this has happened with 3 different protection plugins, I'm only going to assume this is a sponge bug.  I wish you would read what I've already put in the first post before asking that.
How is it possible to switch to MapDB, I thought that is no longer an option?
Basically in the sample app, the screen after a successful login has a delete account button. I think the SmartLock implementation might need a little tweaking. If the account it expects to find is already deleted, then the error is probably not being handled correctly.

Good question, updating is first on the list. We are using a custom pack based on an existing one, which included a requirement of a newer forge.

I forgot to mention we are using Spring Security.  According to the stacktrace it's going through the `WebSocketServerHandshaker` - so I suppose it has something to do with the websockets. I was not able to reproduce it locally, I just see the problem from the server logs. App is is deployed on K8S cluster behind proxies...   I know this kind of problem is pretty hard to solve. I wanted to report it  and to get some hint. I will try to disable the security layer.   Eg. this similar one had to do with Chrome requests: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/242 Yet another https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/340  It would be nice to have better logging support for these exceptions. 
I could find the error:  If i write:  test.AssignCategory("Category1"); test.AssignCategory("Category2");  category filtering works well  But if i write:  String Var = "Category1";  test.AssignCategory(Var);  Category filter does not work.

Dear Oscar,  sorry for the late reply, I could check that only after returning to my office. -        There are no exceptions in the error log -        The files are in the file field  Thanks for your help and kind regards  Stefan 
yes. even in the gridlayout also GridLayoutManager glm = new GridLayoutManager(rvgallery.getContext(),2,GridLayoutManager.VERTICAL,false); 
@laa, what version of OrientDB did you use? I will try to understand what executed inside which leads to the highlighted effect. Probably some OrientDB cache or something.
yes i can do enable or disable the items. in my 1st post i saied "i desactivate all the publics torrents". 
I checked, it's happening always without reason(just when client was launched) but when i try download something, memory leak faster.
Hi. Yes sorry I couldn't remember the exact name for the "entity exporter" I was reffering to the "World Item Exporter".  I'm glad that you have been able to reproduce the bug and I hope you will find a way to correct it because your mod is really cool and usefull.  Cheers

Hello, You can see the accurate input I'm providing in the gif and you can see the behavioural response from the LSP.  I was trying to get it to auto-complete my inputs. The thing is that sometimes it just triggers on it's own while I'm typing, sometimes it doesn't get triggered by the `Ctrl + space` shortcut, sometimes it overwrites the entire line, or it just spits the correct method one line lower leaving the residue I was typing where it was and similar stuff.
I just tried that and it connects the lldb debugger, but it doesn't stop at breakpoints.  It prints "Attention!

Oh of course, sorry ONEPLUS A3003, running OP3_O2_Open_26 (Android 8.0.0 patch 1 Sept 2017)  Thing is, they were gray in the beginning, then they suddenly changed colour...

YES,I follow your wiki like this . Download Material Theme.zip Open Preferences -> Plugins -> Install plugin from disk... and choose the zip. Go to Preferences -> Editor -> Colors & Fonts -> Scheme -> Choose between the 3 Material Theme's. 
It still exists. Small fireballs don't explode, they only set blocks on fire where they hit. No OExplosion involved as far as I can tell. 
Hi,  while trying to send cloud to device message I got exception saying **Exception : java.io.IOException: Connection failed to be established**  Here is part of ServiceClient.class which throws exception: ```     public CompletableFuture<Void> sendAsync(String deviceId, Message message) {         CompletableFuture<Void> future = new CompletableFuture();         this.executor.submit(() -> {             try {                 this.send(deviceId, message);                 future.complete((Object)null);             } catch (Exception var5) {                 future.completeExceptionally(var5);             }          });         return future;     } ```  Here is calling of send, it's modified desktop service example: ``` protected static void sendMessage(String commandMessage) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, UnsupportedEncodingException {     List<CompletableFuture<Void>> futureList = new ArrayList<CompletableFuture<Void>>();     Map<String, String> propertiesToSend = new HashMap<String, String>();      // Message messageToSend = new Message(commandMessage + Integer.toString(i));     Message messageToSend = new Message(commandMessage);      messageToSend.setDeliveryAcknowledgement(DeliveryAcknowledgement.Full);      // Setting standard properties     messageToSend.setMessageId(java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString());     System.out.println("Message id set: " + messageToSend.getMessageId());      // Setting user properties     propertiesToSend.clear();     propertiesToSend.put("key_" + Integer.toString(0), "value_" + Integer.toString(0));     messageToSend.setProperties(propertiesToSend);      // send the message     CompletableFuture<Void> future = serviceClient.sendAsync(deviceId, messageToSend);     futureList.add(future);      System.out.println("Waiting for all sends to be completed...");     for (CompletableFuture<Void> future_loop : futureList)     {         try         {             future_loop.get();         }         catch (ExecutionException e)         {             if (e.getCause() instanceof  IotHubDeviceMaximumQueueDepthExceededException)             {                 System.out.println("Maximum queue depth reached");             }             else             {                 System.out.println("Exception : " + e.getMessage());             }         }     }     System.out.println("All sends completed !");      System.out.println("Waiting for the feedback...");     CompletableFuture<FeedbackBatch> future_recv = feedbackReceiver.receiveAsync(); // Default timeout is 60 seconds.

@clintongormley I was using Elasticsearch 2.0 and got the following error  script_score query does not support [file]  It is possible I was doing something else wrong but when I changed "file" to "script_file" it worked ;) 
I know how to with ddms, but im without a pc anytime soon. Ill be looking into a console emulator to do that. Ill get back to you once i have it. 
That's strangs. I still receive a StackOverflowException. On two different PCs, eclipse Oxygen and Neon. Both with the current develop branch. I attached the correct log again. In the mean time, could you please send the imported model to me? Thank you!  [log.txt](https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE/files/1217184/log.txt)

When you did the test, your global thru account host had the direct  access to the destination host, so you cannot tell if you get there via  global thru or not. You should try to connect to the host, that cannot  be accessed via global thru account.  Best regards, Frolov G.V.  On 10/16/2012 03:38 PM, Andrey Hitrin wrote:  > Cannot reproduce.

It only happens when I have sentinel added to its traits.
Thanks for your feedback. Im' running Nextcloud 14.0.3 on an Odroid HC-2 with up-to-date NextcloudPi.  Ah, and btw. with the German translation of the android app, the message is too small to read the text on a vertical screen. I needed to switch to horizontal view to read the message in total and get its meaning.

It can not transfer into the ExtraUtilities2 Wireless battery, and cannot transfer into any Actually addition machines. And cannot accept energy from EnderIO Capacitor Banks but can transfer energy into the Capacitor Bank.  Testing other storage blocks in our pack to see if it has more issues.
test passed.
Version 8 Update 91, so it should be the newest version.  Until now it did not happen in maximized window mode. Any idea what it could be? 
Hi koral,  where should I place gifTextView.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null)?  I placed above "return ssb",no work; placed here gifDrawable.addAnimationListener(new AnimationListener() { @Override https://github.com/Override public void onAnimationCompleted(int loopNumber) { Log.i(TAG,"reseting gif..."); gifTextView.setLayerType(View.LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE, null); gifDrawable.invalidateSelf(); } });  some  item animated,some item does not, they have the same emotion. am i doing something wrong? where is the proper place to put the method?  thanks 
It is a new installation of Buildcraft addition and Eureka, so after I installed the latest versions. I also tried in a new world and it did the same.

you are right. I'll check why my browser won't display it but it is indeed there

Hi Jörg,  I downloaded the snapshot today and tried it again. Gcviewer cannot handle it. I had to remove the reasons for GC pause to make it work.   Regards, Jayneel 
By that i meant we dont have respawnWithClass enabled  Thanks again! 
[glxinfo.txt](https://github.com/asiekierka/FoamFix/files/2130223/glxinfo.txt)  GLXInfo attached. textures.FasterAnimation was 1 initially  There's not much difference.
Yes, that's a good idea. 
> Perfect analysis. Would you like to fix these problems?  Thank you for your reply,but im not good at java ...  I have not tried Connector/C or Connector/C++, but I think it's  probably the same problem.
@spencergibb Yes, I am. I've provided you my dependencies.
hmm i can't seem to replicate it Java. It was only an issue through quercus. I think it's not a bug in orientdb. sorry 
Fantastic. I'm able to load this into my project now. Thank you very much @jamie-beardedhen  
It is `filesystem` location
See https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/minimesos/blob/master/opt/apps/chronos.json.   It seems Mesos adds an extra `--http_port` with the port from the configured port range.
First example: If you host Jetty directly on an IPv6 address and you use an IPv6 client, the request log says: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 - - [25/Apr/2017:08:27:20 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2802   If you however enable the http-forwarded module and send a request using curl like:  `curl -H 'Forwarded: for="[2001:db8:cafe::17]", for=192.0.2.43' -g "http://[::1]:8080/"`  [2001:db8:cafe::17] - - [25/Apr/2017:14:16:50 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2802   So the behaviour is different. With IPv4 it's the same.  Second example: Our application uses the IPRangePredicate [1] from OpenSAML.  They pull the IP address from the request and check via com.google.common.net.InetAddresses to see if its a valid address, which it isn't because of the brackets.   final String address = httpRequest != null ? httpRequest.getRemoteAddr() : null; if (address == null || !InetAddresses.isInetAddress(address)) {    return false; }  I was wondering where it should be normalized... But since rfc7239 states that it MUST be enclosed by brackets in the Forwarded-header, I think it's up to the consumer (jetty in this case) of this header to normalize this into an parsable IP as if Jetty was approached directly and not via a proxy.  [1] https://git.shibboleth.net/view/?p=java-opensaml.git;a=blob;f=opensaml-profile-api/src/main/java/org/opensaml/profile/logic/IPRangePredicate.java;h=0161ce469a7d8531ca5f96c909cc14f79fde705a;hb=HEAD#l100   
yes I tried without any texture pack. It happens even without optifine. 
I'm using what's on ATC currently:  ResourcefulCrops-1.12-2.1.0-61.jar Cyclic-1.12-1.7.12.jar forge-1.12.1-14.22.0.2464-universal
> I cannot shoot any tank. How did you do it?  simply open the menu of the car put shells and right-click simple
Yes, it is still a problem on GAMA that is updated and it seems not a problem on new download. May be you can tag as low-priority?

This one's my fault. I had a Docker build of Confluent Platform running that was blotting out my build from source. Sorry for the noise >_<
At the moment mine just skips rendering the board when you set the speed to 32x or higher.
also SELECT_SCRIPT and SELECT_PASS_WORDLIST. I would do it. 
Both internal (serial photos) and external (single photo and video).
No, the bug is still there.
@iocanel @jimmidyson i think this kind of transformation is relatively.  you can used original model convert json and  used the same json convert model  the result is same  original model 
Yes it still happens. I've noticed it usually occurs if you minimize rsbot while script selection is loading. 
It does not help, --launcher.GTK_version 2, --launcher.GTK_version 3, or remove it.
I will be trying to get the logcat after the "force close". Actually i haven't seen it lately so maybe it is problem with my watch. I will be trying to get logcat If it happens again. 
Activating abilities and casting spells etc. at the end of an opponent's turn would probably occur more often than doing nothing during an opponent's turn.  It's the last possible moment to use any mana available, and would be very useful. 
yes, in my simple test it works 
@AlexDBlack The derivative of input to logSumExp, used for the implementation of CRF layer
Still got the same behavior.  
Hi!  I'm using Ulbotech protocol in Bin mode because Text format is not working in some of the reason. Text format wasn't working on standard Traccar versions like 3.6 or 3.7   When using text mode, the received commands are not processed on the server side.  It looks strange that by setting command to text mode, the traccar log is still showing it as hex.

Traccar is receiving in Bin mode and is processed properly, device is shown on the map etc, I only have problems sending commands to the device.  Also sending command in text are not working. ![screen shot 2016-10-03 at 19 19 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3518047/19046609/7257405e-899e-11e6-98dc-953d1bca9328.png) ![screen shot 2016-10-03 at 19 19 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3518047/19046610/728d4fe6-899e-11e6-8b30-8d2d8030a7a6.png) ![screen shot 2016-10-03 at 19 19 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3518047/19046611/72915f3c-899e-11e6-99d4-7e5a51b2dcb3.png)  Regarding your second question I just downloaded the latest version from: http://myultrashare.appspot.com/s/traccar-web/dev/latest/traccar-web.war

@TylerJewell:  Reply to: 1. If you mean my distro I mentioned that in my original report (Arch Linux) 2. Yes it runs fine the output is:  ``` bash Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally latest: Pulling from library/hello-world  c04b14da8d14: Pull complete  Digest: sha256:0256e8a36e2070f7bf2d0b0763dbabdd67798512411de4cdcf9431a1feb60fd9 Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest  Hello from Docker! This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.  To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it     to your terminal.  To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash  Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:  https://hub.docker.com  For more examples and ideas, visit:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/ ``` 1. The link you provided seems to indicate that I should try: `docker run --rm -t -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock eclipse/che start`? If so, please read my original report again as I mentioned I tried that and it failed. If you meant something else please be more specific (I'm not trying to be rude, it's just I don't know what you meant for me to do by sharing that link).  
Hi Andy,  yes, it's version 3.5.0, the one which was updated on my phone on the 13th.   I just did some tests again a few minutes ago. The strange thing is now it seems to be working again? I had these issues the last two days and it was reproducible every time. But it's still the same version and now it's working. Weird ...   Well, thanks for your reply, Andy!  :-)  
+1. I will verify this with secured backend and if any issues I will raise it. 
Thanks!

Hi @slemeur , apologies, this was fixed while I was in the process of submitting the issue.  Adding a stack as per the documentation does work for me now, the issue I was experiencing was from an unrelated cause.  We can close this issue.
Ah, I see. And yes, I opened it in Eclipse before for sure. And I also think that this might be a quite common scenario... ;-)  Anything we can do about this? The long list of errors showing up doesn't look pretty... :-)
@nicolas-raoul I removed the "Search this Area" button if connection is lost. Currently if connection gets lost it shows a snackbar With the message but "Search this Area button" is still there. Clicking it makes the nearby stuck at it even if the connection is re-established.  IMO removing "Search This Area" button whenever connection gets lost would be a nice option.
Is docker-plugin deprecated and should be replaced by cloudbees plugin?
Looks much better. Please close this issue. One remark, I think the whitespace between sashes is too big (similar to the  default styling). Please take this a personal feedback, I understand that this is a question of personal taste.  
There is no `.pmd` file in the project folder.  I fixed the error message problem but hit another.  To fix the error message, I went into my PMD ruleset XML file and removed a custom rule.  The custom rule is based on a Java class I wrote.  If I include the custom rule, then the PMD plugin throws a `ClassNotFoundException`.  The PMD plugin does not have the class in the classpath.  How do I add my custom class so that the PMD plugin can use it?  I tried "Select a working set..." on the property page but that did not seem to work.

I simply wanted to get started experimenting with JanusGraph and felt like following the building instructed commands should work. While I may eventually want to use jars they are not my priority now. I just wanted to step through the docs, get the basic JanusGraph server working (probably with inmemory backend I suppose) and start to make some simple experiments with Gremlin etc to build a trivial graph database.

I will give it another try. I have already spent a few minutes looking into the bug... 
I installed build 229 on both client and server, with no luck.  Note that the previously installed build was 228  Problem still persists.
asteroidConfig: https://pastebin.com/BpetYn9g (not a minimal one required to reproduce, will try to provide one later today) It loaded properly I think, all ores added are showing up properly. (mods used: ProjectRed, Immersive Engineering, NuclearCraft, Thermal Expansion)  Regarding lag: yup, thought about that, but every other block around was breaking properly and I was getting drops immediately. Only observatory blocks were doing this.  As a side note: could you make GUI wider, so full asteroid names are showing up? GUI occupies a very small percentage of my screen now...  G.
sorry, mistake: I meant "beam". English...is sometimes not so easy...
It was the current one. 
Yes, it points to the hash from when the PR was created.  There could have been 3 other commits since then and it does not see them. 
Thanks for the comment.  The code works when compiled and run with Java SE, but as soon as I use RoboVM it dies with the Runtime Exception.  It doesn't tell me which specific HTMLUnit class is causing the issue; rather I have commented out all references to HTMLUnit line-by-line and any HTMLUnit class calls to causes the same Runtime Exception, even with try-catch.  Is anyone else having problems with HTMLUnit or other 3rd party JARs with RoboVM in  RoboVM Eclipse? 
The old custom one I used with 3.7 worked fine. I'm working on upgrading to 4.x to see if that resolves #2453, but I'm having problems with this and gif playback speed.  Here's a small standalone project that reproduces these glitches: https://github.com/moxie0/GlitchyCorners

We have our own copy of the IPCameraFrameGrabber in our source code because we were running out of memory on an ARM Chip because the IPCameraFrameGrabber creates a 4096 element byte array on each grab. https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv/blob/fc30fc8b5f1415d957727fb55fe549b248b29552/src/main/java/org/bytedeco/javacv/IPCameraFrameGrabber.java#L139  This was causing the JVM to run out of memory.  If you are curious you can see our modifications here:  https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/blob/37e7aeb5f2fadf9a3e5f7f8fd83ec8dc7de44808/core/src/main/java/edu/wpi/grip/core/sources/IPCameraFrameGrabber.java#L212  Anyways, back to the null pointer issue. I'm going to simply change it so that instead of returning null we throw an exception. I'm happy to make a PR with the same change in your version if that would help. 
@SecUpwN  He he! I was thinking the same thing (about the alignment), but was afraid to say anything, as I could come across as very ...you know. Anyway, I agree with all your comments.   Regarding the Ciphering indicator as shown on slide window. In all honesty, I have little frekkin clue to what it is actually telling us. I posted about it in the XDA thread, but never had any constructive response to my speculations. Thus that functionality is still purely speculation, but has something to do with the current enciphering status, which surely/probably depend on the current network you're connected to. (I started a [new thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2744850), to properly map out SM.)   What we would also need is the CI that is set in the SIM by your service provider.  This require us to use either:  (a) the AT command entry (my preferred way), as we had in the first versions or (b) the internal SIM related API/IPC commands, for reading the SIM EF files.  @xLaMbChOpSx  Would it be a problem to re-implement the AT command entry possibility as we had in the earlier versions? (Before I was able to test.) If so, we could use another slide page for this type of entry. I really promote the ATCoP entry, over the API stuff, because it give you complete and direct control without weirdness.  I know people probably think I'm a pain-in-the-.. for always talking obsessively about the AT access, but few people know that it allows for close-to full control of the Baseband, including completely reprogramming most RF-related main functions, as I have tried to document elsewhere.   @SecUpwN I forgot to mention that the persistence bug is an old one where the logic is reversed. Just check it and it will close down nicely. 
Hi @swankjesse , I can get a test case ready sometimes . But I can give you quick response payload with bunch of Set-Cookie from which I would like to construct a request payload with the same set of cookies from the earlier given response. Sample of payload with cookies from which I would like to construct a OKHttp request object as mentioned below.  ### Response Payload  ---  ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Expires: -1 Pragma: no-cache X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319 X-Powered-By: AM Vary: Accept-Encoding Content-Encoding: gzip Date: Tue, 26 Jul 2016 12:35:08 GMT Content-Length: 949 Connection: keep-alive  Set-Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=rej2xzwk04qewwkks2j3waec; domain=.psl.com; path=/; secure; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: kns=cECa%2fzrO%2fz8CSNuuhDBzBQ%3d%3d%2fW7FfxcEJnSyPteckFGo88khlgyNzgBQyb%2fNlIZk%2fj4qTP%2fx%2f%6ogj9; domain=.psl.com; path=/; secure; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: krl=664; domain=commsec.com.au; path=/; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: psl=NF5oxEr8GNx2AtHRpOzCoOkGQJqckcA%3d%3d; domain=.psl.com; path=/; secure; HttpOnly Set-Cookie: gyk=1FQULisVdAgPawwRgLfza3g%3d%3dM8RTbwXdbc62RodKIkw4t2vem5a6Ggb; domain=.psl.com; path=/; secure; HttpOnly  {"message":"Sucess"}  ```  ### Request Payload I would like to construct from the above response.  ```  GET /v1/api/getOrders HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Dalvik/2.1.0 (Linux; U; Android 6.0.1; Nexus 5 Build/MOB30P) Referer: https://app.psl.com/?OS=android Origin: https://psl.com Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 Host: app.psl.com Connection: Keep-Alive Accept-Encoding: gzip **Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=rej2xzwk04qewwkks2j3waec;  kns=1cECa%2fzrO%2fz8CSNuuhDBzBQ%3d%3d%2fW7FfxcEJnSyPteckFGo88khlgyNzgBQyb%2fNlIZk%2fj4qTP%2fx%2f%6ogj9; krl=664;  psl=NF5oxEr8GNx2AtHRpOzCoOkGQJqckcA%3d%3d; gyk=1FQULisVdAgPawwRgLfza3g%3d%3dM8RTbwXdbc62RodKIkw4t2vem5a6Ggb; ```  At the moment when I use JavaNetCookieJar to construct the OkHttp object it's only adding ASP.NET_SessionId and ignoring other cookies to add to it.  In Summary, I would like to construct the cookie for the request like  `Cookie: <name>=<value> [;<name>=<value>]...`  Where the each pair on the request being returned from the response with the multiple "Set-Cookie"  I hope it's quite clear.

Hi,  After setting this option to false, the problem is no longer encoutered. Thanks.  The problem is I am working on a protected project, perhaps is there a way to communicate you my ontology without letting everybody access to it?  Kinds regards,  GA
So it's the start of a new day and I can see the button on the PR now.   Not sure what I did differently.  The network connectivity is a good thought.  I will investigate and get back to you.   I am getting a 403 error code pop up (see below).   This implies that the 403 is being sent from pasteb.in   or if this plugin is hitting a bitbucket API and bitbucket is returning that.   ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/723989/23463547/27caddf4-fe4f-11e6-86cb-3fde75f1256c.png)  I can't find anything of interest in the developer tab within chrome.  
Hi @moezbhatti,  It doesn't crash. Gets stuck on white/blank screen.  I think problem occurs when you have non functional/broken playstore.  
Server example. Code is not compled. RakNetClientSession - missed  
None (apart from lands) and none.  No pws or creatures were controlled by opponents.  DL Atarka didn't have pro black and ended up in the gy as did animate dead.  It was a 3way ffa. Will see if I can recreate it.
Yeah 
DITA-OT 1.8.5 and DITA-OT 2.1 have the same problem. 
This is my API usage pattern https://github.com/nikolayspb/lettucedemo though I cannot reproduce it locally. I use setex, get, Lua script, pubsub and ping.  In production I use sentinel configuration, btw. https://github.com/nikolayspb/lettucedemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lettuce/demo/SomeValueRedisRepo.java https://github.com/nikolayspb/lettucedemo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lettuce/demo/SimulationRunner.java  I see you made some commits, can I try as snapshot?
I use latest version 0.14.1 but before some time ago I had another old release and had same problem
God I'm sorry for all this trouble I've caused you :) I'm not sure if all of them do but this is the standard keyboard. I don't think that they do use scroll or num lock at all.
I must not have gotten the full mod pack because irises are non-existent in my game 
Not sure, @quintesse just said that it didn't work for him. 
Hi gdt, hi cketti,  I'm trying to connect my **Samsung Galaxy S8 with the PC** and the Device will be shown as plugged (Linux CentOS 7) I've already installed the `android-tools` with `adb`, but when I type `adb devices `nothing will be shown: ``` # adb devices * daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 * * daemon started successfully * List of devices attached  ``` I've already enabled inside K9-Mail | Einstellungen (settings) | Globale Einstellungen (global settings) | Fehlersuchvorgang (Error search ?!?) | Fehlersuchprotokoll (Error protocol ?!?) **TRUE**.  When I talk about "freeze" I mean, always if I use the Papierkorb leeren (empty trash) the **K9-Mail wait 5 to 10 sec. and then the program continue to work as expected**. No error message was shown.  This start first with the Android 9.0 (Pie) update, with the Android 8.0 (Oreo) everything was fast.  Thank you for your patience with me! Klaus.
> What is wrong with it?  sorry,I replied to you so late. I configured as follows ``` spring:    cloud:     gateway:       discovery:          locator:          enabled: true           filters:           - name: Hystrix              args:              name: fallbackcmd              fallbackUri: forward:/fallback ``` throw exception like this: ![c3691104-02d8-448e-891f-c18bc0999f88](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28719668/48681826-d646d200-ebdf-11e8-84c5-c7bd59092ff0.jpg) 
There's no default access in interfaces: by default they're all public.
OK I finally figured out the problem.  I installed Java8 on this new Mac, but it already had Java11 on it and was using that as default.  I switched the JAVA_HOME to jdk8 by using this command: `export JAVA_HOME="$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8)"` and then it built fine!
- test using any file set as "available offline" - have no internet access (eg, turn on airplane mode) - click on file to open it  You will now wait ~ 65 seconds, with "Fetching most recent version of the file." on your screen.  There is even a further maddening delay of 5 seconds or so, where a "using old version of file" is shown at the bottom of screen.  After this all passes, you will be able to view the old version of the file.  Understand that, for example, you may often need to look through many documents quickly.  I was at the airport, and had to search through 8 documents to find an obscure number I needed.  Timeout in such a case should be much, much, much less.  Say -- a few seconds at most?  Alternatively, a way to just view a cached file should be available.  EG, long click/hold menu?  Even better for it to realise that you'll never get a file, when the phone has no network connection.  And most maddening of all.. I was (as mentioned) looking for something at the airport.. so, if you close the file and re-open?  Same behaviour.  
Currently, I'm on 1.2.1. I see you updated to 1.5, I'll update to it and report back about this! 
nothing seams intreasting in the log but here it is [debug.log](https://github.com/Cadiboo/NoCubes/files/3621651/debug.log) 
Just the following line is enough:  ``` import modtweaker.gas.IGasStack; ```

I reached out to the original developer when creating the issue but have yet to hear back. I will try to incorporate his changes and test it out if I don't hear anything.

I just had `\public()` being complained about. 
Hi Kyle - I've asked Andrea to reply if she has time. If she is not able, I'll get back to you after my next trip (beginning tomorrow), after I've tried to re-construct the path to the errors. Note: a couple of other achieves have been built since the update and they are fine. 
@dennisoelkers I'm running graylog on docker, and the log files on not their default location, do you know where they are located? There are no indexing errors logged in the dashboard view in the past 24 hours. 
There weren't any machines or anything attached to it, nor any close enough to have done it anyway.  For inventory management however, Forestry backpacks (shift+right click on block with the backpack to dump) and Quark are present on the server, so there's that possibility. I will test with both of these later when I get the chance.
Hi, Jon.  There is gist: https://gist.github.com/janzar/3698e595d1fb8fa9309c177315a2434f. It contains both log file and application used to generate it. I have changed pushy a little bit:  TokenAuthenticationApnsClientHandler:  long keyShift = 67L * 60L * 1000L; Date issuedAt = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() - keyShift); this.authenticationToken = new AuthenticationToken(signingKey, issuedAt);  and removed some fields from log file. Test application works following: once a minute it tries to send a batch of 50 pushes. As I create token with time set to 67 minutes ago, after little more than 3 minutes of creation it expires. So all pushes in first three batches get response, but only fraction in 4th batch (pushes that didn't got response within 40 seconds are canceled by timer) and all again in 5th batch.
I uninstalled Google Contact Sync using Titanium Backup. I just tested this again by installing/uninstalling it again, and found that I can easily reproduce the error. It requires 2 reboots before the group UID shows back up 
I can't access my linux partition now, but here is the installer http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/ 
The list is still empty, and this issue has occured immediately after installing and running the app from F-Droid.
I think I might have found it. Thanks anyway :)
A project file shouldn't be necessary since you can just create a new project with the control classes I am showing in the image, then just place one single element, save it and then try to load it, you will get this error.  Edit: accidentally closed sorry
I tested it with other video podcasts, same problem with aspect ratio.  
will do, it is happening again for other two pictures 
We have tested with provided solutions on Version: 2.1.7 and it works. Thank You. 
Here is a test project [link](https://github.com/sstubbs/vertx-maven-plugin-testproject)  I ran `./steps.sh setup` to setup the project and have just added the timer with the logger which fires every 5 seconds to the verticle to test.  The the three options I have tried are: `./steps run_with_jvm_args` `./steps debug_with_jvm_args` `./steps debug_with_port` 
It’s the latest 
Sorry I forgot: CC  1.7.10-1.73 p++ 1.7.10-1.2.4  Yes, it does the full chatmsg via speaker output, then returns the error. 
hi..thanks for the reply..after install the plugin and run in the terminal, seems than itś running but doesn't appear any gui ![errorsy2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/616412/13037519/678a44ce-d354-11e5-8a16-743c82b61931.png) 
is it technically possible to also maintain the rng on events like particles? it would be a massive upgrade to not loose rng when sprinting etc @Earthcomputer 
I tried to reproduce it but wasn't able to. It seems the issue has been fixed! Last time I remember seing it was 2 or 3 weeks ago. Since, we moved our frontends to n1-standard-2 instances, maybe it's linked?  I let you close the issue if you want to. I'll reopen it if I see it again in the future.  Thanks!

Put a rex down in an iron cage, set the time to night, and watch the hunger bar with a dinopedia.
it will wait forever I tried to play around with the kill parameter already  the container itself is stopped at this time so just the feedback seems not to work 
Apologies, I wasn't clear. In the example code I sent, the lunch break is given a small (20 minute) window in which it can be "delivered". This would, at least I think, make it more likely that routes are generated with the lunch break unassigned, thus causing the cost penalty override to be applied. You could give the lunch break a wider window in which it can be taken and the problem still occurs, though.  In practical terms, it is more important to insert a break than a job for legal compliance. The cost of a break not being in the route should be (and I think is in the current code) disproportionately high.  With the random component to the problem appearing, I'm trying to identify "special" measures the code takes which then gives the break location an identity. In LocalActivityInsertionCostsCalculator, you appear to have initially added some provision for breaks being handled differently, perhaps you had something in mind here as a problem?

No, I didn't. How do you think these things are related? 
Yup. PR coming shortly.

If it is removed all runs fine.  If it is defined, the rule execution crash with a NPE ... probably because a POM artifact hasn't "real" dependencies ? But we need/use such declarations in our parent pom to force all projects to rely on some basic dependencies

Sorry, I wanted to put "CHE_CONTAINER", which is the name of the docker container. On the command "docker network ls" the output is as follows: ![seleccion_209](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10332003/31861792-fe711a6e-b72a-11e7-883a-5de9094c9695.png) When I run a single user server everything works fine.
I created a new file called `derp~` inside the root of my project directory, and that warning did indeed go away. However, I then moved the file into another ignored directory, and the warning did not re-appear to tell me it was covered by the other directory. Lastly, I removed `^node_modules/` and `~$` from my .hignore and then did `hg st | grep '~'` to see what files were being covered, and there does not appear to be any `~` files in my `node_modules` directory. `find . -name *~` only finds my one `derp~` file too, so I don't think I have any other `~` files. If that's the case, how can `^node_modules/` be covering it? 
ok. This is strange. I try on my home computer (Ubuntu) and it works as expected. I used "fresh" pref and also the same pref than my other computer. It was the same database.  I will try again on my work computer (windows) tomorrow. 
There is not that file in that directory.

I am using Buildcraft.  Odd thing happened.. I can reproduce this all day long in a production/test world.  I made a new world just for grins and I cannot reproduce this issue.  I'm able to get buckets out of gasoline drums all day long.  Any thoughts on this? 
hi @aurelhubert sorry for late response, the error appears when i use ahbottom version 1.3.1 to android version below API 23 (Marshmallow).  - No I didn't use vectors i still used drawables for the icons.  - appcompat I used are v7:24.0.0  so i rollback using ahbottom version 1.2.3 and it's works well across API level e.g from 16 to 24 
@lumpfish  Apology for a not-so-clear description. I have updated it. The issue was originally created with the following in mind:  JCK tests currently run via STF wrappers. These wrappers are part of systemtest repository. So, in order to compile and run JCKs we need to compile systemtests and STF. However JCKs have run without STF wrappers in the past. So, for sake of simplicity and ease of maintenance we may want to think about running JCKs without the STF wrappers.
it's working now, thanks for your quick response, it is definitely an awesome lib.
Sorry, I haven't commented the 'fade' thing - from my perspective, this class in undesirable. It enforces the fade effect even if I don't want it. However, it may be added via `styleClass` whenewer needed. Are you ok with this change?

I created sample. "https://github.com/kurofune/spring-boot-sample"  I tried 2 ways. 1. from Gradle    - I execute `gradlew bootRun`.    - I can change templates/index.html after accessing http://localhost:8080    - But in this way, I can not  proceed to next springboot devtool.  (ex.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32572784/cant-get-spring-boot-devtools-auto-restart-get-to-work-with-1-3m5-with-eclipse) 2. from Eclipse    - I import this project to Eclipse using `gradlew eclipse`.    - I execute `Run as Spring Boot App` from Eclipse.    - I can change templates/index.html before accessing http://localhost:8080.    - I can NOT change templates/index.html after accessing http://localhost:8080, and Eclipse said `The project was not built due to "Could not delete '/spring-boot-sample/bin/templates'.". Fix the problem, then try refreshing this project and building it since it may be inconsistent`.  Tell me if need more information. 
@eolivelli Sure. I will send a pull request later.

Hi Marc, Thank you for the quick response. I'm using the GUI PeptideShaker version 1.13.4 in ArchLinux. I was also experiencing a similar issue in Windows 7 with GUI version 1.13.1.

that just bubbles up the exception, I want the player to ignore this error and continue playing the ad until it finishes and then play the underlying content, right now it just calls this error and finishes the ad and plays the content, if I switch out the content stream for another one it finishes correctly.

@stefanomorson I was able to reproduce it following the steps described above.  Try this:  1. Browser should be full-sized before test.  2. Connect a live kura device to kapua  3. Go to Devices, select live connected device and go to its _**Configuration**_ 4. Select _**Position service**_ and verticlly resize bottom window (the _**Configuration**_ window) and shrink (horizontally resize) the whole browser window. _**Now all the unnecessary sliders should appear.**_

I find it quite nice to work with actually. Except for the bug I have now, of course. I have an implementation of ALS using the PactRecord model and now I ported it to the Array model to see whether this makes a difference in performance in this case.

Hi @masensio,  I filled out the formula. Can you see it?  BTW: Maybe it helps. I renewed a few days ago the ssl cert on the  server. I wonder, that no webserver log item appears from mobile device.

Embraal Bruiser has menace, I should have not been able to block him, I think that was the point. If the log gets saved I should have access to it. I will check for it later.
On my Win10 workstation the test crashes after 19 seconds with a StackOverflow. But the stack size on Windows is much lower than on Linux, like only 250.  I tried the same test in an Ubuntu 16 VM with 5GB, there the test runs for a whole minute, then it crashes with: `  <testcase name="stressTest" classname="org.dizitart.testing.NitriteStressTest" time="59.335">     <failure message="java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded" type="java.lang.OutOfMemoryError">java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded 	at org.h2.mvstore.Page.splitNode(Page.java:400) 	at org.h2.mvstore.Page.split(Page.java:371) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:205) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:209) 	at org.h2.mvstore.MVMap.put(MVMap.java:211) ` On java version "1.8.0_131" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode)  Again inside a a page split loop in mvstore.MVMap.put where the problem seems to be in: `  protected Object put(Page p, long writeVersion, Object key, Object value) {          ...          ...

After 11 records it splits the map, adds them as child node to the current page and self-calls the method. No wonder that after 15000 records the stack goes 1363 calls deep and the map containers occupy more space than the actual data. Something is very wrong here anyway, when I put a breakpoint in line " if (c.getMemory() > store.getPageSplitSize() && c.getKeyCount() > 1) {" I see that for every insert it stops a few times on this line. 6 times for the first insert. And for every two new inserts after that it stops there one additional time. Increasing the page size by a factor 1000 might help, but the whole concept of getting a deeper call stack for every other insert seems very wrong. Please put your breakpoint on MVMap line 201 and see if you get the same behavior.  
I'm using linux. I loaded my tests on another machine (also linux), also directory has changed. Original variable directory contained spaces. 
Thank you very much. I've created test. [rbeans_enummap_test.zip](https://github.com/benas/random-beans/files/559323/rbeans_enummap_test.zip) 
It can wait. Points don't belong to specific packages, do they? I'm thinking for the one thing I was trying to do I could have a point category that different people can all have conditions in their own package check. 
I plan to take this to speak to a colleague who works on Android MD components to debug, please disregard for now!
Please try to reproduce. 1. Set System/Configurations - Search Configuration - Query time range limit - eg. 2 days 2. Go to input click on Show received messages 3. check the time frame selector field.  Some screensoths (14 days only)  https://screenshots.firefox.com/dTduzSI6GTCfm5LJ/10.14.0.90 https://screenshots.firefox.com/MuHZczo5qeia5RiV/10.14.0.90 https://screenshots.firefox.com/A0rqGop8ZRic6Czz/10.14.0.90 It show the "last 5 minutes", but is shows the 2 days search in the results (as you set under "Query time range limit").  If you disable the limit, you click the received messages it shows "all messages" and search fo "all messages".
Yeah, Kodi plays YouTube fine in 1440p but anything above that chugs in the same way Newpipe does. It uses the webm/vp9 mpeg dash input adaptive format. 
just comment the lines in addIndicator and it work ok now 
Done!

It does indeed.  I was just about to submit a pull request recommending subprocess.call(). 
Yeah, it has been fixed. Thank you
Yes, I just updated from 0.1 to 0.4. Now I uninstalled the 0.4 version and reinstalled it and everything works fine. Maybe some issues with the settings. Thanks a lot - great app!!! 
Apologies! I was incorrect in my assessment; the glut of gang tag avatared posts were the result of these posters actually having no avatar, save for a gang tag.  I will close this, and instead suggest consideration towards a method of displaying avatar AND gang tag. 
3) Add config option to set energy input value. Now, if I set energy usage value in config bigger than 250 RF/t, Refinery consumes energy very fast => energy buffer of Refinery doesn't fill. 
Hey @Harshil7924 and welcome!  Have a look at our [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Dev-Setup). In particular, you should familiarize with our [Entity System](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Entity-System-Architecture).  For this issue you might start investigating at `org.terasology.logic.inventory.ItemPickupAuthoritySystem#onBumpGiveItemToEntity` which handles the item pickup. 
I considered that before posting but since we are only using Forge 1291, rather than 1355+, I posted first before updating.  Updated to latest and just tested.  Tanks and buckets work fine now.. But the TConstruct error still occurs..  Will update Tconstruct and see if thats the issue. 
Points in the foreground should be connected to each other by short line .But are  connected around the entire earth. I have not tried, but I'm sure that pave the arc on the earth's surface from Tokyo to San Francisco will fail. The question is .. How to draw meridians and parralleli in their intermediate points? 
yeah im using the dw20 pack, i guess ill have to wait for the update, thanks. :D  
I use the german language and i had the problem with "Arabic prayer times" option only. (Please can you generally describe me, what is the difference with arabic prayer times and without.)

Yes the command works, only the sign breaks
``` # Configuration file  general {     # Sets the level limit of combining Items in an Anvil (vanilla default is 40) [range: -1 ~ 2147483647, default: -1]     I:anvil_level_limit=100      # Ignore the cumulative repair cost [default: true]     B:ignore_incremental_repair_cost=false      # If true, anvils will not take damage due to use [default: false]     B:noAnvilDamage=false } ```
In that case, `allow-external-publish` is working in some cases—including with the steps above—but not in others.  With `allow-external-publish=0`, the RPbus is correctly removed as an option for - the Plots pane (so the reprex above is not a bug) - the upper-right button on the Source pane (but see below) - a running Shiny app  However, RPubs still remains as an option for - an external HTML viewer for knitted Rmd - the Viewer pane - the upper-right button on the Source pane for a file that was previously published using RPubs    - such as an Rmd that was first published before external publishing was turned off, or the document was published using the external HTML viewer    - although I think the document getting published is empty in this case 
I'm able to run the stash plugin using docker, but it always fails using a mac (and we need it to run on a mac to build ios apps). Hopefully this helps :)  I'll have a look and see if I can find the plugin-stash.pr.log for this. 
http://pro2.com.au/8857 I guess it's a clone of the many WMR14 you find on ebay.  Note that DSub plays sometimes one or two consecutive tracks fine and than it hangs. While it's hanging it plays up to three seconds (0:03), jumps back to 0:00 and and plays the next 1-3 seconds, jumps back and so on. Note it doesn't really play, it's just the time display.  I also noticed that at the end of a track DSub plays sometimes 1-3 seconds beyond the displayed track-time.  I tired many other Android DLNA players with that device and they all worked fine. AirPlay from an iPod touch works fine. It would be great if I could control the volume on the DLNA renderer (via AirPlay this is possible).

Hey.  So, I don't know the project well to state facts, so here are my guesses: You could take away `@EnableRabbit` from `@RabbitListenerTest`, so `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration` is not loaded in. In order to get other beans from `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration`, the `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration` could be split up or you could redefine all beans in `RabbitListenerTestBootstrap`, so `RabbitListenerTestBootstrap` would be a full replacement for `RabbitBootstrapConfiguration`.  In that case user can use spring profiles (i.e test vs not test) to choose what bean configurations they choose.  The goal would be making the @RabbitListenerTest work with the spring boot default config spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=false.  Does that make any sense?
I have tested for different text, and have found that if the text is English,  wrapping is working , but if the text is Arabic wrapping does not working. 
@Ashish-Bansal  Hi Ashish,  As I tested, it seems like that bug has got fixed.  Great job, Yashwanth Krishnan 
I am running che as a standalone, not as a docker container. so, is there a work-around for this issues at the moment? I am unable to import my existing projects as of now. 
Nothing crashed. Everything still functioned. 
I click “Edit connection” on any connection. Then “Network settings (SSH, SSL...)”. Under “SSH Tunnel”, I enter my “User Name”, but it does NOT save the user name. 
I'd say yes. @TovaCohen I guess this should be included in doc.

@Sunstrike to allow for iron ingots/iron blocks to be converted to their compressed variants (http://www.minemaarten.com/wikis/pneumaticcraft-wiki/).  @mDiyo  I can't replace it, as I'm hooking into the EntityJoinWorldEvent. But you're right, I shouldn't even allow the item to spawn, and that's what I did. I've used the EntityJoinWorldEvent#setCanceled(true) so it doesn't spawn the entity, and spawned my own entity in afterwards. However, because even if the entity doesn't get spawned, it is still being referenced by Tinkers Construct and added to the player inventory, it is still duping...  But if you don't agree, that's okay, I've fixed it on my side ;).

That's the main point :) the system was not gracefully stop and I guess MapDB did not manage to store its cache on the disk and the files are not consistent.,,  and when started again MapDB never exit from initialisation ! but should throw an exception , try to recover as much as it can , give an error etc...  e.g you need to change MapDB to never freeze ...

GenericObjectInput was imported from com.alibaba.dubbo.common.serialize.support.dubbo.GenericObjectInput; (dubbo:2.5.10)  I'm using dubbo serialization not hessian. config like this:   ProtocolConfig config = new ProtocolConfig(); config.setSerialization("dubbo");  should i change the serialization to solve this problem?  note:   I use com.alibaba.dubbo.common.serialize.support.hessian.Hessian2ObjectInput  -> test ok; I use GenericObjectInput with ArrayList -> test ok; I use GenericObjectInput with CopyOnWriteArrayList -> test not ok;  
It still exists on one of my local machine, but the program can run fine with this error. I will close this for now. 
Fixed! 
Here you go - http://wizrd.tk/r7j6d1 
Still not working but error is not the same (see attached logs). When I got to http://localhost:8080, nothing happens  [log.txt](https://github.com/Decathlon/ara/files/4035631/log.txt) 
So making a loosely coupled design (not perfect though) hard wired again so that it integrates better in the old fashioned design? I am a bit hesitant about that.   Actually we are talking about WPS **4.0** right? Don't know about resources available for discussing current and future architecture and how to wire components and (probably more important) for implementing whole stuff.  Do we have a refactor strategy available, at least listing all core components which will have to be refactored? Is [Iceland](https://github.com/52North/iceland) the only next step? Seems to be a bit fuzzy (at least for me) what consequences this will have too. 
maybe - let me see if i can get it to hang outside of jenkins and i can hit it w/ `jstack`

That's probably a good option. 
I would suggest to write a test. I know that this causes additional effort for people who want to contribute, but we will not get a stable sample application otherwise, which can be already observed quite good. 
Sorry, should have included that info. I'm working on 1.1. So it's probably already fixed in 1.2 
If the picture progress is now reported separately we could just use the normal string (the one which is used if there is no log picture) in step 1

Hm... I don't know but I just tried "[Music-Player](https://github.com/MaxFour/Music-Player)", another fork of Phonograph, at that does not have the same problem. So it's somewhere in Vinyl, I guess. If you can't pin it down, nevermind. I can stick with Music-Player, although I don't like its folder-icons too much...

When I press Load there is warning in console. `Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of`MessageFields`.

`com.orientechnologies.orient.core.exception.OConcurrentCreateException: Cannot create the record #17:0 because the assigned RID was #17:1 instead DB name="testdb" DB name="testdb"`  and nothing much, but result is it doesn't work. it doesnt create data.
@samtstern  Yes. I observed that while working on [`FirebaseRecyclerPagingAdaper`](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/version-4.4.0-dev/database/src/main/java/com/firebase/ui/database/paging/FirebaseRecyclerPagingAdapter.java).  I did an experiment: - When I added this line   `mDataSource.observeForever(mDataSourceObserver)` Then after calling `getValue()` on `mDataSource` doesn't returned a null value  - When I commented the code of `observeForever` Then `mDataSource.getValue()` always returned a null value.  By observing this, maybe LiveData not hold values if nobody is observing
i've tried it with multiple blueprints (all freshly crafted) and i've also tried it with multiple templates. the second i connect the power the blueprint/template just go's into the builders inventory.  
Crossbows do not have proper rendering when held in the main hand, as with the nest of bees.  Also, crossbows cannot be fired in creative.
Using `/npc create test` creates an npc that is not pushable. Not sure how I could push him into the nether portal. I am not familiar with Citizens's in-game commands. I've only ever used it through my own plugins.  [EDIT] I used `/npc moveto` to move it into the nether portal. After a few seconds it disappeared, but when I teleported after it, it was not visible.
The fix for inheritance is trivial (see pull request). The fix for general assignment is quite complex: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1650614/isassignablefrom-with-reference-and-primitive-types http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.2  But it should be OK to limit it to boxing/unboxing. 
Yes I've tried it with the weirding Gadget as well. It too doesn't work. No fluid gets put into the chalice when no player is nearby.
Hmmm, not really sure. The bug was due to a malformed uri, which shouldn't really affect the cells, but it did anyway. I do remember that restarting the app fixed them, can't really confirm because both all branches are now completely different from master. 
Actually my video card is a AMD Radeon® HD 6370 ,512MB DDR3 VRAM ;)  As for dumps, in the game folder after the problem there are files like this http://pastebin.com/6yu4v70f  What happens is that during the creation of the world, the loading bars stop loading, the whole computer freezes and after about 20 seconds the Terasology window closes and it shows up a message (i think) from the JVM that says it cannot send a report (to its developers?) because there's not enough memory to do it.  If there's some kind of test i can do, or if it's possible to debug the program, i'm glad to help

Also in "OK" case. So it looks to me like Jitsi connected properly but marked account as offline regardless.  Reverting 5f9610c alone fixes the issue for me.

This is boost from FreeBSD ports. It hasn't been built with any special options, and is supposed to work for everything.  
thanks for quick response @hukid  when the authcode is incorrect the app crashes and shows an error "App has stopped"  [log.txt](https://github.com/square/react-native-square-reader-sdk/files/3115161/log.txt) 
Here it is  ``` import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;  public interface MyFeignClient {      @GetMapping(path = "/sample")     String feignMessage();  } ```  If I create a new interface like below  ```     public class MyFallback implements MyFeignClient  {          public MyFallback(Exception e) {          }          @Override         public String feignMessage() {             return "This is from fallback";         }     } ``` and then register this fallback as a FallBackFactory then the fallback gets invoked successfully. See the following config which works when registering a fallback factory  ``` FeignDecorators decorators = FeignDecorators.builder()                 .withCircuitBreaker(circuitBreaker)                 .withFallbackFactory(MyFallback::new)                 .build(); ```  But it does not works when I register a basic lambda with the builder method `withFallback`~
Great, thanks to Noor, I hadn't time to put the latest jar online, but we have more plans for v1.2.  at least we now know how to get a working version.

@arvindsv I think we can document it.

Ah, that should be it, I am still on the latest stable, 1.3.x. I'll test with 1.4.x.
Hey,  I just cloned the repo to assembly the jar and noticed that the tests fail on my system (with the same error I'm reporting).

I'm looking at andlytics/src/com/github/andlyticsproject/console/v2/AccountManagerAuthenticator.java which seems to use the Ubertoken method described in  http://nelenkov.blogspot.se/2012/11/sso-using-account-manager.html (excellent blog post btw). That blogpost mentions under 1. in "Logging in using AccountManager" that the first step is to get a ClientLogin token.  If it's not a ClientLogin token, what token is it used to pass to IssueAuthToken? 
When Card Scanner Disable (not Completely), than in Marshmallow  ask the Camera Permission and Allow the Camera Permission than Give me error and Cash the application. If i deny the permission than work perfectly... than how to handle the permission any idea..? 
@DonBruce64 It could be dynamic surroundings or serene seasons changes to snow that is causing the bug then ill do further testing to nail down the cause and resubmit to the appropriate mod author for compatability fixes or you can give our private test modpack a try and see if you can nail down the issue https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/arise-populus.1340101

Indeed, seems the issue is solved in the preview version 1.2.747.
Distributed session implementation such as redis and hazelcast, only update the modified part of session data to session storage.  And the session modification is captured by calling `WebSession::setAttribute`. Only modify session data's value without calling `setAttribute`, session data will not be updated anyway.  For example:  The following code will NOT add ("key", "value") to session key`A_DICT_TYPE_SESSION_KEY`'s value, if use redis or hazelcast based distributed session.  ``` WebSession session = ... Map<String, String> data = (Map<String, String>)session.getAttribute("A_DICT_TYPE_SESSION_KEY"); data.put("key", "value"); ```  You have to add `setAttribute` to the end like this.  ``` WebSession session = ... Map<String, String> data = (Map<String, String>)session.getAttribute("A_DICT_TYPE_SESSION_KEY"); data.put("key", "value");  // The following line looks redundant but is important for redis or hazelcast based distributed session. // It is used to tell redis or hazelcast that session data with key "A_DICT_TYPE_SESSION_KEY" has been updated. session.setAttribute("A_DICT_TYPE_SESSION_KEY", data); ```  `setAttribute` is overwrite by redis or hazelcast based distributed session to capture session data's modification.  For the above reason, we finally got "authorization_request_not_found" in some case since the code failed to update session's data. 
Hi @zhangzhx I am using latest SAM 0.2.4 and Docker version 17.10.0-ce, build f4ffd25  The issue which you referenced https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local/issues/158 has two issues reported. The second one ('invalid bind mount spec') has been marked resolved in 0.2.3. And I am not getting this one.  I am getting first one "open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified".  But I am able to resolve the error when running from cmd, using below command @for /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker-machine env') DO @%i  It is in Eclipse where I am still getting the same error (screenshot attached in previous post.)

Sure, here's an example of a cURL request which does the right thing:  ``` curl -u testuser:password -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST "http://git.internal/rest/build-status/1.0/commits/071c0a5bbe91233b43343c1aa44a374c2dca9e95" -d '{     "state": "SUCCESSFUL",     "key": "TEST",     "name": "helloworld #7-feature/do-stuff",     "url": "http://jenkins.example.com",     "description": "built by Jenkins @ http://ci/build/" }' ```

Hi Phil - thanks for the reply. It's the end of our day so I can debug tomorrow, but in the mean time I can confirm that I have not set the `spring.messages.basename` property explicitly in my app.

Nope. If you looked this up in your log - I'm currently in heavy development, so the server restarts are very often.
Added OS (Arch Linux). I tried with a completely minimal hello world main.go and it does indeed work.  I'll try and create a minimal example where it fails, could you suggest a non-trivial go project where debugging does work and I can try and work from there? I just tried with https://github.com/mitchellh/packer, which doesn't give the error, but nor does it actually stop at my breakpoints.

> What do you mean _empty_?  I mean that the page `Unique BTS Data` on our app stays empty. Not sure how to check if data even really gets collected since my AIMSICD folder only appears to contain the downloaded OCID .csv file. 
I confirm this is fixed in RC3. 
Hi I am using swagger api for creating workspaces and project. By using swagger api I need to change that location so that user can push code to mentioned github repository 
Yes, thank you, didnt know there was a X version of them aswell 👍 
That's great. Easy fix? Do you think it will make 1.6.1?  
So, I changed the following  ` cp = StsAssumeRoleWithSamlCredentialsProvider         .builder()         .stsClient(StsClient.builder().region(Region.US_EAST_1).httpClient(httpClient).build())         .asyncCredentialUpdateEnabled(true)         .refreshRequest(supplier)         .build(); `  to  ` cp = StsAssumeRoleWithSamlCredentialsProvider                 .builder()                             .stsClient(                    StsClient                    .builder()                    .region(Region.US_EAST_1)                    .httpClient(httpClient)                    .credentialsProvider(AnonymousCredentialsProvider.create()).build()                  )                 .asyncCredentialUpdateEnabled(true)                 .refreshRequest(supplier)                 .build(); `  And instead of getting the previously mentioned error, I'm just getting a 403 error from the STS service.  `software.amazon.awssdk.services.sts.model.StsException: Access denied (Service: Sts, Status Code: 403 ...`

Issue is not reproducible, closing the bug. 
Vendor is Oracle.  ``` PS F:\Glowstone-4\target> java -version java version "1.8.0_111" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode) ```
AntiFog is on mode NOFOG. AIR mode doesn't even get rid of fog at normal y level lol.
Will do today when we try the next caches :)  I have UnifiedNlp installed, so it should be able to get non-GPS positions - but then wifi/cell tower is not nearly good enough for geocaching anyway, so whatever 
How did I not know this absolutely awesome proof system and plugin you implemented! Thanks so much and sorry for the interference. 
Unfortunately I have been unable to reproduce this in a smaller test class. I also cannot make my full source available. I have never seen it take more than 2 waits (of 40ms each) to resolve the property, and I have only once seen it take 2 waits, so it is an incredibly narrow timing issue as far as I can tell. I also only see it when my disk I/O, CPU, and RAM are all at very high usage (I've never seen it occur without over 40 MB/s in disk writes, 95%+ CPU usage, 90%+ RAM usage, and creating/destroying hundreds of MB worth of objects/second). My hard drive is an SSD if that is relevant at all. I also made my transactions smaller to increase throughput and since doing so this issue has become much more rare. I now get it once every ~10 hours of runtime at full load. 
Must have done something wrong when I tried code fences.  Thanks for edit.  Yes it is similar I need to install on a test box to test one more time and capture details.  I remember lots of Java error issues though.  I am ok if you want to close mine referencing the other as I am fairly confident that once you guys dive into the code it will all be resolved.  I can follow the other one and even test builds since they sound similiar.  
dmg in the important jars folder. Did the picture I included come through?  not just local tracks, it happened with a track I loaded from ENCODE tracks too. It's happening most times I load tracks but not always? It may have to do with when multiple new tracks are loaded simultaneously but I'm not sure.

@marco-jacob Can you explain once again ?  I guess you deleted a cache which already had a note. Then you added it again and the note is still there. That sound perfectly fine as long as you either had a local note and saved the cache again while it is still held in cachecache or you had a note on gc.com and downloaded it again. 
@AfterLifeLochie  I expect it to work, and it's not :P  It never detects the gate base as a component either directly, or via an adapter, and I'm not sure why. 
It's a spread in an array. Exactly this chunk:  ``` js   deepColumnNames() {     const model = this.getModel();     return [[...Object.keys(model.nodes)],             [...Object.keys(model.attrs)],             [...model.linkWidthDeltaColumns]];   } ```  I know the first two spreads are redundant, but that was the code.  Apart from that, I've now checked some other previous versions (the one I had before updating was v20160517), with the following results: - v20160517 - Ok - v20160619 - Ok - v20160713 - javascript error "$jscomp.initSymbol is not a function” - v20160822 - javascript error “$jscomp.arrayFromIterable is not a function” - v20160911 - javascript error “$jscomp.arrayFromIterable is not a function”  Hope that helps.

Yes.   To fix this, there is two options: 1. make sure the type is not created if indexing fails 2. update the mapping on master even if indexing of doc failed  Option 1 is rather tricky to implement and I do not see why the type should not be created in the mapping so I'll make a pr for option 2 shortly. 
I got the debug build working for ubuntu 16 docker instance (host : ubuntu 14.04) .  thanks for quick help from babneet.

Hi, Lestard. I've checked fx-guice - it works fine with interceptors (It also provides FxApplicationThread annotation for executing method in JavaFX thread).   de.saxsys.mvvmfx.internal.viewloader.ViewLoaderReflectionUtils::getViewModelField tries to find @InjectViewModel only in current viewType, but in case of interceptors Guice creates subclass of viewType - that why it can't find such field. 
Yes I did try #5, it did not work out. That is the complete stack trace. I'm trying to figure out how it works so did not try for DSE. However, I tried with DSE drivers to connect but it did not work out.
No. Exatcly inversely. I updated from v2.X android to 3.0.X and server to v13. And after that my profile account hasnt got any image. On friends mobile phone (Android 4, Galaxy S3 Neo) it is working, but he DOESN´T use an own avatar. There is only the standard avaratar with the first letter of his name. I tested new accounts adding to the app and it is working on my device. 
I didn't mean developing two tggs in one project, but using multiple tggs as libraries in a third project. Like for example in https://github.com/emoflon/emoflon-ibex-tests . 
@normanmaurer Thanks I will check it out and let you know. 
That seems fine to me! I can't think of another case that would include a comma currently.
Sorry for the late response. This was tested with forge 1969 and BQ 126. I'll confirm that it's still a problem, and if so, get back to you. 
Ok i will test this version.  Application system "Download" with the same uid:  com.android.providers.downloads com.android.providers.drm com.android.providers.media com.android.providers.downloads.ui 
Hi @lorthirk , the error still persists, there are no changes. 
@h3xstream - I edited the first post and added the rest of the stacktrace. Sorry I didn't do that in the beginning.  But I don't see a `Caused by` in it... not sure it will be helpful.
Cannot replicate reliably anymore.
I'm afraid I've got no error, and as for the code, I don't have any piece ready.  I can try to make one, but can't promise, I've got lots to do currently.  Concerning the gwtupload problem with gwtbootstrap3: it actually works, but wait until the end of its retry policy to call `onFinishUpload`. This leads to 2 to 3 minutes waiting before the download shows as finished (even though it could have been done in less than a second).  Downgrading GWTBootstrap3 fixed the problem for me. But I don't see why it should be related.  Does GWTBootstrap3 overrides some of GWT's methods?

sorry, I meant POST instead of PUSH. The flag is also wrongly named "pushAlways" instead of "postAlways".  Until a couple of weeks ago there was only I "save" method on the resource repository. In the V2 version there is now a "create" and "save". So it becomes possible to distinguish "POST" and "PATCH". Before that it just did a POST. This thing now just needs to be enabled.  The general issue is a bit more complicated due to the flaws in the current serialization handling. I looked into all that and think I will have a solution tomorrow that does a first cleanup in this area by having a proper representation of a JSON API document and moving the logic out of the serializers.
@christophd Yes you are right, that works. It is certainly not the most obvious solution though. If this is the intended solution, it should be at least documented somewhere (@TovaCohen can you elaborate if it is already documented, or add a mention of that in the documentation?). But this is a thing you don't really expect that you have to read documentation for, maybe a little mention in the UI where there is the "Provide a condition that you want to evaluate (for example, `${in.header.type} == 'note'` or `${in.body.title} contains 'Important'`)." Or in a perfect world if the datatype is a JSON schema there could be a note added or something. (cc @syndesisio/uxd )
I figured the actual problem, I was wrong. It just won't show up in the thaumonomicon, even though it will function properly. (the recipes show up in the thaumatorium) They will also unlock properly.  This is the place, down until the end of the file. https://github.com/Frontrider/thaumic_arcana/blob/eb2b981739e0117d39d51d81d1e0b49446c0d23e/src/main/java/hu/frontrider/arcana/registrationhandlers/recipes/AlchemyRecipes.kt#L433  It creates a set of recipes,that changes the nbt of the specified item. (the aspect list is associated with the nbt)  Tried adding a set of "fake" crucible recipes (that would actually be desireable in this case) but they will not show up either.
Yeah. Why not 🙃  Would be great if you can say me some class names where I can find that snipped.  Additional to that. How do we want to behave with that badge? 🤔  I mean the repo can be "anything".  It can be published to bintray, sonartype, gradle plugin portal, own maven repo... I think we should agree on some for a badge (or get rid of the badge? 🤔 ) Should we also try to parse the URL to find out the repo?  I would suggest (because of "easieness"): * We have a default string like `published repository ($VERSION)`. While "repository" is a link to the publicationRepository config (or automatic via bintray plugin) * We try to parse the URL for bintray and the gradle plugin portal: ** If bintray add the shields.io badge. If gradle plugin portal use `published at gradle plugin portal ($VERSION)`(while gradle plugin portal is the link) * We provide a `shipkitconfig.releaseNotes.publicationRepositoryBadge` (but the name is wrong 🤔 ) which can be a customize string... Like `my awesome repo`.. leads to `my awesome repo ($VERSION)`  Wow... Sounds not so easy 😄
Clear data did not work, but I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it from play store, and it worked now.  Is this app using the faster Enketo forms yet?  I thought it was implemented already, but I don't see the switch language option in the form. 
I simply opened IntelliJ, installed the plugin, restarted IntelliJ, and then tried to check out a project from version control, using Gerrit as the remote.  I have checked the connection in the plugin settings - I get connection successful.  I reverse-proved this by deliberately giving the wrong username to make sure it would give an error (which it did). 
nope. fixed. Thanks a bunch. didn't notice the update until I was told from the discord.
It is surely caused by Tough As Nails, it surely linked to this issue. https://github.com/Glitchfiend/ToughAsNails/issues/274 Anyway now I get this crash. https://pastebin.com/3x1aXQ9V
Sure, will try it today.
`navBarHeight` is 144 (48dp). Thus the resource does exist.  The `hasSoftKeys` from the StackOverflow issue seems to works fine. But I might be a bit hacky to just measure the window imo. 
I'm talking about the text, not images.  Any UTF-8 character coded on 2 octets (like é) will be displayed as 2 separate characters. This is a quite common issue with UTF-8 and only happens when you assume you're receiving ISO-8859-\* text instead of detecting it.  Will post a screenshot ASAP 
Maybe it something in config I over looked. They were coming from spawner and not stacking   On Fri, Feb 1, 2019 at 4:01 PM antiPerson <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Works for me. can you provide reproduction steps? > > — > You are receiving this because you authored the thread. > Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub > <https://github.com/Nathat23/StackMob-3/issues/185#issuecomment-459866191>, > or mute the thread > <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AjQuoWtIMa1W_g5sFCM7rsfGMrih3uz7ks5vJKsbgaJpZM4aN3IP> > . > 
Great, that was a quick fix! Looking forward to the next release.  Cheers, Torsten

@Fr4gorSoftware: Installed branch **fix-shared-qrcode** and scanning via Share intent is still not working.  This is the version I tested on ``` commit 44c64af928ff3d819fd551f0a28be904a591ae22 (HEAD -> fix-shared-qrcode, origin/fix-shared-qrcode) Author: Thore <30445568+Fr4gorSoftware@users.noreply.github.com> Date:   Sun Jan 12 22:16:09 2020 +0100      fix shared qrcode ```  The toast now appears (as opposed to before): `File not found`.  Tested on several different images containing qr codes and failed on all. The image is a regular jpg image that can be successfully scanned by other scanners, including by secscanqr when using the camera, but sharing from the gallery app via intent is not working.  sample image: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48893368/73138500-883f2100-4063-11ea-8917-685290efef3f.jpg 
Well when u first touch the wool u get hte raindrop sound as expected but second time you shouldnt
RFTools Control apparently does. I'll test Pressure Pipes.  Edit: Pressure Pipes works BUT it doesn't save the values. Quality/Purity/Strength/Efficiency associated with resonating crystal liquid was deleted. High Pressure Pump > High Pressure Input > Pressure Pipes > High Pressure Output.  Can't connect pipes directly to the tank, but that's irrelevant here http://prntscr.com/dpif77
Yes, if it's for Dart I think get rid of it.  Any absolute positioning stuff will break with this flag running and the kind of people that need it will know how to add the arguments themselves. 
@psxlover Still nothing with redstone, and levers work fine on the same level as the engine. @SandGrainOne What would these configurations be? I've tried repeaters, but no luck. 
I will test web service as soon as i find bad signal area. Using OC with a stable and fast connection looks pretty good, so i'don't think it has anything to do with perfomance problems.  The point is: of course it can take a while to load the file list, but it shoud show the "loading" animation, or "pls wait" message, or "connection failed" message, instead of freezing and crashing. 
No, I just cannot select a folder but only a file.
Yes, but the server only start if i remove Botania. 
Turns out that declaring the fields as nullables is not enough, they have to have a mandatory default value (for nullable fields should be null). I'm attaching a small example. It has three endpoints:  localhost:8080/test-fail localhost:8080/test-work1 localhost:8080/test-work2  [kotlin-mongo-error.zip](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/files/4102911/kotlin-mongo-error.zip)
        mLottieView.setImageAssetDelegate(new ImageAssetDelegate() {             @Override             public Bitmap fetchBitmap(LottieImageAsset asset) {                 Bitmap bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(GiftUtil.getJsonFileDir(mCurrentZipName , mGiftType) + "/images/" + asset.getFileName(), options);                 if (bitmap == null) {                     LogUtils.e(TAG, "GiftType: "+mGiftType +"  FullScreenGiftView Lottie 加载json图片资源失败：" + asset.getFileName());                 }                 return bitmap;             }         });  I dynamically load the resource pictures in the way above. I suppose there are two JSON files A and B, they all need 3 pictures, when I first went to use this way to load A, asset.getFileName were img_0, img_1, img_2, but when the second time I use the same LottieView and reset the setImageAssetDelegate to load B, asset.getFileName return img_3, img_4 so, img_5, error loading, I think when I use the same Lottie (different JSON files) again when loading the B should return img_0, img_1, img_2.  thank,
Well what I was trying to get at is they cannot breed. Like neutered/spayed bunnies/rabbits irl.  Can you confirm this is a bug?
That's it because the random forest implementation swallows it.  The interesting thing is that the forest still appears to work correctly after that.

 Version of AE appliedenergistics2 stable-1-1.7.1，this is my  local server ,this  is the plugins named Residence-1.6.1-v2.6.6.6,my mcpc is cauldron-1.7.10-1.1231.01.207  @TheJulianJES 
Thanks for your quick response! I have moved padding to parent: ```xml <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <FrameLayout     xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"     android:layout_width="match_parent"     android:layout_height="wrap_content"     android:paddingStart="@dimen/spacing_medium"     android:paddingEnd="@dimen/spacing_medium"     android:paddingBottom="@dimen/spacing_medium">      <TextView         android:id="@+id/markdown_item_text"         android:layout_width="match_parent"         android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>  </FrameLayout> ```  However the issue remains the same.  Here's the markdown I used: ``` And the speech on ["1 year around the world on 1 bitcoin"](https://steempeak.com/steemfest/@remyhauxley/shout-out-to-the-sensational-steemians-i-met-at-steemfest3) by remyhauxley, who I had already met and befriended on Wednesday.  Interspaced with time spent making a certain baby laugh (she's the most adorable 5-month-old I've seen in my life, and my mom used to work with babies), the day flew by and before I knew, it was dinner time, I ate (apparently, I was one of the few who actually liked the mushroom soup) and returned to the apartment.  I promised myself to go to the Night of Steem after that. I promised myself I'd just take a short nap to fight my headache. But when I tried to stand up from the bed, the headache hit me in the face like a truck. [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin) had to go alone.  ### Saturday, 10/11  We chose to participate in the trip to Auschwitz. I didn't take any pictures there and I won't write much about it, as that feels like it's something touristic, not a reminder of what horrible things people are capable of.  It's something you must have experienced to fully grasp, the horror of what went down there.  [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin), [@fukako](https://steemit.com/@fukako), [@techslut](https://steemit.com/@techslut), [@mrlightning](https://steemit.com/@mrlightning), and me went out for pierogi in the evening, which ended the day on a better note than it had been most of the time.  ### Sunday, 11/11  Regretfully, our plane already left at noon, so we weren't able to attend the closing dinner. It would have been so much fun! But you can't have everything. We're both looking forward to the next Steemfest!  ---  ---  ---  My recap might seem a bit short, which is due to the fact that there was just TOO MUCH, and if I went into detail, I'd need to split this post into several parts. And you know what? I just don't have the patience for that.  I loved meeting everyone, I loved talking to people, hugging people, laughing with people. There are so many that I probably already forgot again, because I apparently spoke to more than 1/3 of all attendees. Which is a good bit over 100 people.  Below, you will find a short shoutout to everyone who appeared on my "scanned" list in the Steemfest app - which is by far not everyone I talked to, because I did not scan everyone.  If you are not in that list, but remember talking to me, you're more than welcome to say hi again. I'm just horrible with names.  ---  ---  ---  1. [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin) is the first on my list, which comes to no surprise, as we flew to Krakow together. Without him, I wouldn't be on Steem, wouldn't know all these great people, and would have never attended Steemfest. So, a big shout out to him! 2. [@louis88](https://steemit.com/@louis88) one of the Germans. We talked a lot, and he was one of the top 4 in the scanning competition for a long time, before he was overtaken. 3. [@reiseamateur](https://steemit.com/@reiseamateur) is another one of the Germans. So many Germans! I met him on Wednesday already. 4. [@sjennon](https://steemit.com/@sjennon) was part of the Steemfest crew, and dutifully passing out badges + goodie bags. She still took the time to scan + chat with me. 5. [@varunpinto](https://steemit.com/@varunpinto) Another one of the crew, and one of the first people to get a Utopian shirt. 6. [@things](https://steemit.com/@things) cheery personality and I kept seeing her around! 7. [@aishwarya](https://steemit.com/@aishwarya) have you seen her art? NO?! Go check it out! 8. [@wandereronwheels](https://steemit.com/@wandereronwheels) I can't tie a face to this name anymore ... please leave a comment so you can get an upvote as an apology ^^' 9. [@mrlightning](https://steemit.com/@mrlightning) What can I say ... if there had been an award for the greatest hugs, you would have won it. For the greatest person, you'd be tied with several people, but nobody can take those hugs from you. I will miss this. 10. [@firepower](https://steemit.com/@firepower) Mr. Organizer! It was awesome finally meeting you in person, even though you often seemed a bit anxious (especially on Saturday), to make sure things go right. But it worked out! 11. [@rivalzzz](https://steemit.com/@rivalzzz) My ultimate rival. All Thursday long, we battled for the 1st place, and I loved it. I hope you enjoyed our friendly competition just as much as I did. Looking forward to the next time, when I'll *destroy you*... :D 12. [@rOOsj3](https://steemit.com/@rOOsj3) I was so, so, SO looking forward to meeting you! And I did! Each day! And you're just as enjoyable in person as you are online. 13. [@teamsteem](https://steemit.com/@teamsteem) "Heeey suesa!" I heard, one of the first people to call me by my "name" was teamsteem. You recognized me immediately, I took a moment longer do decipher the name on the badge. People should really have tattooed those names on their foreheads! 14. [@elmerlin](https://steemit.com/@elmerlin) Another person I sadly can't place anymore, and your profile appears empty. Leave me a comment and let's reconnect! 15. [@roxane](https://steemit.com/@roxane) Congratulations on overtaking me in points, despite not even playing the scanning game. I hope you do something meaningful with your share of the money! :) 16. [@celestal](https://steemit.com/@celestal) "I know you!" Thanks for the dried fruit, thanks for the talks, thanks for being as awesome as in chat, you Finnish freak! <3 17. [@gregory.latinier](https://steemit.com/@gregory.latinier) I knew you of course already, as we're both with Utopian, there was no way around that. But meeting you in person was great, once we got past the "Hug? That French cheek kiss thing? *Handshake?!*" problem. That orange T-shirt really suited you! 18. [@lichtcatchtoby](https://steemit.com/@lichtcatchtoby) my favorite Austrian (sorry everyone else)! I didn't expect to see you so shortly after staying at your place, but our fates seem intertwined. Something like that. Now that I've written it, it sounds a bit over the top, but who cares. Who actually reads this anyway? (You I hope) 19. [@espoem](https://steemit.com/@espoem) had an even greater assortment of pins than I did. Thank you for sharing them, thank you for the positive atmosphere that surrounded you, every time we encountered each other. 20. [@sorin.cristescu](https://steemit.com/@sorin.cristescu) You too are one of the people I've known on Steem for a pretty long time, so seeing each other was super cool. 21. [@jaki01](https://steemit.com/@jaki01) One more familiar name, of the German-speaking variety. Awesome meeting you, dude! 22. [@kobold-djawa](https://steemit.com/@kobold-djawa) You were one of the people who had their kid with them, right? Absolute cutie. 23. [@techslut](https://steemit.com/@techslut) I have no words for this pink lady, except for maybe "I love you to bits" <3 24. [@howo](https://steemit.com/@howo) *punches you softly in the shoulder* 25. [@fredrikaa](https://steemit.com/@fredrikaa) I am surprised that I didn't see you asleep at any of the presentations :P Good job on the steempress speech ([@howo](https://steemit.com/@howo) too, ofc). 26. [@redrica](https://steemit.com/@redrica) Funny having you after fredrikaa, because [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin) always struggled to keep the names of you two apart, when someone said them. Also, you're an absolute sweetheart. 27. [@steevc](https://steemit.com/@steevc) I think I signed your ukulele. We also ran into each other like, all the time. 28. [@fukako](https://steemit.com/@fukako) You stalker. You know too much. Love you anyway. 29. [@danea](https://steemit.com/@danea) I hope you even see this, as I don't know if you're even active with this account. Then again, you might be reading from the other one. I just wanted to say "thank you" again, for always supporting and loving my stories. I looked so forward to chatting with you in person, and it was just as great as I expected. 30. [@neopch](https://steemit.com/@neopch) I love that piercing, and the fact that you're super energetic. And I think you're with ddaily? Never heard of that before Steemfest, I must admit. But cool stuff. 31. [@buttcoins](https://steemit.com/@buttcoins) I always loved that nickname. I loved your performance on Friday even more. Please always stay like this! 32. [@camuel](https://steemit.com/@camuel) Checking your blog, I certainly remember your face, but not what we talked about, which is a shame. Usually, it's the other way around. I am still happy we met! 33. [@jeffjagoe](https://steemit.com/@jeffjagoe) Something something food related ... we apparently didn't talk long enough. 34. [@escapist](https://steemit.com/@escapist) One of my favorite Finnish women, and I was SO happy to see her/you again! Can't wait for the next time! 35. [@eveuncovered](https://steemit.com/@eveuncovered) basically the same as for [@escapist](https://steemit.com/@escapist), plus the fact that I *love* the business card I got from you ;) 36. [@asgarth](https://steemit.com/@asgarth) The name alone is epic. I remember that we met in a group setting with... 37. [@kevinli](https://steemit.com/@kevinli) (who also had a great performance on Friday) ... 38. [@daniel.errey](https://steemit.com/@daniel.errey) ... 39. ... and [@teodora](https://steemit.com/@teodora) ! I liked just hanging out with you people for a while, sitting outside, giving you some of my pins. You supporting me against [@rivalzzz](https://steemit.com/@rivalzzz). Good times. 40. [@sndbox](https://steemit.com/@sndbox) There were actually two people with that name tag, and I forgot both faces. Nevertheless, we stood around a bit and talked, which was awesome. You're awesome. Your project is awesome. Keep doing that. 41. [@kevinwong](https://steemit.com/@kevinwong) was standing there too while I was chatting with the [@sndbox](https://steemit.com/@sndbox) guys, although that was neither the first nor the last time I saw him walking around. But we didn't really talk much after that. 42. [@ethwarrior](https://steemit.com/@ethwarrior) I think you told me you're not signed up on Steem yet ... or I might just think so because your profile doesn't exist. I will be waiting for your arrival on the blockchain. 43. [@remyhauxley](https://steemit.com/@remyhauxley) First we talked about Terry Pratchett, then about touring the world (in your case) and Europe (in my case), while leeching off  visiting crypto enthusiasts and friends. Your "One Year on One Bitcoin" story was intriguing, and not just that: You're super cool to be around. I think I spent a significantly longer time talking to you than to most people. Also, your beard is awesome. 44. [@tarazkp](https://steemit.com/@tarazkp) "We talk sometimes." "Oh, do we?" Thanks for making meeting you for the first time slightly awkward. Still glad to have finally met :P 45. [@meno](https://steemit.com/@meno) I walked past you so many times before I finally got around to chat you up. And it was a good decision to finally do it. 46. [@yidneth](https://steemit.com/@yidneth) I am so, so sorry for not being able to come to the Night of Steem to hear you sing! I've heard recordings (thanks, [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin)) and you were so great! And I loved your outfits (yes, all of them)! And your personality, and you! You're so freaking talented, keep that up. It's a true gift to the world. 47. [@hedac](https://steemit.com/@hedac) You were mostly with yidneth, but I think us two didn't talk much. We should have! 48. [@surfermarly](https://steemit.com/@surfermarly) Chill, lovable, and always looking good. Please teach me? 49. [@theaustrianguy](https://steemit.com/@theaustrianguy) You know what? Both, on Wednesday, and then again after deleting my whole list of "scanned" people, I had someone ask you if I met you (today). Both times, I said no. Both times, I shortly after realized that I scanned you that day. What's up with that? Admit it, you somehow tampered with my brain to make me forget your face the moment you leave. 50. [@guchtere](https://steemit.com/@guchtere) You were another one of the people constantly crossing my path. I don't complain about that, because being around you was always nice. 51. [@jeanpi1908](https://steemit.com/@jeanpi1908) So, I've been told people have been confusing you and [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin)? I don't get that. You two are pretty different. You're still a neat person tho. 52. [@goodwithtravels](https://steemit.com/@goodwithtravels) You're (*ba-dum-tss*) good with travels! Jokes aside, I usually saw you around other travel-oriented people. Which is not that surprising I guess. 53. [@for91days](https://steemit.com/@for91days) "Your name seems familiar ..." "Yea, I'm suesa on Sola too. We met there." I never thought I'd meet people I interacted with on Sola. But here we go. And you even speak German. Although that part shouldn't surprise me, because ffs, there were so many German-speakers at Steemfest. 54. [@yrtphoto](https://steemit.com/@yrtphoto) The chocolate. THE CHOCOLATE! Oh people, have you tasted HIS CHOCOLATE?! NO?! Oh, your loss. He was passing it out at Steemfest. And it was sooo goooood. 55. [@jaybird](https://steemit.com/@jaybird) I am sorry I missed your performance on Friday, but *you* failed to make an appearance in my dream, as you promised! How rude! 56. [@dan-atstarlite](https://steemit.com/@dan-atstarlite) Always running around with jaybird, and a musician too. Actually, the first time I ran into you guys was at the airport, where we were joking about the guy who taped a baseball bat to his suitcase. Who does that? And why? 57. [@abh12345](https://steemit.com/@abh12345) You have like, the laziest name ever. But I already knew that because I already knew you. Glad to finally put a face to that na....wait your profile picture is your face. That was anti-climatic. 58. [@shanibeer](https://steemit.com/@shanibeer) Unable to put a face to this name again ... damn it. Leave me a comment please to reconnect! 59. [@amalinavia](https://steemit.com/@amalinavia) You shyly showed me your sketchbook and I was in love! I had to show my friend immediately! You also hosted a drawing workshop which I would have attended, had I realized you were leading it. Don't apologize for your English, you are wonderful and talented. 60. [@honeydue](https://steemit.com/@honeydue) We ran into each other on Wednesday and never stopped, every encounter was a delight. Although I somehow always got a craving for melons ... 61. [@coruscate](https://steemit.com/@coruscate) I just realized I met you twice, once during the official Steemfest activities, and once when you were trying to organize the karaoke. Sorry for being grumpy about the overfilled pub, I was tired and German. 62. [@cryptogee](https://steemit.com/@cryptogee) You're so *freaking tall* O.o Sorry, that was one of the first things I noticed about you, and I somehow didn't expect that. Your voice is amazing to listen to (I hope that doesn't sound too creepy). Talking to you about science and all that other stuff was super cool. 63. [@cryptoctopus](https://steemit.com/@cryptoctopus) I wish I could say something meaningful about you, but your daughter stole the show. She's the most adorable baby and my best friend now. You gotta live with that. 64. [@kryptokessler](https://steemit.com/@kryptokessler) It's so German of you to not want to talk about business, and then proceed to invite me to a conference ;) I'll see if I can attend. 65. [@apshamilton](https://steemit.com/@apshamilton) You're super cool, the whole suing facebook&Co. for banning crypto ads? I didn't even hear about that before I met you. 66. [@datristan](https://steemit.com/@datristan) We met briefly at the end of dinner, together with ... 67. [@future24](https://steemit.com/@future24) ... 68. ... and [@lex030](https://steemit.com/@lex030) . We sadly didn't chat much, as I was trying to find 69. [@mammasitta](https://steemit.com/@mammasitta) ! Who climbed up the leaderboard of the scanning game out of nowhere, and didn't even realize. Loved meeting and hugging you. 70. [@soyrosa](https://steemit.com/@soyrosa) She's NOT Spanish, even though I assumed that the first time I read her name. You gotta show me a picture of that fancy finger jewelry! 71. [@jasch](https://steemit.com/@jasch) Another faceless name, and almost empty account. I'm looking forward to a comment, so we can connect! 72. [@detlev](https://steemit.com/@detlev) I kept hearing your name from [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin), and at Steemfest, I could finally meet you! Another German ... what a surprise. 73. [@twinner](https://steemit.com/@twinner) We didn't talk that much, but you gracefully allowed me to scan you anyway. But most importantly, you gave me a PEN. An AWESOME pen! 74. [@adetorrent](https://steemit.com/@adetorrent) Our first encounter was awkward ... for *you*. Which amused me greatly, and I was happy to see you each time after that, although I am not sure how much you actually remember. You told me on Friday, that you were running on 3 hours of sleep (it was 9 am). That is not healthy. Absolutely not. 75. [@guyfawkes4-20](https://steemit.com/@guyfawkes4-20) You're lying about your age, admit it! You're also pretty amusing when drunk. 76. [@vcelier](https://steemit.com/@vcelier) "Story of my life" taken a bit more literally. I think it's super epic that you're blogging your memoirs on Steem! 77. [@yann0975](https://steemit.com/@yann0975) Is the one who told me everything I wanted to know about [@cleanplanet](https://steemit.com/@cleanplanet) , which made me decide to delegate 500 SP to the project. Check it out yourself! 78. [@traveller7761](https://steemit.com/@traveller7761) What's better in the morning than chatting up unknown people (in German) and them bringing them to someone else to network? After a brief chat&scan, I introduced traveller7761 to yann0975, as I felt their interests aligned. I hope they got along :) 79. [@captainbob](https://steemit.com/@captainbob) Checking your blog, I recognize your face, but don't remember our conversation ... Shame on me. 80. [@jongolson](https://steemit.com/@jongolson) SteemSavvy! I still have your business card! Had to come back to talk to you, because our conversation was interrupted by the opening presentation for the day. So rude of roeland. 81. [@bimjer](https://steemit.com/@bimjer) Following the time line of the day, I guess I met you when I was talking to captainbob and jongolson. I shouldn't have talked to groups that much, it obviously made me forget too much about the people. 82. [@sekhmet](https://steemit.com/@sekhmet) Always busy, busy, busy .... just as... 83. ...[@jm90mm](https://steemit.com/@jm90mm) ! I am still a bit sad that I didn't get a busy.org T-Shirt. 84. [@slobberchops](https://steemit.com/@slobberchops) *How much* did you spend on "Magic the Gathering" cards again? I wonder of anyone has invested that much into SteemMonsters yet! 85. [@gmuxx](https://steemit.com/@gmuxx) and 86. [@rhondak](https://steemit.com/@rhondak), you two are just so great! I've known you for a while, although we never talked *that* much. But I'm looking forward to how your project will evolve, and I want to be *involved* in it! 87. [@arcange](https://steemit.com/@arcange) Thanks for the app, even though it didn't always work as it should have (you should have been my 87th point when in reality, you were somewhere in my 60s). I never spent much thought on what the person behind steemitboard might be like, but even then I probably wouldn't have guessed right. I like how chill and at the same time excited you are and am glad we met. 88. [@fervi](https://steemit.com/@fervi) If I remember correctly, you didn't scan people at first, but then we met again during the "One Year on One Bitcoin" presentation. Correct me if I'm wrong! 89. [@polygnom](https://steemit.com/@polygnom) , your hair is awesome. Nothing more to say. (Ok, the pins in your backpack are cool too. And your business cards. I mean... UNICORNS?!) 90. [@chickencaam](https://steemit.com/@chickencaam) Another group situation, if I remember correctly. Fleeting moments and faces, passing by ... 91. [@marco](https://steemit.com/@marco) An empty profile ... and I can't remember your face. Please reconnect! 92. [@gillianpearce](https://steemit.com/@gillianpearce) Although I hadn't heard of you or seen your name before Steemfest, I am glad we met. Our short chat was super nice :) 93. [@rea](https://steemit.com/@rea) I remember thinking "woah, her name is super short, she must have been on Steem for a pretty long time!" We talked a while, and then you introduced me to 94. [@ezzy](https://steemit.com/@ezzy) , because he's a writer too. Talking to you both at the back of the corridor, where the noise wasn't as harsh as further inside, I had a good time. 95. [@felix.herrmann](https://steemit.com/@felix.herrmann) Aaaaand another German-speaking attendee. Will it ever stop? Probably not. Poor Poland. 96. [@steemmatt](https://steemit.com/@steemmatt) Go on, call me out on my inability to recall your face. 97. [@bugavi](https://steemit.com/@bugavi) and her mom 98. [@olga.maslievich](https://steemit.com/@olga.maslievich) were an absolute pleasure to meet. They took pictures of me and [@reggaemuffin](https://steemit.com/@reggaemuffin) (I guess they loved his hair, almost everyone did) the first time we really talked. You two were always cheerful, and talking to everyone. I am glad you attended this Steemfest, and would be happy to see you on the next! 99. [@peixeboi](https://steemit.com/@peixeboi) We only chatted very briefly, I sadly can't recall what we talked about. 100. [@yabapmatt](https://steemit.com/@yabapmatt) Hmmmmmm who was that guy again.... I he's involved in ... a card game? What a nerd. Also my number 100 and a super cool person! :D 101. [@artakush](https://steemit.com/@artakush) Never have I seen anyone die so gracefully because of bean soup. 102. [@greencross](https://steemit.com/@greencross) We didn't talk in detail, damn group situations. But we met! And we said hi! 103. [@jestemkioskem](https://steemit.com/@jestemkioskem) Utopians unite! Italy, Poland, doesn't matter. 104. [@vikonomics](https://steemit.com/@vikonomics) I think you need to explain @1Ramp to me again. 105. [@joythewanderer](https://steemit.com/@joythewanderer) You're super cute, do you know that? 106. [@stoodkev](https://steemit.com/@stoodkev) I am writing the draft for this post on steempeak. And while doing that, I am enjoying using "ctrl+backspace" several times. Thanks for this application, really. Also, thanks for your business card. It's pretty. 107. [@aggroed](https://steemit.com/@aggroed) I'm sorry I almost knocked over your laptop, it will not happen again ^^' 108. [@race-redmedia](https://steemit.com/@race-redmedia) At first, I didn't know who I was talking to. Some random couple, sharing a username? Hm. Then I learned that the female half was [@michelle.gent](https://steemit.com/@michelle.gent)! We had some topics to bond over ;) 109. [@fundition](https://steemit.com/@fundition) Cool project, keep that up. 110. [@crimsonclad](https://steemit.com/@crimsonclad) I love you? You're super cool in person too? And thank you for reassuring me that I don't necessarily want to have kids in 10 years ... 111. [@roelandp](https://steemit.com/@roelandp) Some weird guy walking around in a fire suit. Somehow seemed important. Idk. He tried to steal SBD from me by making me scan a QR code. (Thanks for organizing Steemfest!) 112. [@aaronleang](https://steemit.com/@aaronleang), ... 113. ... [@joannewong](https://steemit.com/@joannewong), ... 114. ... and [@elizacheng](https://steemit.com/@elizacheng) were the three ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL HUMAN BEINGS from #TeamMalaysia, who gave me one of their pins and a space to relax in. You three are awesome and I'm incredibly happy to have bonded with you! 115. [@ersanduran](https://steemit.com/@ersanduran) Sorry for not remembering you :( 116. [@birdinc](https://steemit.com/@birdinc) I was amused each time I met someone I didn't know, who then turned out to be with some important project. With you, it was Steemit Inc., oops. Now I know! :D I enjoyed our chat. 117. [@gandalf](https://steemit.com/@gandalf) He's the one who convinced me to come to Steemfest. You were right, it was so worth it. And seeing you again was one of the best things! ^__^ Will see you again when I come back to visit the salt mines. 118. [@ultranihilist](https://steemit.com/@ultranihilist) "A Russian and a German meet in Poland ..." Looking forward to trying out your project! 119. [@nastyaromanova](https://steemit.com/@nastyaromanova) I think you were there when I talked to ultranihilist, correct me if I'm wrong. You're cool, I like you. 120. [@sambillingham](https://steemit.com/@sambillingham) We scanned more than once, but it never really worked ... but it gave us several chances to talk! And together, we found water. 121. [@rmt](https://steemit.com/@rmt) Don't be embarrassed by your dad, he's cool. You're cool too! 122. [@velimir](https://steemit.com/@velimir) We couldn't meet in Zagreb, so we met in Poland instead. And it was absolutely worth it, I am looking forward to the next time we encounter each other! 123. [@karinxxl](https://steemit.com/@karinxxl) We met right before dinner on Friday, and if I remember correctly, you had arrived not too long ago. But we still met! Which is cool. 124. [@el-cr](https://steemit.com/@el-cr) I think we had a "Hold my beer" moment. I held your beer. You poured another one. 125. [@nanzo-scoop](https://steemit.com/@nanzo-scoop) You were sitting next to me during the dinner on Friday, and we talked and talked and talked! It helped me ignore my headache a little bit better. Thank you for the wonderful evening! 126. [@revisesociology](https://steemit.com/@revisesociology) We caught each other early Saturday morning, on our way to the buses to Auschwitz, and then lost each other again ... would have liked to talk some more! 127. [@curlysue](https://steemit.com/@curlysue) "My username actually comes from 'Susan'" "Oh really? My name *is* Susan!" When one Sue meets the other :D I love your hair. 128. [@therealwolf](https://steemit.com/@therealwolf) How come I scanned you that late? We ran into each other before we even reached Qubus hotel! 129. [@jayna](https://steemit.com/@jayna) and 130. [@jarvie](https://steemit.com/@jarvie) let me scan them on Saturday evening, and they were the last new people I scanned. I was already too tired to hold a proper conversation, but I still remember your faces.  There were a bunch of people I didn't scan, but still talked to ([@anomadsoul](https://steemit.com/@anomadsoul) for example, or [@blewitt](https://steemit.com/@blewitt) who was the only person who gave me an accetable amount of hugs), but my brain is as leaky as a rusty bucket, so I can't really come up with the list anymore. But you can be sure that if we talked, I was happy about it.  So long  ~Suesa ```  Let me know if you could reproduce it on your side!
I want to say yes. @amysueg @catrobson - can you please verify? 
Yes, roughly. However this issue while related I think more focuses on the lack of support for Android App Bundle in either Fresco or SoLoader and splitting binaries that way.  I could be mistaken, but this issue is reproducible on every device I've tested, not just select brands.  And as per Fresco shipping guides, there is no note of the use case of shipping via Android App Bundles, and we can't use the `splits` key as when you use `bundle` the `splits` key is ignored.

Hello, thanks for the quick reply! Okay here's one example:  http://www.sciplore.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/lipinski13.pdf Reference [4] contains the name  Müller, C.  It is parsed as                              <author>                                 <persName                                     xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" coords="">                                     <forename type="first">C</forename>                                     <surname>MÃ¼ller</surname>                                 </persName>                             </author>
I agree with  the label ;-)  To me, there is a huge difference between the terms "task" and "activity", and as someone who has been using some sort of task-management software for a dogs age, but I haven't (successfully) used time-tracking app. For me, every time the interface says Task, I have to remind myself that in this case, that means Activities, I'm hoping to track both tasks (with taskwarrior) and activities (with ATT) and so I file this issue.  A task is a single thing to be done, and a group of related tasks called is a "project". One couldn't call a single task or a project an "activity", because each one is unique, and when it's done, it's done.   ATT just.. isn't "task management" software, and that's ok!  An activity is a generalized description of how you use of your time. It can be defined as specifically or as broadly as one likes, and any number of tasks and/or projects could be performed in given "activities", but some activities are completely unrelated to any task or project, and yet you could still use ATT to track those too..  Of course I realize how disruptive this suggestion would be, Interface changes, docs revisions and shaking right down to the original codebase, but I'm guessing it's not impossible. It's maybe kind of like ripping off a band-aid, it might be painful, but until you do it, it will continue to be wrong :)   Tell you what, I'll help with docs, and if you decide not to make the change, I won't tease you about it!
@marcingrzejszczak   Sorry for late reply! for example.  we have two services, which are A and B.  so if we send one request from A to B. should we just set peer.service with B and set SERVER_ADDR with address where B is deployed?  > if (span.tags().containsKey(Span.SPAN_PEER_SERVICE_TAG_NAME)) {         zipkinSpan.addBinaryAnnotation(BinaryAnnotation.address(Constants.SERVER_ADDR,           localEndpoint.toBuilder().serviceName(         span.tags().get(Span.SPAN_PEER_SERVICE_TAG_NAME)).build())); }  well, as the code show. we just set the SERVER_ADDR with localEndpoint which should be incorrect.  I hope I made myself clear. Sorry for late reply again!    
I agree that would be best to match transit. Transit has an index with the time departure and after that says the line and more things in the map view, but in the itineraries fragment it just says "1. takes 5 min".  So, we can add the index and always say "1. 3400m - 5 min" instead of  "1. Ride 751m takes 2 min", in the map view, to have information about the distance. I think that is good to avoid the use of Ride or Walk here to have the same output for all the bike routes even if they start with a little leg of walking, also matches better the idea of the transit part. In the itineraries fragment we can just say "1. takes 4 min" if it is OK, as it is in transit, being this way more verbose in this part than in the map view.  I have tested Netherlands server and it happens the same failure with `itinerary` fields, so I will report the bug.  2014-01-29 Sean Barbeau notifications@github.com  > @vreixo https://github.com/vreixo Thanks for looking into this!

@divs4debu Thanks for your input. I have solved the bug and initiated a PR for the same. You are also welcome to review it. :)   Now, we use only one field `id` in Session class and table which matches the incoming Session IDs in JSON. The unique constraint in maintained. I have removed the ServerSessionIDMapping class and table because it was making things a bit complex and redundant.  @the-dagger @mananwason Please review.  
I have made a minimal project to reproduce the problem here: https://github.com/gsurrel-orange/boot-liquibase-dev-tools. On the first launch everything works fine but when the app is restarted by the dev tool module, there is a problem re-running the import script. 
Ah sorry I somehow read the stacktrace as reading the javadoc, yeah its a general error.  Its using XMLBeans 2.6.0  ``` [INFO] +- org.apache.xmlbeans:xmlbeans:jar:2.6.0:compile ```  which is from August 2012.  You can reproduce the issue by compiling the Apache Camel source code. And then turn on Spring APT in that module (we turned it off to make it compile). https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-xmlbeans/pom.xml#L74  You can do a quick build using  ``` mvn install -Pfastinstall ```  You do not need to build all the modules, but you can let it build first, and then after a while after it has built camel-spring and some other modules, you can break it, and then go into the   ```  cd components/camel-xmlbeans ```  And then change the pom.xml and remove those test scoped for Spring JARs to turn on APT again, and then do a   ``` mvn clean install ```  Or   ``` mvn compile ```  To build and see if it causes this error.  Or maybe you can just grab any standard Spring Boot example and add that xmlbeans 2.6.0 JAR as dependency, and then the xmlbeans-maven-plugin ? 
I'm on a roll for idiocy today.  Yes, I mean the rolling machine.  No I have no idea why I said Assembler.
Strange, that link is working for me. Try it again?  In the app, open Home GDG and then open the For Leads tab and select GDG Resources. 
Sorry guys, here the testCase.

is this issue still relevant? 
Not possible, only that "extended standby" option is available.  I always have a few 'essential' apps running on background and they never stop doing their job with the screen off, but Chibe seems to stop working after screen off/lock, when I turn the screen on it starts working again. Similar 'alarm clock' apps always work...  e.g. Set Chibe hourly (i.e. next should be 5 PM) then alarm app to 5:05PM, Chibe fails, alarm app works.  Maybe you missed something to wake up the device?  Anyway, I gonna retest this tomorrow, well today, later!
I managed to get the same log by hitting ctrl+c but it didn't cause the main issue. Later, I managed to have the issue happen without hitting ctrl+c. So the issue is not caused by the ctrl+c.

@riccardo-forina I've built via `syndesis build` let me double check
Yes, the installation on my server runs fine since months. I am using OC 5.0.7 and the app is 1.4. I get messages like this in the apache log while verifying the URL: GET /owncloud/status.php HTTP/1.1" 200 77 PROPFIND /owncloud/remote.php/webdav HTTP/1.1" 401 291 
there is only " the application consulo could not be opened".  I've reinstall os and it worked till i closed the app. when i want to open it the second, situation reapeats. 
This is alpha1, I didn't notice alpha2 yet.  Update: a2 has the same issue, updating title 
Hey I'm really sorry I completely forgot about this. Here a video of the bug. https://nextcloud.abifog.com/index.php/s/xokGzy6x4w4RB4F  BTW, I think this can be fixed by explicitly disabling split screen support for GOYP like the uber app. When its launched in split screen, it overrules all other apps and maximizes. Something similar should happen when GOYP is triggered by launching a selected app in split screen. 
The crawl was already begun.
Sure.  The screenshot highlights the 3 configurations I mentioned.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3874799/35154321-d47158b0-fcf7-11e7-812c-cb15a901ed1a.png)

No this was with a stationary NPC. 
@ZacBlanco  - I'm running alluxio in master/worker mode in AWS EMR , started alluxio master in emr master node and worker in EMR core node.  'Return to Master' from worker webui its not working, looks like it's trying to open alluxio master webui with worker node hostname
I unfortunately only turned logs on after that happened.
could we add a second criteria in the sortby order ?  
I emailed the link to both @ojw28 and then the dev.exoplayer@gmail.com address. The issue should be reproducible with that link. 
This bug was reported by Michele from Density Design. I've asked him for an example file. 
Database creation script below the scenario.  Scenario: 1. Type query: "select \* from a", execute it. 2. Type query: -- select \* from a  select \* from b where 3. Press ctrl+space. 4.

Yes I'm pretty sure - I've also reproduced the issue locally. My test case consists of 3 threads:  Thread #1 - connects 1000 users to a channel "/users/user-" + id (simulate load) Thread #2 - connects a single user and disconnects him every 100ms (simulate locking when adding/removing resource) Thread #3 - sends a group message to group "/users/" every 1 second  Testing this with 1.0.6 - reaches 4000 threads Testing this with 1.0.13 - after 10 minutes run, already around 9000 threads and keeps climbing.  The only change I did when I upgraded to the new version - changed the messages.offer to dispatchMessages 
Proposal:   **Code style** We can use default style of Android Studio with following tweaks:  - Maximum consecutive blank lines: 1 - Blank lines before closing brace '}': 0  *Note*: Default Android Studio style uses spaces for indentation instead of tabs. Let me know if you prefer tabs.  **License** - For files which don't have **any** license/copyright header, add GPLv3 header with your name. - For files which **only** have your name, add GPLv3 header too. - We can also add GPLv3 header to XML files if thats okay with you.  Remaining files are attributed to Michael A. MacDonald. I believe these are under GPLv2 license but I could not find a definitive answer. If these files are licensed under GPLv2, we can add GPLv2 or GPLv3 (whichever you prefer) header.  **Refactoring** I am refactoring `VNCConn` to remove dependency on `VncCanvas`. It will allow us to keep `VNCConn` alive across activity restarts so that we can enable rotation of `VncCanvasActivity`.  Thanks. 
When on a terrasteel helm https://i.imgur.com/hwgPU6y.png https://i.imgur.com/iQNshdE.png  A fluxed helmet with the same enchant clocked at 562-660 us/t  Without the enchant, the player clocked at about 38 us/t, depending on what else was equipped. The largest spike was definitely the night vision enchantment.

The timed one, I also tried an on damage event which worked fine.
I will clarify this in the tutorial.   @jz10 I think it makes sense to report that evidence declarations have to be nested within a block.
The error is `Unexpected IO error.: Input is a directory: /var/lib/buildkite-agent/.cache/bazel/_bazel_buildkite-agent/02e53aad341ca65ced1335c03162fe6d/execroot/io_bazel/external/androidndk/ndk/build`  We unfortunately can't disable remote caching just for one test, but we can completely disable remote caching until it's fixed? @philwo ?
I just tried with a second account on the same server and couldn't reproduce it there. Thought it may have been an IMAP issue when fetching individual mime parts. But it still occurs in my first account. Do you have an idea what else I can check? Messages < 32kb are automatically fetched in both accounts. 
@davsclaus is there any place to get SMX 4.6 ?

Verified. 
My mistake; I've corrected the bug report. 
Im currently using Bukkit 1.8.8.  
I attach a gif with the problem:   
I don't have stable version of Android-Studio, but it's Beta 6 already, so should work fine. All I did is Git-clone the repo, and open it on the IDE. All gradle settings weren't changed from their default ones.   The error occurred when updating the project to lates Gradle version.  However, after trying to import it again, without updating the gradle version, and it got a different issue:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5357526/31053027-5761ea1c-a69c-11e7-8f88-ec7b5b0f4f04.png)  Then I chose to sync project again, and now it works fine...  However, I tried the "comparison" sample, and out of all items there, when I tried "fresco" (with "network", as I did for all), it took more and more memory, till the app crashed silently. Is it intended to be this way? Almost all others just got the memory have a random number, but none really crashed.   I also noticed that sometimes when I try to build a sample I get a warning/error : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5357526/31053493-2a91d4f6-a6a7-11e7-9a19-8eb07fdfaaaf.png) Sometimes it warns something about architecture. However, when I choose to run, it runs fine...  
Nope. Here's a recording:  ![shiny-deploy 2018-12-05 11_30_22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86978/49532015-3ba5ee80-f881-11e8-8112-ed4850a6c9e3.gif)  This seems to happen only for the first deployment of the app. If I redeploy, then everything happens quickly.

Hi Serge,  I found this issue at work. On next Monday I'll give you detailed information about this issue.  If my memory does not fail, I found the bug when trying to autocomplete column names in the query _right after_ the with statement.

Yo've right. That asserts are ok   ``` assertEquals(TEST_CONTEXT, config.getStringValue("conf.context")); assertEquals(TEST_CFG_FILE, config.getStringValue("conf.properties")); ```  But... This test case checks only that system properties for filename, and context are set up correctly. There is a problem with creating Parser instance  ``` setProperties(new Parser(FILE_PATH, CONTEXT).getConfiguration()); ```  FILE_PATH is final, and it couldn't be overwritten, so you always create Parser with default values.

```  "songs": {    "methods": {     "getSong": {      "httpMethod": "POST",      "id": "myApi.songs.getSong",      "path": "songs",      "request": {       "$ref": "GetSongRequest",       "parameterName": "resource"      },      "response": {       "$ref": "GetSongResponse"      },      "scopes": [       "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"      ]     },     "putSong": {      "httpMethod": "PUT",      "id": "myApi.songs.putSong",      "path": "songs",      "request": {       "$ref": "PutSongRequest",       "parameterName": "resource"      },      "response": {       "$ref": "PutSongResponse"      },      "scopes": [       "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"      ]     },     "removeSong": {      "httpMethod": "DELETE",      "id": "myApi.songs.removeSong",      "parameterOrder": [       "songId",       "removeDate"      ],      "parameters": {       "songId": {        "location": "path",        "required": true,        "type": "string"       },       "removeDate": {        "format": "date-time",        "location": "path",        "required": true,        "type": "string"       }      },      "path": "songs",      "response": {       "$ref": "RemoveSongResponse"      },      "scopes": [       "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"      ]     }    }   }  }, ```
Just two remarks: - I used to work with LibreOffice and older JabRef versions without any problems (on Linux - automatic connection worked always, on Windows I usually needed to connect manually) - so at least in the past it was not a matter of LO. - LO and JabRef are on 64 bit 
Yes, it does.

Yes I did. I use it with ionic 3.
Unfortunately no, I cannot.  After spending some time with `org.jaxen.test.ArithmeticTest` and digging the docs (JLS, Java API Doc for `Double#compareTo(Double)` and IEEE 754), there are only two cases to consider: 1. `0 >= -0` (or `-0 >= 0` respectively) 2. `NaN >= x` where `x` is any Number  *NaN* is handled correctly by `org.jaxen.expr.DefaultRelationalExpr`. What's left is the comparison of zero and negative zero. But this is also determined correctly since the relation says *greater than or equal* and this is the only difference between `Double#compareTo(Double)` (treats 0 greater than -0) and Java comparison for the primitive type double (treats 0 equal to -0).  Long story short, it seems that my suspicion was purely based on the 'partially consistent' implementation (`DefaultGreaterThanEqualExpr` is the only class that uses `Double#compareTo(Double); all others fall back to Java comparison for double primitive values).  Hence, you might close this issue as there none. Of course, in case you want to re-align the implementation of `DefaultGreaterThanEqualExpr` to have a fully consistent implementation for comparing numbers - just in case anyone else stumbles across this - I won't object.  Thanks, H
Hi   Thx for the quick replies! I already applied this trick as a workaround (stripping the double quotes and any whitespaces within before passing the header on to SubscriptionStateParser). Therefore I registered my own version of StringMsgParser, which works pretty well.  Unfortunately we are not producing this subscription message on our own and I can not influence the messages sent by the remote party (in this a case a 3rd party integration). I was also surprised by the text param :-) Unfortunately we need to verify against this param value somehow.    FYI: My company is Frequentis AG Austria We are currently using it for an in-house integration testing software where we have to integrate with several SIP / RTP interfaces.  Thx for your support. 
Hello there,   I am using version 0.8.1. I will place here the reproducer by the end of the day.  Regards, 
No bouncer. Yep only one message when I open the chat. It seems to always happen and I think they all come through immediately but I'm not positive.
No added benefit whatsoever! `@AutoConfigureBefore(TraceAutoConfiguration.class)` in `SamplerAutoConfiguration` will be the perfect solution to our problem; then I can remove the custom sampler beans from [StackdriverTraceAutoConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/blob/72d746486fedd19b16ead3cdbbcfb48c3e90c3a9/spring-cloud-gcp-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gcp/autoconfigure/trace/StackdriverTraceAutoConfiguration.java#L80) for good.
Hi Gerd,  Yeah, I don't have `[ALERT_TRIGGERED_CONDITION]` configured in the template.

My mistake! I set colorSurface to a very light color which caused the issue... Thanks anyways!
The destop client is working fine. Webdav is working fine too. 
I think the design of `addHttpHeader` is pretty good because I don't have to implement a `WebViewClient` callback to add custom headers.  My point is: I used it at first, but it seem not to work so I went the custom `WebViewClient` way.  Calling `addHttpHeader` is pretty more convenient but it seem not to be working.

The reason being che server is pinging ws-agent on http://172.31.9.201:33382/api/, which is the wrong IP address of ws-agent it should have ideally performed a ping on http://13.X.X.116:33382/api/  On further debugging the issue, I found that the URL's for launching agents are generated using getServers() function under the MachineRuntimeInfo interface.  The MachineRuntimeInfo Servers Map is built on calling MachineRuntimeInfoImpl.doGetRuntime()  In here, dockerMachineFactory.createMetadata(docker.inspectContainer(container),                                                                                   getConfig(),                                                                                   node.getHost())  node.getHost() - 13.X.X.116 is the value passed into this function  However, on completion on createMetadata the getServers() function is contains the internal IP address of Che Server i.e. 172.31.9.201 for all the agents instead of 13.X.X.116 the external IP address of the Workspace, which is passed in node.getHost()  
I would prefer the email, but that should also work. You should be able to see some red stuff, click on it to expand it and take a screenshot of that.

Unfortunately it didn't work, the same thing is still happening, exactly how it was before. I also tested with my other mods, and repeated this when it just MatterOverdrive and CLib, the mods aren't conflicting.
Hi, thanks for this hint. The validator gave the same error. It turns out that the endpoint itself accepts the SPARQL query as I posted it in the first comment. However, the pagination class as well as the query validator only accepts the "count" in brackets as it is described in the SPARQL standard (there is an example in section 18.2.4.1 on http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query ).  So, my query should look like:  <pre>SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?COUNT) WHERE { ?a &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://www.openlinksw.com/schemas/virtrdf#QuadMapFormat&gt; }</pre>  Thanks again and sorry for opening this issue. 
I'm not familiar with JVM profiling so some instructions would be nice. I tested with empty ritual pedestals, empty ritual pedestals on the marble structure under it, and active ritual pedestals. The chunk updates were consistent throughout them all. 
@alexkalderimis human.intermine.org but I also would like it to work with humanmine.org  Can you help me fix this today or tomorrow? @rachellyne needs to be able to use the results tables to test humanmine this week.

This query is created using Alias.$() (within the generated OfferDaoImpl.java).  Your hint helped solving it: It works if you change the line `query.where(Alias.$(offer.getDrinkId()).eq(drinkId));` to `query.where(Alias.$(offer.getDrink().getId()).eq(drinkId));` in the generated code. Is this something that can be fixed in the generator template? 
No
Yeah, I comment the lines from `for` to `}` but the code is still in keyword color.  The color should be grey, just like:  <img width="534" alt="2017-05-16 9 38 54" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5100735/26108860/4ae7d02c-3a80-11e7-9114-04eaf544c2fb.png">   
It's very simple to reproduce, and in doing so, I find that the problem becomes even more fantastic. In the demo project, there are two sections of keystore configuration in bootstrap.properties, as follows:  > #encrypt.key-store.location= classpath:/config-server.keystore #encrypt.key-store.alias=config-server #encrypt.key-store.password=test123 #encrypt.key-store.secret=test123   > encrypt.key-store.location= classpath:/server.jks encrypt.key-store.alias=mytestkey encrypt.key-store.password=letmein encrypt.key-store.secret=changeme  Pointing to two keystore files, server.jks from the generated command given on the document, as follows:  > keytool -genkeypair -alias mytestkey -keyalg RSA  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" -keypass changeme -keystore server.jks -storepass letmein  When started with this configuration, the exception did not appear and it appears to have been loaded.  So I made minor modifications to the generated command above, and generated config-server.keystore. The command is as follows:  > keytool -genkeypair -alias config-server -keyalg RSA  -dname "CN=Web Server,OU=Unit,O=Organization,L=City,S=State,C=US" -keypass test123 -keystore config-server.keystore -storepass test123  When you start using the config-server.keystore configuration, an exception appears above.  I don't know the difference, maybe the name?  Zip file of demo project: [demo.zip](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/files/2555818/demo.zip)       
Good question. I couldn't tell. What would be a fast VNC server setup to test?

Hi Jexp,  I use neo4j 2.0.0 community edition. Yes, i got an index on :USER(email)  It's the only node where we found this bug, and it's really difficult to share this graph. To much email in this graph. 
I just realized that you are setting minSdk 16, so I don't think people will run into actual issues. But just to be sure, I have created a pull request that makes use of the support DialogFragment and getSupportFragmentManager. See #67  
Ok it took a few tries but I was able to reproduce it with spearows. Happened before with pidgeys, rattatas, caterpies.

That's the point. The first map show that there should be excellent coverage!

It is extending your ImageView which implements RippleView. So, I think it does.. Anyways I'll be uploading screenshots in a min!

Yes, that`s it! 
That is done by [`determineStartPlayer()`](https://github.com/magarena/magarena/blob/7ca1020830d8d554a84ac61a178c2f915fa78b12/src/magic/model/MagicDuel.java#L69).  I thought it might be to implement rule [103.2](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Starting_the_game) which describes how to determine who plays first but the only place I can see where that might happen is [here](https://github.com/magarena/magarena/blob/7ca1020830d8d554a84ac61a178c2f915fa78b12/src/magic/model/MagicDuel.java#L114) and I cannot see how it can ever be anything other than 1.

`Mac OS and Windows ` : 👍   Hi, These functions doesn't work on linux.(For my case) Can u add an encoding parameter? Thanks.  ` public void writeContentToFile(String content, String filePath) throws FileCreationException {         try {             FileUtils.fileWrite(filePath, content);          } catch (IOException e) {             throw new FileCreationException(filePath);         }     }`  // **FileUtils.fileWrite(filePath, "UTF-8", content);**   `public String readContentFromFile(String filePath) throws MissingFileException {         try {             return FileUtils.fileRead(filePath);          } catch (IOException e) {             throw new MissingFileException(filePath);         }     }`  **//FileUtils.fileRead(filePath, "UTF-8");**
Currently I don't have a code sample. The problem occurs in our code which has too many dependencies to easily create a code example.   Anyway, I think the following problem happens:   * We get an event and determine, that the queue is full * We call subscripiton.unsubscribe() https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L176 * The closed "event" was already enqeued in the queue * The queue processes the close "event", sets the atomic boolean and returns (closing the queue processing thread: https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L250 * The queue is now empty (i.e. not full anymore) * The atomic boolean guarding the queue is not set to false * Now, a new event appears on the volatile queue. (Why this happens is the interesting part. It might be that the unsubscribe() call has not completed, yet, or that the volatile subscription has a similar issues that a close does not prevent events from being delivered. ) * The queue is empty, so the event can be added.  * The processing queue is restarted by line https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L180  I think the last line might be the underlying cause of the bug. Why is it there in the first place? Processing should already have been started on line https://github.com/msemys/esjc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/msemys/esjc/CatchUpSubscription.java#L215 So line 180 seems redundant to me. Maybe there is a border case I cannot see right now which requires this line?   Tell me, if you can agree with this reasoning. 
I've tested out 362fafe, here are the results: Booted up the emulator, with shaders enabled, and started up the game, tested loading game save from main menu with "Continue" as well as all other options such as "Start Game" and the gallery, music player, etc. Did not run into the freeze issue. Shut down the emulator and then restarted it (game doesn't seem to run anymore if I simply use the emulator's reset), loaded the game and repeated the process 4 times, still did not run into the freeze issue again. :+1:   Title logo animations issue remains. Also while I was in the gallery, I tested out playing a cutscene animation unlocked during gameplay, the same issue with the green sheen remains. There is also a noticeably delay between choosing to start the playback and when the graphical content of the animation actually shows on screen, even though the audio of the animation starts playing right away. Just to clarify, I say "cutscene animation", but it's not 3D generated within the game, instead being a prerecorded 2D animation, likely a video file.  Also even though the green sheen is the most noticeable issue during playback of the animation, it's not the only issue. While the audio of the animation plays at a smooth rate, the actual graphical content barely displays at all. Only the occasional image is visible throughout the entire video.  Screenshot of the animation using External Software renderer: ![jpcsp-gallery video 1-ext soft](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20574569/31376015-7363f454-ad71-11e7-8f63-f1ec66260d69.JPG)  Screenshot of the animation using OpenGL renderer: ![jpcsp-gallery video 2-opengl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20574569/31376021-78a724cc-ad71-11e7-90d4-02c76b59e0c7.JPG) 
Saw it a few times in the past few days. But I tried to replicate it just now and couldn't. I'll update here if I see it again. 
Sure, I noticed in my recording that this does indeed work when using the integration editor. But links outside this editor work without any conformation. IIRC clicking on the logo also displayed the dialog on the angular frontend and it would be good if it is possible to keep it that way.  ![Peek 2019-06-10 08-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46345469/59178129-6178bc80-8b5e-11e9-9fd7-cb9b90f654cd.gif) 
HTC ONE, Android 5.0.2 It looks as if the last played list is pretty long, which causes the freezing? Possibly because it has to check the last played time? ( noticed this new red bar below thumbnail )

there is not a real bug. I found the problem. I thought I turned off battery optimisation but instead it was still turned on - but I gave permission to get App Status / Usage. The next time I opened the app it asks me again for both - turn off battery optmisation and App Status / Usage -  so I thought it was not working. It works now.   Some more suggestios:  let apps been added to a running Lock. Let's say I want to add Chrome for the current time period without the need to restart the program.    Turn on Flightmode (turn off phone, mail, wlan) for a custom time, would also be nice to have as an addition. So you can say, don't disturb me for x amount of time at all but turn on again automatically in 30 minutes. And of course shortcuts would be nice to activate it quickly.   Reverse Timer is also a good idea. thanks!

Sorry, don't want to waste your time.  Windows 10, 64 bit, 64, Java (build 1.8.0_171-b11).  Not sure what log files I can give you because...unfortunately it's not generating a save file to pull from :(
Hi,  I'm using version 2.6.1 and I forgot a information. It's occur when I use inverse properties axiom.  Follows a class test  ``` public class Test {  	public static void main(String[] args) throws OWLOntologyCreationException { 		OWLOntology ontology = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager().createOntology(); 		 		OWLObjectProperty a = OWL.ObjectProperty("a"); 		OWLObjectProperty b = OWL.ObjectProperty("b"); 		 		OWLAxiom inverseAxiom = OWL.inverseProperties(a, b); 		 		ontology.addAxiom(inverseAxiom); 		 		OWLReasoner reasoner = OpenlletReasonerFactory.getInstance().createNonBufferingReasoner(ontology); 		 		NodeSet<OWLClass> clses = reasoner.getObjectPropertyDomains(a); 	}  } ```
This fixes my issue, looks like some anvil combos were indeed left out. It should probably be PR'd.
@tthuem  I removed the entry in the legend.   There is still missing an explanation of void feature model.   Also are constraint that are not satisfiable not highlighted.    1. So should I highlight the unsatisfiable constraints or not? With the current implementation of the explanation it is not possible to recognize a unsatisfiable constraint.  2. Should I highlight the constraint that causes the void model or should we implement an explanation for the void model (that is currently not implemented) ?  In the end the unsatisfiable constraint causes the feature model to be void aswell. So an explanation of the void model would be perfect.
The latest release. When I change from play screen back to main menu, it stays in "Play Ranked" 
Thanks, works great now!
There is no way, to my knowledge, as each mod can add their own drops, at their own percentage chance, without telling anyone else about it. Enough Resources, I think just hardcodes the loot and the chance.  It can also use the new json based loot tables, however this is new and not all mods use it.  This is the one thing I didn't want to do as I wanted it to work with mods as you added/removed them.

@TylerJewell thanks for the explanation  I am trying to run che behind https using nginx reverse proxy, I have adjusted the che server tomcat server.xml to have the proxy port and scheme to https.   and configured another system as nginx reverse proxy to do the ssl termination and forward to 8080 and other websocket ports on the che server  So i have to start the che sever with CHE_HOST=public host name, but just before the project creation the che server application tries to connect to the wsagent on http://CHE_HOST:randomport/, I am not sure why it is http, but nevertheless I needed that ping to pass so the project creation can pass, so I had to add a dummy hosts entry to the che container for CHE_HOST with the ip of the host machine, and ping passes.
I've used the Eclipse plugin CE.
>  > Which version of Spring Cloud are you using?  I'm using Hoxton.RELEASE  > Did you figure out that it's not a bug in Spring Cloud Netflix?  I didn't had much time to debug. But I'm pretty sure (but not entirely) that it's not a spring cloud netflix problem because the discovery works fine on any other Spring Application in my project.  > SBA refreshes the Instances form discovery every time a new `Heartbeat` event is published. > Could you please try to debug if the event is published by the eureka discovery client?  I've change the logging level of the `InstanceDiscoveryListener` and as far as I can see the  `Heartbeat` events are received (I see `Discovering new instances from DiscoveryClient` print repeatedly).  Moreover, what I have done to test it is to add a new java class in the project that autowires the EurekaDiscoveryClient and schedule a method that calls the `getServices()` and prints the result. I can clearly see that the discovery client is not receiving any new instance while on eureka they are correctly registered.  > May be this is linked: spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix#3708  I think I've never seen the error, but it could be related. This may explain why the first time the registry is fetched correctly. I will look into it and let you know. 
@rentalhost It was happening in *all* my code yesterday. But today.... I tried lots of files and I did not came across the error again. So: not sure what happend yesterday (I did restart my IDE but that had no effect).  Ah well let's blame Windows :)  Thanks for this amazing plugin and I will update this if I see the error again.
No,The only thing that happens to me is that everything disappears when loading the game and has me crazy
Initially no, but I just enabled it in the current master to see if that fixes anything: The problem persists.
@mrtentje  Project: Benchmark (as usual) Mapping: presentation, domain, infrastructure layer -> to their physical counterparts Rules: presentation **is not allowed to use** infrastructure  To say you want to reproduce it... That's the big problem here right? Because I can't find a real cause of the problem. 
@mstachniuk, thanks a lot for verifying the issue! Indeed it is fixed (blushing :).  >There should be shipkit-bootstrap instead of shipkit, I think it comes from:  Those are essentially dummy values, only used to make the first build pass. We probably want to revisit because they are kind of confusing.  >I think in "shipkit-bootstrap" project a file shipkit.gradle should be pre-defined  Great idea! Please review: https://github.com/mockito/shipkit-bootstrap/pull/2  >What do you think about a feature with remove access_token and try GitHub API call without it, if it's wrong (and log this to the console as Warning)?

@heiko-braun the integration is just a super simple API Provider integration with a single implemented flow, running in my local minishift. Will keep an eye on it, but I got it once yesterday and now twice today, no idea right now what could trigger it.
Almost fixed. I think we got the Core version tweaks done and may have rebuilt enough to fix TTA, although the last stable release binary will still be broken. If I can get the remaining modules built today and a binary confirmed as good I can do a quick checkpoint stable then close this :-) 
You mean flip arguments to an operator? I tried something like that before, but I always cleared the variable cards when I was done with an experiment.
``` from BaseXClient import BaseXClient from parsel import Selector  def main():     session = BaseXClient.Session('localhost', 1984, 'admin', 'admin')      session2 = BaseXClient.Session('localhost', 1984, 'admin', 'admin')     session2.execute("check database")      query = session.query("collection('database')")      for code, item in query.iter():         selector = Selector(text=item, type='xml')          country = selector.xpath('@country').extract_first()         doc_number = selector.xpath('@doc-number').extract_first()         kind = selector.xpath('@kind').extract_first()          key = '{}_{}_{}'.format(country, doc_number, kind)         # WO_2018022284_A1 key example         # each item have unique key          session2.replace("{}.xml".format(key), item) ```  This is a very simplified example with the same problem.
Morning Axel.  Still no approvals to post code from my end yet.

All 3 of those options sound good.  **A (very poor) example of the implementation in the configuration file:** ``` disable-projectile-randomness:   # This is to remove projectile randomness while firing arrows with a bow   # This is actually a very old feature and has been in the game for quite some time   enabled: false   worlds: []   multishot:     # Setting this to "true" will result in vanilla behaviour for *only* multishot crossbows.     ignore: false     # This setting allows you to modify how spread out the additional projectiles from multishot are.     #   If 'ignore' is false, the projectiles will be derandomized, and 'spread' will be applied.     # Setting this to 0 will make all 3 shots land in the same place.     # Setting this to <insert default spread here> will give you the vanilla spread.     # Setting this to or above <insert> may cause problems, for example, arrows coming out of the player's FOV.     spread: <insert default spread here> ```
Hi,  I always run it with redis. Here is my code to get the count of registrations.  Iterators.size(lwServer.getRegistrationService().getAllRegistrations());  However, after registering 200+ devices, after a while, the number became to drop. It might go back to the original number and, then, it will be dropping again ...  it will give some wrong small number eventually ...  However, if I get the number of registration directly through redis-cli, the number of the connected devices is correct.  It means something wrong with the piece of code. Iterators.size(lwServer.getRegistrationService().getAllRegistrations());  I also try to use hasNext(), next() instead of Iterators.size. It gives me the same result. Hence, I strongly suspect the iterator implementation of leshan has some issue ... Maybe, it needs to reset the iterator or something.  Myself, I implement a lua script to get the total count. Maybe, leshan should adopt that.  Thanks :)   
Hi @justinedelson   Can you please let us know if there is a an FTP server or file sharing system, where i can upload the packages.   I am unable to add them here.   Regards Sanket 
Appreciate you taking a look Electroblob77. I'll close this issue.

In my mod OMT I use 2 systems, one that tracks all listeners (on the server inventory container, detectAndSendChanges()) and just distributes a custom network message (simpleimpl) to each listener per tick. Explanation for the other is down further. They both make GUI information that is not inventory (since minecraft handles that itself) super smooth and doesnt impact performance nearly as much as block updates do.  For the first system that can be used for GUIs that have an inventory container: https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/openmodularturrets/client/gui/containers/TurretBaseContainer.java#L140-L149 https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OpenModularTurrets/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/openmodularturrets/network/messages/MessageTurretBase.java   And I have an additional system that works for GUIs without inventory containers. It is a tiny bit more complicated and uses my Library mod. Basically the Tileentities that use it need to implement an interface, and have a list variable that gets updated through that interface. In their update() method they send a message to each member of that list containing needed information and additionally they scrub that list every 20 lists or so (checking player distance from block) in case a crash occurs or the gui did not close properly.   https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OMLib/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/omlib/network/ISyncableTE.java  This interface is then used by 2 messages that get sent during init of a gui on the client and on gui close: https://github.com/OpenModularTurretsTeam/OMLib/blob/1.12/src/main/java/omtteam/omlib/client/gui/TrustedPlayersGUI.java#L75-L80 Those messages are really simple, they simply grab the listener list via a function on the interface and either add or remove a listener based on the contents of the message.  Sounds a bit complicated but this solved all the sync issues / performance (due to block updates/ unneceesary information flow) issues in my mod(s).

latest (which is 0.9.3) as it's said in the title, I tried to capture a vengeance spirit in an empty box. 
Will do tonight. 
Thanks for the feedback. My main concern is when we release a new version and we update the metadata to point to the new version. This potential window where we'd show the old version is the critical aspect of it. And quite frustrating since the metadata is immutable the rest of the time really. If that's the only option we need to figure how an acceptable windows for the upgrade use case.
Loading a node entity only retrieve the objects around the loaded object. Adding In the tests : ` a1.getDeposits().stream().forEach(o -> o = btor.findOne(o.getId())); a1.getWithdrawals().stream().forEach(i -> i = btir.findOne(i.getId())); ` force loading of transactions data.  Still, i have to discover how come the objects are fully loaded after insert. It seems that there is a kind of cache in neo4J or SDN.

@keyboardsurfer sorry, meant to include those. it was w/ 1.8.1 on Android 4.4.2 on a Nexus 5. It only happened once, and I've updated to 1.8.2 now. I can let you know if it happens again on 1.8.2 
Updated to LuckPerms v4.1.82 and same issue
I use the recent beta 17.  There is no error message, DNA just deletes not all selected documents. 
It can be reproduced by using the zoom function in chrome, for our resolutions we have to bring it down to 50% or lower.  ![dfstrp7nscu_wf1ifujgrcc6hvd7tccieoket4vqog8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1372708/2865423/90e0489a-d21c-11e3-924e-0c35a402d605.png) 
@swankjesse I am not explicitly closing the cache, its probably getting closed by Retrofit.  I could catch the exception in `chain.proceed(request)` but then I don't know what to return in the `intercept` method. Would returning `null` be fine? 
Those could be options as well. I just went for the most obvious fix, that provides a decent workflow. Could be enhanced. 
I twice opened the inventory of both fillers, initially there were two items in both and at the end one item in both. But OK, I am going to create a new video. (Thank you for answer!)

Always in the GUI :-) And yes, that is the option I selected. Based on the sized of the export, it must be exporting the PSMs that were "identified" but not validated, which is exactly what the option says. However, I guess I don't want just PSMs, but rather unidentified spectra AND non validated PSMs.   I find that with a particular dataset, I get about 20% of the spectra are identified with only oxidized methionine selected as a PTM. This is more spectra than are identified when I select 6 PTMs. I suppose this is a result of the larger search space but still seems odd. I would like to export the remaining 80% of the spectra and then search those with a different set of PTMs. I don't know how valid of an approach this is, but it would allow me to get rid of "uninteresting" spectra so that I can dig deeper for the PTMs I'm looking for.

I'm trying to run a Funkwhale instance (https://open.audio/) with Audinaut v0.3.2 from F-Droid. A friend has the same issue with his instance, it works only with the "Browse by Tags" option in DSub or UltraSonic. So you are saying the option is not visible but it's enabled by default ? Maybe I'm wrong but seems not.
@cammace the navigation image isn't a rounder-bout as i hadn't approached the rounder-bout, their was actually a rounderbout around the right bend shown above, what im saying is we don't drive on the right side of the road - as you can see the instructions is for in 1.2miles 
Thank you Paul. I tried the nightly build and it solve some of the problems, it was much faster and seemed to work much better. To complete the test, I need to install the nightly build. Not sure how to do that. There was no install script or files in the nightly build. Thank you again. Charles Cook 
Yes `onDestroy()` is getting called and even after calling `imaAdsLoader.release()` still the memory leaks kicks in after closing the app. This memory leaks only occurs after implementing IMA Extension.

I've attached a reduced PolyGlot file and the output pdf. ![Screencap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4267128/59292622-b65f2480-8c7d-11e9-90be-e632f33c6ac6.JPG) [.pdf and .pgd file](https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/files/3277711/example.zip)  I noticed that for some word, it *does* omit the form, but not for others. 
This is the error actual error which occurs in flyway:  ``` org.flywaydb.core.internal.command.DbMigrate$FlywayMigrateSqlException:  Migration V2__CreateIndexConcurrently.sql failed ------------------------------------------------ SQL State  : 40P01 Error Code : 0 Message    : ERROR: deadlock detected   Detail: Process 587 waits for ShareLock on virtual transaction 10/12; blocked by process 588.

In terms of whether this is even fixable, I think that the strategy for locking a schema for migration would need to be changed. You may be able to switch to using `pg_try_advisory_lock` and poll for it to go true instead of relying on `pg_advisory_lock`'s blocking nature.
@samtstern  I don't want the modal message to prevent interaction with the Maps View. I hope Google Map is normal when banner style in-app messaging is shown over the app. Could you help this?
@serge-rider yes，i use jdk1.8 build DBeaver ``` git pull mvn package ```
Yeah I saw the ORM and it would be great to use it, but the app's so not ready for it! There's so much spaghetti and view stuff talking direct to the database almost, it needs pulling apart. That's what I was trying to do with the Forum package but there's so much hardwired into using int IDs and building making database queries and network requests, it's a ton of work and it's basically a rewrite of a lot of the app  The appended ID is a good idea... since it is sort of another 'thread', and it'll never show up anywhere else (and get purged after a week anyway). Only trouble is the thread ID is an integer in the database, and (of course) everything's pulling rows out of the database and expecting ints from that column. I'm not sure if we can quickly hack this, I'll have a look at it though  I'll push the tweaks I made to the parsing code, hopefully it's a bit easier to follow and it should fix some of the gotchas with reply calculations. There's other fun stuff that needs fixing though (like ignored posts aren't added to the post database at all if 'always ignore' is set in the options)
@CPColin inside the `if` block, the type of `e` is narrowed to      <I | OverflowException> & RuntimeException  which is also      <I & RuntimeException> | <OverflowException & RuntimeException>  The type checker (falsely) believes that `RuntimeException` and `OverflowException` are disjoint, so the above type simplifies to      <I & RuntimeException> | Nothing  Or, simply `I & RuntimeException`.  The invocation `e.oops()` is legal, since `I & RuntimeException` has a member `oops()`.
Just default, haven't changed anything at all :) 
my xenforo mysql db has always been remote and when you use bungee with servers on the same dedicated server you bind the servers to localhost so players can only connect through bungeecord  when I don't bind the minecraft server it works but when I do it can't connect to the remote mysql db so I would say yes in some cases I need the mysql connector to bind to different ip than the minecraft server  Thanks JamieKG

I meant adding an option so users could turn it on/off at will. I'm working on it just to see if I can pull it off. Folks with bigger screens might want it. 
I have supplied the database to Andrey for analysis. I am waiting for his input on what might be wrong. The database was created by prior snapshot of 2.1

@ryanjbaxter Sure! Is there a (snapshot?) version of spring-cloud-gateway that is already using that? If not, how can I override the spring cloud version?
Just straight up Python. Pretty much exactly as shown in the menu in step 2 [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html).
I used your core analyzer to look at the coredumps i gave you, and it looks like a jit thread is hanging or something. It's the largest cpu time user of any thread and grows between the two dumps.
it gives the right output... strange.. but for some reasons, it doesn't gives the items Edit:Tested this: `on death of player:      loop items in victim's inventory:          remove loop-item from drops          add loop-item to {inventory.%name of victim%::*} on respawn:     loop {inventory.%name of player%::*}:     broadcast " DEBUG: loop-index: %loop-index%, loop-value: %loop-value%"`  Edit2: http://paste.md-5.net/sedufirife.vhdl (Github-Code just broke the format)  No output ^^ 
What is the action bar? 
I just maked a few tests. If I make the photos in landscapemode, all works fine. But if I make the photos in portraitmode the issue is happen.  The photos on the screenshots are maked in portraitmode. On my computer both images are shown like the the received image (90 turned) On my phone so, like the screenshots shown.  I have attached both images. The bigger one is the original before compression. And the smaller one the received.  Please let me know if you need photos maked in landscapemode. ![after_receiving](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6864851/4650539/aacda018-5494-11e4-88b7-7a2b43d2c196.jpg) ![before_sended](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6864851/4650540/aae05bfe-5494-11e4-940f-acfd8c4c61a3.jpg) 
I use this [plugin](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/NFC), but I have the same problem with this [plugin](https://github.com/chariotsolutions/phonegap-nfc).  There seems to be something that does prevent and does not allow the passage of information in the application.  I also tried the [babbelLab](https://github.com/babbelLab/cordova-plugin-kiosk) fork, but the problem is the same. 
No no, that was the actual barrels. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: We just forgot to fix the lids. 
`/data/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/files/config.xml` and `config.xml.invalid` are 0600 and owned by root, everything else is 0600 and owned by uid 10113.  I tried reproducing this again and changing the device name without root works, but changing the device name after I enable root hits the bug. 
This is the first time I've seen it.   It stopped the history service (as uncaught exception) from updating.
I asked, but no one is sure who was messing with it at the time or what was being used, sorry.

Actually right now I am doing such a thing, but this results in the tokens gets small all the time, frankly it's not that beautiful,  ![screenshot_2015-11-10-11-30-47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8791318/11057217/8b98885a-879e-11e5-8e9c-1f5e92a19089.png)   what I think would be great is for the token to get re-sized on-demand (while it's bigger than the available space.

You can use tests/regression/java-rewrite-engine/list/test1. It's commented out but uncomment it and you'll have an example, although it doesn't print the stack trace unless you turn back on SMT solving. 
If I am understanding you correctly, yes the client window is open and I am busy creating a new map when the crash occurs Create New World ---> Building Terrain ---> Downloading World ---> Freeze ---> Shutting Down Internal Server ---> Crash Back To Launcher 
you have the perms list? 
I have tested with the latested, however I haven't reset my config as the server is in production right now, so resetting the config would require some downtime 
I have exactly one ad-hoc task and that one is being passed on to the create method.  Recurrent tasks are being "added" to the scheduler using `startTasks(...)`, before I build & start the scheduler. The method `startTasks(...)` is called multiple times: I do a set of if statements to check for profiles which indicate the tasks that should be started.  ``` if(x) {     builder.startTasks(taskA); }  if(y) {     builder.startTasks(taskB); }  ```  Could calling startTasks multiple times be an issue? Also having the issue if I have a simple scheduler with an ad-hoc task (so passed in the `create` method). 
@TWiStErRob I see some duplicate classes in compiler-4.2.0.jar, you can open it by WinRAR
@robinpaulson I can try when I find some time.
I've usualy just ran the jar file, i can try that later when i play a comp Tried it in a custom map and it appeared to work fine, it does detect the game closing but discord still shows as i'm in menu "CSGO not detected. Shutting down RPC."

@yvgopal, I checked in the test app. The queue is empty all the time. None of message processing methods ever called. So it's "no" for both questions.  onMessageAsync()/OnCloseSessionAsync() is called only when messages put into queue. But it's not affecting CoreMessageReceiver growth.  Here some logs of the period where new portion of CoreMessageReceiver was created: https://gist.github.com/Endeg/7140b7cbdfc8311cabc70695d2b9ce05

Yep, looks good. 
That doesn't seem to help. The only way I got something running again was to leave the beta and install the latest released version, which worries me that next updates will break on my device.  I also tried to reboot the phone, but that didn't help.  Run conditions shouldn't be a problem. Anyway, I tried to run on the usual WiFi wile plugged in and nothing loads.  While the app is stuck loading I cannot even check the settings, which doesn't help me do diagnoses what's going on not to try and change something
Sure, just pushed them to this repo: https://github.com/felixfbecker/PowerShellXSD  `Format.xsd` is the the schema (I autogenerated it from the XML, so pretty sure it's valid) `TestFormat.xml` is a schema instance. Try hovering over any tag, or triggering autocompletion, and you should see the above exceptions logged (and no hover/completion results).

Version 1.4.2. Scene.json remains unchanged when I run headles mode after rendreing scene in GUI. As far as I understand, this is because the scene has already been rendered. Therefore, you must delete the dump file or change some property in the Scene.json (width, height, etc.) and then run headless rendering to reproduce this error.

Helllo @bclozel, thank you for the reaction.  In our team, we provided our own custom `RequestedContentTypeResolver` for `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` to convert our own accept header and content-type header. (This is because the accept header controls versioning.)  Usually, HandlerMapping is executed in the following order.  1. `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`) 2. `ControllerEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`) 3. `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` (CustomRequestedContentTypeResolver)  The value of MediaTypesAttribute cached by `HeaderContentTypeResolver` of `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` is cleared when `ControllerEndpointHandlerMapping` ends.  However, for some reason, our team executed HandlerMapping in the following order. (I am aware that this is a rare case.)  1. `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`) 2. `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` (CustomRequestedContentTypeResolver) 3. `ControllerEndpointHandlerMapping` (`HeaderContentTypeResolver`)  In this case, the MediaTypesAttribute value cached by the `HeaderContentTypeResolver` of `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` is inherited by `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` without being cleared. Therefore, we can no longer resolve the MediaTypesAttribute with the CustomRequestedContentTypeResolver.  Manipulating the HandlerMapping order can solve the above problem. However, if  `WebFluxEndpointHandlerMapping` alone can clear the value of MediaTypesAttribute, can the value of MediaTypesAttribute be handled without depending on the order of HandlerMapping?  What do you think?    
Cool, I can look into it but won't be able until late December.
In the client side, I'm using StandardWebSocketClient. While handshaking, it is trying to extract port number from the URL, but container's public url doesnt have port number at the end: `wss://server2v4p7rik-dedicated-container-server-6000.mydomain.com/chat` ``` 	private int getPort(URI uri) { 		if (uri.getPort() == -1) { 	        String scheme = uri.getScheme().toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH); 	        return ("wss".equals(scheme) ? 443 : 80); 		} 		return uri.getPort(); 	} ```  So, the websocket client is trying to use the privileged port no. 443 (?)  In order to overcome this, i had to use authbind to bind exposed port 443 to springboot websocket port 6000.
@lbensaad, I feel like we had an issue for that already, but I can't find it. Yeah, open up a new issue.
It's blindcat97@gmail.com Thank you very much for the help! Polyglot is a wonderful program and it's nice to know that it's author is extremely helpful!
ok, so are you saying that your mod doesn't support upgrading?  you might want to tell modpack authors not to upgrade your mod, then. seems like a huge issue, to me.
Ruh-roh.  Does this one work for you?  https://mytake.org/foundation-v1/presidential-debate-kennedy-nixon-1-of-4/2888.000-2910.500  It doesn't work for me right now.  If you have a link that works for you, can you send it to me and I'll try?
For example, I want to watch a part of video that is 8 minutes long. The problem is I don't want to watch the full video, but I would like to start watching from 5 minutes in. In 1080 mode I am able to scroll through the video and start watching 5 minutes into it. With 4k mode, I am unable to do that. It only allows me to watch the video from the location (time) that I am currently at which means I am forced to watch the full 8 minutes of that video. 
That means even if I right-click on column name(header of the task list), for example start date, the sorting will be triggered as well. 
Hi.  No it appears to happen on the S3 homescreen which is locked in portrait.  Cheers. 
ok. This is strange. I try on my home computer (Ubuntu) and it works as expected. I used "fresh" pref and also the same pref than my other computer. It was the same database.  I will try again on my work computer (windows) tomorrow. 
i've tried it with multiple blueprints (all freshly crafted) and i've also tried it with multiple templates. the second i connect the power the blueprint/template just go's into the builders inventory.  
I am not sure if this will actually work in our approach due to: 1) Even if the connection is open before sending the batch, the race condition still exists: - connection is not established, I send the command without autoflushing disabled (internally, there's a connection promise), and when it's completed, the command is added to a connection buffer - I wait for the connection to be established, I get the same promise (AsyncConnectionProvider.getConnection(...)). - When promise completes (meaning the connection is established), 2 actions start at the same moment:     1. add command to the command buffer (internally in lettuce)    2. flush commands (externally by my code). - If for any reason `flush commands` action is quicker, the command would not be flushed. 2. In cluster mode connections are stored [by slot](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/blob/master/src/main/java/io/lettuce/core/cluster/PooledClusterConnectionProvider.java#L103), iterating over 16384 connection before flushing would be bad from performance point of view. 
Thanks for investigating.  I have only started using IntelliJ and save actions today, however I can see 3 instances of the error in the IntelliJ console log.  I think the plugin is working, not exactly sure, I will investigate further the next time it happens.

0.2.3 ... wait oh... OH... 0.3.2 exists
The latest dev build. 
@tolusha what's the latest status? Is there someone who can provide the code review so we can get this merged? 
This is on Linux with openjdk version "1.8.0_91" The launcher is version 3.2.3.1  I had a quick look at the launcher's code. It looks like you have your own code for deleting files, which looks similar to the apache commons file utils.  Would it be an option to use the original file utils for doing the job? If yes then I can do a quick test if this would fix the problem. 
no. but i dont know what i did wrong  i did the steps like in this instruction  https://crosp.net/blog/android/android-reverse-engineering-debugging-smali-using-smalidea/  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25721108/40206283-9d65598a-5a2f-11e8-9d4b-d203d8e05bac.png) 
sure. happens with the most basic setup. https://github.com/masc3d/flyway-issue-1180

> why would I want to delete this module?  Possibly when implementing beacons v2 and removing beacons v1. The real concern here is the underlying issue that prevents removing certain system packages. Modifying system data is something we do regularly between releases.
I attached an example project to the original description. As @jaikiran noted, it is specific to `dev` mode; it does not occur if I run tests (also included).
Sure :) I do not exclude I'm doing something wrong.. But If its' so I don't understand what o:) The songs have all a genre displayed in GPM, it just seems that only a few have it exported. Every other part of the tag is correctly managed. Genres aren't that important as they are pretty subjective but this is indeed strange.   The songs are the following: Clean Bandit - Rockabye (feat. Sean Paul & Anne-Marie).mp3 Ed Sheeran - Shape of You.mp3 Enrique Iglesias & Juan Luis Guerra - Cuando Me Enamoro.mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Bailamos (Wild Wild West-Soundtrack Version).mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Bailando (Spanish Version) (feat. Descemer Bueno & Gente De Zona).mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Be With You.mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Duele el corazón.mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Hero (MetroMix).mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Rhythm Divine.mp3 Enrique Iglesias - SUBEME LA RADIO (feat. Descemer Bueno & Zion & Lennox).mp3 Ermal Meta - Vietato morire.mp3 Francesco Gabbani - Occidentali's Karma.mp3 Katy Perry - Chained To The Rhythm (feat. Skip Marley).mp3 Nicky Jam - El Perdón.mp3 Rag’n’Bone Man - Human.mp3 Rag’n’Bone Man - Skin.mp3 The Weeknd - I Feel It Coming (feat. Daft Punk).mp3  Of those, only these two have been exported with correct genre "Blues" (checked using mp3tag) Rag’n’Bone Man - Human.mp3 Rag’n’Bone Man - Skin.mp3  And these one with correct genre "Pop" Ed Sheeran - Shape of You.mp3 Enrique Iglesias - Hero (MetroMix).mp3 Ermal Meta - Vietato morire.mp3 Francesco Gabbani - Occidentali's Karma.mp3  All the others have an empty Genre Tag. Instead the genres should be (as they are present in GPM), for example: Latin Pop > Enrique Iglesias - Bailamos (Wild Wild West-Soundtrack Version).mp3 Latin Pop > Enrique Iglesias - Be With You.mp3 R&B/Soul > The Weeknd - I Feel It Coming (feat. Daft Punk).mp3 Latin > Enrique Iglesias - SUBEME LA RADIO (feat. Descemer Bueno & Zion & Lennox).mp3 Dance/Electronic > Clean Bandit - Rockabye (feat. Sean Paul & Anne-Marie).mp3
@l0rd I've created workspace from OSIO codebases view. It was existing project: https://github.com/rhopp/vertx-wiki2
> Does this happen when you open NewPipe or when you start playing a new video?  When you re-open NewPipe. Effectively the reproducer is something like:  1. Start playing an hour-long video on popout. 2. Switch to another app. 3. Do other actions, lock your phone, etc. 4. Go back to NewPipe, and the popout dies.  > This can be caused by an expired stream link.  Maybe NewPipe should try to re-fetch a new stream link and restart playing from the stopped time, instead of dying? I could look into implementing it myself but I'm not really a Java developer by trade.
Except you can't craft the liquid infuser, as it requires 6 dark iron plates, which are made from 6 dark iron ingots that have been made into plates.
Sorry i haven't had a chance, I'll try to get into it this week.

Yes still happen same in 732 version and if i add tile doesn't save 
Posts, Stairs, Slabs and Walls all seem to have the issue on Multiplayer, however Posts and Walls don't make step sounds in single player, either. The platforms on the same BlockID as "Wooden Post" and "Metal Post" also suffer from lacking multiplayer step sounds, however the coloured Metal Platforms work fine on both. 
When you select a range of cells and click on clear content, the contents are not deleted. However, if you close the book and reopen the book, you will find out that the contents of the range you selected are deleted.
I cannot reproduce this issue in CHE 6.12.0-SNAPSHOT.
I think Cert is good as i am able to access the get request using the browser, i am try to access the static html file using the browser, some how it is throwing the error. public class CustomHandlerFactory implements HandlerFactory {  ``` public Handler create(LaunchConfig launchConfig) throws Exception {     return Handlers.chain(             Handlers.assets(launchConfig, "static", Arrays.asList("index.html")),              Handlers.path("foo", new Handler() {                  public void handle(Context context) throws Exception {                     context.render("from the foo handler");                  }               })                ); } ``` 
- put the mod in the mods folder  - Open the launcher  - start the game with forge  - game crashes
Yes, appears to be fixed. 
Yes, PdTest does work on the device. Play back of the sine waves works and patch mic results in a distorted, high pitched sound. 
Step by step:  -/shopkeeper (a villager appear) -sneak+clic to access the edit menu -click on the name tag -type a name -change the outfit of the npc  and now or even before i try to put things in his inventory but things continu to come back in my hand.  I've found another way but still got a problem, i've used the /adminshop create Farmer all the buy/sell is setup, but after a restart server, some of the npc lost all the setup.   I have a lot of issues with my plugins, i'll need to make a lot a request on this site :/  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9_HCGyEhXc&feature=youtu.be] (url)  ![shopkeeper console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47430309/52450205-583cfc00-2b3a-11e9-9dbf-0cf171831581.png) 
I'll give the latest a go when the server restarts tomorrow morning (I have a scheduled auto-restart set for 8AM my time, as that's about the only time it's empty), as I always immediately revert when I encounter a failure.

1188 - I thought I cleared up everything but I'll have another look tomorrow evening. I was working on a game generated in that version.  Sequence was basic crafting table, using great maple logs to make boards and used same to upgrade table. Any attempt to then re-enter the table interface generated the dump.   Not sure what I still had on the table as I can't get the interface.

I found out the problem. It's not related to a particular android version. If a phone call is on and you open the video call with open vidu and then you turn off the phone call, android doesn't set the output audio, so you can't ear the other user. On iOS this doesnt happen. 
The tuple is the instance of List. 
Cleaned at it worked fine, sorry about that.
all streams are affected. Only this happening with MI tv with pie edition. There is no effect on playback but that view AspectRatioFrameLayout resize modes are not working at all.
Take as an example:  `COPY schemaname.tablename FROM 's3://bucketname/filepath' CREDENTIALS 'aws_access_key_id=ZZZZZ;aws_secret_access_key=bbbbb' GZIP;` 
I've usualy just ran the jar file, i can try that later when i play a comp Tried it in a custom map and it appeared to work fine, it does detect the game closing but discord still shows as i'm in menu "CSGO not detected. Shutting down RPC."
Thank you! I just upgraded on Google Play and I am back in business (if geocaching can be considered "work"). 
@vreixo Great, thanks! 
Yes, it is working for standalone tables.  Curious what information the driver would provide that makes a difference.
Turned off all trackers in Settings and this still occurs.
in my shell , I try to generate jimple files under SOOT default output dir. 
Thanks for having a look. So the seed has nothing to do here (and yes I change it for every training), when I said "between run" I meant between epochs = a play until reset() state. And even with the changed configuration the actions taken by the net are very similar from one epoch to another. It could make sense after many epochs, but it doesn't in the beginning as we can expect A3C to randomly discover patterns, except here for example the first few actions have never been changed, even after 10k+ iterations.  So the first few epoch action sequences taken are: 10100110111110011 1010011011111001101 1010011011111001 ... and after 11k iterations: 1010011011101000100010100110111010011...0110111010011010 1010011011101000100010100100111010011...000111010011010 1010011010101001100010100110101010011...110101010011000  Notice how the first **9 actions ('101001101') have not changed a single time during all training**? Gut feeling tells me there's something wrong, either in the gym (the initial state is always the same so no need to change the initial pattern) or in the action discovery.  Otherwise with the tuning changes you suggested the NN now learns correctly:  <img width="1216" alt="screen shot 2017-11-17 at 11 18 13 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11771531/32932092-0e17004c-cb89-11e7-90ab-50def942e94a.png">

Rebuild the project and let's it restart by itself, then issue happens when Tomcat embedded in Spring Boot run is trying to deserialize the sessions.  But yes, with spring-boot:run  Also this has happened with all Java versions, including Corretto 11.0.3 I use currently.
Well, I meant technical (except stateless)

Same thing happened with the .lfa files. Where the file sizes were different, the files from the bagger transfer understandably did not work. Where they *were *the same, they did. I haven't done a systematic review of the files, but considerably more often than not, something, perhaps bagger, nicked off ~1-2% of each file. Bagger was the only thing knowingly added to the process.  Basically, rsync, then bagit.py worked fine, but using bagger to create a bag in destination was a disaster. I'm not ruling out that I might have made an error, but I'm reluctant to try it again. Do you have any pointers?  I attach screenshots of the following: -"get info" "general" metadata for each of the 3 main folders from the original drive ("Dance Forms App," "Merce DanceForms Files," and "mercecunningham") featuring each of the 3 versions, from top-to-bottom: original, rsync, bagger -"get info" "general" metadata for an .mov file in the same manner as above (original, rsync, bagger) -a screenshot of the results from the rsync transfer of the .mov file side-by-side with the failed bagger transfer -"get info" "general" metadata for an .lfa file in the same manner as above (original, rsync, bagger) -a screenshot of the original .lfa file (the rsync file looked the same) side-by-side with the failed bagger transfer  Best, Ben   On Fri, Jun 16, 2017 at 8:47 AM, John Scancella <notifications@github.com> wrote:  > Hi Ben, > > There is already a open issue regarding the file date modification (#16 > <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger/issues/16>). > > Does this still happen if you copy the files using rsync and then bag in > place using bagger?

Deleting `bazel-bin` and re-running the build (with 0.3.0 and of 0.3.0, since it was failing the same way with re-build of 0.3.0) worked, with some warnings:  ``` WARNING: failed to create one or more convenience symlinks for prefix 'bazel-':   cannot create symbolic link bazel-out -> C:/tools/msys64/var/tmp/Bazel/-kBpKhQY/execroot/bazel/bazel-out:  Command failed cmd.exe /c mklink /J "C:\tools\msys64\home\rok\bazel\bazel-out" "C:\tools\msys64\var\tmp\Bazel\-kBpKhQY\execroot\bazel\bazel-out"   cannot create symbolic link bazel-bazel -> C:/tools/msys64/var/tmp/Bazel/-kBpKhQY/execroot/bazel:  Command failed cmd.exe /c mklink /J "C:\tools\msys64\home\rok\bazel\bazel-bazel" "C:\tools\msys64\var\tmp\Bazel\-kBpKhQY\execroot\bazel"   cannot create symbolic link bazel-testlogs -> C:/tools/msys64/var/tmp/Bazel/-kBpKhQY/execroot/bazel/bazel-out/local_windows_msys64-fastbuild/testlogs:  Command failed cmd.exe /c mklink /J "C:\tools\msys64\home\rok\bazel\bazel-testlogs" "C:\tools\msys64\var\tmp\Bazel\-kBpKhQY\execroot\bazel\bazel-out\local_windows_msys64-fastbuild\testlogs"   cannot create symbolic link bazel-genfiles -> C:/tools/msys64/var/tmp/Bazel/-kBpKhQY/execroot/bazel/bazel-out/local_windows_msys64-fastbuild/genfiles:  Command failed cmd.exe /c mklink /J "C:\tools\msys64\home\rok\bazel\bazel-genfiles" "C:\tools\msys64\var\tmp\Bazel\-kBpKhQY\execroot\bazel\bazel-out\local_windows_msys64-fastbuild\genfiles".

> Isn't this the purpose of settings -> accounts -> files -> synchronisation  Not sure what you mean by that @tobiasKaminsky   I would expect stuff to be automatically synced, very aggressively to make sure I always have the latest versions. In my case for example this is about notes which need to be always up to date. 
What is the appropriate email to contact? And what should I send--fastq? vdjca? clna? clns?

Yes, it was another plugin. Thank you. Could you also look at [this](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/bentobox/issues/297) issue? Its really annoying and problematic, when players are not fully added to island :/
I doubt that I hit `F2`.  Almost nothing in the environment.  The code (that I had just selected for copy/paste):  ```r connect$fixupPackageHashes("packrat") ```  The `connect` object _may_ have been in the environment but cannot be sure. I was mostly using the IDE for editing and then running the code from a separate terminal using `Rscript`. I was debugging a `packrat` interaction with my code and wanted untainted R sessions.  The `connect` object was created by: `source("../path/to/connect.R")` and inside there, we:  ```r connect_buildHelpers <- function() {      fixupPackageHashes <- function(packratDir) { ... }     # ...     return (list(         # ...         fixupPackageHashes = fixupPackageHashes,         # ...     )) } connect <- connect_buildHelpers() ```
I'm using Motorola Moto G4, android version 7.0 (I veryrecently updated from Android 6, actually, probably the reason of the bug), English language
Refreshing the cache did not fix the problem. Did it twice. My java version is 1.8.0_51. Perhaps add more logging to help us troubleshoot? 
You can try with the example test: "Benvenuto nel mondo della sintesi vocale."  Without a dot it works, but when dot is present an exception is thrown. 
@JakeWharton  I edited it to 2.5 after the first post. 
@ryanjbaxter I didn't try and find out the code but simply putting a breakpoint in the class with before and after upgrade showed that the default values are picked up afterwards. I suppose it won't be terribly difficult to create a project to demonstrate this issue. Do you've any integration tests that test this feature?
For the record: This seems to be the cause for `fjage.js` failing after network disconnection at times, while the shell websocket seems to be fine.
Thank you for your prompt response!!!   I've installed the JAR you sent me and I've found what was the error.  The problem was that in my item definition:  `String Arduino_TCP_rcv "ArduinoUDP [%s]" {udp="<[*:8888:'']"}` 8888 is the destination port  where arduinos send the info, sourceport  is a random port that changes everytime. Reading the new log files I've realized with the lastg message that what the binding expects there is the source port, not the destination port. So I've changed  the item to:   `String Arduino_TCP_rcv "ArduinoUDP [%s]" {udp="<[*:*:'']"}` and now it works!!   Thank's for your help.   One "cosmetic" thing. If I use display in the laraf console, I get the log like it's copied below, but if i go to /var/log/openhab2/openhab.log, there are a lot of ^@^@^@^@^@^ between "Cocina ^@^@^@^@^@^ on the listener"... like if it was an StringBuffer no emptied.

We are using the version 4.3.0 of Bitbucket Server.
My workaround was to run it on JDK 1.8.0_152 :) Was easy to me, maybe not so free on every platform, though.
both sender and received just have one account 
@KingIdee Sounds good. Create a new issue with the tasks that you're going to do. Then create a branch with your changes. We'll review the PR and help out whenever you need it.  Need anything right now?
Yeah, not able to load the content  editor without restarting dbeaver. The NPE above is the only thing I see when attempting to reopen.  (I've switched back to 4.3.0 as I haven't seen this on that version, we'll see what happens). Feel free to close if you think it's an eclipse issue. :)

@tobiasKaminsky The pre-existing auto upload folders can be changed from Instant Upload to something else, but the auto-upload folder connections themselves can not themselves be deleted, and when I reinstall they revert back to be set to Instant Upload (I believe this last part is correct, I need to reinstall to double check but I'm currently traveling so haven't had time to check. I can soon though, perhaps tonight).   Also there are some folders that it it trying to sync such as "reddit_sync" (which is from a reddit client app called Reddit Sync which I have uninstalled and deleted all trace of on my phone.) As no new images are ever going to be placed inside the reddit sync folder again (because the app has been uninstalled and won't be reinstalled), NextCloud Android Client will never recreate the reddit_sync folder (as it did with the Screenshots folder in Instant Upload after I took some screenshots) but it's still junking up my list of autoupload folder connections. 
Hi, sorry for the long delay. I didn't find time to work on my project or yours in the last weeks. Glad you could reproduce the crash.  
[RosieTest.zip](https://github.com/Karumi/Rosie/files/1943013/RosieTest.zip)  I isolated a base Rosie project and seems to work, so should be a problem with my legacy project... I'll continue to investigate.  Thanks
I have updated master to use guava 20.0 and made sure it was compatible.  I have also made sure it was compatible back to guava 15.0, with most functionality (no IPv6) working with 14.0.  Guava 21.0 is only Java8 compatible, so I opened up a new ticket #211 for adding java 8 functionality, but figure that is a little out of scope for a 2.0.0 release which is long overdue.
I didn't see any logs in the remote worker, and I suspect it's something going wrong in the network layer. My assumption is that the real log messages (like "can't resolve host" or "connection refused") are being swallowed, and replaced by the error about exceeding number of retries.  I think the MacOS comment in `remote_execution_test.sh` is unrelated, since I'm not trying to use any XCode features (it's just plain C++).
Well, i checked out the ftb wiki and it says that the version that im using is "rv2.stable build 1" i dont know if says alot but yeah... i have the newest version feed the beast client.  Maybe i should mention that im using a stirling engine from Ender IO to power the ME controller, maybe that is the issue?  Thanks for answering! :) 
They are all there when you open the schematic but when you print, it prints everything around them but not the conduits themselves. If I turn off the schematic then all that's left are spaces. So it's replaced by space. Same thing for AE2 cables. Should they be rendering?
@cpfeiffer Thx for the quick reply!  It's a guess that debug logging doesnt't work because of the same reason, but since it's trying to write to the same location it seems logical that it's the cause. The directory exists, owned by `root:sd_card` with permissions 775.

This is what I see in Protege 5.5, on a different class (I have only access to an older version of SNOMED-CT, which does not have the class you show in your screen shot)  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2441046/58206156-08231900-7c95-11e9-92a7-7bce9662742b.png)  This looks good to me.  @rwynne can you confirm that this is still an issue in Protege 5.5?
Well my issue is that the controller doesn't seem to have broken state. The weirdest thing being the "connection order" thing which made the system behave correctly when it's the p2p on the drive which is connected first. Also, I've notice a huge lag when loading the chunk and some drive showed visual glitch:  ![2015-03-29_18 48 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10573494/6886632/505629c0-d644-11e4-9c99-e6cf43bbaedf.png)  Here's my view (the ticking is regular (just missing frame at 60fps) and the weird shader is because of my recorder):  ![my view](http://i.imgur.com/XumEjcq.gif)

So, "reinstall" in that context means at the end "installation of all orbit bundles."  However, the plugin is installed but not working, and I have no more error messages. That is a little bit unusual.
5.0.23
Yes I need only property.  I tried updating che.env for adding one custom property but still I was not able to inject that property in ws agent code. May be I did something wrong. Can you describe how to achieve this?
Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
Now it works. Thanks. 
I pulled the lasted commits from the master branch, so I'm guessing 1.2.7.  
@chkal with the last snapshot it works, thanks for the fast help
You are right. After manually invoking sentry-cli same result - `error: The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid. (os error 1006)`  Maybe any option from my ProGuard is the reason? > -dontusemixedcaseclassnames -dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses -dontskipnonpubliclibraryclassmembers -verbose -dontobfuscate -dontoptimize -dontpreverify 
Try to save as much as possible whenever something changes.
4.4.1.158 
|o|,,,it works now! You are right, I use  `Drawable backgroundDrawable = VectorDrawableCompat.create(getResources(), background, null);`  But also need this in activity `static {     AppCompatDelegate.setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled(true); }` or this way `Drawable drawable = AppCompatResources.getDrawable(mContext, mImageTitleResId);` I have not tried this  Do you want me to commit and review by you?
No
Yea sure.  Thats what I do: 1. Load into Minecraft 1.12.2 Singleplayer /Multiplayer (none works) 2. Set two positions (/minebuild pos1 ; pos2 ) 3. Use command (/minebuild reverse test.txt) 4. Minecraft Crashes  5. Restart Minecraft and load into same world 6. "[Minebot] Output written to: C:\Users\.......\.minecraft\minebot\build\test.txt"  7.

I tried to extract something I could post, but failed. Then I removed the affected folder from my workspace and re-added - and, presto, no problem any more.
@garagatyi I'm using Oracle, and @TylerJewell  running the shortcut to start the server.  @eivantsov how do i copy and share logs 
Nope, it was all on 7594. I was testing it due to the calc being fixed. I'm back to 7378 again.
I downloaded and exploded the linked nightly. I started my default docker-machine. I used `bin/che.sh start` UI came up. I attempted to create a project (and workspace) to test this and it is stuck on Creating Workspace. Nothing interesting in `catalina.out`. I restarted che with the same result.  I deleted my default docker-machine and attempted to `bin/che.sh run`. Still stuck on "Creating workspace". If I run `docker ps` or `docker images` I now see nothing. So it appears that the workspace image is not getting pulled. `docker version` correctly provides information about my client and server versions, so I assume my environment is setup correctly. I just ran `docker run hello-world` from the same shell I'm running che commands from and I got the appropriate output.  Aside: It would help to know if there was a less destructive way of resetting things, I might have containers in my default machine I don't want to just wipe out. 
Basically, RED plug-in is working fine. It just throws the syntax exception.

@edmundoa Thanks for the help!  I'm a bit confused by your first paragraph (first day is still Jan 1 for me, because there should be no Dec 31 logs at all and all these timestamps are ingested explicitly). But if I understand you correctly, it doesn't matter and yes, you are right! Switching minute resolution does not show any time shift in the histogram unlike the day resolution, so this really seems to be exactly #1830. I completely missed this issue when looking up past ones.  
Both private and woogerworks, no logs also. My friend had the same problem today, saturday everything was fine

Hey @taban03 - it's been a little while since I tried, but I think that's exactly what happened.
I guess you're lucky ;-) Since Vertx-core is an Eclipse project, we do not need a CQ in order to use it. The question is more: do we want to rely on a beta version. What's your take on this?

ok I have updated to the final version of mapstruct thanks. But the compiler Warning still persists. I have taken the lombok mapstruct example from github to reproduce the compiler error (https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct-examples/tree/master/mapstruct-lombok) ok this is the mapper Inteface: ```java @Mapper @DecoratedWith(ConverterDecorator.class) public interface Converter {      Converter INSTANCE = Mappers.getMapper(Converter.class);      @Mapping(source = "test1",target = "test2")     Model fromDto(Dto dto);      @Mapping(source = "test2",target = "test1")     Dto toDto(Model model); } ``` And this the ConverterDecorator: ```java public abstract class ConverterDecorator implements Converter {      private final Converter delegate;      public ConverterDecorator(Converter delegate){         this.delegate = delegate;     };      @Override     public Model fromDto(Dto dto) {         //do something before or after mapping         return delegate.fromDto(dto);     }      @Override     public Dto toDto(Model model) {         //do something before or after mapping         return delegate.toDto(model);     } } ``` With the plugin installed the ConverterDecorator class has a red underline saying "@Mapper or @MapperConfig annotation is missing"  I use the latest IntelliJ 2018.3.4
@dhirajsb @rhuss I've rebuild the server without those 2 `app, type` and it metrics finally appeared. Only `app` label seems to be not enough. Probably  a bit of fiddling in prometheus config should do it, but I'm really lost in that one.     
A feature which seems to have been added about a year ago allows for multiple devices to be open in the same test (not a parallel test) such as for sending SMS or calling each other. This feature is very helpful for our needs however when upgrading to qaf 2.1.13 the null pointer exception above occurs on the teardown as soon as it is done tearring down the first device driver  Below are the versions I am using: <qaf.version>2.1.13</qaf.version> <qafsupport.version>2.1.13</qafsupport.version> <quantum.version>1.14</quantum.version>

The JASPIC code/jar is copied to the glassfish/lib folder and registered as a MessageSecurity through the admin console. Instructions taken from here: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-authenticroast/ (see section container configuration).  The actual JASPIC code that is deployed deployed is here: https://github.com/ratcashdev/authenticroast You'll have to compile it yourself. Make sure to copy both the API and the IMPL jars. The app through which I test: https://github.com/ratcashdev/JSR196OAuthLogin (has a dependency on the API)  Try to change the SampleOAuth.java class while it's deployed 2-3 times, and do  GET /api/test/secure/oauth  with the header: Authorization: BEARER mytoken  BTW: Is there a more straightforward way to register the JASPIC code without messing inside the admin console?

"This defect is quite old, but I was not able to deterministically reproduce this error. It does not seem to happen always, right? Do you know how to reproduce it?" I can always reproduce it. Just zoom in. Seems to only affect alternatives what is qute stange as or-groups should have a similar implementation.  The mandatory and optional dots semm always to get cut a bit. 
Brilliant! Thanks for the quick turn around
Yes I did that twice and nothing showed up...
just added it a second ago! :D  it's Paper-"b7dc6fb0" (MC: 1.14.4) (Implementing API version 1.14.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT)

An example would be the (overworld) ores from Thaumcraft for which I enabled UBifying for Amber and Quartz ore and was a bit surprised about the missing alpha blending. <details>    <summary>The overlay textures with partial transparency</summary>    ![ore_amber](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3805624/52109619-6781ee00-25fe-11e9-8748-dc73bf86d320.png)  ![ore_quartz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3805624/52109620-6781ee00-25fe-11e9-8d82-d259630744df.png)  </details> I've cut out the non-opaque parts for now, but would like to put them back in :-)   For the sake of clarity though I should mention that I'm not entirely sure if alpha-blending is actually missing or if I just badly misjudged the overlay's appearance ingame^^  
no I have a folder "com" and a folder "theprophet31337" inside the folder "com" 
I run the test with this:  ``` java     @Test     public void testLocalExecutorWithWordCount() {         try {             // set up the files             File inFile = new File("/tmp/myfile.json");             File outFile = File.createTempFile("wctext", ".out");              // run WordCount             WordCount wc = new WordCount();             final String inParam = "file://" + inFile.getAbsolutePath();             final String outParam = "file://" + outFile.getAbsolutePath();              //2 threads per CPU             LocalExecutor.execute(wc, "16", inParam, outParam);         } catch (Exception e) {             e.printStackTrace();             Assert.fail(e.getMessage());         }      } ``` 
I used the KMLViewer.java example to import, exception text attached.  [Exception.txt](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/files/604472/Exception.txt) 
It says it is an NullPointerException, but then its an obfuscated class name in my package namespace.  "Attempt to read from field 'com.me.kG com.me.lj.ᐝ' on a null object reference"
I think it was a glitch. Working fine now.
@arunkumar9t2 This page is a good sample: https://github.com/arunkumar9t2/chromer/issues/58
Netty. I'm pretty sure it was page not found, when i logged requests comming it was recognized as: `/x/y/z` in CR6 it was treated as single parameter when i used url encoding. I will edit this post and add some logs in about 8-10 hours.  Star given, great job :) 
Exactly !  I have about 5 minutes  and I see that all containers are started.  I get two messages the first is **502 Bad Gateway**  and the second is  **Cannot GET /(.*)**  
@zackm0571 I've managed to reproduce this by modifying the Quickstart example with some code from the ScreenCapturer example. I've got it on a branch of this repo. I don't have permissions to push to the remote so I've just zipped up the modified VideoActivity.java file.   [VideoActivity.java.zip](https://github.com/twilio/video-quickstart-android/files/2388718/VideoActivity.java.zip)  To reproduce with this code: After accepting the screen share permission, two devices can connect to the same room in the same way as the standard quickstart and their screens will be shown to each other. One device can then turn off sending their screen by tapping the Video floating action button so one device is just viewing the other screen. The bug is illustrated if both devices then rotate to landscape and you can see that the transmitted screen contents are only a small slice within the video.  Let me know if it's not clear! Cheers 
Same thing as before. Your repo seems to be returning error 500 for all of the dependencies.  Perhaps I am doing something wrong, I have included the full build log if it helps.  http://pastebin.com/PsTkAbHt

The phone has not been changed.  After posting my question I realized a possible change that might be affecting the situation: The patient started wearing a Garmin vivofit2 BLE wrist worn device that has an app installed on the phone. Can the phone not handle two bt devices?  or is xDrip somehow assuming it will be the only one?  When I try to install xDrip+ (xDrip-plus-20161124-9bf0276.apk) it states "App not installed".

exactly, and will do. Just let me start Minecraft from scratch so the log isn't quite as massive XD. this was on a server I set up, but I expect it'll also happen in single player, unless SpongeForge is causing an issue somehow. If I can't get it to happen in singleplayer, I'll also give you the server log, obviously
@shoebkhan09 check for null.
I am using 1.4 (as it seemed to me (from the description) thats the best stable version) 
7.1.3 on Android and 7.0.2 on iOS :P
Thank you @pveentjer, will try. Hope new official release will be ready soon too.

Mhhh, I have a shared webhoster **without** HTTPS but use the password function from Selfoss. How can I add username/password without select "Require authentication"? The app crash on every start. I must delete the account, to get it run again. 
I have update the issue detail and some device with problem and without problem.
At least, we don't have such problem on https://nightly-onprem.codenvy-stg.com.  @skryzhny: could you, please, write: - size of memory which regular user have on https://nightly.codenvy-stg.com compare to https://nightly-onprem.codenvy-stg.com? - number of workspaces which user is allowed to create / to run on https://nightly.codenvy-stg.com compare to https://nightly-onprem.codenvy-stg.com?
Sorry for late reply 1. its OK that the Slots are not Item Specific but for Farm Automation with AE2 or this mod i like to set the slots to a Specific item like the Hoe or a Axe to auto pipe new Tools into the Slots so that not two Tools of the Same type can be in the Farm. 2. Consume Stacks means that in the Left set of Slots 1 Item not Planted to create a Placeholder for this Plant... 3. Your Farm current Pickup all Plants and stores them first in the Left set Slots for Planting so the Farm fills itself with the Farmed Potato's or Carrots. Thats OK but the Farm can only Export from the Right set of Slots. I think that the Handling of the Pickup needs a configuration (Ingame/Configfile) to make the Default Location for of Harvested Plants the Right or the Left set of Slots...  MfG PpVolto 
I wouldn't mind it. I'm thinking about getting rid of the fossils mod because I already have JurrasiCraft, which works just fine with Jewelrycraft just fine. I can also message them to see if they can make it more compatible with your mod too. 
Its on a large multiplayer server, I don't know how to reproduce it.  Here is another one -   https://gist.github.com/ProsperCraft/b9008f98a4beef3422ffdd7a245e4912
@cpfeiffer Thx for the quick reply!  It's a guess that debug logging doesnt't work because of the same reason, but since it's trying to write to the same location it seems logical that it's the cause. The directory exists, owned by `root:sd_card` with permissions 775.

I just put the setting "Disable all sound effects" to No and a get all .wav effects failed to load. Putting on Yes it don't happen maybe it's my Linux sound driver  
I can not even assign a name to a flow, not sure if it is what we wanted.

I had been using prestisssimo, but i clicked the new setting and switched it to sonic.  the most current episode, episode 4.5, would not play.  I also tried 4.3 and 4.4 just now and both have the same problem.  I can open these files without a problem on  vlc on my phone. 
Let's talk about this in the next triage meeting (for priority). I'm also not keen on adding a bunch of Fennec files. :)
Sorry, for not mentioning that this is from JabRef to LibreOffice Writer (version 5.0.5.2), so there is no .tex file. I can whip up a .bib file if that would be helpful, however.  By "in-text citation," I mean the writing signifying that a work has been cited that appears in the body of a document. So if this were part of a journal article that I used JabRef (Team 2015) to help me create a bibliography for, the in-text citation would be "(Team 2015)". [Though ideally it should be "(JabRef Development Team 2015)".] 
I don't know whether they ever worked locally, but yes I am using VirtualBox. I'd like the tests to be resilient for that, or be skipped explicitly in my environment if that's by design - help me with it? 
Dumb question: how do I get the logs? 
Will look for it and see if I can do it on my machine. SOmeone showed it to me. 
Well, after I wrote that report we figured out that there was a 'ghost' shell storage. We put down a shell storage and then broke it, got kicked again but the ghost block was gone and the treadmills attached fine. So far, we haven't been able to replicate it.  
Mmmm ok thank you Eclipse. I don't see what is wrong with my workspace but I can reinstall it from scratch for the Nth times... or used a stable binary version?

I just follow the recommended steps . `$ git clone git@github.com:ReactiveX/RxJava.git` `$ cd RxJava/` `$ ./gradlew build` and it generated three .jar files under /build/libs build/libs/rxjava-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar build/libs/rxjava-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar build/libs/rxjava-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar but 2 tests failed
Nope that was crashing on 1.12.2 beta 1 
Ah. That explains it.
I use MviActivity and didn't try to reproduce in the sample applicaiton, because only `ProductDetailsActivity` extends `MviActivity` and it doesn't use `unbindIntents` method.  I've just tested with clean project with classes listed below and when I leave the app, go back to the app few times, logcat shows only one `bindIntents` and many `unbindIntents`.  **MainActivity.java** ``` public class MainActivity extends MviActivity<MainView, MainPresenter> {     @Override     protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);         setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);     }      @NonNull     @Override     public MainPresenter createPresenter() {         return new MainPresenter();     } } ```  **MainPresenter.java** ``` public class MainPresenter extends MviBasePresenter<MainView, MainView.ViewState> {     @Override     protected void bindIntents() {         Log.d("MainPresenter", "bindIntents");     }      @Override     protected void unbindIntents() {         Log.d("MainPresenter", "unbindIntents");     } } ```  **MainView.java** ``` interface MainView extends MvpView {     class ViewState {     } } ```
I don't have permission plugin in my login server.
I've tried to run the test case 0001A (it can be run in PROD) in: - Cerberus QA -> VCItemMgt QA, UAT and PROD - Cerberus PROD -> VCItemMgt QA, UAT and PROD   The behaviour is exactly the same; cannot run the test case; still critical 
Hi,  I still dont know... As from the beggining, using the alternative player or the old one worked for me...  According to Google :-) my board is am805w with mali450 graphics https://androidtvbox.eu/x96-mini-android-tv-box-powered-amlogic-s905w-chipset-now-24-99-promo/  So i Never investigate on this. Maybe i am wrong, i didn't found a resize feature? The video appears like a small windows (i am not in windows mode...) without border on the center right side of a black screen. Maybe you can guide me to send you debug logs, etc...? I would be more than Happy. But since the old player feature is going to disappear, maybe juste allowing playlist to be all played with the alternative player would be a simple solution for those like me...? I can't tell about how much people encounter that 'bug'.... Regards, Fred
I though so too but the guys at TE said it was BC bug https://github.com/CoFH/Feedback/issues/338

If i use Java 1.8.0_144 and Project Language Level 8, then i get a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` Exception, because my runtime tries to call the method `java.nio.ShortBuffer.flip()`, which does not exist under java 8 and should be `java.nio.Buffer.flip()`.
I always cycle through options. Long press method does not appear to reproduce it. However, now that you mentioned it, I tried going to one option after an other. So the "Random" option appears to be casuing the issue. I did the long press->Random. Then long press -> Back to no repeat. Causing the same behaviour. 
If my application doesn't have enough memory, JRE throw OutOfMemory while processing stack.add(commandToUse);  Thank you.
Still fails for me. 
Unfortunately I wasn't able to reproduce this exception after I restarted Eclipse. Therefore I'm unable to test whether it is fixed. 
Oh yes, v0.2-2 did indeed fix this. Thanks :)

I worked around it by simply entering my server’s (thankfully static) IP address. 
Yes, here's the situation, I have a timeline, which has multiple songs and with empty gaps between them, these gaps can be at the start and end as well. for that, I use ConcatenatingMediaSoruce with ClippingMediaSource for songs and SilenceMediaSource for gaps. Here's a representation of a simple timeline:  **-song-song-song-** **-**: SilenceMediaSource **song**: ClippingMediaSource with ProgressiveMediaSource  The issue is when readData happens, the byteRemaining is a negative value which shouldn't be the case, here's a debug screenshot up until the hightlighted line that produces the error: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10184170/61947147-bc4a6400-afa4-11e9-84f8-b4ef567cf3d5.png)  This issue is that everytime I recreate the ConcatenatingMediaSoruce, even with the same values, with the same SilenceMediaSource durations and start positions for SilenceMediaSource and ClippingMediaSource. I sometimes get the error and sometime not. I tested with fixed constant values and recreated the ConcatenatingMediaSoruce again and again, it's like a hit and miss, works a couple of times, then error, then works again, then error again...  I'm sorry as it's hard to explain because I ran a couple of tests already and I can't seem to track down the exact source of the issue.   
Hi @oliexdev, thank you for taking time to fix this issue. I was evaluating my automated GUI testing tool on a set of well-maintained open source apps, and this app is one of them.
I'm using IOS 13.1.3
Looks good, I have verified the code in my test project.  Related, how can one change the status code? For example, I guessed that one could add `endpoints.health.DOWN=500` to the `application.properties` file if a 500 response is preferred instead of the 503 (or a 200 if one would revert to the current behavior) but that does not seem to work? 
ZAP is 2.5.0 Selenium is 5 
Looks like Jetty 9.4.12.
The big ints are random 128-bit wide. I'm now trying to commit and compact every 10 million, but the compact and commit are scaling linearly, is this expected? 
I made a collection of examples in the main folder, with a bunch of files from `guava` 
Yes, I delete the platform complete, also the plugin. After that i reinstall the Plugin with: <pre> ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio npm install --save @ionic-native/fingerprint-aio@4 </pre>  And readd the Platform with: <pre> ionic cordova platform add android@8.1.0 </pre>  If i try it in an new ionic 3 Project, the Build Process works. Dont know why.
Hello!  I Will send it later, when I will have access to PC
Thanks for looking into this @adamretter. I've given it a try with https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/pull/1864, which does indeed reduce the amount of information in the logs, but does not fix the problem.   > This is actually not really a problem, and you can safely ignore it for now. I think the logging is too severe here, rather than ERROR, it should be WARN level at the most. I will send a change to fix that.  Perhaps I hadn't stated clearly enough in my original report that the problem isn't just the logging, but the fact that retrieval of the binary files with `http:send-request()` actually fails with the same error message.  After your commit, behaviour remains the same: in eXide, a first call to `http:send-request(<http:request href="http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/resources/images/app.gif" method="get"/>)` succeeds, but subsequent calls fail with the "exerr:ERROR Unable to add binary value to result" error.  ![2018-05-10 13_57_45-exide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/223134/39868661-de4a3de2-545a-11e8-8319-722724f86cc5.png)  In `exist.log`, logging now is reduced to:      2018-05-10 13:57:08,412 [qtp1980097967-53] WARN  (TemporaryFileManager.java [returnTemporaryFile]:108) - Unable to delete temporary file: C:\Users\RON~1.KAN\AppData\Local\Temp\_mmtfm_693a8863-3a27-4796-87c2-313e078f4ef52135163101174793632\mmtf_15259534218951031901657529973713.tmp due to: C:\Users\RON~1.KAN\AppData\Local\Temp\_mmtfm_693a8863-3a27-4796-87c2-313e078f4ef52135163101174793632\mmtf_15259534218951031901657529973713.tmp: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

I am using Marshmallow in my mobile device so it has to be a case for <N as well. No idea how it will work on pre-Marshmallow devices.
No problem, it's not a critical issue for me - just wanted to make you aware of it.  I have a LG G3 d855 with CM 13 nightly 2016-02-05. Strangely it didn't happen the last 2-3 days, so it looks like even I can't reproduce it reliably any more. Afaik Doze Mode shouldn't even activate when the device is plugged in, so maybe this is an Android/CM/device bug.  I'll experiment the next few days with [Testing your app with Doze](http://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#testing_doze), maybe something comes up. I just tried it for a few minutes - the alarm was ignored when idle (as expected?), but logging resumed once the device came out of idle.  Let me know if I can help you in any other way. 
@xLaMbChOpSx, thanks for assisting. I completely re-flashed my ROM from scratch without AIMSICD installed and.. faced the same issue. I figured that AIMSICD **cannot** be the cause at all and traced down the Issue to be related to [Aptoide](http://www.aptoide.com/). Within the logs I discovered that the package installer could not find an identifier - I guess Aptoide removed it or something and thus my phone refused letting me press the install button. **All good now, issue solved and world saved.** Thank you for reviewing my logcat. ;-) 
Both singleplayer and multiplayer, using latest version from curse.  
@dariuszseweryn   Unfortunately, adding ```synchronized``` to ```onCompleted()``` and ```onError()``` does not prevent the queue hanging.
I tried it on top of aff46bc2f0e59cb9b59f6db982ddd490cf1d2b3c and it still fails. Also, I think my proposed test from above is flaky in some way... 
Here is an example: ```java HttpServer httpServer = createHttpServer(); httpServer.requestHandler(mainRouter); httpServer.connectionHandler(connection -> {     if (connectionCount > connectionLimit) {         connection.close();     } }); ``` We expect the requestHandler not to handle the request if the connection closed. But it will still handle the request. Any good idea to deal with that?
Hi,  My apologies. I've only had 1 coffee today :-)  OK, here is a more detailed description with screenshots.  I think I've narrowed it down to Syncthing stopping when I tick "Only sync on wi-fi".  Attached are 4 screenshots showing the error, the fact that the notification icon should be shown all the time, the options I have chosen, and then what happens when I choose "Only sync on wi-fi."  As you can see, I am connected to my wi-fi, and it works.  Over to you... 
How can I get and use fixed version? 
Hi Harald,  Thanks for the quick response!  I have tested it with the IdentificationParametersCLI using the new versions (only commandline options but without using the template .par as before) and it looks good (but not 100% the same as tutorial):  Using IdentificationParametersCLI: java -cp SearchGUI-2.8.5.jar eu.isas.searchgui.cmd.IdentificationParametersCLI \ -out                 ${output_folder}"/identification.par" \ -db                  ${fasta_file%.fasta}"_concatenated_target_decoy.fasta" \ -prec_tol         '10' \ -prec_ppm       '1' \ -frag_tol           '0.02' \ -frag_ppm        '0' \ -enzyme           'Trypsin'   \ -fixed_mods          "Carbamidomethylation of C" \ -variable_mods       "Oxidation of M" \ -min_charge          '2' \ -max_charge          '4' \ -mc                  '2' \ -fi                  'b' \ -ri                  'y'  ![screenshot 2016-05-04 12 34 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10395695/15011886/9ce20646-11f4-11e6-8578-553720bf822d.png) [identification.par.txt](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker/files/248584/identification.par.txt)  With SearchGUI generated .par: ![screenshot 2016-05-04 11 29 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10395695/15010329/bb0ea786-11eb-11e6-9556-ea014c94487d.png) [newsearch.par.txt](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker/files/248490/newsearch.par.txt)  With example .par: ![screenshot 2016-05-04 12 38 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10395695/15011961/27f6b59c-11f5-11e6-9533-50bbfaa57207.png)  [Tutorial-April-2016.par.txt](https://github.com/compomics/peptide-shaker/files/248595/Tutorial-April-2016.par.txt)  The difference in total id's and confident assignments between the CLI and SearchGUI,are very slightly different. Both differ from the results using the .par provided in the tutorial (same basic settings). Do you recommend using the CLI as I did now without a template or to modify the template from the tutorial? I am primarily working on the command line.    Thanks! Thys 
I stored the file in the root of the vault. So its like _"S:\1111111111111111111langer [...].txt"_ `Len=213` The vault itsself is located in _"d:\test.cryptomator"_. `Len=230` I tested such a file in a longer (non vault) folder name _"d:\test.noch laenger als crypromator"_ and it works. I guess its not 255 limit.

There are several ways of making it noticable: - Spawn a block and notice that it is way too small. - Connecting blocks, making the arguments change text and thus length - Carefully move the knot to the point (frame) where its index changes and the arguments aswell, in most cases the arguments are now larger then the block. (but if you keep moving it resizes sort of correctly again, this one is really precise.) - Everything where the total argument length suddenly changes. 
Sure, what shall be fixed? Documentation or Placeholder Prefix?
I just put the .jar and started the server, there was no prior config file, everything was generated as if I had just put the plugin for the first time.
Hello,  They are the same on all servers though... https://pastebin.com/RzEUNC9g  
Here's an example https://gist.github.com/holgerbrandl/4517fed2594e38945d0951958744ce6e  To reproduce 1. Open the document and move the caret to the very end ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200952/52149912-9df75180-266e-11e9-9555-1c537d2b53ff.png)  2. Double click on `Foo` in the structure view. The editor scrolls and puts the caret at the right place, but the preview does not update ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200952/52149992-db5bdf00-266e-11e9-8b7c-90744b6868f0.png)  Typically I use the simplified structure view, but it's the same there.  When doing so I just click on header elements in the structure view.  I've noticed that there is one exception: When (using the non-simplified struture and) clicking on _Unordered Lists_ and _Ordered Lists_ it updates caret **AND** preview!   My version is ``` IntelliJ IDEA 2018.3.4 (Ultimate Edition) Build #IU-183.5429.30, built on January 29, 2019 JRE: 1.8.0_152-release-1343-b26 amd64 JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o Windows 10 10.0 ```  and MD Navigator is on v2.7.0.  
I delayed doing manual sync. I feel like manual sy down/up would put them back into sync... I have three clients: laptop, work and home... On home, daemon was started by syncany gui which was unresponsive to restart, so I did a sy daemon force-stop and sy daemon start.  After a full night, home is still out of sync. I know because there were files added yesterday at work. Of course, work may be having issues, too. 
I tested with a astro thing type.
@fmontesi @mwallnoefer That is good for me i will commit this afternoon on my branch 
Thanks @syntrydy - Thought It has something to do with logout button.
Jackson version 2.7.6 (used by Dropwizard 1.0.0).  I can see that work around code in Katharsis for Jackson 2.7 AnnotatedClass builder is being called, but still unless Katharsis itself compiled with 2.7 Jackson it was crashing. Also, at least for me it required to delete Katharsis target folder  in order for this bug to appear  once I started to switch between 2.7 & 2.6.

Hi Michi, I tried to isolate the issue and found out that it is not because of multiple clients. Even when I run single ycsb client to load my Cassandra cluster I am facing the same issue.  If for example i give a insertstart=0 and insertcount=58823529 it is performing only 58823500 operations.

Okay you can close this (or should I? not sure how this works)
Hi,   no, the widget does not show any task at all. I delete the widget, readd, and works again for a while.  On 2016-02-12 12:21, benedetto wrote:  > The widget does only show tasks that are currently active, i.e. that have no start date or a start date that lies in the past, but no tasks with a start date in the future. In the app itself, all tasks are shown independent of their status. Does this correspond to your situation?  >  > ##  >  > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub [1].  ## Links:  [1] https://github.com/dmfs/opentasks/issues/202#issuecomment-183284030 
Hi jbax, i was testing very normal case:  file1.csv --------------- a,b,c d,e,f ____________________ file2.csv --------------- a|b|c d|e|f _____________________ Java code: ---------------         `List<String[]> allRows = new ArrayList<>();         CsvParserSettings settings = new CsvParserSettings();                  settings.setDelimiterDetectionEnabled(true);         settings.setQuoteDetectionEnabled(true);          CsvParser parser = new CsvParser(settings);         // print format before parse         System.out.println(settings.getFormat());         try {             allRows = parser.parseAll(new FileInputStream("D:/file2.csv"));             //print format after parse             System.out.println(parser.getDetectedFormat());         } catch (Exception e) {             System.out.println(e);         }` Result If i using file1.csv (delimiter comma), everthing file If i using file2.csv (delimiter pipe), the output is wrong, and CSVFormat still showing delimiter=, (comma). So version 2.5.2 cannot detect delimiter. THe old version 2.1.1 does not have this problem . 
@deathbeam Yes, vanilla discord on the stable build. I would have included it in the screenshot if possible, but yes show running game is enabled and the screenshot shows that it is enabled on runelite as well.
I've installed yesterday 1.157.0  PyCharm 2019.2.5 (Professional Edition) Build #PY-192.7142.56, built on November 19, 2019  
Hi Stefan,  The /apps/example/tests folder is created with the correct jcr:primaryType - 'cq:ClientLibraryFolder'.  Thanks, Naveen 
@allek5 Well I just "hacked" the code in AuthState there is the method "getClientSecret" and at line 632 there is the method getClientAuthentication() which takes the clientsecret (if any) and acts like that 
Thanks for the speedy response. We are using Oracle JDK v1.7.0_80 with Seam 2.2.2.Final. I can't see anything strange in the JBoss config so I'll try and reproduce in a Vagrant box with a fresh copy and one of the Seam examples. I'll let you know how I get on. 
I can't reproduce it either on my desktop, so maybe this is some cache issue on my laptop.
@orhanobut same as @glocci here
Yes I did. non results.  I cant understand why not?. because fragments get destroyed and recreated each time. 
Hi @aurelhubert, thanks for your response.  I'm working with android N Preview 1 (Nexus 6) and android 4.4.4 Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Both have the problem.   My implementation is in the next link.  [http://pastebin.com/L3g2VfQF](url)  I try with the example code too and y have the same problem. 
Seems to be impersonation issue. I was able to resolve the issue by adding these to my `alluxio.properties`   ```   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.hostname "${master}"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.journal.type "UFS"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.mount.table.root.ufs "${root_ufs_uri}"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.hive.users "*"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.presto.users "*"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.yarn.users "*"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.hadoop.users "*"    append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.root.users "*"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.root.groups "*"   append_alluxio_property  alluxio.master.security.impersonation.client.users "*"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.master.security.impersonation.client.groups "*"   append_alluxio_property alluxio.security.login.impersonation.username none   append_alluxio_property alluxio.security.authorization.permission.enabled false ```
thanks
yes, I have already build the libbridge.so, and put it into the bin directary
No man. Thanks for creating this awesome library.  What i mean is that, the FAB always requires 4 options in order not to look distorted
As we're talking about e. g. "visited waypoints" the caches *have* to be saved offline, right? ;)
It happens every time. I just reproduced it on the current develop branch using Windows and Eclipse Proton. But it happened to everyone in the team project with Linux and Oxygen.   ![missing_connection_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/47085653-8e671080-d217-11e8-809c-9ba58c0e9b14.png)  ![missing_connection_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32126695/47085656-9030d400-d217-11e8-9a62-9144a87755e8.png)  There should be a connection between NewFeature1 and Priorities.
Still the same problem on 3.0.9B 
For me when the app was uploading a new page and a new image it was just hanging on the upload for a new page and never completing (waited for a few minutes). However, if I can fix this issue by: 1) Tap the image 2) Select Retry 3) Tap the image 4) Select Cancel  5) Back out to Site Pages  Then the page uploads successfully. Just revalidated a few flows and this looks like it's an issue on other media blocks as well not just gallery. 
Hi,  Sorry for the late answer, I'm a bit bussy this week. Will try suggested work-around as soon as I have a spare minute.  Thank you!

Not sure, just going through some older debug logs and looking at some scripts that should be working still. I think the idea was having some object in a working queue that could be access different ways to produce data based upon request. 
No, not really a problem. Just wanted to have this registered in case it was still an issue in 2.0. So I guess you can close this one. 
Fixed via #749 
I haven't reproduced it yet. I need to make a testbench for this.  I'm guessing that writing on the DataStore timed out (which doesn't mean the data hasn't been committed) and Collect retried sending the image, but we can't be 100% sure...

Hey @joeatwork ,  Sorry for the slow reply, it has been busy around here.  Here's the answers to your questions: - On device.  We've tested on the Moto X and Nexus 5 (both Lollipop) and saw the problem.  It doesn't happen on our LG G3 or Htc One (KitKat & Jellybean). - I added that metadata and the problem stayed. - Yes, we had 5 codeless events.  I removed them all, deployed, and tried again.  The problem still remained. - The whole app appears slower.  It appears to be most obvious when a re-layout happens (such as the height animation).  But it is also super noticeable by simply calling getActionBar().hide() as well as other places in the app. - Downgrading wasn't entirely straightforward, I'm guessing the API must have changed since then.  So I gave up trying. - Actually, I'm able to reproduce this without tracking anything.  After removing every single event in the app, I still see the lag.  If I remove the initialize call it disappears completely.  Thanks for looking into this. Brad 
Looks fine to me, close it if you like. I have the workaround until an update. 
I'm using 6.0.1, Sony stock, no root, bootloader locked. I place a dish, press the home button, then tap on the app's icon in my launcher, and the dish just disappeares (Now I don't get the message about the same cat showing up, it just disappeares). 
nodetool cfhistograms  currently it shows zeroes 
> It is a bug in Eclipse platform, not DBeaver itself. I'm afraid I can't fix it.  I understand it. But I do not understand why the previous version does not work. In addition, for a while I worked and version 5.  Maybe I need to install a previous version of the JRE separately? Only I did not find how to do it.

There's a couple of other places where I've seen odd things like this.  I'll wait for the dev to drop as a release before reporting any others.
The searchgui zip is 4.2GB.   I'll try to generate a smaller file that exhibits the same issue.   
UTF-8 Later today I can try that on my home PC too.
I'm sure that dealing with this one will help by using ZAP Proxy through jenkins plugin. Most of companies will use ZAP Proxy through automated tools as jenkins plugin. So this is my selling points ;)  :   -All the developers to home i presented ZAP Proxy and how to use with jenkins told me that they have to obtain a delta between two or three jobs and need to tag false positives.  -As you know the managers need also the information to see how the issues are dealt with and the only thing we can get when using ZAP as daemon is the report.  I hope you understand the importance of the fix ;).  thc202 : the alerts are shown with green flag .  Thank you all for your help.  Best regards,  Abdellah AZOUGARH

It doesn't throw an error anymore and the call to getAuditLog works perfectly fine! However, I have noticed that when listening for a BanEvent the user field in the BanEvent is empty, i.e. the id is 0, the username is null and so on. I tried this both on my actual bot and on a clean new example bot - same result. The guild field of the BanEvent is correct though.

Thx @nmervaillie I'll check and give some feedback.

Testing team use live executions very frequently to debug had to spot issues from Cerberus screenshots and also as helper when there's complex scenarios and several steps prior to the step where the issue happen.  It's not blocking but the possibility to view a live execution, makes the debug process a lot faster an efficient. Our testing team use it all the time.  Screenshot still displayed.  As you mentioned, I would suggest to make it headless by default (because it should reduce resource consumption and the complexity on robot host) but with possibility to overwrite it for some robots. If you predict the development will be long we surely appreciate to remove it temporarily, otherwise, we can wait for it a couple of days for it, no problem.
You can wipe over the keys to input letters in your app i only can type letter by letter, the wipe function is not active  here is the app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonyericsson.textinput.uxp&hl=en "it offers a superior swiping experience as well as traditional tapping."  thx :) 
I don't know if haxe or haxelib were involved at that moment. 
Hi, okay I understand, this makes sense. Thank your for this explanation...  Looking forward to remove those error lines as it pollutes a little bit those useful logs ;-) 
Yeah the quick fix seems to work. Thank you very much. I also learned something pretty interesting from this issue about drawables :)
Sorry, false alarm, I did not copy the DTD during the DITA OT 1.6.1 integration in our DITA OT. I'll close this one. 
cytosacpe 3.2.1. I know they have done a lot of work on the deleted node/edge between 3.2 and 3.3 but likely people will be using 3.2 for a while yet.   
I have no idea, but it's a good question. The only thing I know is that http://r2d2.devnet.vaadin.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Flow_FlowReleaseDemos job is responsible for that.
I'm afraid I cannot be equal to this task. I'm not familiar with the internal mechanism of Vert.x.  :D
And to be cleared, it works perfectly well in JVM mode and hot reload mode.
I'm not using command line flags. I use the jar from within a web application. The compiler is setup like this:  ``` java CompilerOptions options = new CompilerOptions(); CompilationLevel.SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS.setOptionsForCompilationLevel(options); // https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/477) // options.setFoldConstants(false); options.setCodingConvention(new ClosureCodingConvention());  Compiler compiler = new Compiler(); compiler.disableThreads();  SourceFile input = SourceFile.fromInputStream(resource.toString(), resource.openStream()); List<SourceFile> inputs = Collections.singletonList(input); Result result = compiler.compile(Collections.emptyList(), inputs, options); ```

ghc-mod version 5.4.0.0 compiled by GHC 7.6.3  Perhaps the culprit is changing my GHC version? Not sure why that would be, just a stab in the dark. Edit: Nope. 
It is Command Prompt (64-bit) with settings exactly as you show.

Here's the screenshot:  ![Screenshot_2020-01-23-20-02-55-966_cgeo geocaching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54314831/73020127-e5956100-3e1c-11ea-9258-f8db98e34cff.jpg)   I should add that, since my first post, I've managed to bypass the problem by uninstalling Locus Map Pro. At first, nothing happened, but then I noticed that the maps folder was set to the Locus map offline folder, although I kept setting it to the maps folder. In other words, the Maps folder you see in the previous screenshot ("Pasta de Temas de Mapas") was actually the Locus offline map folder when you opened it.  Still, I had Locus Map Pro app installed in my previous phones, and this never happened.
@maartenba Yup, that fixed it!   Thanks for the speedy update. Kudos on the plugin by the way, i love not having to use VS on Windows to develop azure functions. VSCode on the Mac is just to _minimal_ for me, lacking resharper.
Thanks @ManfredKarrer , I saw the 2-minute timeout constant in the source code, however this doesn't match my practical observations, where the timeout message occurs after 60 seconds only (12:16:38 -> 12:17:38 in my log). It might be a different timeout condition.   Agreed that a socket timeout of 2 minutes makes perfect sense, on the other hand, a *data transfer completion* timeout (which is what seems to be happening here) makes more sense to be a function of the data size.   I use release v0.9.5 in my tests.

My Android phone is  8.1.0 and I have tested on Genymotion Android Emulator with Android 7.0 but got the same exception.  Update: **your fix worked well on Android now.**
> @nirodg - thanks. It appears that the problem is related to the use of a generic collection where the scanner is unable to determine the type of the collection type parameter (e.g. `ENTITY` in `List<ENTITY>` and it is not falling back to `object`. Would you mind to push a simple project to Github that demonstrates the class hierarchy being used?  I see. I do have [an example project](https://github.com/nirodg/dodo-example) where its shown it's usage- I will soon update it due to the changes I've done in the lib, but it does give a clear idea.   Here is the definition of the API endpoint https://github.com/nirodg/dodo-example/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/brage/dodo/example/rs/api/CarRestService.java  Here the implementation and where all injections occurs https://github.com/nirodg/dodo-example/blob/develop/src/main/java/com/brage/dodo/example/rs/services/CarRestServiceBean.java  Currently I'm porting my library to Quarkus and I'm wandering if it a problem of getting properly the generics via reflection or a problem due to the open-api lib.    Many thanks in advance for checking this out, @MikeEdgar !  PS. If needed I can quickly setup a quarkus project with the exact implementation so the NPE happens. 
Thanks for the quick reply!  No toast message. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10e.  The ADB log shows the following: ``` 01-22 15:18:00.330 22939 22939 D KeyStore: UserNotAuthenticatedException because of Fingerprint ```  I've tried to clear Aegis app data and set up my vault again: * Through the "Password" option via the first setup assistant, then trying to check "Biometric unlock" in the settings ⇒ I have the same behavior and error in the ADB log. * Through the "Biometric" option via the first setup assistant ⇒ I cannot go to the next screen, and I have the same error in the ADB log.
Right. You can repro this issue if you open up the voting dialog in the game, then rotate the phone. What happens is, Android destroys and then recreates the Activity (and any Fragments, including this dialog) with the new configuration. But because we just save the Alliance and AllianceRequest objects as instance variables, they don't get recreated.  The newInstance pattern works because you don't use instance variables, you serialize them into a Bundle and Android can pass the Bundle back when the Fragment gets recreated.

Well I sometimes place a quarry near bedrock to only mine the interesting stuff, such as diamonds and gold. I found this bug by accident.  On the overworld this normally doesn't cause any issues but in the nether one could place a quarry on the bedrock ceiling (near y 127) to get on top of the nether world. 
I will see what i can do.

Actually application is 10 lines long. However our core library which includes operating system API produces much of the code because of a task container created for each application before running it. API is huge 100s of classes. System requires a single application file, so we embed TeaVM runtime also to the code.  Here is a figure for 10 lines of application ( not 3, almost 4 times larger) GWT -> 220K TeaVM -> 850K (without minify 2.3M)  I have a teapot demo for GWT which is a pretty good size application, GWT produces 330K for it (this includes images in the code, around 20K). I haven't compiled it with TeaVM yet. One thing may be the string concatenation that produces quite a lot of code.   Unfortunately, library is huge, and I cant release it to public at the moment. Lets get the bugs settled and make things running on our end first. I will work with you on the reasons of the huge file size. You may also supply a maven configuration property for also compressing the output. The generated files would be myapp.js and myapp.js.gz. That would help a lot. 
All your guesses are correct. I reinstall Minecraft. Now, it works fine. My mistake. Thanks for the help.

It can be seen that `ResourceMonitoringManager` sometimes produces logs with `null` or empty values that can be a sign that something works incorrect.   @SilinPavel As long as you've recently changed `ResourceMonitoringManager` could you please recheck if everything works as intended?  ``` [DEBUG] CPU Metrics received: pipeline-2446:0.0, pipeline-2447:null ...

Fixed, thanks so much! 
Thanks for your quick reply.  I'm still struggling with the localization of the heading of an argument group. Using a literal string as heading text (using the code fragment given below) works great for me:  ``` @ArgGroup( exclusive = true, multiplicity = "1", heading = "My custom heading" ) DataSource datasource; ```  It's still unclear to me, however how to put the heading string in a resource bundle. I tried this, to no avail:  ``` @ArgGroup( exclusive = true, multiplicity = "1", headingKey = "myBundleKey") DataSource datasource; ```  Bundle.properties: ``` ArgGroupsTest.myBundleKey = My localized heading text   # doesn't work, please advise what's wrong here ```  Hopefully you can clarify what's the correct way to get the heading text of an argument group localized.  > I like all your suggestions to improve the docs, in addition we can also add an example to `picocli-examples/src/main/java/picocli/examples/arggroup`.  Great to hear that.   > Do you feel like providing a pull request for this?  Yes, I will try to prepare a PR. I can't promise it though. 
I don't think the issue is removing the server dependency. It's removing the `:controller:contract` dependency.  We're using the `pravega:client`, `pravega:common` and `pravega:service` jars from http://asdrepo.isus.emc.com:8081/artifactory/nautilus-build/pravega. The issue is with the service jar. If you download and unpack [service-0.0-1092.4905199.jar](http://asdrepo.isus.emc.com:8081/artifactory/nautilus-build/pravega/service/0.0-1092.4905199/service-0.0-1092.4905199.jar), you'll see that it includes `com/emc/pravega/controller/stream/api/v1/ControllerService$AsyncClient.class` (the missing class in the `NoClassDefFound` message). If you download and unpack the next build, [service-0.0-1095.8b6e93f.jar](http://asdrepo.isus.emc.com:8081/artifactory/nautilus-build/pravega/service/0.0-1095.8b6e93f/service-0.0-1095.8b6e93f.jar), it does not include that class, and `ClientFactory.withScope` is broken from that point forward.  The diff between those two builds is http://github.com/pravega/pravega/compare/490519...8b6e93f. The only commit in that diff that looks relevant to this issue is https://github.com/pravega/pravega/commit/7e32e9742ea393e6c7081d2f42b6e29308cc9e17.

If i use Java 1.8.0_144 and Project Language Level 8, then i get a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` Exception, because my runtime tries to call the method `java.nio.ShortBuffer.flip()`, which does not exist under java 8 and should be `java.nio.Buffer.flip()`.
In project tab it seems all fine except that it is not usable after VS experience Count is about 3000 files for 2 projects i have in imported solution Also there is many folders in project - about 300 total 
1d, 25d, 1w, 2w, 3w, 4w works but it throws error on 5w, I can't open the hastebin I sent firstly so I'm sending this error https://pastebin.com/uu1AMEL6  Could it be caused by that on server start it types `[BanManager] Missing player for ban 3, ignored` etc. so it doesn't know the name?

@danieloeh I would, of course. Unfortunately 0.9.8.1 has not arrived on f-droid, yet. I don't know if you somehow can push them to build the most current version or if just their build service has some hickups... 
We are NOT using Sponge.  We are running ATM3, v5.9.6b, which has many, many mods in it.  I can likely get you a full list of mods later this evening.
I think I had a field with type java.time.OffsetDateTime. So this kind of exception happens when you have no converter for such type. So exception should be meaningfull like: org.sql2o.DataConvertException: Please provide a convertor for type any.package.CustomDataType 
hi @ctron  1. signed the ECA 2. Yes, I agree with making it configurable.  3. I need help in building the environment for development and testing. i followed https://wiki.eclipse.org/PackageDrone/HowTo/Contribute building with oomph but eclipse still have lots of errors. is there a better guide?
I was in creative mode. I just played a random youtube video, I didn't pause or stop the video and broke a screen block with my hand, breaking the screen but the audio from the video still played and when I turned on the screen again the audio was still playing, and I went to another youtube video, the audio from the first video was playing over the audio from the video that was actually playing.
@MHerbst - sorry, but I'm not sure how to do this? - got it DEBUG set to TRACE I suppose. Will try with the next restart, thanks.  But since all other 40 Homematic Things never throw an error, and if I define the 6 wall thermostats without any Channels definitions they don't throw and error either, I'm more inclined to assume it has something to do with the Channels/delay statements.
Hi! Really sorry, was a bug that i found in 0.10.0. In a 0.12.0 it works.  Seems that in 0.10.0 in schema.ftl there are two roles defined with a old definition (schema/update and schema/insert) when the correct roles must be registry/update and registry/insert.  I correct this in my installation addign this two old roles and i deletem them when i update to last version.  Regards and thxs for answer.
See the attached screenshots.  If you want you can reach out to me directly at mbasil@macfound.org and I'll give you SSH access to the box.

(repost - GitHub mangled the last somehow)  Sure, any regular expression pattern will work. The only caveat here is with this bug, and our mishandling escape sequences.  And yes, both BEL Script and XBEL formats require annotations to be defined before use. BEL Script groups these into `DEFINE ANNOTATION` expressions; XBEL uses the `annotationDefinitionGroup` element shown above. 
Regrettably, that doesn't work. I think that doesn't work as long as using ` -ovc lavc`.
Stash: v3.8.0, PullReqNotifier: 1.37. 
The workaround should work. I pushed the correction, I just need to repackage the plugin and upload it. I'll do that this weekend.   
Sorry for the long delay.  Here's the resources, https://www.dropbox.com/s/543yqcc78oncel4/CMM%20resources.zip?dl=0 And here's the json, http://pastebin.com/viGvR1EU 
Uh, yes, I can always reproduce it. I use the latest the riot version from the playstore with android 6. To my knowledge I have all relevant power saving features disabled.  When I get a mention or a highlight on matrix. My phone vibrates and the LED starts blinking. When I now open Riot in the browser and read the message the phone continues to blink. Now when I pick up my phone and open riot-android. I can see the notifications for a split second and then the client apparently gets all informations from the server and marks everything read and deletes the notifications. 
@eivantsov Thank you. Would you please consider to take a look at the issue in Codenvy repo.
Hi,  It works if I change slightly the implementation to: KieSession kie = getSessionByProcess(processInstanceId); org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance processInstance = (org.jbpm.process.instance.ProcessInstance) kie.getProcessInstance(processInstanceId); processInstance.signalEvent(type, event);  Thanks 
@regisd I use two machines.

Consistently fails now, used to work before. Not sure where it is getting "   (" from, instead of blocking for my input. Ill can some more debugging later today..
I do not see any errors in the console. No. 
After opening the issue, I created a gist and added some files to it. Then I added the link to the comment. I wanted to use the issue number as the title of the gist but that didn't work. 
uhm for disable i need to change the configuration of my monitors but i think that work

I updated it anyway. I know some of these may be duplicates but it's a chore to try and search each one when Minecraft and chrome are lagging your computer as it is 😆 
Confirmed, it does work on released builds. FYI, I am looking into other cases involving loading external links (#1942 ): `QDesktopServices::openUrl` works, but in cases where it's done directly via an anchor in the HTML RStudio then crashes (but successfully launches the page into browser).

After having some more time to test this, it does appear to be a number of boolean operators issue, not a number of queries issue. It was getting hung at a query (example) for about an hour. Then it would hit a longer query that KSQL could never get past.  @apurvam  - There are no error messages. As I stated, I'm defining 'loading' as the "Building AST" message. And KSQL just stops printing anything. I never see the more common messages about rebalancing, etc as it executes the queries.  I've created a minimal queries file that seems to exhibit this behavior: ``` CREATE STREAM events ( field0 varchar, id int ) WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='events', VALUE_FORMAT='json');  CREATE STREAM test ( field0 varchar, field1 varchar, id varchar ) WITH ( KAFKA_TOPIC='test', VALUE_FORMAT='json');  INSERT INTO test SELECT event_id, 'x_0' AS field1, field0 FROM events WHERE ((id=1 OR id=2 OR id=3 OR id=4) AND (field0='0x10' OR field0='0x11' OR field0='0x12' OR field0='0x13' OR field0='0x14' OR field0='0x15' OR field0='0x16' OR field0='0x17' OR field0='0x18' OR field0='0x19' OR field0='0x1A' OR field0='0x1B' OR field0='0x1C' OR field0='0x1D' OR field0='0x1E' OR field0='0x1F' OR field0='0x20' OR field0='0x21' OR field0='0x22' OR field0='0x23' OR field0='0x24' OR field0='0x25' OR field0='0x26' OR field0='0x27' OR field0='0x28' OR field0='0x29' OR field0='0x2A' OR field0='0x2B' OR field0='0x2C' OR field0='0x2D' OR field0='0x2E' OR field0='0x2F' OR field0='0x30' OR field0='0x31' OR field0='0x32' OR field0='0x33' OR field0='0x34' OR field0='0x35' OR field0='0x36' OR field0='0x37' OR field0='0x38' OR field0='0x39' OR field0='0x3A' OR field0='0x3B' OR field0='0x3C' OR field0='0x3D' OR field0='0x3E' OR field0='0x3F')); ``` 
Sorry 👍 
Here it is. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ipujmq38sr70ikz/BiomeOutput.zip?dl=0  I however don't see a genWeight in the output. 
I didn't look at how the card is implemented but the important thing is, that when moving -1/-1 counters from ones own creatures onto enemy ones, they aren't affected. Maybe this has something to do with ownership of tokens? But that's just speculation as i don't know the implementation like i said. 
The function `getTypesafeValueForField`makes a promise: To get the value for a field in a typesafe way. But it does not keep the promise and `getRequestPayload` (and other callers as well) will suffer from it.  I like the idea of `getTypesafeValueForField` a lot, as it makes the caller's code much easier and separates concerns. I very much prefer a solution that fixes `getTypesafeValueForField` so all callers can benefit from the improvement.  Does that answer your questions?
It works now. Thanks
I didn't use the SSH URL, I use the https way Clone repository, I can do it on the computer like Clone.  ![screenshot_20181019-101109](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38396747/47194036-5d5a1d80-d388-11e8-86f8-e58a6068d64a.png)  ![screenshot_20181019-101116](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38396747/47193936-ee7cc480-d387-11e8-9ad9-686134e18bb9.png)  Even if I don't check "Clone recursively", the same error will occur.
just update  column value to null, empty string or not null no exception. `UPDATE datatype set test_var = null where id =3`
I think this issue is indeed related to #265. And the solution proposed by @StrangeNoises (#265#issuecomment-262994643) seem to work.  However someone more knowledgeable than me should look at case of the reusable cells.

I try to narrow it down first and then send you a snippet maybe per mail or if it doesn't contain company related stuff then I post it here. 
I'd even go so far to say that people very rarely use "disabled" at all. And in all the other modes machines are still open for power. 
Reproducible(chest output to advanced workbench).  Checked all mods one by one, only happens with CustomNPCs(just PMd CustomNPCs Author). ![bug](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3028542/15251/50c89132-471b-11e2-819d-cbda99eb3ebc.jpg) 
Saw the advice to try 3.0RC3. Is this working better? I was earlier at the "official" Google Play version (2.x I think) and that also had the same issue.... Uploads from my Sailfish phone and from my desktop clients have no issues. Account created for testing and info emailed to the requested address.  Tried to find something with catlog, but it told me I need to be root and these phones are not rooted.
>  >  > @phenixmzy Do you have any steps to reproduce this? How many workers do you have? I'm not able to see this on my end yes, have completed, i am very busy these days so forget. 
A repository rule doesn't actually help @c-parsons's case, as it still will be cached build-to-build (there's no file that changes we can depend on).  But maybe repository rules would be the right place to add a "force to run every time" option.
Testing with SpongeForge 1942 and Forge 2171 now. Will report back if error shows up again.

Hi, Perfect, version 2.3.0-SNAPSHOT in maven central is not found.  Thank you very much,  Kind regards  Anderson 
@gsmet I triggered more than 10 livereload and no issue with 0.21.2. Sorry for the duplicate this is a bug I wanted to open since a few weeks and I didn't saw anything about it when I quickly looks at the list of bugfixes for 0.21.2.
sry wrong button 
Ah, got it, yep, it sounds like my `target/classpath.txt` got out of sync. Not sure what happened, but I moved over to `es4x-cli` and after doing `yarn install` I see that `es4x postinstall` ran automatically and `target/classpath.txt` has the latest/great jars listed. I'll close this out as not reproducible. Thanks!
@jgcmarins  I didn't check the example project. This issue happens in my react native project FYI I am using react-native-navigation v3 for navigator.
The issue is intermittent at startup. This is a code quality issue in Bookkeeper with how it is integrated with Zookeeper and how it checks and handles state at startup. Since it's a Bookkeeper issue, I'm closing this as a non-issue for Pulsar.
No clue, if not BWA (or whatever aligner) some post-alignment editing that went wrong.  I have seem occurrences of this in at least 3 WEx bams that I presume have been produced using good practices.  
Yes. Add a @MapperScan to your main application class pointing to a dummy interface. That will register a MapperFactoryBean:  ``` java @SpringBootApplication @MapperScan("dummy.package") public class SampleMybatisApplication implements CommandLineRunner { ```   or create a MapperFactoryBean explicitly:  ``` java @Bean MapperFactoryBean<Object> createMapper() {   return new MapperFactoryBean<Object>(); } ```  If a MapperFactoryBean is detected autoscan is not done. 
Hi Liu  Thanks for the reply  Yes I did, my test software is below, as I said in my post it works perfectly with Arduino 1.04 and 1.05  #include <SoftwareSerial.h>  const int ledPin = 13; boolean ledOn = false;  void setup() {   Mouse.end();   Keyboard.end();  // make sure both mouse & keyboard are off   Serial.begin(9600);   while (!Serial) {  };    // wait for serial port   pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); }  void loop() {   Serial.println("Hello");   if (! ledOn) {    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    ledOn = true;    } else {    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);    ledOn = false;    }   delay(500); }  Dave

I am using java 8 , including janusgraph 0.2.0 as dependency and 3 node cassandra cluster for backend storage. Please let me know If anything specific you want to know.
Hi, Yes, of course. I do think it very strange.  * For a **Empty** Rstudio which just started with no projects, click create new projects——Doooon, Crash, No reactions. Actually you can only "Open" a Project.  * When I already have a project working on, click New Project, also crash.  * When it went wrong in running a loop or building packages, if you click the red point(which will stop R running manually),  Dooooon, it crashes.   ----  Always, I have to stop the session by Windows Task Manager, because clicking the "X" of Rstudio on the head right, can only get a waiting circle forever. And never close the program.  Also, if it crashes, you can not save the file editing, but it just stays there, you can click buttoms of Rstudio, but nothing happens.  Quite strange.    
Hi Alexander,  thanks for your invest. I check it with the latest version and give it a try with the .asciidoctorconfig file feature. I use a Ubuntu distribution.   Thank you for this great asciidoc plugin. It provides a great integration in our development environment. 
I simply wanted to get started experimenting with JanusGraph and felt like following the building instructed commands should work. While I may eventually want to use jars they are not my priority now. I just wanted to step through the docs, get the basic JanusGraph server working (probably with inmemory backend I suppose) and start to make some simple experiments with Gremlin etc to build a trivial graph database.

aw, hell, i thought i'd edited it with more information.  Shift-clicking a bauble out of its slot is the time it doesn't fire.

I upgraded to the latest forge, and I can now see the items! Unfortunately, I cannot click on the items and place them into my inventory on survival. I can only do this on Creative, but since this is a new problem, I opened a new issue, unless this is intentional?

I suspect it is the same version.  The Ubuntu Lucid package version is 0.4.0-1.

@szugi i think  It is likely that we will branch off the gesture action based on the view's center point.
Thanks for taking a look at this! That makes sense in terms of precedence but I'm admittedly am not an expert.  I bumped to `3.5.4` in my `pom.xml` file and realized the difference is that this works:  ```javascript import { USER_UUID_HEADER } from './lib/headers'; console.log('FOOFOO' + USER_UUID_HEADER); ```  But this does not:  ```javascript import { USER_UUID_HEADER } from 'lib/headers'; console.log('FOOFOO' + USER_UUID_HEADER); ```  Now that I know that, I can just change our imports to have `./` to keep prototyping, but it'd also be nice to have parity with node (although the `./` prefix is admittedly more explicit). Thanks!
Hello @tkrille,  we are using the latest version of the addon-administration (1.6) and the issue is related to boolean-typed extension fields.

Only two things disabled are "Bottle of Creosote" and "Bucket of Creosote". Had to disable those as we were getting a crash when users right clicked either item, to dump them out into the world. (A bug that I saw previously reported here.)

I use Informix SQL command SET ROLE xxx during connection ( in bootstrap queries ). This role grands me permissions for some database objects ( tables for example ). When I try to do SELECT from these tables I get error: no SELECT permission for  ( all versions 6.3.x and 7.0.0 ).  I always got permissions in versions prior 6.3.x but I never seen SET ROLE in Query Manager (may be  this is my wrong look!)  
@edmundoa Thanks for the help!  I'm a bit confused by your first paragraph (first day is still Jan 1 for me, because there should be no Dec 31 logs at all and all these timestamps are ingested explicitly). But if I understand you correctly, it doesn't matter and yes, you are right! Switching minute resolution does not show any time shift in the histogram unlike the day resolution, so this really seems to be exactly #1830. I completely missed this issue when looking up past ones.  
sorry for my delay i ran out of internet, ill give it a shot

I would just go with giving all the test helper classes versioned names. It keeps things straightforward.
It's working again, thanks for the quick fix.  Grabbed the latest snapshot using this maven dependency (I am using maven for this particular project):  ```         <dependency>             <groupId>org.elasticsearch</groupId>             <artifactId>elasticsearch-spark_2.10</artifactId>             <version>2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>          </dependency> ```

No - this issue was opened after that commit. 
Try it on this: ``` module TEST endmodule ``` Just a simple empty module. Also, I've tested this on windows 10, 64 bits, if that helps.

OK @vetss, I will try again and provide logs. 
Registered items included saddle, armors and chest. Try to shift click a stack of diamond while opening the GUI
Theoretical should work but do not work. If I select Refresh from Eclipse context menu by right click on folder of project all ok. 
Latest version. Single Player. 
I'll send the log if it happens again. 
Video I would could do, but render + uploading video on YouTube is too long.  So here's step-by-step guide:  1. Go to **SURVIVAL** mode 2. Take _"Bound Blood Drop"_ in your **LEFT** hand 3. Go to any source of blood (for example, blood infuser) 4. Take blood from this source (Shift + Right Mouse Button)  If that doesn't work, try to turn on auto-filling mode in Bound Blood Drop
It downloads only a few rows.

Hey @a-hacker,  thanks for your fast reply. I just checked the global settings and they seem fine: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58905132/72498667-33fc9b80-3830-11ea-81ac-9c453aa5237a.png)  Project settings are empty though ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58905132/72498828-7faf4500-3830-11ea-839c-f09e0feb4f59.png) Is this some new feature I missed?

Are you trying on a client/server setup?  Also, fastcraft and kcauldron are running.  he suspects it was a rutabegga seed. 
Hello, Here is the project file. (https://github.com/bardsoftware/ganttproject/files/1003581/Planning_Transporeon.zip) This is correct, one name of the resources was missing and generating troubles in the display. After setting a name to the resource, there are no errors now. Thanks a lot. 
Fixed.  @danielnaber , sorry, this is not the first time that I forgot about mvn clean test. I changed my batch file so that I can't forget again.  
Sorry forgot those infos :) Yes it doesn't appear on my launcher. I use lawnchair on LOS 15.1
Yes, using gcloud to deploy works without error. Yes, I enabled the Service Usage API and the error still occurs. I've also signed out and back in with my Google account within Eclipse hoping it is just something related to authorization.
Cool, something to do with this case statement most likely but I haven't had time to check it out https://github.com/andytill/erlyberly/blob/master/src/main/resources/erlyberly/beam/erlyberly.erl#L189 
My server is constantly restart... 
@davidohayon669, other controls work fine.  Android's three dots menu always does not work for non fullScreen mode.
I dont think manus is an official flans modpack  I got manus modernwarefare and manus civil pack installed, other flanspacks I have installed dont have vehicles in them. So I dont know who's code is causing this bug 
I do not have one convenient at the moment but I can put one together. 
It was a plain text file, specifically my contacts as exported by Android.  I think its called "Contacts.vcf"
Seems to be solved now. 
I ended up just opening up the GIF in Photoshop and exporting it again, which resulted in a (non-broken) GIF.  I assume that means the original GIF had incorrect disposal, but I don't know anything about that.
Reading the code about recover() according to the prompt, the message will do reput. Analyzing the log again, i find some about the error log. The first error log of ReputMessageService: 2018-09-11 16:46:46.976 WARN ReputMessageService - [BUG]logic queue order maybe wrong, expectLogicOffset: 1050988840 currentLogicOffset: 1050988820 Topic: role_change QID: 4 Diff: 20 The cqOffset reputing:52549442. There is something wrong with cqOffset 52549441 of qid 4.  From the producer log, the phyOffset is 80549937024 of cqOffset 52549441, as follow: 2018-09-11 16:37:32,006 [ INFO ] MissChecker - send msg success, topic:role_change, tag:1536655040000, index:399503976, result:SendResult [sendStatus=SLAVE_NOT_AVAILABLE, msgId=0AB314D91D3F070DEA4E3710B4E7BD18, offsetMsgId=0A60706900002A9F00000012C1267F80, messageQueue=MessageQueue [topic=role_change, brokerName=syz-00, queueId=4], queueOffset=52549441]  In the recover log broker, the max phy offset is 80549937216. As the messages with fixed length 192, the laste message offset is 80549937024 whose cqoffset is 52549441. 2018-09-11 16:44:11.292 INFO main - load over, and the max phy offset = 80549937216  And I find some log else about this issue: 2018-09-11 16:44:11.123 ERROR main - [BUG]read total count not equals msg total size. totalSize=192, readTotalCount=140, bodyLen=38, topicLen=11, propertiesLength=0 2018-09-11 16:44:11.134 INFO main - /home/suiyuzeng/store/consumequeue/0 mkdir OK 2018-09-11 16:44:11.134 WARN main - found a illegal magic code 0x0 2018-09-11 16:44:11.180 INFO main - topic:role_change, queue:4, queue offset after truncate:52549441, origin:52549441 The last line is added by me for debug.  In truncateDirtyLogicFiles() before return, get the cqoffset by getMaxOffsetInQueue(). And The cqOffset should be 52549442.   I think the last message(cqoffset 52549441, phyoffset 80549937024)  was damaged. In the log, totalSize, bodyLen, topicLen are right but propertiesLength is wrong. As checkMessageAndReturnSize() find it abnormal and return false, the message is dispatched.         DispatchRequest dispatchRequest = this.checkMessageAndReturnSize(byteBuffer, checkCRCOnRecover);       int size = dispatchRequest.getMsgSize();       // Normal data       if (size > 0) {              ..........        }  As the topic was not set in the DispatchRequest, we find the log " /home/suiyuzeng/store/consumequeue/0 mkdir OK ". So the message whit cqOffset 52549441 may was not despatch to the consume queue.  In recoverAbnormally() ,only the size is checked. Should we check isSuccess as in recoverNormally? Truncate the messages when isSuccess is false.
I didn't know that. Thank you for clarification. But my following lines of code still work fine, so it's look like the rightclick events are correctly detected. Only the event cancelling doesn't work ... however it was working fine with the dev20b, just before I update to the dev22f.  ``` on rightclick on a villager:     cancel the event     send "Here is a few dirt" to event-player     give 5 of dirt to event-player ``` In this example, the player always receives the message and the five dirts. However the cancelling doesn't fail occasionally but on each try ... 
I just did.. What should I elaborate? 
Hi, im using the version 4.1.69  Here are a screenshot of the loading.  https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/luckperms-an-advanced-permissions-plugin.174259/page-103#post-2983419
```  jantje commented 9 hours ago  This is actually a issue for https://github.com/jantje/hardware repository and not for sloeber. Do I understand correctly that the esp tool used is a wrong version? ```  Yes, that is correct; I've verified this for (2) separate installations. You did comment in the video that both the 1.65 and 2.30 SDK's were needed for debugging; I thought perhaps this was the reason.  To explore what 'esptool' version would upload Project A's debug sketch, I did some experimentation using the command prompt for: ``` a) My original Feather board, with peripherals attached (I2C bus, SD card, and interrupt lines; pretty full plate) b) Another Feather board, no peripherals attached c) My Breakout board, also sans peripherals ``` Test case B was added as a cross-check, as my original circuit needs all the lines controlling the ESP-12 boot mode for I/O. During reset, external logic fixes these line states to insure proper booting, then connects them to where they're needed.  Included below are excerpts from my notes recording the command prompt results for various esptool uploads: ``` ================================  Test upload which failed using admin. command prompt:  Huzzah Feather Board, on protoboard with peripherals C:\Users\DELL>C:\SloeberBeR1\arduinoPlugin\packages\esp8266\tools\esptool\0.4.9\esptool.exe -cd ck -cb 921600 -cp COM4 -ca 0x00000 -cf C:\Users\DELL\SloeberWork\Wksr1\blink_wtdelay_gdbA_r1p65\debug\blink_wtdelay_gdbA_r1p65.bin warning: espcomm_sync failed error: espcomm_open failed error: espcomm_upload_mem failed  Huzzah Feather Board, stand-alone C:\Users\DELL>C:\SloeberBeR1\arduinoPlugin\packages\esp8266\tools\esptool\0.4.9\esptool.exe -cd ck -cb 921600 -cp COM8 -ca 0x00000 -cf C:\Users\DELL\SloeberWork\Wksr1\blink_wtdelay_gdbA_r1p65\debug\blink_wtdelay_gdbA_r1p65.bin warning: espcomm_sync failed error: espcomm_open failed error: espcomm_upload_mem failed  NOTE: The 'esptool' makes (3) attempts at connection before generating failure messages; the RED led followed BLUE led flash for each attempt.

Given this additional testing, its likely that ``` a) Preventing the 'newer' esptool from being invoked when the 'older' esptool is needed, and b) Using a modified set of arguments when the 'newer' esptool is needed ```  would correct the problems seen the Huzzah Feather board.  
@jiazhai I've opened a PR to bump the netty version - #6424, but I am not sure how to go about testing it. Do you think the existing integration tests cover it?
Thank you for your quick response, Pete. Today morning I tried to provoke this error with different classifiers. The error occured with 'Random trees', 'Artificial neural network' and 'Logistic regression'. I think the more settings I change, the more likely the error will occur - but I couldn't figure out if a single setting is the reason.  With my usual approach I train the pixel classifier on a project training image. If I could successfully save the classifier and load it for another image in the project, I get the following error messages for ANN and KNN:  ANN classifier: ![err_ann](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59967282/73450688-34d01a00-4366-11ea-9c8f-7e08251c6261.png)  KNN classifier: ![err_knn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59967282/73450694-37cb0a80-4366-11ea-98f8-17df5cefcf52.png)

1.8.9 actually. When I have the time, I'll check if I can get it to work in another way. I'll inform you if I can identify the problem. I'm a bit busy this week though. Perhaps on the weekend. 
It does yes. According to the wiki, `Squeezer.addRecipe` can only take `inputStack, outputStack, outputFluid`, but it actually has 4 different parameter options.  `inputStack, outputStack` `inputStack, outputStack, outputFluid` `inputStack, outputStack, int chance, secondaryOutputStack` `inputStack, outputStack, outputFluid, int chance, secondaryOutputStack`  The same goes for the mechanicalSqueezer. The duration parameter does not seem to exist. 
Thank you for reply.  ```yyyymmdd``` is the partitioned column.  I try to reproduce the bug using simpler query, but I can't..  This is a little simpler query. ``` select yyyymmdd from ( select      b.yyyymmdd     , b.test_id from     some_partitioned_table a right outer join     (select distinct yyyymmdd, test_id from some_non_partitioned_table cross join othere_non_partitioned_table) b on     a.yyyymmdd = b.yyyymmdd     and a.test_id = b.test_id group by      b.yyyymmdd     , b.test_id ) WHERE yyyymmdd='20180117' LIMIT 1 ```

Hi, Not a exception. This is a new add country codes.  
 @SilentChaos512 nope, reverted back to the previous and it worked fine.
Yes, that's very, very similar to what we do. Thank you for such a quick turnaround here.

I removed the config file before running Minecraft and that did the trick! It seems like "config.evilcraft.blood_stained_block.blockWhitelist" is the only one that needs attention.
Yup, got a user on the forum that I'm trying to get more information from.  @dlivitz have you run into any samples that you could pass along?
Anytime it dies from combat damage.  Example I blocked a Prized Amalgam. Damage happens Mass died trigger went on stack but the copy never happened.  I tested it and its repeatable. 
Thanks for your time. I tried to get more information by passing `-Dconsole.log=verbose` through various means (Capsule and log4j parameters, exe command line) without more success. The whole message I get is:  ``` >java -jar lwjgl.examples.spaceinvaders.exe -Dcapsule.log=verbose CAPSULE EXCEPTION: Not a JAR/ZIP file while processing environment variable LOCALAPPDATA: C:\Users\Olivier\AppData\Local (for stack trace, run with -Dcapsule.log=verbose) USAGE: java -jar lwjgl.examples.spaceinvaders.exe <options> <path or Maven coords of application JAR/capsule> Options:   -version - Prints the capsule and application versions.   -modes - Prints all available capsule modes.   -tree - Prints the capsule's dependency tree.   -resolve - Downloads all un-cached dependencies.   -jvms - Prints a list of all JVM installations found.   -help - Prints this help message.   -mode <value> - Picks the capsule mode to run.   -reset - Resets the capsule cache before launching.

How could I get more details? Do you want me to share the whole project?  Regards.

@ashimokawa  Okay, thanks. I guess the timing is just a coincidence then.  @danielegobbetti  I live in Finland and our daylight saving time change is in October, so no. Both all-day and non-all-day events get duplicated, I just chose to screenshot those as they aren't from my personal calendar.

It also happens on trunk from the git repository, which was what I developed my patch off of.  To reproduce it? Windows 10, JDK8, IntelliJ... and try to debug a JUnit5 unit test. I'd have to set up a minimal case for you otherwise. I'll work on that in a bit.
This is the first time I'm using Archi & this plugin. Sorry, have no previous experiences. 
I think this only happens when you use a deployer that passes in the AppDefinition.properties as command line args. The k8s deployer does this when using the `exec` style entry-point.
I have tried with your suggestion, and there is no exception thrown anymore, but my interceptor code doesn't run, so it still can't work.  I decompile the code after Byte Buddy running, I can see the delegate filed, and the `handle` method in `org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerAdapter` is already be enhanced.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20675747/66993740-b32de680-f0fe-11e9-9586-a4f86817d54d.png)  I guess the reason for my interceptor doesn't run is the implemented subclass of `org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerAdapter` override the enhanced method, and it loses the enhance logic.

Hey, my IDE (Eclipse) says String.getBytes should be String. 
@khotyn  The problem is described as follows: `org.springframework.beans.factory.ListableBeanFactory#getBeanNamesForType` is a common method invoked frequently when refresh spring application context, such as autowire constructor injection. This method is used to get bean names according to the specified type. It will scan all bean definitions and fetch bean type.   If this bean is a `FactoryBean` , Spring IOC will generate a shortcut instance(early stage of bean instance), generally, the shortcut instance will return the type of object that this `FactoryBean` creates, however, if null is return, the shortcut instance will fall back to full creation. It may be lead to some problems, once the `FactoryBean` is fully created, then the subsequent `BeanPostProcessor` would not apply this `FactoryBean`, such as `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`  
I downgraded to 3.4.1 to avoid for now, so not seeing this again for now. I am actually seeing this still, it happens occasionally when I just open my app, but not everytime. I am initialising the stream client in my main activity, the log doesn't show me where this error originates from my code, so it makes it difficult to point out the origin from my code, but I'm initialising the stream client in my MainActivity, and other times in my channel list and detail views in case the stream client is destroyed by the system.
For me at least, if I use the apply operation with a 1 parameter operator, and specify a fixed value in the second slot, the result is a 0 parameter operation.  i.e. I have an operation variable that accepts an entity and returns an NBT value. If I use it in an apply with an entity variable, the resulting variable can be placed in a display to see the result. It seems it can also be used again in an apply.
Hi joakime, thank for your help so far.  We do not use .war files for deployment. Our apps are dropped into the webapps folder manually as entire folders. e.g. `${jetty.base}/webapps/exampleWebapp/`  Jetty notices the new folder and starts up the webapp as we are used to happening. With Jetty 7, removing the `exampleWebapp` folder would stop the app as in your video.  > Do you have a `${jetty.base}/webapps/myapp.xml` perhaps?  No, we do have something similar like: `${jetty.base}/webapps/exampleWebapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`. Is this the same?  > Have you customized the the default descriptor in any way?  I'm not sure what that is, sorry.  > Did you deploy myapp.war manually (not via the Deployment Manager) as well perhaps?  We deploy manually by untarring an app into webapps as a folder and not a .war package.  We do have one war file always deployed called root.war, which is just a small app to redirect htpp requests to the various webapps we currently have deployed depending on requested hostname.

So OpenJDK jdk8u172-b11 is one of the JVMs I have seen this on. Also, it happens for me while running the app in IDE (Intellij 2018.2) and also while running the Spring Boot executable jar.  It's interesting that it consistently fails for you. The behavior I saw was that it would pick the String overloaded setter most of the time and int overloaded only one once in a while.
@apurvam unfortunately this didn't make it in. How high of a priority should this fix be?
It seems to be on reboot, though it feels like it was just any time it sat more than a day.

The game needs more and more memory, I don't know fixing this issue will completely fix it or if it is just contributing to it. I found the issue through a memory snapshot however, so it's not something minor. (view distance moderate = potentially `13*13*13` chunks = about 2000 = chunks, 50 frames per second would give 100000 entries per second. Each entry say 4 bytes would give 400 kbytes per second = 24 mbytes per minute = about 1.4 GB/hour, of coures maybe not all chunks may have reflection but still).

I _believe_ I only had one driver running. That's why there's only one command-line with --driver=embedded in the report; that causes that particular instance of the tool to start up a driver as well. The default is to not start a driver. 
Yeah, it does seem like Aedict reader is the faulty one, it didn't occur to me there was an almost identical verb to 没す  Though on the example tab for ぼっする, it still only shows 1 of the examples even though Tatoeba examples has 3 instances (technically 4 but one is a duplicate)  ![screenshot_20180704-173320](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40373139/42296674-e9400192-7fb5-11e8-9a75-cc37e6af3639.jpg) ![screenshot_20180704-173328](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40373139/42296685-fb73cdb2-7fb5-11e8-86f2-d6f247a9f06f.jpg)  My guess is the remaining sentences don't show up because they're not exactly ぼっする but would appear if there was an entry for ぼっす   If possible, maybe examples for verbs like 愛す/愛する should show identical example tabs, since they are the same verb (assuming they have the same reading, I do think you're right that もっす shouldn't display examples of ぼっす(る)) After all, the Tatoeba search does allow for exact matches so if somebody wants specifically あいする instead of あいす、あいした or the like, they could use that  Thanks for your time and your efforts in developing this great app!

Yes it is set with the server running. Why would a server reset the config back to the previous state after a restart though? Also what would be the point of having the ability to change a setting live in the game with a command if it reverts or the ability to reload the config after changing the setting VIA the config file. 
No, only in those cases where 1000G_ALL exists, if there is not any frequencies then it is unknown

However, i am on someone elses server and help him when i can.            You cannot place on the block, but can place next to it.    I have not tried to move it with a piston but would assume I would not be able to move it.   Ill try and let u know in a few moments

I see, I updated and still can't remove the passed notification by id in iOS.  I am trying to remove the passed notification in order to remove the feed from the push notifications, since if i don't do so, the feed will stay even you tap it and enter the app again.  I can remove the passed notification by using cancelAll(), but it would be the best that I can do this by ids, too. Thank you:) 
@E3V3A, I am hoping that @meatballhat will chime in as well to help us making our Travis CI builds rock stable again. I've just turned off caching in the global settings and will read and implement a few other things you mentioned above soon. Will have a tasty coffee with my family now, stay tuned. :coffee:  **EDIT:** I've also noticed that `android-wait-for-emulator` always spits out the following warning:  > Failed to Initialize backend EGL display > emulator: WARNING: Could not initialize OpenglES emulation, using software renderer.  Then, it takes a _very_ long time until it starts. Not sure if this is related, just posting my findings. Another error spit out by Travis CI during compilation (not sure if and how we can fix this):  > :third_party:RootTools:compileDebugJavaNote: /home/travis/build/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/third_party/RootTools/src/main/java/com/stericson/RootTools/internal/RootToolsInternalMethods.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.  Regarding the usage of RootTools in general: Couldn't we cross-link it somehow so that we always have the latest and greatest RootTools by @Stericson in our App? Or should we switch to [libsuperuser](https://github.com/Chainfire/libsuperuser)?  @Ueland, just as a side-question: Are you familiar with [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/)? I've been notified that our App has quite a few things that would need fixing. Want to have a look at [our Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3346) (without a hurry)?

Yeah, I meant packets. But I came up with an easier way (Did not test it though): You could just check player.isSneaking() instead of Keyboard.isDown, since the sneaking state should be synched automaticly.  For the right server configuration, create a new Run Configuration: Project: Minecraft Forge, Main class:cpw.mods.fml.relauncher.ServerLaunchWrapper, vm-arguments: -Dfml.ignoreInvalidMinecraftCertificates=true -Dfml.coreMods.load=de.teamlapen.vampirism.coremod.VampirismFMLLoadingPlugin. Then add the vampirism project to the user entries under classpath. But the server doesnt work atm anyway, I still have to fix it, see issue #7 . 
Can't attach it to github, so I uploaded it to my owncloud:  https://cl3.arctium.org/index.php/s/4a88Q9vQJbyqdu9/download 
Works. Thanks a lot :).

Seems to work now, thanks a lot for the help!
The default renderer works correctly for typical use case (Uniform tile shapes and sizes), however when using a map that has a fixed map tile size (i.e. 250x150), and differently sized tile images (i.e. 250x250, and 250x300), you will get the overlapping effect seen in the first image.  I believe this is because the default renderer is rendering tiles from bottom to top.  If you invert the process (rendering tiles from the top to the bottom), the tiles appear correctly (second image).  It can be reproduced by creating a map in tiled that uses tile images that are larger than the tile size on the map.  ![screenshot from 2014-03-30 18 16 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1435884/2562826/4f07d886-b861-11e3-966b-71f724304c79.png)  My map loading code is simply using the default TmxMapLoader().load() function and my rendering code is using a standard OrthogonalTiledMapRenderer render call, nothing fancy at all.   
Yes, they don't persist through relogs. Restarts most likely gets rid of them as well but I haven't tested that.
This was on RC3 the windows install version.  Great i will build my own version. 
2.19.5
I tried it with that app as well right after I made my last comment. It failed. It said the QR code was invalid (I don't remember the exact message, but I can get that if necessary) and gave numbers the plugin rejected when I attempted to manually enter the code (with 6 digits, SHA256 settings).
I am alright, how about yourself?  I had around 1.2 GB free at the time of the crash 
Thanks for checking. For me, it fails 100% of the time, even after a device restart. Hmm.
Corrupted library is unlikely to be the cause, as I got the same result from the app built on 3 different computers. I’ll wipe gradle cache and retest. Just to double check - did you run your app with `-Duser.language=tr` ?

Hi Yonjuni, yes it works. It decodes QR code without having to wait (feels prompt), but as the screen is dark I cannot see the active area nor whether it's active at all. (Not using XPrivacy)

Every view in `System overview` takes so much time to be render. ![system-overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1283378/24441730/9574da18-148d-11e7-9bf4-07c9d965b7ae.png)  By the way, shouldn't we attach multiple clients to one CMR simultaneously? It seems that every client got frozed together when anyone of them established a synchronous connection.
this off by one issue looks like only when a user is zoomed in, going to close as a non issue.  
Here is what it was before I took out the JSON and XML parms:  steps.dependencycheck additionalArguments:         '--scan ./ --format XML --format HTML --format JSON --prettyPrint --suppression ./OWASPFalsePositiveSuppression.xml --out ./ --data /home/jenkins/tools --cveUrlBase http://ourmirror.com/nvdcve-1.0-%d.json.gz --cveUrlModified http:// ourmirror.com/nvdcve-1.0-modified.json.gz',         odcInstallation: 'OWASP Dependency Check v5', skipOnScmChange: false, skipOnUpstreamChange: false  Nothing I did would make the XML and JSON reports be anything other than a default report with zero vulnerabilities.  I remember too that these default reports also showed that nothing was scanned, zeros across the board, yet the XML report was quite accurate and usable.  It (the XML) also appears to be fed into the mechanism for Jenkins to display the vulnerabilities page.  Michael Corum
I am sorry but right now i am unable to reproduce it.  
@trustin You're right it's my mistake, I had a dependent library still referring 3.6.3 that was causing this jar to be used instead of 3.6.4. Many apologies. 
  After first launching a new workspace with this stack / runtime / recipe: ``` services:   dev-machine:     image: rb-dtr.de.bosch.com/cloudia/6i   rt-machine:     image: rb-dtr.de.bosch.com/sg82fe/6i-core-runtime-from-tarball     depends_on:       - dev-machine     volumes_from:       - dev-machine ``` I did use two Che IDE terminals  - terminal 1 on dev-machine  - terminal 2 on rt-machine you can see the commands and flow on the screen-shot below  what i  have done: Via eclipse che IDE terminals i used both terminals to navigate (cd) to /projects folder. initially /projects is empty (visible via ls -la on both terminals). Then on terminal 2 (rt-machine) I create a file via touch fil : file gets created and is visible in /projects in both terminals. Creating file via touch from terminal 1 (dev-machine) is refused with permission denied. using sudo touch file is working. The second created file (from dev-machine created) is visiible on rt-machine /projects folder via ls -la  unfortunately attaching screen-shot seems not to work here in my comment :-(  at least something noticable: while on the rt-machine there is only the user _root_ on the dev-machine (eclipse/ubuntu_jre-based) there is a user _user_ and _root_. by default on dev-machine, user is logged in in bash (in Eclipse Che terminal) by default on rt-machine, root is logged in in bash  (in Eclipse Che terminal)

After a fully network restart it is working, but I don't know, why I have get this warnings.

Yeah, maybe gui.json is corrupted. Here is: [gui.zip](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/files/1550046/gui.zip) 
It can run react 5 without any problems on the same server, it currently have 4GB of ram to play with. It crashes every time it run any /re command

``` java.lang.IllegalStateException: com.thindeck.life.RoutineTxns was already scheduled for execution ```  Yes, looks like it is because of `@EqualsAndHashCode`, shouldn't it compare if the objects is the same using `==` instead of `equals()`?

2016.06.09 on samsung s4-mini  Interesting....  This is the only found cache out of 1600, which resists to show me the found date.  I guessed because of the leap day. This is the only particularity.  Any suggestions?  
pls refer to the following.   https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/d242aa2d507deb5148f5f69b6a80344200b968c2/private/endpoints/endpoints.json  https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/fd136b7571693211815b5c780eebcb52c37a1b46/private/endpoints/endpoints.go

okay update to the issue: it seems to only be when you break the core ill test it on its own 
Sure, I'm having the bug in my repository: https://github.com/RealityTest/SuggestaMovie so you can either use that (It's happening in the ResultActivity) or try it with these code snippets:  This is the code I use in the RecyclerView adapter      @override     public void onBindViewHolder(final RecyclerViewMovieAdapter.ViewHolder holder, int position) {     final Movie movie = movies.get(position);     if (movie.getPosterPath() != null) {     String posterUrl = imgUrlBasePath + movie.getPosterPath();     Log.d(TAG, "Poster URL " + movie.getTitle() + ": " + posterUrl);     Picasso.with(context).load(posterUrl).placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder_thumbnail).error(R.drawable.placeholder_thumbnail).into(holder.imgThumbnail);     holder.textTitle.setText(movie.getTitle());     holder.textRating.setText(String.format(context.getString(R.string.rating_format), movie.getVoteAverage()));     holder.textRelease.setText(String.format(context.getString(R.string.release_format), movie.getReleaseDate()));            if (!showBtnFavorite) {         holder.btnFavorite.setVisibility(View.GONE);       }       if (watchlist.contains(movie)) {         holder.btnFavorite.setLiked(true);       } else {         holder.btnFavorite.setLiked(false);       }       holder.btnFavorite.setOnLikeListener(new OnLikeListener() {         @Override         public void liked(LikeButton likeButton) {           watchlist.add(movie);           notifyDataSetChanged();           serializer.writeWatchlist(watchlist);         }              @Override         public void unLiked(LikeButton likeButton) {           watchlist.remove(movie);           notifyDataSetChanged();

I have also tried to send silence instead of nothing using this code: ```java @Override public boolean provide() { 	boolean didProvide = this.audioPlayer.provide(this.frame); 	if (!didProvide) { 		this.getBuffer().put(new byte[] {(byte) 0xF8, (byte) 0xFF, (byte) 0xFE}); 	} 	this.getBuffer().flip(); 	return true; } ``` This did not fix the error.  **Timeline:** - My bot started at `2019-02-20 22:29:41.951` - The first error occurred 4h30 after, at `2019-02-21 03:03:30.862` - The last error occurred 10h30 after the first error, at `2019-02-21 13:36:35.275`  During this period, 13.436 PortUnreachableException were thrown.  Also, but I'm not sure if it is linked, my shards stop reconnecting after a while. They get stuck on `Retry attempt ... in ... ms` but I keep getting the PortUnreachableException. As quantic said, PUE are sent by epoll thread pool so it makes sense it could hog all resources.

Thank you for your response. Yes, I see 5000 entries on the log files. I am attaching the last one which was from no "git pull" case.  It runs about 10 minutes, also. [opengrok0.0.log](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/files/4232693/opengrok0.0.log) 
Your test needs an assert that tries to reference the value you just captured. Which will cause the NullPointerException. 
it was set to default, Square wave, and even on sine it was skewing the waveforms! And would you be willing to rename the Rednet Historian to RedNet Oscilloscope?  
Running OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 KDE Plasma 5 Intel graphics Java 8  I think it was running with the JavaFX software pipeline: -Dprism.order=sw Unsure if gtk3 was enabled or not with -Djdk.gtk.version=3. I have to check when I'm back at work on Monday. Perhaps try with/without either of these settings. Until then I will try running the test application at my home computer tomorrow, where I am running the same Linux distribution, but it has better NVIDIA graphics. I will also try running it with Java 10.   Should the needle be at the center(top) position if the value is outside of minValue/maxValue? I see that the needle is at bottom left side if value is lower than minValue and bottom right side if value is higher than maxValue. When the needle goes from one side to the next it is disappeared.
Indeed I do, moving it back to its normal position seems to fix it. I've had it snapped to the bottom-right snapbox

Yes, I published to mavenLocal used BUILD-SNAPSHOT and it is solved. 
@trustin can you explain me what the problem was or point to the issue ? I think not expand it should be fine as we should just keep on trying to write until isEmpty() is true or size() == 0 
The Tests are running fine in Eclipse, and are running fine even in Eclipse Che Terminal with "mvn clean test" or "mvn clean install". Just using Che-GUI with _Test_->_Run TestNG Test_ gives me that Error.
Sorry its 1.10.2 tested on both the direwolf20 pack and the skyfactory3 pack on curse. 
Because OKAPI is usable for reading non-personal data without ever authenticating (which makes perfect sense). Therefore we can always read OC caches without the connector being active.
Unfortunately, I don't own another account on a different pod. but if you have a test one I could use, please let me know.
@mmacfadden Maybe! Critical differences, however:  - This issue does not exist if both elements of LINKSET are created _either_ inside _or_ outside the transaction. - The above test runs through with a LINKMAP (as in #8632), as well as with a LINKLIST - it seems an issue specific to LINKSET. - This issue is exists for PLOCAL as well as MEMORY dbs.  So it would rather be an indirect relationship to the same root cause.

@ggezer , thank you for spotting this.  I'm curious that I've already configured   ``` ALLUXIO_JAVA_OPTS=-Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=SSD -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/var/lib/docker/alluxio -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota=500GB -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.high.ratio=0.9 -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.low.ratio=0.7  ```  And here is the command line of the master. I noticed it has the two same key `alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias`.  ``` /usr/bin/java -cp /opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/::/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/assembly/alluxio-server-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dalluxio.master.hostname=alluxio-master -Dalluxio.master.journal.type=UFS -Dalluxio.master.journal.folder=/journal -Dalluxio.worker.data.server.domain.socket.address=/opt/domain -Dalluxio.worker.data.server.domain.socket.as.uuid=true -Dalluxio.master.port=19998 -Dalluxio.master.web.port=19999 -Dalluxio.worker.port=29998 -Dalluxio.worker.data.port=29999 -Dalluxio.worker.web.port=29996 -Dalluxio.worker.memory.size=16GB -Dalluxio.security.stale.channel.purge.interval=365d -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=SSD -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/var/lib/docker/alluxio -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota=500GB -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.high.ratio=0.9 -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.low.ratio=0.7 -Dalluxio.home=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT -Dalluxio.conf.dir=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf -Dalluxio.logs.dir=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/logs -Dalluxio.user.logs.dir=/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/logs/user -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=MEM -Dalluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/dev/shm -Dlog4j.configuration=file:/opt/alluxio-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/log4j.properties -Dorg.apache.jasper.compiler.disablejsr199=true -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Dalluxio.logger.type=Console,MASTER_LOGGER -Dalluxio.master.audit.logger.type=MASTER_AUDIT_LOGGER alluxio.master.AlluxioMaster ``` And I checked the getConf:  ``` /opt/alluxio/bin/alluxio getConf |grep alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=MEM ```  Looks like it's configured MEM in the end. I'd like to change SSD as the level0 tieredstore. Any suggestions on it? Thanks.
Tried it again and I unfortunately don't see any change in the behavior.
player keeps jumping when you press forward, no idea what's causing that, might be mod incompatibility with something. It only keeps jumping if you move forward, not backgwards.
It happened two or three times. Maximum of 3 scripts were empty at once.

It's a limitation of the browse, not the appbuilder.  For a variable or expression displayed without @  the column is added but it has NAME = ? . When walking the widget-tree of the browser it's not possible to identify those columns.  If `myvariable @ myvariable` is used the column widget name will be "myvariable".

1. i want to share volumes between containers 2. i would also like to bind mount a host volume if possible.  for example, i've already ran      docker run -v /usr/local/src:/usr/local/src -it ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash  i would like my docker container created to also have /usr/local/src/ shared... e.g.      -v /usr/local/src:/projects  along that line. is that possible? actually would like my workspace to directly access /usr/local/src/ on the host if possible

Nope, singleplayer.  If you're suspecting it's a multiplayer issue (i.e. other guys on the other ends of some other computers), I am only using this mod on my singleplayer world. If you're thinking about a more strictly server-related issue... Well, I am suspecting one of the mods I installed messes around with the internal server, although I've got no actual proof of that -it's "Fastcraft", it's supposed to make your playing a bit smoother, but I know neither what it does nor how it does it. Sometimes I get block lag, so maybe...  I think I should also note that in my F3 screen I can see a "Multiplayer Chunk Cache". I don't have a single clue about either what mod is using it or what it is for. Maybe I'm a bit rusty on my Vanilla and there's always been such a cache, even in a SP, but I think not.  I am talking as a complete noob, so maybe whatever I just said makes no sense whatsoever, in which case you are allowed to yell at me; I thought I'd let you know anyways. I found Fastcraft here, if it helps: http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=10820  I also just downloaded the new 1.12 version (I was using 1.9 till now), I'll see what it comes out of it. If the cow still doesn't eat, I'll try deleting the mod entirely and see if my computer and Moo can compromise on that. I'll report again tomorrow. 
6.0.8.2 at this moment. I'll Need to re-test this issue on the Weekend, but i got an infected ear at the Moment and am out of order.
The issue did not occur with a fresh install with only ID (same forge version).  Issue was in singleplayer. Tried a fresh world in the modpack, issue persisted.

This question looks more trick. I made some investigation. Add jackson-module-kotlin is not enough. By default java and kotlin in runtime does not know about field name.  You should pass **javac -parameters** for compiler  Spring boot 2 in spring-boot-starter-parent set up it by default  ```  <plugin>              <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId> ...               <configuration>                         <javaParameters>true</javaParameters>                 </configuration> </plugin> <plugin>               <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>               <configuration>                         <parameters>true</parameters>               </configuration> </plugin> ``` If you add this parameter to quarkus, it will work with kotlin data class perfect.  **### I suggest to change this behaviors in quarkus.**  [Here](https://github.com/serg-bs/quarkus-data-class-spring) is example project   Moreover if you want to deserialize by hand, you need register ParameterNamesModule.  Look at code below ``` val jsonAsString ="{\"name\":\"a\",\"description\":\"description\"}"; val objectMapper = ObjectMapper(); // objectMapper.registerModule(ParameterNamesModule()) val readValue = objectMapper.readValue(jsonAsString, Fruit::class.java) ``` here is **(no Creators, like default construct, exist): cannot deserialize from Object value (no delegate- or property-based Creator)** But if I uncoment `objectMapper.registerModule(ParameterNamesModule())` that parse perfect.  So quarkus by default register this module.   
Master (Tier 4).  Limit is a million.  As per JEI, there are two more tiers above that, though I'm not sure if Tier 6 is actually implemented.

We have sources available for 1.7.4 and prior?  ![index_of__nexus_content_groups_public_com_adobe_acs_acs-aem-commons-content_1_7_4_](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1451868/4924298/2057516a-6522-11e4-863a-ce71dfd60207.png)  Also, we should keep this open to get the 1.8.0 javadocs onto the GH site. 
Still appears this way in 3.0.1.v20181217-1554.  This is what update site for Eclipse 4.10 provides.
yes, it might be the case that this was an issue due to old cached assets. It seems to have gone away for now. I will keep this issue for a while. If anyone sees another case, please report here, with reproduction steps. I will close the issue in a few weeks if all seems clear. It used to be a sporadic issue that would pop up every now and then!
Of course: ``` public abstract class Foo {     protected Foo(@Nullable String name) {} }  Foo foo = new Foo(null) {}; // anonymous class - no way to annotate constructor parameters ``` Actual behavior: `new Foo(null) {}` will throw a `NullPointerException` if instrumented with `<implicit>true</implicit>` configuration. Expected behavior: take into account `@Nullable` annotation on `name` parameter in implicitly invoked parent `Foo(@Nullable String)` constructor (and not throw).  Basically, the fix would be to _not_ instrument anonymous class constructors at all - their super constructors are always invoked anyway and the instrumentation on those should take care of checking the nullability constraints.  And - thank you for the plugin!
the input doesn't specify any colors, modifiers or attributes. no idea what's happening here's the output <Folder id="1382647a-81df-48b3-9e93-8fd8a652dc92">     <name>         <![CDATA[PAA3]]>

I can completely reproduce the problem with new turbines in my original Bevo test world. I can't reproduce the problem in a minimal modpack with only Mekanism / NEI / Pressure Pipes. When I get a chance, I'll try creating a new Bevo world and testing there.

You're right. Please have a look at this example:  ```robotframework *** Settings *** Library	MyLib.py *** Test Cases *** T1 	${value} =	Get None         ${list} =	Create List 	${value} 	Log	${NONE} #set this line as breakpoint ```
You mean a specific project that I'm building/testing? It's https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake .
Apologizes for the late reply. For some reason, I wasn't notified by email about your messages.  I'm afraid the problem remains using JabRef-5.0-dev--snapshot--2019-07-15--master--e89d60370.jar.  My locales are in french.
A release of 0.7.6 would be fine (and more maven-compliant) if this can be done. Thanks for your help. 
Hi,   They have several hundred to several thousand members.
That parses exactly as written, but the label from a list production is still getting declared as a cons list so that rule doesn't work correctly. 
the wrench that comes with maybe integrated tunnels ? shift_right click to easily remove the logic cables, importers, exporters and interfaces. May even work with batteries, variable stores etc but I have never tried ?
Done. Please find it [here](https://github.com/FWinkler79/SpringCloudPlatform/tree/Issue-Just-For-Spencer-Gibb).  To reproduce: * start service-registry <-- throws an error reported in spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix#1471 * start greetings-service <-- this is where the error of this issue occurs.  ❗️ Note: it seems the error is related to one of these dependencies: ```xml <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-amqp</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-cloud-bus</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.amqp</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-rabbit-test</artifactId>   <scope>test</scope> </dependency> ``` If they are on the class path (like in the sample referenced above) the error is thrown. If they are removed, the error is gone. Unfortunately, I need all of them for the (non-minimal) setup I have initially referenced.

They appear on the trees and grass. Reloading the game causes all the pink and black blocks to disappear, but they reappear after some waiting.
Probably later today
https://youtu.be/s8OOIm8eGQw It works fine if I enable blur
This time when I tried I got the following:  com.connectsdk.service.command.ServiceCommandError: not supported             at com.connectsdk.service.sessions.WebAppSession.playMedia(WebAppSession.java:421)  I am launching the web app like this:  ```             device.getCapability(WebAppLauncher.class).launchWebApp(webAppID, new WebAppSession.LaunchListener() { ```  and then using the WebAppSession to call playMedia. 
sadly no test case apart from running gatling, where it has only occurred once in possibly 100 times. I expect though with some perseverance it could be reproduced but in a couple of weeks as I am away.  ``` $ java -version java version "1.8.0_05" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.5-b02, mixed mode) ```  gatling has a fair number command line args:  ``` -agentpath:/home/vagrant/git/RichardWarburton/honest-profiler/build/liblagent.so -XX:+UseThreadPriorities -XX:T hreadPriorityPolicy=42 -Xms2G -Xmx2G -Xmn1G -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat  -XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled -Djava.net.preferIPv4 Stack=true -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false ```  not sure whether invokedynamic is used. gatling is not supported in java 8, I have just been testing out a few different things, regardless a crash shouldn't happen... 
@jpountz I've tried to reproduce on my environment and it didn't happen anymore. The only difference was that I updated from Alpha 2 to Aplha3 using RPM. I've tried to do it again but the error didn't happen. I'll close. Thanks.

Sadly no .. but this is just a limitation by GitHub. This works different with organization repositories.  So noted: you are working on it. And thanks for that! :+1:  
Thanks @TheBentoBox  I do like that idea of the command.  With Minecraft adding SEVERAL new blocks/items, not having the aliases easily accessible is going to make things quite tricky. AND I KNOW you guys are going to get 10,000 people asking you where they are ;) I mean, I KNOW where to find them, but not everyone does.   I think the other reason I like the idea of them being in the docs, is because everything else is there, so it just makes sense to throw them in there as well.
Hi,  The problem is with Amazon for example : onPurchaseResponse return BILLING_RESPONSE_ type answers. Same for Samsung it seems.

Thank you for your quick fix @lbroudoux! I just pulled the latest Docker image, and was able to import and test our use-case further.  For Keycloak, I don't seem to have any errors with the functionality, it just jumped out at me as something potentially related to the reported issue. The configuration I'm using is the default docker-compose file found in the Microcks repository. Happy to help troubleshoot further, but this doesn't appear to be impacting me for testing Microcks locally.
I am not sure why, but I have been unable to get any traffic coming from strongbox. Requests and responses from clients to strongboxes are showing up fine, but requests from strongbox to the web are not showing up in my proxy program(fiddler). Maybe does strongbox not respect the system proxy? Or fiddler is not capturing everything for some reason. I am not sure why, but I am working on it.  
Hi! Seems now test working.

I see, but did you try to connect again after turn off/on with device being discoverable? Because my problem is that when Bluetooth turns on I call `establishConnection` and then it hangs.  I am using Nexus 6P, Android N Preview 4  ``` device.establishConnection(context, true)                           .flatMap(rxBleConnection ->                     rxBleConnection.getCharacteristic(CHARACTERISTIC)                             .flatMap(characteristic ->                                      rxBleConnection.writeCharacteristic(setValue(characteristic))                                             .cache()                                             .flatMap(characteristic1 -> readData(rxBleConnection))                             )             ); ```  This is the code. 
This is a segment from logcat last week (our app is com.bynd.looper), which doesn't give a lot of info yet - I'll try to get a longer segment and some stats on how long it takes/etc. Note that it's excessive cpu use, not battery use.  One thing is that it could be that our app does quite a bit of custom processing which is done in the activity, not the navigation service. Although we need that, we might need to look into pushing that into a second service (which would also need to be a foreground service, so will require a second icon in the status bar, which is mildly annoying).  ``` 2019-01-24 14:14:33.299 892-1110/?

I saw that forum post right after my post @wweich. My phone is a LG G5, which has a 64 bit processor. So I guess the change in how the app is compiled is the reason why I'm having problem. 
Sorry for responding late, I didn't receive a notification. I'm using ViaVersion on BungeeCord. Would that be the cause of it?
The library we're using is `com.segment.analytics.android:analytics-core:3.1.4`. We initialize the SDK with a single `Analytics.with(app.getApplicationContext())`, which is injected into activities etc. with Dagger. 
I'm not an expert on database design. What is the advantage of a separate table instead of a new column in the existing table? It seems like it may save a little space but would make queries slower and more complicated with "join" logic.
I have no clue. I guess kotlin have chosen that for better readability. Actually, kotlin is not not checking the type. Also a field of type string like `val isFoo : String` will translate to `isFoo()` and `setFoo(string)` 
Definitely a duplicate. Sorry guys! I reproduced it on my Windows 10 1903 VM after stumbling across this behavior on my production machine.
I am studying Android Apps Lifecycle and how to handle correctly orientation change events :) 
The result for A-B before setting diagonal elements to zero is correct, i.e. 0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000  0.000 -1.000 -1.000  0.000  0.000 -1.000 -1.000 -2.000 -1.000  0.000 -1.000 -2.000 -2.000 -1.000  0.000  0.000 -1.000 -1.000 -1.000  
@niqo01 can you reproduce locally or are you getting this through Crashlytics/Bugsnag etc. ?  
Hello Kay Sure, I did import all default patterns. I did not check for those messages, but will do. It seems to be some misinterpretation of some characters. For example: a numbered field identified as INT is not recognized on gl. Changing to some string, it goes on. On the debugger, this doesn't happen. I'll get that error message and drop to you.

This bug also occurs in v3.6.0. I can confirm it works in v3.5.5.
Many thanks for solution. One more thing I need to ask that how can I get the changed selection item at my custom binding and post update accordingly? I have also defined rule for this. Actually, I am creating one custom binding for testing like when I select timezone from selection then it should display time according to that timezone in Date item. 
ok, i will see
hi @marcalwestf , It is a correction, currently the process generates commission for reverted charges, if the charge is reversed it should not generate commission for this charge since it is a zero charge.

Thx for your response,  I am using gradle version. Will you update gradle version or want me to fix your code in my project?  Thx. 
And I would like to add that, of course, we SHOULD NOT have any static variables in renderers (other than the ones  used to memorize global properties and which NEED to be shared between renderers).  
Deadly World generates a lot more spawners that do a bunch of things; one of them, for instance, will shot tons of arrows all around the place, and another one has got a "ghost zombie" standing on it. When you get near enough, the zombie "comes alive" and gets a primed TNT head to blow you up. That's how I died the second time ç_ç it also adds a crapton of silverfish nests everywhere, and that's how I died the first time...the pro to all this is that you get a reward, usually there's an interesting block in every silverfish nest and a chest under every spawner. Maybe I lost it in the darkness of the cavern, or in an adiacent cavern hidden by a wall. I'll test this further, although I'd rather not die (lol). 
The logs sent by the user had 3 instances of this error. And I didn't see any success logs either.   Username: Jompol0000
It works in 1.7 but not in 1.8 I'll test.

Oh I forgot it, reopen the issue now
http://imgur.com/LmIDMWH nope, same result here :( 
@rombert : The issue seems to be with happening with this specific AEM Project that i am using dev tools with .  AEM Dev Tools -> 1.0.6 Sling IDE Tools --> 1.0.10  The following details may help you guess whats going on ..  Step 1: I have setup an AEM project using information available at https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/lazybones-aem-templates Step 2: Added another content project module to hold initial "authored content" , which is actually packaging and deploying content to "/content"  Step 3:  this project is "develop" branch of my git repo and there is lots of merges already happened . Step 4: Nothing pops out from filter.xml for either of the content projects   Please let me know if you want more details .  Note : When i add some thing in Dev Tools that is syncing into CRX , but the issue is with import operation (getting from crx into local folder)

No, it did not resolve the issue. I'll contact Slack support see what they have to say. Maybe they have a test account you can use. 
If excluded, all worked fine. It’s problem in asm, because this library has restriction  UTF8 length like 65535 
No planets as of yet, here's the temp.dat though.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4UhGIFXzCO6dDlLVzAyYlN0eGM
What do you mean? This bug is for directory 
The solution you provided worked perfectly.  Thank you serge-rider
no authentication. I tested this on the website hurl.it and was able to make it work there by just putting the discord URL in the post line and your template from the json compact notification into the body. didn't change anything on the header and no authentication required.

I'm afraid that I could not post the full debug.log because it has been a long time since I last found it. Fortunately I have latest.log at that time and I can post it here [2019-09-21-2.log](https://github.com/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft/files/3702256/2019-09-21-2.log) Let me discribe this issue again. When players log in the game or complete executing teleport command like /tp or /spawn, they would often get disconnected and the game client would display "A fatal error has occurred, this connection is terminated". They can continue to try to log in the game, then meet the same issue and disconnect again. However, by attempting loging in the game over and over again, they can still get logged in and play normally just like this issue has never happened before until next disconnection. I'm sure only AcademyCraft need LambdaLib in my mod list. To my surprise, I tried to remove AcademyCraft related blocks like Imagfusor(machine) in the chunks which I always played in and the frequency of disconnection actually dropped.

Here is a simplified form. examples document (using all default mapping, no mapping defined by me): {     "id": 1230912,     "min_price": 10,     "name": "bla",     "categories": {         "0": [             [                 1,                 720,                 758,                 781             ],             [                 2,                 3,                 4             ]         ],         "1": [             [                 284             ]         ]     },     "default_variant": {         "attributes": {             "attributes_1": [                 49,                 53             ]         }     } }  and the hive table:  CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE external_sources.elastic_search_products(     product_id BIGINT,     min_price BIGINT,     name STRING,     virtual_categories MAP<STRING,ARRAY<ARRAY<INT>>>,     default_variant MAP<STRING,MAP<STRING,ARRAY<INT>>>) STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler' TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'searching/product/_search?q=*',               'es.nodes'='my_ip_address',               'es.port'='9200',               'es.nodes.discovery' = 'false',               'es.mapping.names' = 'virtual_categories:categories,product_id:id,default_variant:default_variant.attributes.attributes_1'); 
I believe all 3 cards are set to the height of the longest card, so what we're seeing here is cards where the Resources card is longest, which varies by chunk, and therefore the space below source or translation will vary accordingly.  If that is the case, that's fine for now. I guess this will be best we can do, as either the card must extend or the gap between cards is extends.   (I'm working on the Resources layout some more, so will look at this again after that.)

That did it! 👍 Did not think of that.  Thanks so much!

@gunnarmorling I can make a PR but as this is a side R&D project I dont know when it will be ready ..
So I tried different areas in the myst world, it worked.   I went back to my original issue. I was trying to change red stained glass to white stained glass. It was not changing them. Then when I set it to air and then to white, it worked. My guess is that since it was the same ID, but different metadata, it wasn't liking that?  I was even trying 948:0 
I will check and let you know 
It will be broken functionality for anyone upgrading their phones currently. I don't use the feature myself, but the first thing my wife noticed when I handed her a new Pixel was that it wasn't working anymore. She's non-tech, so that's the kind of person who needs to be considered. 
Found the issue; A conflicting config from another mod, causing the compartment cells not to be registered.

Yes the issue still exists in the current version.  I solved it by re-implementing the Filter base class. I used a ScheduledExecutorService to periodically execute the polling of the events on the eth client instead of a while(true) loop with a Thread.sleep(). The problem is that by using a fixed ThreadPool and the busy wait approach, the ExecutorService runs out of threads and its queue grows. I suspect that this leads to a complete blocking of the app process in android systems, since it uses too much resources. I attached my implementation of the Filter class. Please note that I only tested this with a few contracts with 3 events each. So far I don't have any problems, but I haven't tested this solution throughly.

The entire DBeaver application crashes. It closes (the window vanishes) without any alert or error message displayed. Only examining the logs reveals the cause.
@rubensworks  > I assume you meant an exporter on the bottom of the apiary, the importer obviously won't do anything.  No. I have an Importer on the bottom of the apiary. When the queen splits into a princess and drones, the importer pulls them out, then tries to put the princess and any drones it can back in. Combs or drones that don't fit go into the chest.
it didnt have any properties when i mined it which is the thing
I really can't say more than this. The crash report is just this stacktrace.  But I know it's on a device called "Samsung Galaxy Nexus (toro), Android 6.0"  We can also see that it is when we try to show an error message in a lambda initiated from the doLogin function.   This can be as easy as the user has closed the application before the lambda triggered but it can be something bad. Eg. A user not seeing an error message.  This is a reoccurring error every time we release a new version so I thought it should be in the issue list so we can discuss a solution.

@tsmaeder I'm not an expert. I would expect something like this https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/blob/b5a868dc78a1d94e59810addc20e461a05d832b0/extensions/eclipse-che-theia-plugin-ext/src/node/che-api-service.ts#L330

@Lineflyer It looks indeed very similar to the issues you referenced (bit this time with at least a chance to reproduce. 
Thanks, updating version works for me.  BTW, is it possible to force restamp the binary if the head commit changes, even if all dependency is unchanged? AFIK go rule is using STABLE_BUILD_SCM_REVISION instead of BUILD_SCM_REVISION which can force restamp, can cc_binary configured in this way as well?
@DaanHoogland I will double check
Interestingly it also works for me on my local environment:  ``` Darwin Kernel Version 14.0.0 java version "1.8.0_20" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode) ```  But it does not work in AWS  ``` #63-Ubuntu SMP java version "1.8.0_25" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode) ```  The example error logs in my original post were taken from the same application deployed on the same EC2 instance with no known configuration changes. The only difference in the deployed versions of the application code was to upgrade Spring Boot Version and add the 'logging.path=.' property. This upgrade has jumped me from embedded Tomcat 7.0.56 to 8.0.15 so not sure whether that could have anything to do with it... 
Hi Safris,  Thanks for the response. I changed the log level to finer here is the output we got. To me its searching for a manifest which is not available in temp folder .

Simply right clicking the chisel to open it again will essentially rollback the inventory of the chisel to before you chose and removed a chiseled block, but will keep the chiseled block in your inventory therefor duping it.

Hi, Clint:   I don't know how to upload .rar file into gist, so I updated my post in google mail list, and attached the logs of 20 nodes in my post. You can download it from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elasticsearch/mYW-ruxCJ8A   The logs are for 0.90.0.Beta1.     Today I tested the latest the ES version 0.90.0.Beta1, it has the same problem.   My test configure is as following:   20 nodes. 10.96.250.211,212,213 are master nodes. 211 is the leader; 214 and 215 are load balancer; other 15 nodes are data nodes.   My test step is as following:   1) after the cluster is up, I created an empty index: test1 curl -XPUT 10.96.250.214:10200/test1 {"ok":true,"acknowledged":true} curl -XGET 10.96.250.211:10200/_cluster/health?pretty=true {   "cluster_name" : "es-test-0-90-0-beta1",   "status" : "yellow",   "timed_out" : false,   "number_of_nodes" : 20,   "number_of_data_nodes" : 15,   "active_primary_shards" : 15,   "active_shards" : 27,   "relocating_shards" : 0,   "initializing_shards" : 3,   "unassigned_shards" : 0 }   The cluster stayed in this state for long time.  2) Then I created another empty index: abcd1234 curl -XPUT 10.96.250.214:10200/abcd1234 {"ok":true,"acknowledged":false} curl -XGET 10.96.250.211:10200/_cluster/health?pretty=true {   "cluster_name" : "es-test-0-90-0-beta1",   "status" : "red",   "timed_out" : false,   "number_of_nodes" : 20,   "number_of_data_nodes" : 15,   "active_primary_shards" : 29,   "active_shards" : 53,   "relocating_shards" : 0,   "initializing_shards" : 6,   "unassigned_shards" : 1   The cluster stayed in this state for long time  3) Then I created one more empty index:  curl -XPUT 10.96.250.214:10200/1234abcd {"ok":true,"acknowledged":false} curl -XGET 10.96.250.211:10200/_cluster/health?pretty=true {   "cluster_name" : "es-test-0-90-0-beta1",   "status" : "red",   "timed_out" : false,   "number_of_nodes" : 20,   "number_of_data_nodes" : 15,   "active_primary_shards" : 43,   "active_shards" : 78,   "relocating_shards" : 0,   "initializing_shards" : 6,   "unassigned_shards" : 6 }   The cluster stayed in this state for long time.   Thank you.  -Regards- -Dong Aihua- 
No - I've just pulled/reinstalled and its still segfaulting. Will try to narrow it down a bit more.

@freezingWu  you can do this:   insert into name(`channel`) values('xxx')  need escape
It's definitely not correct ;-). Well, you can try to observe `ProcessBean` instead of `ProcessAnnotatedType`, analyze its `ProcessBean.getAnnotated()` and then use `ProcessBean.getBean().getQualifiers()`.
I don't know. I don't think adding an XML file to the classpath makes sense TBH.
Apparently, this is also a known issue in Java map implementation, keys can also leak if they are mutable.   I guess its the users responsibility to be careful.  
@paoloantinori kindly see meta.log above. I don't errors in other pods.
Log taken locally with aLogcat Root: [alogcat_stringlate0.11_export-to-sd_filtered-stringlate.txt](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Stringlate/files/1500361/alogcat_stringlate0.11_export-to-sd_filtered-stringlate.txt) Pretty terse, IMO.
I have been working on this for the last 10 days now. I have created a test case for it and have also re-factored the BlockwiseLayer quite a lot so that it now handles all of this correctly AFAIK. In the course of doing so I completely removed all *special behavior regarding blockwise transfers* from the Matchers as well.  I will push the branch with the changes later during the day so that you guys can take a look. But beware, I made a lot of changes :-) 
Tomorrow evening I guess. Not at my laptop atm

It's been affecting it since the version before the one now on F-Droid. 
Thank you for your work! With '3.1-SNAPSHOT' it works with gradle 6.0.
Hi,  I have no experience in Linux console..... though I would like to help you get this corrected... any other way to help?  By the way, Traditional Chinese language is not shown on the language list, is it possible sony have deleted it from the firmware?  Thanks!  Jack  From: ma1co  Sent: Saturday, June 11, 2016 4:49 AM To: ma1co/OpenMemories-Tweak  Cc: pjack1 ; Author  Subject: Re: [ma1co/OpenMemories-Tweak] Sony RX1R II and RX10M3 error (#59)  There might something different in the firmware of these cameras. But I don't own them and there are no firmware updates out yet. Do you have some linux console experience? Could you dump the firmware on these cameras via telnet? Pleas tell me if you're interested.  — You are receiving this because you authored the thread. Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread. 
I try it with mysql. 
Workarround: I edited the script 'zap.sh' in   '/Applications/OWASP ZAP.app/Contents/Java'.  I disabled line 20 till 25. On these lines a check is done on the system default java interpreter. See code:  ``` bash if [ $JAVA_MAJOR_VERSION -ge 1 ] && [ $JAVA_MINOR_VERSION -ge 7 ]; then     echo "Found Java version $JAVA_VERSION" else     echo "Exiting: ZAP requires a minimum of Java 7 to run, found $JAVA_VERSION"     exit 1 fi ```  Later in the script 'zap.sh' (line 85 till 90) the OS platform is checked. If this is 'Darwin', then the Java 7 provided in the ZAP package is used.   ``` bash #Start ZAP  if [ "$OS" = "Darwin" ]; then   exec ../PlugIns/jre*/Contents/Home/bin/java ${JMEM} -XX:PermSize=256M -Xdock:icon="../Resources/ZAP.icns" -jar "${BASEDIR}/zap-2.4.1.jar" "$@" else   exec java ${JMEM} -XX:PermSize=256M -jar "${BASEDIR}/zap-2.4.1.jar" "$@" fi ```  I think that the check in line 20 till 25 is not needed if running Darwin, because later in the script (line 85 till 90) a check is made on the OS platform. If the OS platform is found to be 'Darwin', the provided Java 7 is always used.  So, line 20 till 25 should be something like (I think):  ``` bash if [ $JAVA_MAJOR_VERSION -ge 1 ] && [ $JAVA_MINOR_VERSION -ge 7 ]; then     echo "Found Java version $JAVA_VERSION" else         if [ "$OS" != "Darwin" ]; then          echo "Exiting: ZAP requires a minimum of Java 7 to run, found $JAVA_VERSION"          exit 1         fi fi ```

I am using Mockito 2.042-beta and mockito-java8 2.0.0-beta.

no, it's not been reported on `minishift`. indeed that let us believe this is caused by resource limits that are set on `fuse-ignite` but not locally on our dev environment.  investigating in that direction right now
Sorry, my bad again. I jumped the gun and used 1.102-SNAPSHOT to build a patch for my internal use.  But I see the issue still exists with MIME type encoding when I use the `1.102-SNAPSHOT`  I am testing like this:  ```   @Test   public void testMIMESmall() throws IOException {      String login = "asthinasthi";     String oauthAccessToken = "";      GitHub gitHub = GitHub.connect(login, oauthAccessToken);      GHRepository ghRepository = gitHub.getRepository("asthinasthi/test-github-api");     GHContentBuilder ghContentBuilder =  ghRepository.createContent();     ghContentBuilder.message("Some commit msg");     ghContentBuilder.path("MIME-Small.md");     ghContentBuilder.content("123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567");     ghContentBuilder.commit();   }    @Test   public void testMIMELong() throws IOException {      String login = "asthinasthi";     String oauthAccessToken = "";      GitHub gitHub = GitHub.connect(login, oauthAccessToken);      GHRepository ghRepository = gitHub.getRepository("asthinasthi/test-github-api");     GHContentBuilder ghContentBuilder =  ghRepository.createContent();     ghContentBuilder.message("Some commit msg");     ghContentBuilder.path("MIME-Long.md");     ghContentBuilder.content("1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678");

At least in the current state of the conversion method this might happen - of course I could also adapt this in the implementation to convert both \n and \r\n to breaks which is probably better. 
Initially, I wanted to export a model from a FeatureHouse project. For testing, I also tried models of Antenna, FeatureC++ and Munge and all exports failed.  Error Log isn't containing anything regarding this export or its failure. My first guess is that some class or method in the ImageExport plugin was "refactored" and the respective call from FeatureIDE via Java Reflections doesn't get any result but I'm not sure. 
We can add a simple `AtomicBoolean` flag to the `Tracker` object, and raise it when `setUserId` is called. Then in the following call to the `track` method we could check that flag after the call to `injectBaseParams` and if it's *raised* inject the "deviceParams" and lower the flag. What do you think @d4rken ? (I ran a little test and seems to be working fine now)
It's the same but it auto generates the run config so it's more convenient
So that during the compilation of `module-info.java`, the Java compiler sees the packages exported by Kotlin (otherwise, javac complains on the first `exports` clause, claiming there's no such package).  However, in #99 and #101, we've established that we won't be changing the destination dir of `compileJava` (or any other task) at all. Instead, we'll add the destination dirs to modulepath (for compilation), or produce a special "merged" dir with outputs (for run/test).
Yes, sorry, there was another one right below it. For some reason the line numbers are not really interesting; they point to the declarations of the classes containing the methods in the stack rather than to the lines that are executing.  However, it's a NullPointerException that has MapActivity$GetGeolocationAndMapItTask.onPostExecute and then MapActivity.access$500 at the top of the stack, so it seems reasonable to assume setPositionAndMarker is crashing due to mMap being null.  I can test that hypothesis later today if it's not easy for you to do it :) 
Good point, this started happening after upgrading to BuildCraft 7

i think it lets me hold it but when i place it it is only visible to me and nobody else on the server also if i rejoin it wont even for for me anymore in 1.8
Only those tickets load that are replied or performed any action on any of the tickets that are assigned to me in mytickets but those tickets dont load that are not performed any action but assigned to me which are suppose to be showing under my tickets

On Linux, things worked fine, because capitalization was correct for the package names (ie nameWithCapitalLetters.launcher instead of namewithcapitalletters.launcher.) 
for your quick response. I tried "gast" (again) but also does not work. I have OSXFUSE installed, does that interfere?

Thanks for the hint! I just had it regenerated, it works wonderfully! Have a great day :)
We do not _need_ it, but since we already have Git mirrors on SourceForge (e.g. for Fiji) we might just as well keep them up-to-date, no? Should be relatively easy, too.

Yep , i have more mods installed do you want the list?
That's what we are doing right now.  Check `variables[0].value` in the example it's not json parsable. So we cannot provide a meaningful output in the UI
I have Eclipse plugin 4.0.18.v20181220-1448 with PMD 6.10.0 installed.  I see that PMD 6.11.0 just came out but the Eclipse plugin is still version 4.0.18.v20181220-1448.
Yes, but the odd issue is GLOBAL_SUBJECT doesn't migrate properly if I attempt to do groups directly after. If I ONLY migrate GLOBAL_SUBJECT, it works fine. I messaged you on discord with more information including test files.

My server is the latest spigot with patched. I bypassed this problem by cutting and pasting entire mine structure around and moved them far away that the coordinates don't overlap. But it is not the solution i was hoping for.  
HikariCP version: 2.7.8 Sometimes I get it:  https://hastebin.com/adujexiqad.md 'Does it only happen under load?' -This happens when I'm spamming with method which executes something to mysql, or 'two users' are using over 2 methods, in 3-5 seconds (i think so)  Example: ```java final String updateString = "UPDATE `users` SET `group`=? WHERE UUID=?"; try (final Connection con = CorePlugin.getInst().getHikari().getConnection();       final PreparedStatement update = con.prepareStatement(updateString)) {    update.setString(1, args[1]);    update.setString(2, uuid.toString());    update.executeUpdate(); } ``` (https://hastebin.com/peyudexedu.swift)  ```java hikari = new HikariDataSource(); hikari.setDataSourceClassName("com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource"); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("serverName", getConfig().getString("mysql.host")); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("port", getConfig().getString("mysql.port")); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("databaseName", getConfig().getString("mysql.database")); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("user", getConfig().getString("mysql.user")); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("password", getConfig().getString("mysql.password")); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("autoReconnect",true); hikari.addDataSourceProperty("tcpKeepAlive", true); hikari.setMaximumPoolSize(100); hikari.setMinimumIdle(0); hikari.setIdleTimeout(1); ```
I'm sorry but I dont know which android method to start debug with. Could you tell me the code related to this function so I could use android studio to see the values come out. 
Images at http://imgur.com/a/hJDbm The problem occurs if the mouse goes over the red diamond. That widget does not have a text filled in so toString tries to use a null pointer. One image is before I fill things in, 2nd image is after adding materials.  The machine processes one cycle and then stops.  25mb of water is used and 25mb of liquid growth medium is produced and piped out.   (I guess that's a bug too since it has a valid recipe but isn't processing it).  [crash-2017-08-23_10.21.48-client.txt](https://github.com/ForestryMC/Binnie/files/1247945/crash-2017-08-23_10.21.48-client.txt)  Edit:  Figured out some more info.  It wasn't just one cycle -- the machine ran until water got down to 475mb and then it stopped.  I want to let the water run dry and reuse the same machine to process a different recipe, and it refuses to continue until I give it more water.  So IMO it is indeed two bugs but I'll leave just this one report for now.  :)
Really? If you do it without LWC you cant invade the house. 
Yes it works with an empty list. I updated to Syncthing 0.14 and this problem is still there. Its an Samsung GT-S7710 on Android 4.1.2 
I tried using it with the oficial deb too.  Arch is also using an official release. https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/bazel#n15

This only happens with reactors that have a really big height...(This statement is wrong) so yeah only if assembled or the controller has information of it being assembled? 
From my investigation this was caused by a change in `GrpcFirestoreRpc`; I've opened a PR #3460  that does the "minimal thing" to get correct overriding behavior if that's the direction y'all want to go.
Yes, I had worldguard. Build version 1722, the latest build version (as of replying this message). The dev builds are from here:  http://builds.enginehub.org/job/worldguard?branch=string-ids 
Thank you, Moritz!  I wasn't sure if I'll receive such a nice answer due to my angry expressed post but you made my day! Yes, I am happy if I can help you testing your code. I have 100,000 active app users. THEY will test it for you.  Aside from that: Is there no other way to use an IAB plugin for Cordova which is not basing on that buggy Google code from 2012? Also I wrote an email to Trevor Johns, the developer of that java code asking him if he really things that the bugs are all fixed. He is not responsible for anything but should tell the truth if someone asks him. An IAB plugin is not a nice to have plugin. It is essential for surviving for indie developers who code in Cordova.  Best regards from Dortmund ;-) Marc
Yes it's openjdk 11 if it's a known Bug, then it's no problem. I use the workaround TLS1.2
I made a simple test db first containing elements with one-letter text   only (like <p>x A x B x C x</p>).  For real data, i.e., with text   containing real words, indexed and stemmed (German), the phenomena   occur.  You could try the attached file and these queries:  for $i in //*[text() contains text ("Mühle Teufel" any word) ftand  "und"] return $i  for $i in //*[text() contains text ("Mühle" ftor "Teufel") ftand  "und"] return $i  The strange behavior of ftand and all words I noticed some weeks ago   and therefore switched to ftand instead of all words.  But then I got   stuck with ftor.  Maybe this is also related to issue  https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex/issues/359 
Yep, errors appear to be gone. Woot :-) 
Can we extend the functionality of RuleRegistry with method requestUniqueID() ?

It said in chat: Stopping minigame...  Sent everyone back to the lobby and still had the colours.  Edit: This also happened with shears on the sheep game. 
Because this has been a recent change in this release, what we are going to do in this version is allow users write --password without raising an exception. However, if that's the case we will print a warning message saying that they should not do it and that it will be forbidden in future releases.  Regarding adding --password automatically to the other command lines, that will be probably added in a future release.
By "valuable" I mean with matter values :). Every item that got value during calculation/recalculation process will have that value untill restart. So, every vanilla item like coal, wood or ingots for example will have their fixed matter values but crafting table or chest will not. I will send you log when I will be able to generate proper one for report purpose.

Sure, my personal server is w5castv5k4dhwexj.onion, however it's not open to registration at the moment.  It was a while ago I set it up so I can't remember if I made a root signed CACert for the hidden service, however I know I did so for the non-hidden service and would be surprised if I hadn't. I'll try to check later. 
hey ojw28, yup, seems to be a duplicate - I will use the search next time, sorry ;) I'll use the original issue for further comments on the issue 
Thanks. Updated to 2.0.3-SNAPSHOT, the bug fixed.

Actually, my setup looks almost exactly like the 'edge case' you've described (with HaProxy instead of nginx), but with one important difference:  > [ Browser ] -> HTTPS -> [ haproxy ] -> HTTP + X-Fowarded-Proto -> [ Tomcat + RemoteIpValve ]  So haproxy sets the X-Fowarded-Proto header, so Tomcat knows that the original request is secure. I.e. requests.isSecure() returns true. No need to configure HTTPS for Tomcat! IMO this is the correctly configured version of tne edge case - which is not so edgy at all IMO.

I don't have it fixed locally just bypassed the bug in my code, but I can make a PR for it, and with the other issues that I have found.
Hi, sorry for delayed response, I've tested it, the pedestal of rending works fine on everything but Omothol creatures, so I guess It's the same issue. Hope this will help.
I see @timoe already did. :)
I installes syncany with Homebrew and then the gui plugin with syncany itself.  ``` $ sy plugin install gui Plugin successfully installed from https://www.syncany.org/dist/plugins/releases/gui/syncany-plugin-gui-macosx-x86_64-0.4.3-alpha.jar Install location: /Users/andreas/.config/syncany/plugins/lib/syncany-plugin-gui-0.4.3-alpha.jar ```  ``` $ sy -v 0.4.2-alpha+SNAPSHOT.1503111913.gitUNKNOWN ```  How can I update syncany to 0.4.3? 
I have searched these string too and found that in landscape mode video view doesn't fill screen fully. I mean  that some text below the video view 
The previous issue is gone but now a new issue exists. The message states, "No '.java' file or non-empty source folder was selected in a valid module". I appreciate your development on this project. 
What do you mean by demarshalling? 
We use the client certificate to login to Liima and don't use passwords. Also it only happens sometimes.
Yes I did. But I also used it to make the second one. I fact I use it 99.99% of the times I make a pattern. Even in the Pattern Encoder.
sorry for late reply...here the logs  http://pastebin.com/7kEPWdMK 
Any help appreciated. :)
Hm, this is strange. PHP autoloading loads this aliased class without any error on Linux (with case sensetive filesystem)
The problem for which I created the issue has occurred in the screenshot by PaulWestphal. I have also marked the places which I see the problem again in the attachment.  Regards, Manoj  
dear phillipp,  pardon, i have to ask, what calls do i have to make to get the things you asked for ? i can provide you the "create table" statement. but i don´t know howto get the other things you asked for. there are some sensitive data. i would like to send you these infos in private, hope thats okay for you.  
Thanks @kevinykuo for the stack trace. I'm running RStudio Server in Docker and was having a hard time getting a terminal attached so that I could run `gdb`.

Hey Scott,  Yeah I guess a fix was the wrong word to use.  I can't provide the exception until I get to work tomorrow.  But what I can say is that getThreadLocalInstance() is never called.  I noticed that method was there, but I wasn't sure if we were supposed to call that directly or not.  As all we do is repeatedly call writeImage when we are writing out our billboards.  I'll provide the stack trace tomorrow.  -Jon  On Mon, Jun 24, 2013 at 5:15 PM, Scott Hunter notifications@github.comwrote:  > Your fix may just be hiding a bigger threading problem.

@CindyZX I first saw the problem in the Zowe 1.0.0 build we have on our LPAR and then recreated it using the latest master branch on my local machine.  The problem occurs when invoking an API under the api route ```yaml routes:         - gatewayUrl: api  # [api/ui/ws]/v{majorVersion}           serviceRelativeUrl: / ```
Please look at the header with menu. It is short and (presumably) should determine the borders of the page. Every content below should 'fit' within. This table violates that boundary, and whole page does not look symmetric at all.   Here is another screen from app which in my opinion is correct: I think that this is how this should look like:  http://postimg.org/image/mjw6e61h9/  Container class in css is quite clear about it: width: 700px; 
step: 1. use default setting, format wrong 2. change the delimiter, format ok now it's ok maybe my workspace is create too early;

I would not say 66de8b78e7620b42039b31dd87eab3af12d13a01 caused this, as it is actually a step towards fixing this issues. Just invoking the Xtend compiler a second time after the Tycho compiler was missing: 09da09d06809b8d7fe03e061a0735f6a6027c3f1
Hi Martin,  Cool ! Mystery solved ! I did buy Aedict3 for the popup service and installed on request, without actually opening it not even once, so the dictionaries weren’t downloaded.  I guess for a first time users that come straight for the popup, it would make sense to put an warning dialog suggesting to download the dictionaries.  Anyhow, everything works now, Thanks !

I think you mis understood what I'm saying ;) 
There was fastcraft installed. No texture or shader. AMD 4600 series. 
We're building with gradle, and the relevant part of our resolution strategy is that we don't allow dependencies with conflicting versions. E.g: `configurations.all { 	resolutionStrategy { 		failOnVersionConflict() 	} }` We can solve this by excluding transitive dependencies for a given dependency, and lock down the version by defining an explicit dependency. This we must live with when separate dependencies have transitive conflicts, but we prefer not to do so for a single dependency in isolation.

You are right, is it ok after refreshing. So the cause seems to be the same as for #4472.

Hello again!    Sorry for bringing poor information about the bug, I was a little busy. Today I have been 2 entire hours making a deep investigation on this bug on a new empty server, and I figure it out a lot of things.   The first thing I have to noticed, is that the bug doesn't actually comes entirely from Essentials, and now I'm confused about considering this a bug or not, maybe it is likely more a conflict problem that was actually fixed by Essentials, but not fully fixed (you will understand it after reading the How to reproduce the bug)  **How to reproduce the bug, step-by-step** - You will need the following 6 plugins (Vault, EssentialsX, EssentialsXChat, ChatInyector and its dependencies: PlaceHolderAPI and ProtocolLib) *Forget about LuckPerms, I used it for letting "Test" shout a message to demostrate you that the format [Shout] is already fixed. ![2020-03-05_11 17 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43190931/75990759-1e246200-5ed4-11ea-8910-ed90d028469b.png) - After having the 6 plugins downloaded, you must download Player expansion for PlaceHolderAPI with _/papi ecloud download Player_. Then, the only thing you need to change on the config.yml of Essentials is on the EssentialsChat section. You must enable the radius chat, changing it from 0 to any number higher than it (in my case: 100 blocks). - On the "format:" you must change it from "<{DISPLAYNAME}> {MESSAGE}" to "<{player_name}> {MESSAGE}" and here it comes the big question, "Why would you change the displayname variable with player_name?" Well, first of all, remember this is the fastest way to reproduce the bug, but on my detailed server I use it for avoiding players who used to be Vip group with their nickname changed, to show their realname whenever their Vip group would expire, or also to obligate players with staff groups inherited, to always show their real name, even if before becoming staff they had a custom nickname defined. There are a lot more reasons about this, but I won't be splashing much more on this, as it's not the topic. - You can now restart the server. And after you do, you will need to join the server with two differrent accounts for obviously reasons. One of them will need to have OP so that way you can "Spy" the messages sent by the other account when it is out of the chat-radius.  **So, after following those steps, you will notice this results:** ![2020-03-05_11 17 28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43190931/75992507-d6eba080-5ed6-11ea-9719-070f65bdb94c.png)  The name I used for the one that is OP and will spy the messages is "Tomi010817", and for the one that will send the messages, is "Test".   As you can see, when "Test" sent a raw message as Local, and "Tomi010817" was out of his chat-radius, "Tomi010817" didn't have other alternative of spying the local message, so you can clearly see that the placeholder on the Spy Local format "[L][SPY]" gets bugged, showing the name of the one who spies it (in this case Tomi010817). This also happens with other placeholders intended to show stuff owned by "Test" instead of "Tomi010817" (for example his Rank, I will attach an extra example image of the bug including group ranks also, at the end of the reply)  I think that this should be fixed by Essentials and not by other plugin author, because Essentials has already fixed this problem with the Local format "[L]" and with the Shout format "[Shout]" (you can see on the image above that the bug doesn't occur with those chat formats) So I will guess that Essentials only forgot to also fix this problem with the [L][Spy] chat format.    Below this, I will also bring you the same example but also using group ranks. ![2020-03-05_11 09 25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43190931/75994040-23d07680-5ed9-11ea-922f-b60e2d35df90.png)   The last message sent by "Test" on both example images, is the same message but "Tomi010817" is inside the chat-radius of "Test", so "Tomi010817" doesn't have any need to spy the message, and you can see that that format is fixed.   In short words, Essentials maybe forgot to also fix the compatibility with ChatInyector, on the Local Spy "[L][Spy]" chat format.  Hope you can read this, and if you could, thank you very much for taking the time of reading this long text. 💜 if you want more detailed info about the problem, or even join the server and see the bug with me, you can add me on discord: Tomi010817#8699      
Where would it be located? I can't find any other one.
Trying now 
Hi @benas,  Just tested and looks like it's working now.   Thanks for making this project - its been very useful to me.  Peter 
Basically I had a config server and client in one microserver. I was trying to get rid of the config server being an own instance. Maybe this was a not so good idea  ``` spring:   application:     name: myservice   groovy:     template:       check-template-location: false   cloud:     config:       uri: http://localhost:8884       enabled: true       server:         enabled: true         git:           uri: ${gitRepoUrl}           username: ${git.username}           password: ${git.password}           basedir: ${git.basedir}  ```

yes..sir 
No this is about you having to manually set permissions on entity classes before a user can do anything. It should be runAsSystem so If a user has edit rights on an entity he/she can annotate that entity without problems  On 14 September 2015 at 20:59, Morris Swertz notifications@github.com wrote:  > What would be the expected behavior?

The driver needs definitely to be improved.  Still the current behaviour of Dbeaver to just fail is not good. Squirrel or Eclipse Data Management Tools are working fine with HIVE.   I thought of creating a new plugin for HIVE which works around the Metadata topics, but I haven't fully understood how to inherit/overwrite the jdbc exec classes. A new plugin would also allow to handle JAR uploads for user defined functions etc. 
I was pretty sure it was on the oracle jdk 1.8. But it was on some other people computer, so I need to test it on my own one before being sure.

> What kind of customizations do you have in mind? Can you give an example?  As I wrote in the description: for example install `yarn` into `che-nodejs8-centos` image (it has just npm) or unset `MAVEN_CONFIG` environment variable for maven based images.  
It would seem like this could quite probably be the change...since it has significantly changed the way the container is loaded. 
ok, then, please, explain your vision on which way you are encouraging to use for development of Che and how to debug Che without changing default logging level. 
Done !  The workaround solves my problem, however I wanted to avoid writing xpath in my scenario. No worries, I saw you fixed the issue in 0.7.1 version. Will wait for it to be available in maven.  Also for others help, there is one more workaround I used: In scenarioFile: * replace req.${request_uuid} = request_uuid And in xml I changed : OfferID="#(request_uuid)" to OfferID="${request_uuid}"
No problem. My new pi arrived on wednesday. I hope I can work on it next monday 
Let me try to explain how views actually look: 1. Video Texture fits all the screen, but actually rendering may not cover all it's area (for example: screen 1080x2220 and typical video 16:9 is rendering like 1080x608 and other area is just black). It's necessary to have such a big texture to be able make animated transitions/scales/crops/etc from one screen to another. 2. If SubtitleView measured like 1080x2220 then we have a huge size of text and it's not I'am expect.     If it is measured to video frame size 1080x608 and located in screen center over video then there's a bug when cues rendered somewhere bottom outside subtitle's view. 
can i use Utube? I'm going to make it 我可以使用Utube 视频吗？

@davidfestal From the New Module, New Source File, or New Package wizards I mean.  
Nodes should be self-contained.  Lustre does not have a concept of "global" variables.  In this case, the node foo() refers to a variable outside of its scope.  When we translate into jkind, this triggers an error because the node foo() is translated as a separate node from the "main" node that contains the definitions for system A and system implementation A.impl. 
If you are referring to official 1.7 update, no because EchoPet would not launch with 1.7. If you are referring to the protocol patch which I'm pretty sure was 99% bukkit 1.6.4, yes. I'm not sure if it matters, but I also changed the config around for all pet names so instead of saying for example Chicken Pet, it says Pet Chicken. 
To create a tileLevel the user must supply an image of the map. The map is a one pixel to one tile ratio. The mapColor is the color the developer should use in the map image to represent that specific Tile.  So if the user uses #000000 for the mapColor than any place in the map image that the color #000000 appears the tile defined mapColor will appear 
I tested it on some apps and appears to be working correctly.  Importantly it doesn't appear to have broken anything either. 
> does the exception happen when building the model or when calling setContent?  When calling `setContent()` with something that starts with `//`.  I don't think I'll find the time to create a complete test case though...

@jpountz I didn't expect the numbers to be highlighted in the query. To say the truth, we only realized we were automatically including numeric fields in the "highlight" section after this error came up (it is an ID in the real scenario). Maybe this should be an error, but with a different message, like "numeric values cannot be highlighted" or something like that. 
ok with  passLimit=0 the server seemed to survive the 15 minutes idle. wierd thing was that when chopping the first tree it took some time 3 blocks for the physics to kick in. 
Cheers, I appreciate it. This has really given me some headaches over the last two weeks.  Could it be that it has something to do with my Ubuntu VMs not having enough resources to keep all threads and ssh connections alive? I find it quite weird that I never observed this issue on my (way more powerful) Windows machines.

Some information: 1) Is plain JPA (was migrated from EclipseLink 2.6) and doesn't use Panache 2) Can't try with Alpha1 because the app doesn't even start...
Yup. I have to admit, I am a C/C++/kernel guy but I will look at it. I think it's a JRE thing.  Rob 
It has absolutely nothing to do with the contents of the function, but here:  ```vbs options:     STORAGE: scripts      function register(name: text, version: text, author: text):     set {{@STORAGE}::%{_name}%} to {_name}     set {{@STORAGE}::%{_name}%::version} to {_version}     set {{@STORAGE}::%{_name}%::author} to {_author} ``` It's defined in another script.

Yes, that's better. Thanks 
No, just optimized the `HashChain.follows()` method which is used heavily by the changes in `LocalSplitter`. One user saw his compilation time go from 9 minutes to 37 minutes. :-) This fix brings it back to about the same in my tests. 
It always doing it everytime i start the server,i did not use the /reload command,nopey

you decide 
Yes @johspaeth   The test case passes when we change the reference type of `engine` to `AESLightEngine` along with below assertions. ``` Assertions.notHasEnsuredPredicate(engine); Assertions.mustNotBeInAcceptingState(engine); ``` 
@HeinrichReimer I just migrated from an old version of your library to the latest version, I was using DrawerView so I replaced it with DrawerFrameLayout everywhere in my code and since then I am getting this error 
If I clear the workspace, then my history will gone. I would like to preserve the history results, but without test cases that are not in the project. 
Thanks for your quick reply. There are errors, I took a screenshot from the log: ![screenshot_2015-07-26-00-23-52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4226042/8891515/6f27741c-332d-11e5-8dc9-62172cd2d055.png)  Otherwise I'm using a Fairphone with Android 4.2.2 Not sure what info I could provide else? 
I don't see the ability to disable Syntax Highlighting through the Syntax menu.  Only see Auto Detect, Plain, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML.  I changed it from Autodetect/JavaScript to Plain, but it only applies to that one JS response.  Is there another way to disable application wide (not seeing it in Options)?
what /ejump or essentials:jump does is just stick on the same block, it doesn't go where the center of the mouse pointed to
Hi, I tried with Firefox and Chrome on MacOs (same laptop I run the executable), right now I don't have my work laptop with me, will try it tomorrow. 
@mfussenegger Thanks for your quick response.  I just tried the REFRESH command and it didn't work. I test this with multiple node. Let me setup a single node cluster and try this again. Will get back to you later.  Best regards, Ryan
yes, I have to change the phrase there.   The issue for delete Object is #309 
Indeed same id as #502. I'm not surprised that more than only I tried. The offer was 'too good to be true', Over a hundred euro under marketprice. It must have been a mistake by the seller. Could it be that you can't see the offer because the seller realised that it was a mistake and he/she **withdrew** it, **yet** it is still visible for (amongst others) me and martysto of #502? While it was actually long gone?  I confirm I lost 3 x 0,001 btc to 1FdFzBazmHQxbUbdCUJwuCtR37DrZrEobu = € 1,67 @ 555. 
I guess my environment is behind the firewall, so that I copy settings.xml (contains the proxy settings) to /home/users/.m2 fold.  How do I do in the devfile? 
My configuration is this  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1606069/27844304-2c4541ba-6152-11e7-9fc0-f23623770514.png)  But even I add something in configuration, still the same problem.  ``` /usr/local/Cellar/elixir/1.4.5/bin/elixir -pa /private/var/folders/gt/r1p1xhl93h5d5nh0tvwtjckw0000gn/T/intellij_elixir_debugger1 /usr/local/bin/mix intellij_elixir.debug_task --debugger-port 51571 -- run --no-halt ** (EXIT from #PID<0.73.0>) an exception was raised:     ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, :ehostunreach}         lib/debug_server.ex:9: IntellijElixir.DebugServer.init/1         (stdlib) gen_server.erl:365: :gen_server.init_it/2         (stdlib) gen_server.erl:333: :gen_server.init_it/6         (stdlib) proc_lib.erl:247: :proc_lib.init_p_do_apply/3 ```  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1606069/27844308-64601cfa-6152-11e7-9a1d-f899257cf1b6.png) 
Fixed with https://github.com/welovecoding/editorconfig-netbeans/issues/57. 
Usage:   ``` java @TypeHint(value=AbstractInterfaceDocs.class) public IMyInterface getSomething() {     return new SomeImplementationClass; } ```  original class:  ``` java @XmlRootElement public abstract class AbstractInterfaceDocs implements IMyInterface {   /**    * Gets Information about stuff    */   @Override   @XmlElement   public abstract String getInformation(); } ```  generated class with abstract modifier:  ``` java @JsonInclude( JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL ) @JsonIgnoreProperties( ignoreUnknown = true ) public abstract class AbstractInterfaceDocs implements java.io.Serializable {    @JsonIgnore   private java.lang.String _information;    /**    * Gets Information about stuff    */   @JsonProperty( value = "information", required = false )   public java.lang.String getInformation() {     return this._information;   }    /**    * Gets Information about stuff    */   @JsonProperty( value = "information", required = false )   public void setInformation(java.lang.String _information) {     this._information = _information;   } } ``` 
Nope. This must be the lack of API testing. 
You can do the same thing in your interceptor by calling `System.nanoTime()` ! 
Ah thanks, I didn't spot that this was a duplicate. I tested my environment against the master branch and I'm no longer seeing the error. I think this can probably be marked as a duplicate so I'll apply that label and close it.  Duplicate of https://github.com/imageworks/OpenCue/issues/270

In the web interface and in my desktop client everything is correct (except for the screwed up files mentioned in owncloud/core#5559). I've checked remote.php/webdav now, it looks quite alright. The broken files from 5559 isn't visible there, so I guess they can't interfere with anything then.  I'm on app version 1.4.6. Phone is Xperia Ray running LegacyXperia 10.2 (a non official CyanogenMod branch). I'll try to get a logcat of a synchronization... 
I've added a zip file which follows the following: 1) Shows current view folder structure 2) Create a new root folder under "\Views"  3) Move the subfolder "\Data\OMS" which has subfolders and views to the newly created folder. 4) Shows new folder state 5) Pre Export 6) Export 7) After closing the model and trying to re-import, receives the import error regarding bad counts.  [ImportError.zip](https://github.com/archi-contribs/database-plugin/files/3734837/ImportError.zip)   (i also attempted to just replicate the folders and only move the views themselves, but it fails for the same reasons)
As far I can see just with wifi and cell tile. 
Oh, right, what was I thinking...  Forge 1566 Minecraft 1.7.10 AgriCraft-1.7.10-1.4.5.jar  Sorry 
Thanks for fixing the html("") issue.  The append issue: I was passing null and it is causing a NPE, empty string does not cause a NPE. Sorry for the confusion.  In jQuery sending null does not cause an error, however in Jerry it ends up requiring an extra "if" statement to make sure your string is not null and not cause a NPE.

As an example, I have the  ID for the entity public_rnaseq_3_Samples (in above example example_ID) and I want to get the information that is in the public_rnaseq_3_Input_file, to which public_rnaseq_3_Samples has an mref. I don't know which ID in public_rnaseq_3_Input_file is linked to example_ID of public_rnaseq_3_Samples, but if I request  public_rnaseq_3_Samples/example_ID/input_file_paths/  I get the mref data from Input_file_paths that is lined to example_ID.  What would be a better way to get this? 
Works now. 
I was not using experience fragments before. Currently, I am on AEM 6.4.2 and tried with  ACS Commons 3.18.0, 3.18.2 and 3.19.0. all version have this issue. After uninstalling ACS commons package I am not getting this error.
Sure @wilkinsona !  That worked prior Spring Boot `1.3`. The `MessageChannelMetricWriter` was declared in the `MetricRepositoryAutoConfiguration`. Plus the `metricsChannel` has been declared there as well.  That's why my old answer on SO is pretty simple: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29627061/subscribe-to-spring-metrics-channel.  Not sure that it was a good idea to declare a channel as an out-of-the-box feature with its own `TaskExecutor`. So, I don't see reason to reinstate it. From one hand we are already far away from `1.2`, from other the Doc clarifies what to do http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-metrics.html#production-ready-metrics-message-channel-integration:  > If a MessageChannel bean called metricsChannel exists,   I think `MetricExportAutoConfigurationTests#defaultExporterWhenMessageChannelAvailable()` should ensure that `MessageChannelMetricWriter` is present in the `MetricExporters`. 
@anshooarora : I checked with the SparkReporter. It also has similar issues: the result shown on the Tests-tab is correct but on the Dashboard-tab not, see these 2 sceenshots:  ![2020-02-01_18h46_56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54316676/73596575-70641300-4523-11ea-8e12-96d5012f12d3.png)  ![2020-02-01_18h46_32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54316676/73596581-8a055a80-4523-11ea-84ce-ce516763a1f7.png)  
The kilo version of OpenStack. I use the method org.openstack4j.openstack.identity.internal.ServiceManagerServiceImpl.createEndpoint to create a endpoint for service. Got an error that the request entity has not JsonRootName.  v2 version api support this request  This is the request info. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11000963/8372819/544dd71a-1c19-11e5-8469-83fd74b20808.png) 
I can't reproduce now either... Strange! I close the issue
Yes, that's exactly it. Something like "Removed 17,500 old storage entries from the database". I can get my exact logs for you if you want.  I did go into settings and shut off the "archive old data" since these lines of text really make no dent in the storage, so no reason to erase data from players who have not played in a while. But that did not make a difference with this.  Any way to stop this from happening? It would be a HUGE help to us and finally solve our headache of players never having their times.

It's a good thought, but my gut is to leave it as-is.  Here's a couple reasons:  - if a misformed MAT-file happens to have the `global` flag set in a non-root array, what would you do?  Ignore it?  Throw an error? - looking at the `MatFile` interface, the only way to get the `isGlobal()` value is through the `Iterable<NamedArray> getEntries()`.  That's okay, but it's a little awkward for people who care about the `isGlobal()` but want to access via map or index  It's not crazy to change it, but it does seem like a bit of an impedance mismatch with the file format.  It's too bad that there's a mismatch between the underlying format and the semantic meaning, but there's too many MAT files out there to change it now ;-)
@createbyte I am not sure what you are requesting. are you trying to fix this bug? or just be able to send notifications?

Refactoring branch, and no local changes. Are you running it on OS X? The error seems to be OS X specific, which is what I'm running on my MacBook. 
@jsotuyod Thanks!   We don't have any other interesting changes in our 5.3.x branch, except for the ones already mentioned. Unfortunately, we have to stay at 5.3.x for a while because we still need to support Java 6.  Should I submit a pull request to have it merged to master?
Thanks for the quick response and for having already addressed the issue by the sounds of it.  Just updated to v3.2.10. Will try it in a few hours when I head home and report back.
@JamesSmartCell no, can pull from the repo provider etc. It has versioning to prevent such an attack.

@marcingrzejszczak My problem is that ExecutorBeanPostProcessor creates proxy of DelegatingSecurityContextSchedulingTaskExecutor which during execution forwards call to yet another task executor. It cannot do so, because the delegate field is null
I have Client (java code on eclipse neon on my laptop) and server (java code on eclipse che at codenvy). I am not able to establish the connection between them because full access of virtual servers (CentOs+java or Ubuntu+java) are restricted. 
Well spotted, that seems quite likely to be the cause.  The scale bar seems to be behaving as if zoom were still an int.
You can give a lamp object a wire by right clicking it. This won't cause the block to update if the only wire is another lamp with a wire in it, the two won't connect. It works fine if you feed it wire next to an ordinary cable on the ground because the other cable block updates the lamp but if the other cable is a lamp with a phantom wire, neither will connect.
Yes, doing SNI also would be great. For a separate follow up PR though please.

il will try to dig my home computer for a log tonight. (i think i renamed the log after i came back, so i may still have it). Otherwise, to fix the problem on my home computer, i  deleted the EVA_Propellant.cfg, and it seem to work but crashed later on a invalid checksum.  I also tried to do a "sy down" from a fresh "sy connect" directory but the sync failled on a "invalid checksum". Look like something is corrupt now. 
There's no more logs for the null pointer entry. There's a ton of logs for the headers and each of the 2K requests do you want me to post those? All of those responded with 200 OK though.
Latest version of NPCLib (1.4.1 I think)  I've simply added the plugin itself as a dependency. (This issue did not occur with version 1.3)
@bclozel here you go https://github.com/lazystone/spring-bugs/tree/22973  It works on SB 2.0.9, but if you change SB version to 2.1.x here https://github.com/lazystone/spring-bugs/blob/22973/build.gradle.kts#L6  Then test will fail.

Well, I am still using API6 but I might consider switching to API7 if you don't plan to support older versions of sponge.  I can also change my code with 4.10
This is the used Docker version: Docker version 1.9.1, build a34a1d5 i installed it as suggested in the docuentation OS: CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)  Running as virtual machine in Openstack environment. I saw the same error on 1.14.4. After approx. two weeks cloudbreak failed and i cloud not reach the WebUI although i could ssh into the machine. After updating to 1.16.1 it worked again...
Yes, just a plain black ink sack.   We also tested with wool once, but it was just white instead of colored
This behavior was produced in the 2.3.0 currently in the Ubuntu 14.04 repos (I don't think it's any kind of milestone release).  However the database corruption I think caused it comes from a 2.2 version. 
@llorllale Thanks for the fix. @0crat Thanks for the invitation to join but I prefer to work for you for free.

Yes, Shuttle has the same exact issue.  Tried ID3 Fixer and selecting the "fix android database" on the songs fixed it (though I had to do it for the entire album, including songs that weren't affected, so they would get merged under the same album properly), thanks a lot! 
Please use nlpCancer in domain repo. I reran using that ontology and the same error was produced in pt02 report.
I have configured Actuator with the following context path: ``` # Management management:   context-path: /api/management ``` Then I'm calling the endpoint ```http://localhost:8080/api/management/env``` with Postman, which results in the NPE.  Calling any other Actuator endpoint, such as ```/api/management/health``` or ```/api/management/metrics```, works fine.

I believe @LeifBrooks and @pyashwanthkumar have already expressed an interest to look into it, but if you would still like to investigate, feel free to do so and report back your findings. Otherwise, you can have a look around our issue tracker for something else to pick up.  Please, feel free to join our [chat channel](https://chat.carlspring.org/).

Hi @saudet , here is the code:  ```c++ cv::Subdiv2D subdiv(rect); //rect is a cv::Rect  // Insert points into subdiv (points is a vector<cv::Point2f>) for (size_t i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i)        subdiv.insert(points[i]);  //getting the triangles from subdiv vector<cv::Vec6f> triangleList; subdiv.getTriangleList(triangleList); ```
Yes correct the timestamp that is being sent by the device contains the correct timestamp. Graylog extracts the timestamp then adds 7 hours to it. The timestamps being sent by my device are set to UTC. I live in PDT which is UTC -7 so I do not get alerts until 7 hours AFTER the fact, and they do not show up in my dashboard. I can find the message if I set the time to include messages that are at least 7 hours in the future though.  The only thing that makes sense to me is that Graylog is assuming that the messages are set to PDC timezone, I don't understand why though because the original messages do not contain anything that says PDC or UTC-7 or anything that could be misconstrued as PDC or PTC. What confuses me is that if Graylog assumes UTC if it cannot determine the timezone then why is it extracting as PDC when there is nothing in the original message that can be interpreted as PDC or PTC.  My original message shows a very typical example of what comes into Graylog and the screenshot has what is extracted. It definitely adds 7 hours to extracted timestamp.  Here is the exported extractor  ``` {   "extractors": [     {       "condition_type": "regex",       "condition_value": "(btsdefense\\sSFIMS)",       "converters": [         {           "config": {             "date_format": "eee  MMM dd HH:mm:ss YYYY zzz"           },           "type": "date"         }       ],       "cursor_strategy": "copy",       "extractor_config": {         "regex_value": "([a-zA-Z]{3}\\s[a-zA-Z]{3}\\s[0-9]{2}\\s[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}\\s[0-9]{4}\\sUTC)"       },       "extractor_type": "regex",       "order": 0,       "source_field": "message",       "target_field": "timestamp",       "title": "Timestamp"     }   ],   "version": "1.1.4 (59783f6)" } ``` 
haven't tried to recreate it with just actually additions but taking off my back pack makes it stop plus it does it with every tile entity being placed on another tile entity, must be a problem with iron backpacks, sorry for wasting your time dude XD
Just no response Not ErrorMessage SPIGOT 3.0.2 #MESSAGE "is,it run?"
Exactly, it only happens when scaling is applied. displaying CMYK jpegs without scaling works fine. 
the readPosition will be  null when ledger list is null or can not find the nextValidPosition  the code as follow: managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedCursorImpl.java ``` public void asyncReadEntries(final int numberOfEntriesToRead, final ReadEntriesCallback callback,             final Object ctx) {         checkArgument(numberOfEntriesToRead > 0);         if (isClosed()) {             callback.readEntriesFailed(new ManagedLedgerException("Cursor was already closed"), ctx);             return;         }          PENDING_READ_OPS_UPDATER.incrementAndGet(this);         OpReadEntry op = OpReadEntry.create(this, PositionImpl.get(readPosition), numberOfEntriesToRead, callback, ctx);         ledger.asyncReadEntries(op);     } ``` managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/OpReadEntry.java ``` public static OpReadEntry create(ManagedCursorImpl cursor, PositionImpl readPositionRef, int count,             ReadEntriesCallback callback, Object ctx) {         OpReadEntry op = RECYCLER.get();         op.readPosition = cursor.ledger.startReadOperationOnLedger(readPositionRef);         op.cursor = cursor;         op.count = count;         op.callback = callback;         op.entries = Lists.newArrayList();         op.ctx = ctx;         op.nextReadPosition = PositionImpl.get(op.readPosition);         return op;     } ``` 
I'm good, thanks :)
It's easy enough to recreate. What do you mean by the type of message? What info do you need?
Both seems fine, waiting would be neat but not necessary
Not sure if this helps because it need to distinguish if the event target is the local client or a remote one.  In case one player hosts the game, he should still get the renaming popup for himself because he would be the authority too. 
That is the current state. The IP address information is anonymized on the client before the mail is composed.  However, as we don't have _any_ value in collecting those data, we will get rid of them entirely.
I thought that but it only occurred when I tried to export my project. 
i try rs.getBundledInput() and rs.setBundledInput()  CC 1.72 and last computronics and asielib last release redLogic to.  nothing happen, the cable visually don't connect, and i receive signal 0 from the cable if i try to use getBundled comand, although i have some color with redstone signal ON from levers. 
Hi Goran,  With the latest v0.0.51 and v0.0.52 it finished building, but still the console shows the same error message. Running the game seems to work, but doesn't show a 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL'.

>Do you find that particular video resolutions are broken while others work?  Yes, most of the working videos has multiple of 16 height (1080, 720, 480). But some of them has resolution 640x360 and works too. `360 / 16 = 22.5`. So I don't know could it be the reason or not.
Current value of rootUrl member in ODataResource class is as follows.   https://example.com/john/box1col/ But any trouble has not occurred, because this rootUrl is not used currently.
After changing to user/pwd (it was API key before) and after entering the credentials in the history window it looks like the following screenshot after creating and modifing a ticket ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10806821/12579940/edada20e-c42b-11e5-8ac2-00fe327c889d.png)  You can scroll down to see the history in the window, but this is probably not, how it should work?

I mean that when inside a cave I die, I teleport using /back and I appear outside of the cave with a view of the sky. Ground level means over the cave, sometimes 50 blocks over.

Hello,  I encountered two problems regarding rollback with the latest changes:  - (I encountered this only once, but it stopped whole rollback) - probably a timing issue only as I never see that again  ``` --- * Rolling back 'Update resources'       - BuildConfig: update (replace)       - ConfigMap: update (replace)         * syndesis-meta-config         * syndesis-prometheus-config         * syndesis-sampledb-config         * syndesis-server-config         * syndesis-ui-config       - DeploymentConfig: update (replace)         * syndesis-db         * syndesis-meta         * syndesis-oauthproxy         * syndesis-prometheus         * syndesis-server         * syndesis-ui       - PersistentVolumeClaim: update (replace)         * syndesis-meta         * syndesis-prometheus       - RoleBinding: update (replace)         * syndesis:viewers       - Route: force update (delete/create)         * syndesis       - Secret: update (replace)         * syndesis-global-config         * syndesis-oauth-proxy-cookie-secret         * syndesis-server-secret       - Service: force update (delete/create)         * syndesis-db         * syndesis-meta         * syndesis-oauthproxy         * syndesis-prometheus         * syndesis-server         * syndesis-ui       - ServiceAccount: force update (delete/create)         * syndesis-integration         * syndesis-prometheus serviceaccount "syndesis-prometheus" deleted Error from server (AlreadyExists): object is being deleted: serviceaccounts "syndesis-prometheus" already exists ====> Rollback Error ==> Exit  ```  - Is the upgrade supported with some integration running or should the user stop all integrations before the upgrade?  (According to this #1117 the integration can be running, but I don't know how optimistic is that :-)) The rollback wants to drop the whole DB and recreate it, you can't rollback with an active integration:  ``` --- * Rolling back 'Migrate database' deploymentconfig "syndesis-server" scaled deploymentconfig "syndesis-meta" scaled Waiting for syndesis-server to be scaled to 0 Sleeping 10s ...

Those are bugs from the Google Play Console. I have no further context unfortunately. Perhaps that's related to the Shake to Scan feature.
I assumed that they needed to be started since they can be started and they become ACTIVE. I had this impression installing the quickstart and this needs to be manually started. Should I close the issue?

Not really, it was just something one of our integrators stumbled into. Also this looks like it needs some time and manual labor to do.

Well, no. I will not post on public or to unknown persons full headers of real e-mails or real e-mail addresses of persons I have no permission to publish their e-mail. You should know that this no good idea. Sorry. :)  I know of my own experience it is hard for a programmer to believe. Check it out with the information I gave in the description. I tried and tested those parameters. Check it yourself: Create an e-mail-address of those length, send test-mails to yourself and you should see the result. :)  If you have other questions I try to help as far I can.  best regards, Stefan  
We don't this before prior 2.0.x every class had only one cluster. How there are multiply clusters per node and it doesn't seems to be working correctly. Looks like it is related to order in server list: "servers": ["nodel","node2","<NEW_NODE>"] ... but I am not sure. 
I have version 1.8 and it appears my ROM is headered as its at 4097 even tough its fresh out of the RAR folder and japanese. Should I go get another one or can I just patch it to be unheadered with something like LunarIPS Edit I'm off to find a new one, sorry I'm not great with understanding how technology works. I'll have to draw you something for taking this much of your time as an apology.

@guyca has nothing to do with background. I'm showing the modal when the user is in the app
My use case is : run an [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org) based application as a windows service. So I have a start method to launch Camel, and another one to stop it. - Using the `java` way requires to develop `IPC` (inter process communication) as the `main` method is called to start and stop the process. It means, one `JVM` is launched to start the application,and another `JVM` is launched to handle the stop request. We need an `IPC` between both of them to notify the first one to shutdown. - Using the `jvm` way, it starts only one `JVM` it means start and stop will executes under the same context, and may use same object instances. It is more easyier in my use case.   But you are true, it breaks the feature `LogonAsService`. To provide both features `(start/stop method` and `LogonAsService`, the `mode` should became configurable and the doc should be updated. But should be easy to do :) 
I apologize. I read the issue #7157 incorrectly. Now i will use named tag like $proc$
I'm using a custom ROM, AOSP Extended, running Android 7.1.2. Device is Lenovo K3 Note. This happens regardless of the theme, light or dark. Even using the default color scheme.
I am currently working on a modpack, so that is what I am testing in. 
I did some more testing, here are my results: - It's independant of the shaderpack that I'm using. I tested it with SEUS and have the same issue - It also seems to be independant from the instruments or HUD. Disabling any of them or both does not help - It occurs in first- and third-person mode
Dear Alexis, it was about 10 000.

In every opensource project there is usually a LICENSE file with software license copy, like mit. This is standard, and it would be nice to have this file in a project, so when people would be packiging sikuli, they would immidiately know under which license you distribute sikuli.

There are no chunkloaders anywhere in the world where this happened. I have tried to produce it with just Botania, but as I mentioned, this happens very rarely.  (ATG volcano is the reason I'm that high up) 
I also added the legacy permission (authme.unregister false) to try and see if it was because of this.  About the debug perm:  https://i.imgur.com/gUg225e.png  The perm is negated in the default group (and the player was in the default group).  Do you think this is a bug with LuckPerms?  Thanks.

Jepp the Line number is 1560 if i remember it correctly. Seems to be only an issue for files which are on the tablet and can´t be pulled in an Windows 7 enviroment. Therefore, i pulled all these files with a working zotfile version on my mac from the tablet ...et voila.. pushing, annotating in pulling in Windows 7 seems to work. Maybe a file conflict issue? 
A lot of rows like this  ``` 2014-03-11 10:54:39 WARN  ChannelOutboundBuffer:609 - Failed to mark a promise as success because it is done already: DefaultChannelPromise@5e15e68d(failure(io.netty.handler.codec.EncoderException: io.netty.util.IllegalReferenceCountException: refCnt: 0, decrement: 1) ``` 
Hm, from what I see you are using a very old version of jaxb and when I see it correctly, since several versions it is already included in java8  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/bind/JAXB.html  And also have a look here,https://jaxb.java.net/2.2.11/docs/release-documentation.html#a-2-2-11  There seems to be a sample somewhere which inlcudes some namespace stuff  Look also here, this is a newer gradle plugin  https://github.com/ewerk/gradle-plugins/tree/master/jaxb2-plugin 
Using the latest jar (closure-compiler-v20161024.jar), I'm still seeing the issue.  Adding `--new_type_inf` does fix the issue, but it's not on by default.  Is that what you meant by "type based optimization"?

I guess it's running in the background, but the icon never appears in the taskbar like it's supposed to.
I failed to mention: The files are images and contain the graph.png. As I've said before, a new copy is created _every_ time, graph.png is requested. Basically, just browsing the server and refreshing creates them. So, yes, I guess they are temporary files that just don't get removed.  Have you not seen those? In IntelliJ, they are shown as unversioned files, which is why I became aware of them in the first place.
I think I might have a solution using docker `--build-args` feature. I'll maybe have a PR later today... 
WPA standards specifies that you have to have a password length of >= 8. I was in the middle of implementing a fix for this and will finish it today. I was a bit naive in how I did in in `2.5.3` so I will address it by end of day.  For the latest stable release, install @2.5.0
The name should be as descriptive, as direct, and as unambiguous as possible. For example:  - The string "Insufficient Space" should be named `insufficient_space` instead of `in_safe` (ambiguous). - The string "Random Skin" should be named `random_skin` instead of `random` (descriptive). 
PR https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android/pull/918 has been created. 
I'm using Mysql, and this no matter with the database. I mean that when a field is a type of string, the generated xml file should add the expression in the if clause.For example: if my java code is  ` String sysCode = ""; ` xml file content is  ` <select id="query" parameter="java.lang.String" resultType="java.util.HashMap"> select SYS_CODE as sysCode from table <where> <if test="sysCode != null" >         AND SYS_CODE = #{sysCode,jdbcType=VARCHAR},  </if> </where> </select> ` when I call the query method, the sql will be:  ` select SYS_CODE as sysCode from table where SYS_CODE = '' `, actually it should not match the if clause, it should be: ` select SYS_CODE as sysCode from table ` so I had to add the code  `sysCode != ''` every string field every time,  because it spends me a lot of time.
@hsz and thanks for the build which seems to fix it👍 
This is alpha1, I didn't notice alpha2 yet.  Update: a2 has the same issue, updating title 
For me it would be a menu entry on the main screen: "report problem", with a popup then asking "Do you want to send the logs as well? [Yes/No/Cancel](with the default being yes)".  I would not like an additional setting. It is not a big deal if we store, say, 500 messages of 40 characters, that would be 20kB of RAM (we would only store the severity and the data, we wouldn't duplicate the tag for example). 
@Zhuinden Thanks for your help, the warning and the bug is gone with this version!

I don't have root or ADB... :/ any otherway I can generate a log ?
Unfortunately I don't have much time right now. But I think the case is very simple to reproduce.
Hi, thanks for pointing out, i'll try to take a look at TLS/Java, My goal is to use the Java Stack on Raspberry Pi   (BTW: Oracle Java6 is no more available for RPi/Raspbian -- install fails, as the JDK6/ARM is not available for download from Oracle).

If quarkus.http.root-path is not set then by https://localhost:8080/swagger-ui works otherwise doesn't. As soon as that path has set, things start to break. This bug, and there are others related to it. Reported before.
The pipeline works with single backslash. As commented elsewhere, I think it should be documented what flavour of regular expressions the component expects. I used the double backslash, since I was expecting regular expressions from SPARQL.
I had 6.4.10 and I tried updating to 6.4.11. Problem was in both. And yes, I have Optifine (version OptiFine_1.7.10_HD_U_B5)  (Minecraft 1.7.10) 
StyleTable example, i try the code.  ```            int rowCount = 20;            int columnCount = 10;      @Override     public int getRowCount() {         return rowCount;     }      @Override     public int getColumnCount() {         return columnCount;     }       Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button1);     btn.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {          @Override         public void onClick(View view) {             rowCount++;             adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();         }      }); ``` 
I don't think I did... doing now!
I'm sure. Both meshes have different names. (I even reduplicated them). You can check the file in the link I gave. I updated the file with the bugfix.

Your commit looks good, and I agree that that is a better spot for the logic.  Thanks for getting that in there!  It works as intended now. 
Java does the shift only with distance specified with 5 bits. e.g. in Java's 5 bit shift distance 0xA0A0 << 0x20 is not 0x0000 but 0xA0A0 (equal to no shift) You should have something like "if shift distance > 31 then result=0 else result =base<<distance" 
@straumat  Can you give me the your docker-compose file? I will try again, and wait and see how the result. Thanks.
They seem to still be on 345, i'll wait to report after our next reboot and confirm, but it seems to be fixed to always give 4 at a time properly. I will give an update tomorrow to see if it continues to work great. Thank you for all that helped!

The MACs display for the hosts, but on the main section where you scan for hosts, the main device MAC does not display properly.  It just says:  02:00:00:00:00:00.  About the second part, you are correct.  The section where you scan for hosts. 
Sadly, no. I tested it only with his account.  I mean this count:  > 16x Found it, 2x Didn't find it, 3x Write note 
After the natural spawned cyberzombies didnt drop I put the rate tom 100%. After that I was just testing with `/summon cyberware.cyberzombie`. Now I killed a natural spawned cyberzombie and it dropped. Seems to be just the manually summoned zombies.   Could be another mod, however I have no clue which one it could be.

@stefanomorson I was able to reproduce it following the steps described above.  Try this:  0. Browser should be full-sized before test.  1. Go to child accounts, select one of them and go to _**Settings**_ tab 2. Select _**Role Service**_ and verticlly resize bottom window (the _**Settings**_ window) and shrink (horizontally resize) the whole browser window. _**Now all the unnecessary sliders should appear.**_
@serge-rider  Thank you for your reply! my database is TiDB which is support Mysql protocol.  and the dbeaver went normally at the begining. I think i have some setting problem of the dbeaver, but even if i reinstall the dbeaver, there is still exits the same problem.
 if I put on any set of armor (chest) the shadows in the shaders disappear. shaders work but the shadows from the sun disappear.
I just want to download soundcloud songs by sharing to newpipe. Youtube share works but soundcloud does not work.
I will pay attention to that next time it breaks. As far as I remember I can only say not all writers on the same network break down at the same time, at least not always, that much I know.
@dennisoelkers I'm running graylog on docker, and the log files on not their default location, do you know where they are located? There are no indexing errors logged in the dashboard view in the past 24 hours. 
HTC M7 is the phone I got. Indeed, that is quite strange. Well hopefully it gives you some idea.

1. I tried to copy data inside the same region (from a bucket in us-standard to us- standard), and I reached very good speed - 440 MByte/sec (3520 Mbit/sec), so actually AWS dependency does not slow down the speed. 2. When I placed the EC2 machine in Frankfurt, I reached almost twice better speed than when the machine was located in N. Virginia while copying data from us-standard to Frankfurt - 38 Mbyte/sec (304 Mbit/sec). I'm not sure that there is a real problem here. Transferring data via WAN network always works much slower then via LAN due to latency and bandwidth 3. Regarding -e / --endpoint option, my source bucket is located in us-standard and target bucket in Frankfurt, so I don't understand how this should work? If I define a Frankfurt's endpoint, the application will try to access both buckets using only Frankfurt's endpoint? Or there is a possibility to define separate endpoints for source and target buckets? 
I don't think I'm communicating this effectively. It is not an issue of individual verbs, it's an issue of entire classes of verbs/adjectives being handled incorrectly.  You don't need to reinvent the wheel, nor try to fix every irregular individually.

I don't know if this would work for everything, but since most types of config files use a ":" to seperate the keys from the values, you could check if there's at least one colon in a line and in case there is, exclude everything before the first colon from the renamer.

So sorry - In the process of writing my response, I realized that I was not actually using 0.9.4! Works now that I'm actually following the directions... :-P 
The plugin is 0.0.20. It doesn't seem to trigger on load, but it does trigger quite a few times (my last editing session had 6 triggers between start and clear of the error). Either way, a decision was made to refactor to a JSON model instead of YAML (for other reasons) so the problem hasn't reoccurred. 
I fixed it already. The problematic code were: https://github.com/GluuFederation/oxAuth/commit/0c145b1d875f1cbd7f6461f0871b066d6b06add7  As result it showed blank page... without redirect user to right place. In this and in few next commits I fixed logic. Closing this issue. 
We are running this on a number of nodes in a GKE cluster.   We have 3 web services running and we use an end of request handler to calculate the request timing and send them to stackdriver as a custom metric.  We inserted the middleware on just our `/health` endpoints to test out the dependency which was the latest in maven central at the time of testing (`com.google.cloud:google-cloud-monitoring:0.17.2-alpha`). We then let the Google Cloud load balancers hit our health endpoints as the normal do and watched our metrics (the load balancers in gcloud hit the endpoint 2-3 times a second)  After a few minutes of metrics we notice a ton of the stacktraces above. We are not doing anything to batch this data up we are simply logging a single `Int64Value` with a timestamp to StackDriver.  Let me know if you need anything else. 
Because the choice of default widget depends on whether the state description is editable or not. It looks like now the state description seems to answer "not editable" while it should return "editable". https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/blob/master/bundles/org.openhab.core.ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/smarthome/ui/internal/items/ItemUIRegistryImpl.java#L244 https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/blob/master/bundles/org.openhab.core.ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/smarthome/ui/internal/items/ItemUIRegistryImpl.java#L781 And it looks like the only very recent PR that was in relation to "editable".

@itchix can you provide feedback on this one ?
a) No idea honestly. Sorry, I'm pretty much a plug-and-play guy when it comes to networking. My router/modem thing does show both an IPv4 and IPv6 address in the LAN settings. Let me know if you need a screenshot. b) Not directly from the email problems, no. Another app that could use a default exception is Audible (doesn't show ads, but the Audible Store throws an error on every page if it's not blacklisted in DNS66). But maybe this should just be mentioned prominently at the first start of DNS66 (not sure if is right now); for me it was pretty much the last thing I thought of. Otherwise you're just adding and adding more apps to the default list. c) Yes, receiving emails works fine now.   Thanks for working on this.

Excellent! All these exceptions are gone after retesting the scenarios with a local build containing the latest master. :smile: :1st_place_medal:

@marcuslinke PR #633 
Yes. In source , the emblem is only being used on steam loco, only solid. 
I referenced a test in the project i experienced the issue so that I don't upgrade to a version with this issue, using [System Rules](https://stefanbirkner.github.io/system-rules/#EnvironmentVariables). So it could be added a test similar to this, quite easy since it crashes on initialization of the client.
It should have been these builds:  - [1843](https://travis-ci.org/JanusGraph/janusgraph/builds/492193490): Targeted `0.2` which didn't get the flaky marking. - [1902](https://travis-ci.org/JanusGraph/janusgraph/builds/498592012): This build belongs to [this commit](https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph/commit/4682509e753f7934dc6fd9da30989248181d758f) which was merged before the flaky marking was added. So the test probably just failed the number of retries in Travis.  So, this really seems to be not an issue any more.
Updating the pack and server today, will report back if it is still happening. 
Yes, it does.

Thanks for the response!  The instabug-reactnative is the only dependency in the project. It should be reproducible by creating a new project, installing instabug, linking it, and then running on Android.  I’ve reproduced it in two separate apps (example app linked to above).  Has instabug been confirmed to work with the latest version of React Native?

It concerns the methods marked as FIXME, like for instance this one.  ```     @InheritInverseConfiguration( name = "targetToSource" ) // TODO: FIXME     Target sourceToTargetDefaultMapping(Source source); ```  Its already some weeks ago that I handled this, but I think its like this:  I assumed that the original idea is that sourceToTargetDefaultMapping does not have a forward mapping (like all the other sourceToTargetXXXX mappers).  However removing the `@InheritInverseConfiguration` makes the testcase fail with: `expected:<'[01.01.2014 00:00] UTC'> but was:<'[January 1, 2014 12:00:00 AM] UTC'>`  After some analysis I found out that this mapper (again presumably accidentally) relies on `targetToSource`, which in its turn relied on `sourceToTarget`.   I fixed it when I was introducing the `@InheritInverseConfiguration` to what actually happened prior to the introduction, not to (what I think was) its original intention.   ## `  BTW: this is the reason I stated that the old behavior of the reverse mapping was quite unpredictable.  
You are correct, I apologize. My settings were wrong in the xml file. Importing settings is working just fine.

Ah, it's fairly simple actually. See, while testing I figured out that pretty much all passive coolers have far, far too little cooling to be useful in such a large reactor, and most of the actives weren't great either. However, the default cooling value for glowstone is five times as high as the next-highest liquid, 80,000 for glowstone vs 16,000 for liquid helium. So, I made a sort of cascading grid layout, and filled the entire reactor volume with it.  ![2017-12-10_16 34 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16315400/33809675-9c67d88e-ddc8-11e7-9101-531ee0a3df79.png) ![2017-12-10_16 33 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16315400/33809676-9fb52aa0-ddc8-11e7-8f2f-d41897d6f08d.png)  Anything with heat production much higher than Thorium produced far too much heat, but thorium oxide is just about right, and really efficient as well.  I haven't tried turning it on since the fix went out, so I'm not sure how much glowstone it'll require, but I think I'll manage. At worst, I might have to set up a dedicated ET void miner for it.

Hi, As in https://github.com/eclipse/che-archetypes, agent-archetype i modified the script which will do software installation from a zip file and add some environment variables. Like you mentioned, i need to achieve this functionality in workspace with the help of agent.   After modification of script - i have agent-archetype jar out of build. At this phase - i referenced this jar  and added dependency to assembly-ide-war - module of Che and built the same - and continue with the procedure mentioned in https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/plugins/create-and-build-extensions/ and finally need to load che with the custom assembly.

My mistake, I am confused. Normaly those issues in the conversation are listed as issues here in github, and resolved in commits. But commits and open issues didn't list it. It's a philosophical question. Keep up the good work. ^^ 
@gavinking : Do you think we can close this, assuming your guess fixed the issue (and we'll open it again if it comes back) ? Honestly I don't remember how it occured and failed at adding the stacktrace (which I wonder why it is not in the issue description). 
Still the same.

yes,it my falut  thx ur answer 
Oh no, it seems to be a heisenbug: putting a breakpoint has caused it to work :-(
Should it? In https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome/documentation/development/bindings/xml-reference.html#xml-structure-for-configuration-descriptions, it says that the property name is "default"...

_UPDATE: I was testing a lot back and forth while writing the below and now I can't get it to work with websockets/chrome anymore either, but I have no idea what I did. Anywho, if this persists I guess I'll have to workaround using cookies sicen that works now as per issue #485 (thanks!) and fetch the object manually from cache - I still think it would be fantastic if it was possible to access the attributes on the wrapped request, so I am leaving the description below. :) Thanks!_  Sorry if I was unclear: I already have an object stored on the request, that I want to fetch using request.getAttribute(). The object is set using setAttribute(), earlier, on the regular HttpServletRequest object by a regular servlet serving JSPs and I need to retreive it inside the Atmosphere handler servlet. This works when using websockets, but not when using long-polling. As I understand it, the HttpServletRequest is wrapped by the AtmospehereRequest and this is why this works, but perhaps the wrapping is incomplete in long polling version?  I never got Atmosphere test code up and running properly, but the minimal testcase would be to have a regular servlet doing something like:  ``` java @Override protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {     String ws = "websession";     request.setAttribute("WEB_SESSION", ws); } ```  And when connecting using long polling, in the AtmosphereHandler do something like:  ``` java @Override public void onRequest(final AtmosphereResource resource) throws IOException {     AtmosphereRequest request = resource.getRequest();     String ws = (String) request.getSession().getAttribute("WEB_SESSION"); } ```  And make sure that ws is actually fetched properly. In my case it's not a String, but a custom Object, but should be the same. This already works in websocket code, like I said. _UPDATE: as said above, now it doesn't but I don't know why. I "should" be back on the code that works now before trying to work out IE issues, but it stopped working._ 
yes to me, these informations could be useful while debugging. The question is not about human or bot but if it is useful to fix an issue or not. I think we need to be consistent: if these are displayed in the json logs, should be display either in the text logs.
Hi there, no the name was %iv% so it's max 12 characters  
I tried the goto station action. To no avail.  It was with version 7.0.3.  This is more a suggestion then a bug I suppose. It is not an issue when I define a work area.  
I am still able to reproduce it on 1.4.19 on Firefox and Chrome on Linux and Windows 
This SESSION header is set only inside this interceptor per request. I also set some extra headers like Language, Date, API-VERSION, User-Agent. However response also can contain this header with same name, that's why I extract it from each response to get new value. And I have 2nd Interceptor to do another job related to response.  I think its related to HTTP/2.0, when we test on staging server with HTTP/2 disabled this issue disappears. 
@RomanIakovlev  I fixed the build at the 2018d.6 version and now I'm searching for the conflict again. Let's see if I will find the bug this time.  Thanks

I do not getting big difference `System.currentTimeMillis() - e.getWhen()` on Mac OS X using  `JNativeHook-2.0.20150329.zip`. Maximal delay value was < 500 ms. I am always getting big difference on Windows and Linux (virtual and not virtual) now.  > Also confirmed on OS X, are you seeing any WARNING: hook_event_proc [883]: CGEventTap timeout! messages?  I am not getting this warning, but I am always getting another on Mac `WARNING: hook_event_proc [855]: Unhandled Darwin event! (0X1D)` 
Yes, it works nicely now.

Hi @johnscancella - many thanks for the quick response. My D: drive is a partition on a hard disk. I wasn't aware that the zip functionality has problems associated with it so this information is extremely useful as we're using zipped bags to add data into our digital preservation system (Archivematica) and I don't believe that our vendor is aware of these issues. If you could elaborate more on them I would be most grateful (or point me to somewhere I can find more information). Thanks for the workaround, I will share it with my colleagues.
I tried it both with a custom thread pool (8 threads) and the default one that the SDK provides.  The code I have is trying to download 69 files, totaling to about 16 GiB, with the same `TransferManager`.   My code works just fine under version 1.10.16, but when I try upgrading to 1.11.44 (specifically for the parallel downloads feature!) the program just hangs after downloading a few files.  My code, as it happens, has some metrics around the transfers.  First I get these warnings, which I don't know if they're relevant:  ``` 18:14:52.551 [Coordinator 2] INFO  c.p.d.automation.s3.BulkS3Download - Bulk S3 download from s3://my-bucket/common/prefix/for/my/objects to /home/myusername/path/to/download/directory (regexp = ^.*\.csv(/part-\d+)$, metrics-uuid=966c0cf1-dfe7-48ac-adac-4f82ee82e5e8) Oct 18, 2016 6:15:00 PM com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.DownloadCallable combineFiles WARNING: The file /home/myusername/path/to/download/directory/subdir01/file01.csv/part-000025315321510609134081.part.1 could not be deleted.

It downloads for a few seconds (as seen from the OS X system monitor's network graph), but it hangs very soon thereafer.  So my metrics reporter just repeatedly logs this out, showing the TransferManager stuck after 8 transfers have started (same as the number of threads in the custom executor)  and only 4 have completed.  (I compute these metrics by attaching `ProgressListener`s to the SDK's `Transfer` objects, and observing the `ProgressEvent`s and `ProgressEventType`s.)  ``` 18:15:37.569 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=GAUGE, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.fraction-bytes-transferred, value=0.05701729361113557 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=GAUGE, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.progress, value=5.70% 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=COUNTER, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.total-bytes-to-transfer, count=16580360328 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=COUNTER, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.transfers-completed, count=4 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=COUNTER, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.transfers-failed, count=0 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=COUNTER, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.transfers-started, count=8 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=COUNTER, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.transfers-total, count=69 18:15:37.571 [metrics-logger-reporter-2-thread-1] INFO  c.p.d.a.metrics.S3TransferMetrics - type=METER, name=S3TransferMetrics.4b4df776-f11c-443e-82f3-fca12d913a47.bytes-transferred, count=945367273, mean_rate=2.1003752701155223E7, m1=3.752772926092549E7, m5=5.581370025628049E7, m15=5.9619597766520604E7, rate_unit=events/second ```  To me it looks like the following is happening, if I understand things right: 1. Each time I initiate a download with the `TransferManager`, it [submits a  `DownloadCallable` task to its executor](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1101). 2. This task will itself [submit `DownloadPartCallable` tasks to the same executor](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/DownloadCallable.java#L190). 3. The `DownloadCallable` task then [blocks waiting for its submitted `DownloadPartCallable`s to complete](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/DownloadCallable.java#L203). 4. When the parts download tasks complete, the `DownloadCallable` combines the files.  So with 69 downloads and an executor with only 8 (or the default 10) threads, it's just very easy for the program to end up in a state where all of the executor's 8 threads are running `DownloadCallable`s who've all submitted their `DownloadPartCallable`s and are in a blocking wait for them to complete, but there are no more threads available to actually run the latter.  Solutions I might suggest (which may well be all wrong):  - Submit the `DownloadCallable`s and `DownloadPartCallable`s to two different executors, so that the former never starve the threads available for the latter.  Downside: if the separate executor for the `DownloadCallable` tasks has a fixed number of threads, only that many downloads can be active at the same time.  If it's an unlimited number of threads, then my code would end up launching 69 threads. - Rework the `DownloadCallable` so that it doesn't block waiting for the parts to download before it combines them.  Rather, the task to combine the files is triggered asynchronously upon completion of all of the part download `Future`s.  This requires some mechanism like [Guava's `ListenableFuture`](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ListenableFutureExplained), [Java 8's `CompletionStage`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage.html) or [the AWS Java SDK's async callbacks feature](https://aws.amazon.com/articles/Java/5496117154196801).  This is perhaps more complex than the two-executors solution, but it's "righter" in some sense (that may or may not matter).

@netomi - thanks for the support!  I was just typing an answer and I saw your edit. Yes, we use both `dontshrink` and `dontoptimize`. Without the `dontoptimize` part we were getting some errors, I'll try tomorrow and perhaps open a new issue.  Thank you again for looking into this!
Can someone else test with a 2.3 device? 
thanks for reply. here are the gifs I used: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ghBZcVHgnKd2YxQ0lKZHNHd00/view?usp=sharing  I find it hard to reproduce the issue in a small sample app. I guess glide use too much cpu or memory which cause resource intense. I try to use android-gif-library which do not cause such issue. All I focus now is how to effectively release the memory and cpu when those gifs go off the screen. Maybe that would do some help. 
Yea okay, i have tried some things and after alot of work i found out the my scoreboard plugin was overriding EssentialsX's system..
@davidecaroselli I think this is the issue...  There is a broken carriage return that is interpreted in a different way from the tokenizer and cleaner.  Can we filter those so it does not crash?

Thanks for response,  The problem I am actually facing is: I have two keystores to manage, the first resembles to yours I refere to it in my code with : TrustStore it has a Certificates Authority . the second is a  appKeyStore has a client certificate and a password.   But in your example you have one and only one keystore (TrustKeystore).  With okhttp2 I initialezed keyManagerFactory with appKeyStore as follow:   ``` KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance("X509"); keyManagerFactory.init(appKeyStore, tableauCertPassword); KeyManager[] keyManagers = keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(); ```  and for the trustStore I used :   ```   TrustManagerFactory tmf =           TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());    tmf.init(trustStore);    TrustManager[] managers = tmf.getTrustManagers(); ```  But this does not work with okhttp3: Here is the exception I am getting `javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Read error: ssl=0x9dd07200: I/O error during system call, Connection reset by peer`  While following your solution I did not use the trustStore, I initilized the keyManagerFactory  and the TrustManagerFactory with the appKeyStore. As result I get :   ```  Caused by: java.security.cert.CertificateException: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found. at com.android.org.conscrypt.TrustManagerImpl.checkTrusted(TrustManagerImpl.java:324) at com.android.org.conscrypt.TrustManagerImpl.checkServerTrusted(TrustManagerImpl.java:225) at com.android.org.conscrypt.Platform.checkServerTrusted(Platform.java:115) at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl.verifyCertificateChain(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:556) at com.android.org.conscrypt.NativeCrypto.SSL_do_handshake(Native Method)  at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:324)  : ... 47 more Caused by: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found.   ```  I adapted your solution  to my situation, I initialised the TrustManagerFactory with TrustStore and as result I get :   ``` Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Read error: ssl=0xab163140: I/O error during system call, Connection reset by peer  at com.android.org.conscrypt.NativeCrypto.SSL_read(Native Method)  at com.android.org.conscrypt.OpenSSLSocketImpl$SSLInputStream.read(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:705) ```   how can I use the TrustStore with okhttp3?  Thanks in advance

Thanks for your reply! I was not accurate enough, sorry.  In fact , buttons in flow layout is working very well, as your sample app does. But when we use other custom views (like Cards view from CardsLibs in FlowLayout) those views are not displayed on 4.4 KitKat. But works well on others version.

Admin pod restart doesn't change things ([logs_3_admin_restart.zip](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/files/1907181/logs_3_admin_restart.zip)).  The Connections tab contains one entry: ![connectionstab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/891931/38733128-1390689a-3f21-11e8-9687-6effc60d572f.png)  
For the plugin? It would be the newest version from bukkit 
The main problem with this code which is likely to happen is when someone using a code like this for example? BASE_URL = "http://example.com/photos.php?id=";  in Adapters getView for example: view.setImageUrl(BASE_URL+position);  In this case every call has a different reference (as far as I know about java that is, which is not a lot).  And you now how cursed asyncTasks are, even one of them will have an impact on the application.  Thank you for your sharing and managing this code 
I've fixed it in a slightly different way, though the result is of course the same 
Hi guys!  I think we are facing another time zone issue.  My time zone is `GMT -02:00 Brasilia Summer Time` and the issue can be reproduced using the sample files.  I changed my device to a non negative time zone (I used `GMT +00:00 Greenwich Mean Time`) and like you the problem could NOT be spotted. 
Ok :)  [SQDevPluginInfo.zip](https://github.com/Krzmbrzl/SQDev/files/1237079/SQDevPluginInfo.zip)  One more question, how can i format my code (auto indent) with your plugin ?  Or a way to use tm4_indenter 
I haven't been able to pin it to a specific query.  I do have one query which usually takes several hours (4+) to run -- if it ever returns at all.  Whenever I run it I start singing 'Charlie and the MTA' to myself with "the man who never returns" replaced with "the query who never returns", wish I could feed it as sandwich as it went by.    It is the one I would suspect the most:     match (n)-[r]->() where not has(r.some_property) return count(r) 
i tried with ender io cable and is working  probably is a mekanism problem i suppose 
@codemanyak Hi Kay,  easiest way to see what I mean: 1. open structorizer - it shows progamname "???" 2. insert a parallel element 3. select program frame and give the program a new name - now you can see, that the Line "??? is not a valid..." didn't disapear. Try it again without a parallel element and the Line "??? is not..." will be cleard. - You can save the programm - now with a valid program name - start structorizer again and open the program again. The line "??? is not ..." still remains.  HTH Rolf

Updated issue as found the real cause (Assistants able to demote mayor, and then subsequently kick) 
It did, in fact. Both in options menu and in the config itself Here's my config:      {"algorithm":"rivens-half","updateChecker":false,"preallocateMemory":false,"fog":false,"beaconBeam":false,"fastHopper":true,"fastBeacon":true,"fastSearch":true,"asyncSearch":true}
As I haven't changed any setting startup routine before and after the upgrade, and the drive letter, which is "X", is not configured to be used by another program so I doubt that's the case here, though at the same time I don't know what the exact cause is.  If that would be the case, it's just not understandable why that hadn't happened since `1.4.7` to `1.4.10` at all.
Hi @vertigo17 ,  issue is only present in QA.  Thanks
Using latest Windows 10, Eclipse running on Java 1.8.0_181. I've re-enabled "EGradle project decorator" an I do not get this error anymore in startup log. But I removed some plugins since my initial post, so it could be that... I'd say that if you cannot think of an obvious cause for the stack trace I posted, don't spend too much time on it.
@andrm  Layout is the default values in both cases.  Do you suggest changes? How would this affect avoiding the issue when changing allocation problems?

If you do a beta/preview through [releases](../releases) I can test that but I don't want to download apks from wherever.
In our case these are JSon-Objects. 
Hmm only way to reproduce is to break an annotator manually at a point where it will update entities in the database, like it happend with the >255 into string field here.  If our annotators all work, then this is no longer an issue. 
I don't think an account needed to be selected at all.

I'm not familiar with VisualVM but I'll see if I can figure it out.  I assume it needs to be run on the server, not the client, yes? Or do you want both?

Hi,   Yes that makes sense, I guess the only scenario I can think of is if if the last modified fetched in a header only request and is ignored because of this strategy. 
Take a look at the tests:  * [`AbstractDatabaseClientIntegrationTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-r2dbc/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/core/AbstractDatabaseClientIntegrationTests.java) * [`AbstractTransactionalDatabaseClientIntegrationTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-r2dbc/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/core/AbstractTransactionalDatabaseClientIntegrationTests.java) * [`AbstractR2dbcRepositoryIntegrationTests`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-r2dbc/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/repository/AbstractR2dbcRepositoryIntegrationTests.java)

@Paris it won't freeze up, but it also won't show any notice saying it couldn't connect (which may make people post on the forums asking for help, saying their scripts don't show). If it cannot connect, maybe pop up a message dialog saying powerbot could not be reached? 
Hi Serge,  I confirm that the package body is correctly loaded and parsed by TOAD using the same user.  TOAD retrieves also a slightly different package declaration in header.

Using Forge 13.20.0.2285, LittleTiles version 1.4.8. This is on 1.11.2 of Minecraft. Basically use the hammer to make blocks into the little tiles blocks (i did 16x16x16 in the hammer) place those blocks down and then break those blocks with a vanilla pickaxe and you get 2 blocks when you break the block.
This happened on our productive cluster and locally I'm not able anymore to reproduce the bug. Nothing special, the request is constructed as follows:  ```                     new DeleteRequest(TOTAL_BYTECOUNT_TABLE_NAME,                             rr.getRow(),                             TOTAL_BYTECOUNT_TABLE_COLUMN_FAMILY,                             UNPROCESSED_QUALIFIER                     ) ```  According to the stack trace the server tries to deserialize attributes which exist as of version 2 (DeleteRequest) only. Looking into your code you still serialize v1 delete requests:  buf.writeByte(1);    // Delete#DELETE_VERSION.  Stick to v1 here for now.  HBase does not try to deserialize any attributes if the version is 1:  org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Delete:  ``` if (version > 1) {   readAttributes(in); } ```  I do not understand how this exception can happen at all.

I added another point so the path didn't run through the rocket with the same results. The right path was longer than the left and the heading was increasing positive. I tried another path with a clockwise turn where right should have been more than left and it isn't. The heading went negative when I would have expected plus. I know from last year that we had to negate the navX yaw reading because a clockwise turn with it was a positive value while Pathfinder standard was clockwise negative. We were running Vanaka's Motion Profile Generator last year but switched to Path Weaver this year. We couldn't get the simplest turns to run until we switched back to Motion Profile Generator.

I see this in Courier, LucidaTypewriter, MathJax_Vector, MathJax_Vector-Bold, Nimbus Mono PS, Noto Color Emoji and VT323. I do not see it in Source Code Pro and Source Code Variable. These are all the fonts I can choose. I will change my font to one of those then.  Also: I set the preferences to automatic line breaks. If a new line starts then, the cursor gets resetted.
@nigelcharman, no worries. Copied the "before" table to each example for now. I'll refactor once it's fixed and released. 
I have GSEA running in the eclipse debugger. I'll try to see if I can find the source of the problem on GSEA's end.

as I have installed previously a palette, in the <TIBCO_HOME>\bw directory I have directories 6.3 and palettes. The code I removed set the prop.bw.version to 6.3;palettes.

Yes the damage is enabled and it was a normal gate, not a pegasus gate. All damage is taken by my armor and more testing showd that a protection IV enchanted endstell armor from EnderIO can save your life too.

I solved it on my side by filtering away any "remote.php/webdav" from the server URL. However, my point with this bug report is that the library should not crash with a null-pointer exception if such a case happens.  I made the following change in `CreateFolderRemoteOperation`:               if (!result.isSuccess() && mCreateFullPath &&                      RemoteOperationResult.ResultCode.CONFLICT == result.getCode()) {     -            result = createParentFolder(FileUtils.getParentPath(mRemotePath), client);     -            if (result.isSuccess()) {     -                result = createFolder(client);    // second (and last) try     +     +            if (!mRemotePath.equals("/")) {     +                result = createParentFolder(FileUtils.getParentPath(mRemotePath), client);     +                if (result.isSuccess()) {     +                    result = createFolder(client);    // second (and last) try     +                }                  }              }  I.e. avoid trying to get the parent of the root folder and return an error message instead. I can send you a PR for this, but since it's only one line to insert, you may want to simply do this yourself. Or you may want to handle it in another way. Whatever. Just make sure there is no hard crash with wrong user input :-)  
Now it's work.  Thanks. 
I can't swear that the Droid Maxx has a step counter, though i could check if i knew where to look, but it's extremely accurate, so it's doing something right.   It has happened 3 times now, but i haven't seen a correlation to anything I'm doing physically (i.e. running). No task killer or battery savers, not rooted, stock ROM 4.4.4. I don't reboot for sometimes a couple weeks at a time.  
Thanks guys! I haven't had access to anything but my work laptop for some time. Lacking a dev environment hurts.   Expect to see more from me in the future.

Yeah, sure. I would appreciate any help :) .  So I ran the GlobalKeyboardExample class (I did import the already compiled .jar on releases). My keyboard layout is portuguese (Brazil) and when I type the " ´ " I'm getting two of them " ´´ " therefore I canot type like "é" or "á" because whenever I type that I got two of them.  This is the output I got: 219 [down] 219 [up]  I was Reading the c code and I guess I should change the language at "MAKELANGID(LANG_NEUTRAL, SUBLANG_DEFAULT)". I'm installing cygwin for trying that today.
