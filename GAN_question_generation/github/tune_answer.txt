ok  it looks like this is more complex than i thought  kicking it into the long grass until i can come up with a nice example 
 macdonst you refer to the payload sent to fcm or the payload received by the plugin 
these are the main issues  1  the error message is ambiguous so the user does not know what the problem is   the app or the server  2  there is an empty folder made when this happens which is undesirable  3  the app has the "try again" feature but is not offered in this case   returning a specific error message would be too much work considering the possible pururin errors   how bout a general "server error" message and then offering to try again similar to download errors  and a folder should only be made if the links are parsed successfully and an image is ready to be downloaded   the above suggestions should fix the main issues but please do not consider them to be the best solutions  if there's any way you can fix the above issues with less work then that's great  good luck 
1  i mean  if someone kills you with tic weapon  2  just tested in singleplayer  if you kill yourself with dagger  for example  tools drop in multiple amount too  3  cauldron 1240  the latest version  have lots of bugs  so i switched to 1231

hummm… my trin part pack has about 50 wheels  and lots more are to come xd that makes a bit less than 20 objs  maybe  just an idea  make the wheel system unu  dvc and trin uses  in the naming of our wheels we have 14t4d   dvc only would say 14x4   t being the radius in pixels of our wheels  d being the width  make a little text menu that allows you to search the part like creative inventory would do  so players can look for specific sizes

indeed  i installed  net 3 5 and it works now  thank you  it will be difficult to have a multiplatform software now     i saw that any others free softwares test if java or  net are installed and if not  download and install them  it would be interesting to add this feature in the installer 
no  thanks for fix 
the  idatabaseconnector  and  iconnectionservice  interfaces of the  com nextep designer installer  plugin were not consistent with the corresponding interfaces of the  com nextep designer core  plugin in terms of thrown exceptions  so i changed the  idatabaseconnector  and  iconnectionservice  interfaces of the  com nextep designer installer  plugin to throw  sqlexception  exceptions instead of  installerexception   which is besides more logical too   connection failure to the repository database is now correctly detected again 
that's a good question  fixed 
slight performance hit on island load  it will sample the y 0 coordinate below the island  as well as the 4 corners  if any of these contain bedrock  it will wipe the lower 4 layers of the island  issue a warning  and do it after 10 seconds   giving players a short time to flee  if they are roaming the flatland   it will remove one layer at a time  starting from the bottom  and do this asynchroneous   to minimize server load lag

i'm afraid not  i was actually just speculating that that might fix it  i've never used jscover before and i didn't know about looping with labels either before i looked into this  if i have time tomorrow and no one else has suggestions i might try to fork the project and fix it there

i simply wanted to get started experimenting with janusgraph and felt like following the building instructed commands should work  while i may eventually want to use jars they are not my priority now  i just wanted to step through the docs  get the basic janusgraph server working  probably with inmemory backend i suppose  and start to make some simple experiments with gremlin etc to build a trivial graph database 
in my experience  the hacks are in until they are deemed not good enough  which usually happens way before upstream has released a fix   
ok  yeah i think it would be useful  i will try to fix at some point   probably not for a few days

nope  that's a different issue  this registration must be perfomed in the sm metrics extension 
it seems that the option "deleted" still isn't working  but "moved to app folder" is  also the moved files are shown in gallery now 
hm  so that would be the same version that i have    not sure what would cause this difference  just raising the issue       this isn't all this important to me  as i can build the agent without running the tests  so feel free to skip this issue if it does not bother anyone else

i haven't tried that directly  but i will   the only way i've found so far to clear it is to restart openhab  i assume that's because the thing isn't in the jsondb  and so a fresh start of the systems clears out any internal knowledge that the thing exists

hi ripcurlx  thanks for looking  without the torcontrolport argument  both 1 2 5 and 1 2 7 fail  because tails prohibits tor inside tor   but they _fail in identical ways_ so it's no problem on bisq side   the only problem is when i try to use the system tor via torcontrolport         i only had limited time  but i've made one more test to isolate the issue   sudo strace  f  e trace connect  u amnesia  opt bisq 1 2 5 bisq   loglevel info   torcontrolport 9051   i did a little cleanup on the output and pulled the following relevant snippet  note that this is a successful run of 1 2 5  showing the "expected" behaviour"    there are two   connect     calls  and from the context we understand that the first one is an attempt to probe for a bitcoin node on the local machine port 8333  and the second one is the connection to tor's control port  supplied via command line as 9051   the software works correctly   when i repeat the test with version 1 2 7  i see the first connect   call to port 8333  however after the message "connecting to running tor"  strace  shows   no connect   call     to port 9051 or any other  the timeout occurs 4 minutes later    this is consistent with my observation from running tcpdump on loopback  and confirms that the issue is located within the bisq app  not a firewall issue etc     i hope this helps  and provides a portable test to reproduce the bug even on non tails linuxes

hi  itdelatrisu   it's this  map  http   osu ppy sh s 160493  that caused the issue   regards
nope  both were spoils from ground battle  although i restored 1 point of si on union  because it got destroyed during combat  leopard just had some damaged armor  and after loading next day  all bays were destroyed somehow  although i think i added them manually in megamek  not from rat  maybe they are corrupted in that database  both were deployed in shut down state  as ai is unable to restart them  maybe that flag caused error  i have now two more drop ships  both salvages  and both seems to also have all bays destroyed  leopard cv was fully operational  and destroyed during space battle  so it doesn't seems to be influenced by shut down status  or ground map 
i am using 2 1 0 but it is an old project upgraded to this version  i use sublime text for editing files 
i am using the class path "com alee laf weblookandfeel" to set the look and feel dynamically at runtime  this is testing on the program lateralgm   it only occurs on restart where the look and feel is set and then setfocustraversalpolicyprovider is called with true at the end of main      lgm web l f  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3212801 11094577 723536b8 885e 11e5 9e2a a201063266f8 png   here's a full stack trace with java version printed by the error dialog

thank you for your quick fix  lbroudoux  i just pulled the latest docker image  and was able to import and test our use case further   for keycloak  i don't seem to have any errors with the functionality  it just jumped out at me as something potentially related to the reported issue  the configuration i'm using is the default docker compose file found in the microcks repository  happy to help troubleshoot further  but this doesn't appear to be impacting me for testing microcks locally 
sure   will do

i've attached the log showing a few runs of the application  this time the debugger seemed to mostly stop  i think it was something like 2 times stopped  1 didn't  3 times stopped  1 didn't   wrt delve  i have an entry   dlv path d  dev projects _go bin dlv exe   in idea properties to point to a delve i sometimes build myself and it installs under gopath bin  the problem with not always stopping on breakpoints happens with the delve you bundle with the plugin  as well  i haven't changed anything that i can recall which would affect how idea starts other than the vm memory settings   one possibly related note is that yesterday when i reported this issue  i was using the default idea settings for the heap  128m start and 768m max  i normally use higher values than these and for the runs you see in the log  i had set starting heap to 1024m and max to 2048m  i'm not sure if the intermittent stopping is related to memory use  but with the default settings it seemed that the debugger mostly didn't stop  for the runs with more memory allocated  it seemed to mostly stop    idea log txt  https   github com go lang plugin org go lang idea plugin files 233078 idea log txt

 tobiaskaminsky it's not clear what you are proposing for me to do     it looks like  atomspring did the same thing mentioned in the original post to _temporarily fix the symptom_     that is  after some unknown and intermittent issue causes the nextcloud account on a device to be removed  for me  this only happens intermittently to my nextcloud app account   no other accounts have this issue  _and_ i discover that i cannot add the nextcloud app account back again on my device  this _also_ is intermittent and not necessary correlated with the nextcloud account on my device mysteriously being removed     then i will   1  put the device into recovery  i use twrp  2  pull  data system_ce 0 accounts_ce db to my computer via adb 3  edit the "accounts" table and the "extras" table by deleting all entries referring to the nextcloud account in the file accounts_ce db by using a sqlite editor  "db editor for sqlite" is my poison of choice for this  4  after saving the edits in step 3   push the modified accounts_ce db back to  data system_ce 0  on the device via adb  5  use "adb shell chown system system  data system_ce 0 accounts_ce db" to make sure this file's user   group ownership is something android expects 6  reboot the device  delete any now defunct nextcloud app accounts _on my nextcloud server_  and readd the nextcloud app account on my device   fwiw  i continue to have this problem intermittently  so far i have not been fortunate enough to get a logcat of the events otherwise i'd share it      updated environment data additional info   android version 7 1 2 lineageos 14 1 20171020  device model  surnia  i also have update a falcon and a hammerhead device both using lineageos and a similar app mix but so far have not run into this issue    nextcloud server version 12 0 3  ubuntu 16 04 3 lts  gnu linux 4 4 0 97 generic x86_64   topt enabled  https only  redirected from a ddns service at a high port that is redirected to port 443 by my router   while this problem has affected me over the past month when using versions of 2 0 0rc and the "stable" 2 0 0 both from fdroid  i cannot provide reliable info to reproduce this problem   it occurs unexpectedly  intermittently  and  as far as my recollection goes  not always due to events related to using the nextcloud app   if i can get a logcat before after this event happens  i'll share it     hth

the numbers i mentioned above comes from taiwan diabetes association at  1   their whole site is in chinese  however i can find different suggestions from many local hospital associations doctors over the internet  some just take ada's suggestion while some takes from epidemiology researches    so maybe we could check if this standard range would be different for people from place to place  if not  we can simply use ada+aace+nice+custom  and ask users to consult their physician for their optimal ranges  would this way better    1  http   homepage vghtpe gov tw  meta hospital teach1 htm

 dragonraider5   i used  react native link  command and verified manually that it has linked correctly  according to the readme  unfortunately i can't share the repo i'm working on right now  but i'll try to setup a clean app and reproduce the problem 
yes  i'm using windows 10  i already tried to import fonts  it don't help 
for me  it was usually when going to background and coming to the foreground inside the channelactivity but can happen in mainactivity too

 lgou2w not solved yet    but i feel   i was using a dev build     i test that paper spigot version and my friends said bukkit was better that it    i think i should wait for the full version of 1 14 paper spigot  so i closed the issue  
i don't have pylint  i got this when runnin the mirror script and  i think  the log directory didn't exist 
many of the calls to  increasestoredenergyunits  that i can see will all check the eu capacity  and only increase by the amount it can hold  the other ones are for things like the magic energy absorber  which is probably fine because it eats an enchantment or something and produces a ton of energy all at once 
that happened in 2 1 rc5  almost sure that it can happen on 2 1

thanks for looking into this  i will try to produce a sample project which reproduces the error  but it might take some days   maybe there could be a problem with the order postprocessafterinitialization method is called  if postprocessafterinitialization is called first with a datasource argument  and directly after that with a entitymanagerfactory argument  then properties variable is not yet set and this might lead to npe  just a thought  i might be totally wrong about the inner workings of spring    
i've now been able to reproduce this on my local whereas previously i was only encountering on our production server  it seems like the version is incorrect like it is somehow using the created date      one other thing to note is that our schema_version table does not have a "state" column  this showed in the https   flywaydb org blog flyway 4 0 but that could be database specific or redundant

okay  swankjesse sorry this came late  my case was this  i'm building this app that respond to shared url  so part of my test was to make sure that all url are return a success respnse of 200  i used okhttp to make sure that i got a succes response of 200  for some reason urls with empty fragment or with frahgments seems to return error even though they where valid 
i am not sure about that because i do not know that much about mail spec which is a bit complicated    but only in  if  content instanceof string        we check if something is attachment and https   docs oracle com javaee 6 api javax mail part html#getcontent 28 29 says  for example  the object returned for "text plain" content is usually a string object  so usually    always     what if it is going to be inputstream or something else for some other mimetype  anyway i do not think it can happen very often  probably only if some other library will mess with datahandlers or some other case but i havent seen that yet   but since we are here there is one more thing to consider  _  which is connected to previous one  what about images  for example  image png  that are inline  they will usually go to if  content instanceof inputstream        or the new else      since there is no check for disposition they will be always treated as attachment  but i think that images can be also inline  probably some other stuff theoretically can be inline to   for example some email clients can show images inside message and some other show them as attachments  but we loose that information     anyway i am not sure what you should do in such case  email addmessage   which doesnt seem right since it is usally for text plain  text html  or maybe there should be email addinline

apologies for the delay  i will see what i can do  what i'm thinking should happen in this case  where a single "word" is larger than the column's maximum width  is that the output should fall back to naive splitting and breaking in the middle of the word  what do you think 
a user of this library might rely on  configuration isnamespacecleanupenabled    in order to cleanup their own stuff   we were using our own flag to control this behavior  but we dropped it in favor of using arq cube one  it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel for such behavior   so  we create our stuff and  in the end  we check for that flag to decide whether or not to cleanup the stuff we created   the problem is that by default  that flag is set to  false  on arq cube  given  destroynamespace  is true by default   which is semantically wrong  since its meaning is  "should we cleanup stuff after the tests run "   the fact the the whole namespace is going to be destroyed at the end of the suite should not affect the fact we should cleanup the stuff we created   example of workflow  1  test1 runs and creates  say  a buildconfig named "build" 1  test1 finishes  but we don't delete the buildconfig above because  configuration isnamespacecleanupenabled    returned false 1  test2 starts but fails because it also creates a buildconfig named "build"   duplicated resource  1  test suite ends  namespace is cleaned up   note the broken behavior on step 3 above  with my patch this is fixed  because it makes configuration less subjective

 cdjackson yes  options are permitted in case they are true  note that i kept all your alarm "switch" channels in place with options  saying "ok" and "alarm"   but this channel type that i fixed is the "generic" power switch and for this a toggle is definitely the right widget   a drop down does not make sense   btw  the options were even wrong  they sent "on" and "off" instead of "on" and "off"

can you fix it soon 
that would fix the test case  since it is predictably running touchdown during the lifecyclelistener's pause event  but i don't think it would prevent the issue from happening in practice if a timer could still possibly be created during the "danger period"  what about suluke's suggestion from #1548  setting timer thread to null during the pause event seems like it would work

had the same idea as stalep  but not only gradle itself is a problem  when importing a gradle project into intellij or eclipse  the output paths of gradle and the ide are not shared  because gradle wants no shared paths  because that destroys correct up to date recognition   so  if you want to start the test from your ide  it still will not work  eclipse and intellij  have default output paths  but can be reconfigured to other paths  so i would suggest   on the one hand the ability to recognize the default intellij   projectroot out production classes  and  projectroot out test classes   and eclipse  only one output path  projectroot bin   output paths should be added  and on the other hand some kind of additional output path configuration for non default output paths may be useful

yes  i have no trouble connecting to his backend  and after this failure  i can go to another screen and get other downloads   just to be clean  re reading my original comment   when i said "after a few hours are collected" i was referring to hours of guide data  not that i had to wait hours for it to start syncing again   i've also used my browser and done things like myth gethostname as fast as i can press ctrl r e g  refresh and had no failures   i suspect this is a result of tcp rsts that i've discussed in the past  but without being able to capture protocol  i can't prove it   i would suggest that the test for backend availability might be enhanced to make more than one check  if all is well  there would be no impact on data transfer  if gethostname failed  maybe it could be retried  or  could calls to that function be passed with an argument s  for how long to try  and or how many attempts to make  just tossing out ideas

ah thanks   actually i was playing with damn vulnerable websockets  docker version  you start it with docker run  d  p 80 80  p 8080 8080 tssoffsec dvws you have to put dvws local in the host file  otherwise websockets do not work   when finally i had everything working  kali updated zap to 2 8 0 and it stopped working again   i configured zap with port 8081 as a proxy listener   what happens is that when dvws local is redirected to https   dvws local  all requests that use websockets simply do not go through  not sure if it's relevant  if it's a zap issue or a dvws issue

thank you for the quick reply    i’ve inherited the use of a persistent database from when  simple monitor exporter  was used  we want simple monitor to retain state when restarted  our processes can take quite long  hours or even days  and we have preference for postgresql when it comes to relational databases 
only a few where showing though there should have been more  there were some edge errors in log  so i'm pretty sure there was some corruption and something got stuck in a loop over it  i ended up rebuilding my db so i don't have access to that data anymore   i'll try these queries again on non corrupt data and see if i still have problems

 rachellyne i believe what's happened is the unexpected syntax  the greater than symbol  causes the webapp to misread the widget config and discard it   it's reading xml so the     bracket is breaking it  i tried to encode but that didn't work either    i will check the reader and see what's wrong  the enrichment widget seems to be okay with that syntax so maybe just have to copy that over for graph widgets   let me know your priority for this

thanks ill mention this to the admin  and no i cannot provide any further infromation beyond what i have  i have no access to any server files  and admin recently disabled  plugins command   but thanks for the replies  i'll let him know about this profile reset  which in my mind sounds like the most logic thing to work on  prior to what i described above  i had lots of items duplicating when placing and removing them   items disappearing when i die  and duplicated into other items   like one example my sword got turned into steak  food  when i was first hitting with the sword   then ran low on health  switched to food rightbefore i died  holding down rightclick to eat   the sword was then gone  and instead of having that 1 stack of steak  i now had two stacks with the same quantity  this happen whilst fighting "bosses" that was created from the plugin bosselite  or something     atleast a boss plugin   later i had placed redstone on the ground  and was going to remove that redstone piece   and place a piston when i placed the piston the piston disappeard   then when i right clicked the ground where that piston was  it placed redstone whilst i had nothing in my hand  due to berserker triggering even if i was holding an item in my hand   then when i rightclicked on the ground redstone appears  from "thin air" i could still tap the redstone again creating a new entity duplicating redstone dust  but the piston was forever gone  these things happening and also getting loads of these lagspikes after teleport i do not know exactly whats causing it   i'm now digging through bukkit forums to find more solutions

actually application is 10 lines long  however our core library which includes operating system api produces much of the code because of a task container created for each application before running it  api is huge 100s of classes  system requires a single application file  so we embed teavm runtime also to the code   here is a figure for 10 lines of application   not 3  almost 4 times larger  gwt    220k teavm    850k  without minify 2 3m   i have a teapot demo for gwt which is a pretty good size application  gwt produces 330k for it  this includes images in the code  around 20k   i haven't compiled it with teavm yet  one thing may be the string concatenation that produces quite a lot of code    unfortunately  library is huge  and i cant release it to public at the moment  lets get the bugs settled and make things running on our end first  i will work with you on the reasons of the huge file size  you may also supply a maven configuration property for also compressing the output  the generated files would be myapp js and myapp js gz  that would help a lot

thanks for the follow up and questions   before deciding how the tccl should be used   it would be useful  to me anyway  to understand why it was introduced in the first place  especially for the logging case   is there any brief write up  other than in the following linked issues    history   featuredetector  and  classutils ispresent  first learnt to be passed a  classloader  in https   github com flyway flyway commit 8c800dfcb954840d52ab7c6c271e049162c301a7 and it seems issues #626 and #696 were drivers   before that the normal classloader was used   i figured logging in flyway code  and location configuration of logging apis  would be mostly an internal affair  but i do notice that at one point logging was moved from the internal to public api   maybe to support extension and plugins  i'm not familiar enough with flyway to know    note that  logcreator  and all of  logfactory  is static   if it is allowed to be deployed to a shared classloader and called by multiple applications modules with their context classloaders  we could end up with a race where the first caller to  getlog  brings their available logging api   so in summary  i'm interested in knowing what the tccl provides here   maybe it is access to resource configuration files for the logging api that only exist in the child context classloader   just seems like for something as fundamental as logging  flyway should be self sufficient within its own classloader

hi  sanketmarkan  thank you for your interest in this aspect    my recommendation is to start from the worldrenderer interface and in particular the worldrendererimpl class  that's the entry point of the rendering system    if you look into worldrendererimpl initrendergraph   you'll see a long list of nodes being added  the existing debug system plugs into the finalpostprocessingnode but i assume it will be eventually removed from there    please notice that the rendering system will undergo some further refactoring during the gsoc  consequently the new visual debug system will suffer from a moving goalpost syndrome  that been said  the node base architecture will remain and you will be able to rely on that    some logistics    are you already running from source    feel free to use this issue to discuss things further  you can also use the forum or we can set up an appointment via irc should you require it     keep in mind i'm in the gmt+1 timezone

the reason i'm removing   adding back the scrollbar from the viewgroup is because i never was able to just hide it  neither setvisibility gone  nor setscrollbarhidden false  works for me   so the crash occurs after i removed the view once  then simply try to add it back to the same parent  simple call to view remove   and view add    nothing fancy here

sorry  the project is a larger project that i can't share  it's been mostly built by other developers    i can try to give a little more context to see if it helps at all  we're using struts 2  the project structure consists of parent artifact with several modules  i've included the above configuration in the webapp child module  not sure if maybe other plugins could interfere  if nothing comes to mind  i'll try to re create the issue in a test project  might be some time before i get to posting that though 
copy  working on it now   will be back in a few  using the released versions i assume 
well if u select the vailla version then the game is bugged because it copies wrong stuff  i mean try it yourself  the game starts but gets stuck in connecting  faf is a supreme commander forged alliance mod not a supreme commander mod 
thx for your answer and the for fixing the bug in the next update    i somehow missed the tutorials part of the book and looked at the page for the importer  i am sure i can figure it out with this informations 
it works fine  thank you   2016 07 03 14 45 gmt+07 00 alexis drogoul notifications github com    ##   quang chi truong tel  0939388153

at least full application on off would be helpful   yes  i use traccar web for 20 cars with gps data and there's a problem with some  half  that  every minute  send same positions  10 x  7am  20pm   13 hours  x 60 minutes   7200 per day x 1 week   a lot of entries   i should filter from the datasource so that the db doesn't get redundant data  i'll do it anyway  but i found strange the high cpu and analyzing queries in the db  found it was related to events     btw   my gps data collector only gets data at work hours    so  by night  it's all devices being 'offline' x devicetimeout

as always i try to pinpoint the source of my problem as best as i can before posting in the correct place   so yes i have already disable all plugins and have defaulted all settings    i don't mean to to argue but the bug that i was referring to that went on for a while is the one where your spawn point was not saved and you respawned at the map's default spawn point every time you died   not sure if this happened more than once but this bug dragged on for about 2 crows and a stable canary build before it was fixed when i noticed it   here's where i requested to be fixed  http   forums canarymod net  topic 3171 0  which was fixed by commits   fixed bug regarding server crash when your bed is destroyed   somners  https   github com fallenmoonnetwork canarymod commit 93651f6f8270bcff442a4af51454a39c6aabc627  and  fix bed re spawn issue  i hope   wwol  https   github com fallenmoonnetwork canarymod commit 49e48c81500585ac97b72be54cae8d9ed068ed22       anyway if you're talking about the current bug  respawn at death point  then let me know if that's the one you've already fixed so i can be quiet and we can dismiss this case   thanks 
thanks  that actually works  i thought i tried it but probably screwed up something else in the meantime

i have started the instance a second time  and also tried your advice  still  i can't make any change in the tree of the configuration editor  even if i don't color features  looks like we reload the config file after a save  but the save never happens  so no configuration can be modified

 fxprunayre  about the pseudo code you added for a fix  looks fine to me  i'll check next week to implement it    previous code stored wrong information  the template field names in the xml  what also was not nice 
i like that idea      deprecate  artofillusion procedural module  this will provide a shortstop for any code that tries to use the fqpn  pushing us to use the new name    commit to a version where we _will_ remove the old code   4 0  which would give us some time to work out the implications    i might consider  artofillusion procedural pmodule  or  artofillusion procedural procmodule  if we wanted to continue to use the word  module   otherwise  i might go with  artofillusion procedural block  for both "block of functionality" and "building block" from the visual editor standpoint   i don't think it will be too hard  my test build only fussed about 20ish uses in the core code  though  i don't doubt there are probably a few more 
3 6  however this was happening with 3 5 and maybe previous versions 

it is indeed different than i first thought  i have just seen that on repeated refresh of the same list of caches still some pictures are loaded  which made me think they are loaded multiple times   i retested it today and from what i can see  the first refresh loads quite a lot of images and on the sedond refresh also images are loaded  but these have not been contained in the first refresh as far as i checked   why is that   both refreshes have been done a few minutes apart  here are the logs   first refresh  https   www dropbox com s joo7hp9byiy2nnw firstrefresh_89caches_issues4578 txt dl 0  seond refresh  https   www dropbox com s bmugewj5ynwn39j secondrefresh_89caches_issues4578 txt dl 0  please kindly have a look 
it only happens when i have sentinel added to its traits 
default textures aren't patterned so you don't see the overlap  however in the interests of resourcepacks it really needs to be addressed

sure   the command  minecraft gamemode spectator has the same behaviour  the user falls into the void  it seems  there's no difference between the minecraft native command and the essentialsx one  over this issue   furthermore  i have noticed that this bug seems to appear and disappear per player with no reason  the day i opened this ticket  utrerano  _one of the users with "moderador" rank that suffers this_  suffered this problem  and  for example  this morning he didn't experience it on the main world  worldcraft   but on the skyblock one  so i asked another player with "moderador" rank  sancavip  to test it  he experienced it on the main world and on the skyblock one as well  so i suspect it   may   be a permission related   world related conflict  i've uploaded the personal permissions of this players   utrerano's permissions  https   gist github com metalgeardaner 0778d4d4f70c05b5d6d5adf341deda2a sancavip's permissions  https   gist github com metalgeardaner d367c30258d6cb31eb507d85e51eee7d  this is the list of user accessible worlds    worldcraft   worldcraft_nether   worldcraft_the_end   recursos   askyblock   askyblock_nether  thanks for the help

i have not personally  no   no specific devices seem to be the culprit   everything from the nexus 6 to the original htc one   they claim as soon as they enter in their details and  i am assuming  hitting the login button  it hangs there   some people use the word "froze" as well   not 100  sure on which screen  but i've gotten at least 20 reports of this just recently  within the last 2 weeks   which i have never received before   i am unaware if the consumer app is installed on these devices 
restlet jse 2 3 0 from the maven repo  i'm also including  using gradle       compile group  "org restlet jse"  name  "org restlet ext json"  version  "2 3 0"     compile group  "org restlet jse"  name  "org restlet ext fileupload"  version  "2 3 0"     compile group  "org restlet jse"  name  "org restlet ext guice"  version  "2 3 0"     compile group  "com google inject"  name  "guice"  version  "3 0"  also  using the internal server  although this is a testcase  so i'm connecting right into the application instance  the test cases  client  are in the same source tree as the server  so it's all the same version 
it is transport client  i use scala 2 12   that's all the code left  then i ran  lsof  p pid   grep tcp   wc  l  every second  the count increased by 3 exactly the same number of es servers configured for the connection 
kindle fire  7" ver 10 2 6  is the only android device i have right now so i don't know if it happens on others

now the beds work properly  thanks  👍

it's hard to reproduce because it happens rarely    close on the report should have been called only once  else there is some bug with nunit  also  endtest   should have been called on all tests before close

hi axel    i've found that the root cause is that i use data sources with autocommit mode set to false  in this case even extremely simple case  just schema history table creation without any migration  fails in concurrent environment  i've reproduced it in naive test  here  https   github com apanasevich flyway commit 03a47e00a355106a1d5f9f6fb1cca20bf0360687  in a separate branch    also  i've commited a  fix  https   github com apanasevich flyway commit 8afe727e6ae073af7e0c4f6e111b0e64080015cd  in another branch  could you take a look on it  if you find it correct  i'll create a pr   unfortunately  i can't find any test in the repository  so  i've checked the fix only with postgresql  but i think the problem is related to other dbmses 
not sure i understand the first part of the question but i got the spdy npn stuff working with gyrex back in the day  using  xbootclasspath and npn fragment   i'm now in the process of updating to jetty 9 4 1 and alpn 
when the error i linked happens my game seems to lag and slow down 
no sorry but since the high tps come as soon as it attack i suppose it's the most basic one  
my test case is a bit complex but i try to put a simple version  the problem may also originate from 'elemmatch' operator since it is used as well and i just realized that operator not found error is also in the console

no  the plane is completely gone  it's possible that i just couldnt find the entity because of how fast it is  but im pretty sure if you exit a plane it stop immediately  and yeah it logs it where the plane disappeared 
hmm i can't seem to replicate it java  it was only an issue through quercus  i think it's not a bug in orientdb  sorry
yeah u are right  fixed it

a few thoughts observations   first of all  a creature that goes onto a weird tile sometimes  but not always  turns invisible  that could explain why they all seem to be born around the same time    i was messing with something to make it so the creatures can't fight after they give birth for a while  to protect the baby   and around that time this seemed to happen more often  it is possible it has something to do with that  but i remember it happening before    also  this is definitely one way of making this happen  because if you just set newpy  and px  to be 0 it happens much more often    assuming there are not other ways of causing this problem  there may be   the actual issue is when you divide by distance  which is 0  in calculating the collision force  because adding a small value to distance gets rid of the problem if newpx and newpy are set to 0   and is it really such a small chance that it won't happen for 50 000 creatures    is it possible it spawns really close to the center of the creature and is pushed so the distance is 0   to sum up  i know this is one way of causing the problem  but i am not sure it is the only one or the one actually causing it during simulations   edits  my attempted fix  see earlier post  didn't work  so either a  my fix doesn't work  or b  the problem does not lie there   also  it sometimes says in the console something along the lines of  no glyph found for   character  ufffd   this could be a cause  or an effect that happens after  maybe there is no nan character to display on tiles

none directly  indirectly it complicates unit testing  is confusing when developing new annotators and will result in problems building functionality on top of the output resulting in time wasted that could be spend on developing other features 
thanks for the comments  the liblockdev1 library does fix the problem on the rpi3 but not the rpi2 on wheezy   the answer came from cvanorman   "the current build of nrjavaserial requires glibc    2 15  debian wheezy has glibc 2 13 and so it will crash on that platform"  as a result i moved on to jessie and my problem ended

sorry  what do you mean by "external" 
removing tostring might work  it could just potentially break some backward compatibility  e g  transform map files which map "undefined" to something else    and it does not solve a deeper problem  if you post undef on a stringitem  it will not reconstruct an undeftype  but a stringtype instead  so i wonder if we might have to introduce some reserved keyword and put the undeftype at the top of the accepteddatatypes in stringitem

 shawnieboy that wiki page really needs some editing and does not have enough info     lodici i guess our opinions are different about readmes  i think a readme is something that helps you if you read it  not only somewhere to put release notes  i think stuff like the definition of in game words and shortcut keys  should definitely be there   that f1 mechanism is neat  will check it out    melvinzhang  lodici will test the memory parameter along with the existence of a "time to think bug"

i haven't tested this but i think this bug appears in following code    ife 0  1   set a   sp + 100    in that case emulator is skipping and tick    tick_skip    getinstructionlength   will return wrong instruction length  i suppose it would next try to use 100 as instruction opcode and do something evil 
great  thanks  i'll reduce my specification to a minimal example exposing the problem and submit a pull request   since i should do it against the  2 0  branch  should i keep the specification in the 3 0 0 format or rewrite it as 2 0 
yes  this is 1 5  looks like things were reworked in 2 0  i don't know if our project could migrate to 2 0 immediately

this is exactly what my issue is  i am indeed overriding the  applicationcontext  itself because it only works as a facade when  genericapplicationcontext resourceloader  is  null   otherwise it uses the resource loading capabilities of its superclass  since  genericapplicationcontext  derives from  defaultresourceloader   therefore  when custom protocol resolvers are registered with the  applicationcontext  itself  actually  the  defaultresourceloader  it extends  they fail to be consulted once devtools injects the custom  resourceloader   therefore  i chose to reimplement  applicationcontext getresource  to easily showcase the fact that this method is never called   you are correct in your suggestion to change the testcase the way you did  as you then implement the workaround i illustrated  what my tests show is that if  genericapplicationcontext resourceloader  is not set  then the  applicationcontext 's implementation is not used  therefore its behaviour is lost   the main problem here is that  applicationcontext  in some cases is not just a facade  but an actual implementor of  resourceloader   if you ask me  a better solution would be to remove  defaultresourceloader  from the inheritance chain of  genericapplicationcontext  and always delegate to an instance property  this would however be a breaking change and i understand that this cannot be changed at the moment  neither is it in spring boot  but in spring context    is the problem more clear now  do you need anything else from me to help 
it was necessary to exclude org w3c dom document from class loading  that solved issue  thanks

i haven't used that plugin  this is what i've tried    second one throws an error  first one doesn't work 
i believe this used to work fine and was only recently introduced seeing as it was used as a solution in a previous post  https   github com runelite runelite issues 2719   i originally tested this on java 8 until i updated to the latest version so i believe it's not related to the version of java    i'd like to also mention the issue only occurs when using the gpu plugin and works fine otherwise 
yes  i do mean all adjacent blocks  but why would the sign also protect the block beneath it   shouldnt it just protect the sign and the block that the sign is on only  and you mean that sign posts protect the block that the post is one  right   sorry  will need to get back to you on the version i use 
it's requiring me to mount them  and my bad i didn't use full paths 
i'll give it a try 
 fpj i hit the problem while developing a unit test for the writer   i don't think the specific error is significant     take a look at the referenced code block  observing that the  pendingwritescount  is not decremented on error  causing a subsequent  flush  to wait forever for  pendingwritescount  to reach zero 
i'll try to reproduce the issue  i already corrected everything   for the record  so far 0 10 is working great  it resolved my endlessly spinning problems on 0 9 3 4  why i was still using 0 8    i'm still monitoring  but things look good   i'll rebuild from backups into a test environment and re upgrade and see if i can repeat the issue for you 
i tried with and without the battery saver mode  still the same issues

here you can download the sample application  testapp zip  https   github com spring projects spring boot files 1371062 testapp zip    the test app is a very simple application that exposes the actuator endpoints  if you run the application as it is  the management port is different from the server port and if you perform an head request on the endpoint http   localhost 8889 management refresh you receive an internal server error  500 error code    if you edit the application yml removing the management port and management context path properties and then execute the head request on the endpoint http   localhost 8888 refresh you receive the method not allowed error  405 error code  as expected   this different behaviour represents a problem into the integration with the spring boot admin application   the app has the same behaviour if you don't specify the version 1 5 7 of the actuator library  using the one imported with the dependencies management

thank you so much for your investigation and time you've spent  but unfortunately i messed everything up with service naming and led you to wrong assumptions    camel producer  and  camel consumer  are not using  camel zipkin  lib  that lib is not covering my needs  so i decided to make lib myself  https   github com playtika sleuth camel  hopeful after i get proper result we will publish it to maven central  next step   to contribute to spring cloud sleuth project for 2 0 boot and brave support  my lib is targeting 1 5 boot which is my preference so far   anyway issue i posted is related to json's which i attached below  they seems to be correct and i see that zipkin got them and parse them in proper way  but unfortunately not showing the desired result of lag  which i trying yo achieve  i'm not pointing that this is a bug  maybe it's by design  just wanted to have confirmation of that

i think you're right   jgfidelis   i just checked and sharing directly from spotify to stories  spotify has a direct ig share feature  has a similar issue  it brings me to a login screen  and i never end up being able to share the song even after logging in  no "unable to share  must be logged in" message in this case though    you can bet that if it's breaking spotify's sharing that it's a bug

i edited the mac address just on the log  didn't want to post the real one  no changes were made in your code   i'm getting this error when trying to connect to a physical elm 327 interface connected to an hw emulator  the older version  http   code google com p android obd reader downloads list  and other software  i e  torque  works fine in this configuration   notably  the current version works fine with obdsim  sw emulator  
i agree  an additional check for the cluster id should reduce occurrences of this issue  i will attempt a pr  and maybe i get other ideas on how to improve this when doing this  in which case i would add a comment to this ticket here before implementing them  
good to hear  no problem at the meantime i use those without with_ack_receipt  but although without such ack  if i send it with reliable  i have no need and it's alright to operate with _with_ack_receipt if i don't do anything after another end ack back   on a side  could you please point me out to jraknet documentation  i can find only simple demo code that client server connects with each other but not send receive any packets  i might miss something  thank you marf 
well i don't have any of those mods  and the emc is correct on some most worlds  i have ex nihilo ex aquilo botania  thaumcraft and add ons  blood magic  the only difference in worlds is the one is a botania garden of glass world which changes recipes but other gog worlds are fine  is there a way to clear cache or something 
i attacked and dealt combat damage with  i _believe_  two   _siren stormtamers_   and a   _storm fleet aerialist_    though one of those creatures might have been a   _kitesail freebooter_      sorry for being vague   this is my first bug report 
i put 5 0 in the title because that's the version i was testing  it seems that although some of these are not new strings  they weren't truncating in previous versions   so seems like some are regressions   i don't have a previous build or screenshots to tell though  but i filed truncation issues for the previous release  and these strings weren't part of the truncations  i believe

that is exactly what i mean  but it looks like the stargate ring is there  too  below it  seems like both at the same time  so to say  because one or two ring   chevron blocks are usually missing and you can see the ring there

according to daydrem docs  "app button  this button depends on the app you’re using  for example  it might show menus  pause  go back  or change modes "  so it's a good idea to map that button to the general back action

the pr in question  https   github com nextcloud android pull 4275  is already merged 
false alarm  indeed problem was on our side  api was setting db encoding to  utf8  instead of  utf8mb4   just deployed a fix  should be good now 
sure  be happy to open a pr  we're currently using version 1 7  working on upgrading   after a node restarted  one of the shards failed to initialize with the error message i listed above  i'm guessing that a write was dropped on the replica at some earlier point  even though the overall operation reported success  if this is a known issue that is fixed in later versions  i'd be very interested to hear it   to fix this  we removed the shard files from the node reporting the wrong doc count and let it recover from the primary   when checking doc counts with  _cat shards  i noticed that the doc count didn't match up with the error message  checked on the source code to see where the number was coming from and found the bug

i'm not sure how informative my answer to mario will be after tom's comment  but since the thread does not seem to have come to a conclusion consent yet  i'm adding my answer to be sure nothing is lacking   our use case is a service that uses the java cda api to obtain cdaentry instances  i e  our service is a client of the cda api   the service caches these instances  the service uses different threads to serve multiple concurrently connected clients  each client can have a custom locale  whenever the service serves a request from one of its clients  it will access the cached cdaentry using the client's locale   contentful surely cannot know the access patterns for all the clients of the cda api  that's why we are happy to tell about our access pattern  the cda api should certainly support all access patterns insofar as it should be thread safe  i e  the cda api should by design avoid hard to detect bugs like race conditions and this is certainly possible with the solutions tom and i outlined  we could surely build an abstraction around the cda to avoid the race condition for us  that would  however leave the issue open for other users who acccess the cda api from multi threaded services which would need to uncover and fix the race condition again  individually  contentful could solve the issue once and for all by adjusting the api   please let me know if i can provide any further input to solve this issue

i found the problem was not in the test project itself  there was another project in my workspace which was causing this problem   it took me awhile to figure out which one  as soon as i closed this project eclemma ran flawlessly   what is peculiar about this offending project it is a plugin project with no output directory defined in build properties  i guess this causes the error above   thank you 
probably not before the release

yes  i also think that i'm using 1 0 8   below is the code that creates the animateddrawable  or if that does not work  creates a normal bitmapdrawable assuming it is a non animated image   unfortunately i cannot reproduce this issue on my device by myself  but a friend of mine gets it from time to time  samsung galaxy s3   also  in google developer console  i get many of these native crash report  the devices are mostly galaxy s3  nexus 5  galaxy s4  galaxy note 3  galaxy s5  xperia z1  looks like it happens only on android 4 3 and 4 4  but that might be a coincidence  
i see this in courier  lucidatypewriter  mathjax_vector  mathjax_vector bold  nimbus mono ps  noto color emoji and vt323  i do not see it in source code pro and source code variable  these are all the fonts i can choose  i will change my font to one of those then   also  i set the preferences to automatic line breaks  if a new line starts then  the cursor gets resetted 
sounds good to me  that's what i originally thought too  should we use the string "open in focus klar" that also appears in the browser menu in a custom tab 
ive migrated about 6 servers from pex to luckperms already  they all have the same issue  but its not always the same users that dont get migrated correctly  on a few servers i can run "lp user voidangel info" with no problem  but for a user that is online even at that moment i can type " lp user exampleuser info" and it will tell me that the user cannot be found   given the fact that i have already done this many times i dont think the outcome will change xd but if you have something else in mind that i am not thinking of  i will try exporting and migrating again

the screenshot is from dynmap  full world render right after the regeneration   but that explains why the world has only terrain generated   don't forget the command bug here   i do the "pregeneration" of the world to reduce the server load when players are online and moving around to find other biomes or so  if i only generate the terrain  there is still lost of work for my cpu when the decoration is generated  so this will not really do  what i want   totally remove world generation lag   maybe a config paramter can do the trick here  so i can switch to full generation  terrain + decoration  for every filler run  to toally remove that i need additional cpu load for that  because with every change in a chunk dynmap is refreshing the map too  causing additional load

 lumpfish  apology for a not so clear description  i have updated it  the issue was originally created with the following in mind   jck tests currently run via stf wrappers  these wrappers are part of systemtest repository  so  in order to compile and run jcks we need to compile systemtests and stf  however jcks have run without stf wrappers in the past  so  for sake of simplicity and ease of maintenance we may want to think about running jcks without the stf wrappers

it looks like a useful improvement but the problem is that information is only shown if   file   preferences   show verbose output during    compilation   is checked  compilation verbose output is not enabled by default and is rarely needed for troubleshooting the common issues reported on the forum  i usually have it turned off because it makes for more scrolling to read the warnings  requesting the user to enable it adds an additional step to the support process and can make the output longer than the maximum character limit of the forum  forcing the user to add it as an attachment or dropbox link  etc  which adds yet another level of complication and makes it harder for the other forum users to view the output  having verbose output during compilation turned off makes it less likely that the platform version can be determined from platform paths shown in the output as those paths will only be shown if the error involves one of the platform files   i was referring the text added to the start of the output only when the "copy error messages" button is used not shown on the console   for example  changing     adding the platform name to this output would also be useful 
yeah  i was just capturing this  don't have time at the moment but hope i get a minute to circle back soon

for me at least  if i use the apply operation with a 1 parameter operator  and specify a fixed value in the second slot  the result is a 0 parameter operation   i e  i have an operation variable that accepts an entity and returns an nbt value  if i use it in an apply with an entity variable  the resulting variable can be placed in a display to see the result  it seems it can also be used again in an apply 
it should change the brightness  just like on off should turn the light on and off 
so adding that mutex does make the problem more rare but i could still get it to happen by the about 30th run when i had 3 requests happen at the same millisecond   i'll do some more poking   edit  could not repeat this anymore despite how long i ran the test  might have been some fluke thing related to how i created the mutex at that time  the attached pr 884 seems to fix this completely 
afair in nearby location search at least 
so i took another look at it this evening  and i'm fairly sure it was an issue with the drive having its permissions changed somehow  the  data directory had been changed to be owned by root  i've no idea how  but changing it back fixed the issue 
yes  it is reproducable with just plethora  and computercraft 1 79 of course    if it helps  here is a crash log with just computercraft and plethora 
thanks for reply  i got this error again a few days ago  maybe when ad is ready to play but i finish activity and release the player   this is the sample ima ad code here  https   pubads g doubleclick net gampad ads iu  21685920852 setn_video_pre roll_1280x720_2 cust_params pagegroupid 3d 0  description_url  placeholder  env vp impl s correlator  tfcd 0 npa 0 gdfp_req 1 output vast sz 1280x720 unviewed_position_start 1 ppos 1 timestamp 
after speaking with matt about this  i believe there was an onerror function showing custom error output and not outputting line numbers properly so looks like this is probably a non issue 
https   gist github com ciscam f538eb21e40978f10b75463aa23648f4 here's the "logcat  c  logcat  v long" output turning off all providers didn't change the behavior  thanks for pointing that out  though   also  using the app from f droid   i'd try the play store version  but it's still on 2 32 3  which works fine when installed from f droid
i've done some more testing and these are my conclusions   i can't reproduce the bug in singleplayer it only happens for me in multiplayer  i've tested all the botania rods and found that only the following three rods have the duping bug     rod of the lands   rod of the highlands   rod of the terrafirma  furthermore the rod of the depths makes it so that the builder's wand doesn't work at all   i suspect that the bug is due to all three rods abillity to create dirt out of mana and the interaction of this mechanic with your mod  i've tested with some other random botania items but none of them seemed to exhibit the duping bug 
in current  oauth2authorizationserverconfiguration  you can find

nope  it only happens when a compile error occurs  you also do not see the compile error in the repl
thank you for the reply   1  yes  i am seeing the issue only on galaxy tab s2  i tried it also on galaxy s5  android version 6 0 1  and nexus 9  android version 7 0  and just noticed that selection of higher video tracks are disabled  2560x1440 and 3840x2160  on these devices  on galaxy tab s2 these video tracks are available and i see same issue when selecting one of them manually   2  i must have tried reproducing the issue with unprotected short video before because i just managed to reproduce the issue with shorter widevine protected video            "name"  "dash gpmfv6 h264 encrypted"          "uri"  "http   media axprod net dash gpmfv6 h264 encrypted manifest mpd"          "extension"  "mpd"          "drm_scheme"  "widevine"          "drm_license_url"  "https   drm widevine licensing axtest net acquirelicense"          "drm_key_request_properties"              "x axdrm message"  "eyj0exaioijkv1qilcjhbgcioijiuzi1nij9 eyj2zxjzaw9uijoxlcjjb21fa2v5x2lkijoinjllntqwodgtztllmc00ntmwlthjmwetmwvinmrjzdbkmtrliiwibwvzc2fnzsi6eyj0exblijoizw50axrszw1lbnrfbwvzc2fnzsisimtlexmiolt7imlkijoin2yzyze0ntutowe0zs00odc4ltgyzdetywq3yjyyytyxmdzjin1dfx0 qgt0i2hzmntyfq9tk3p2u2s1pruygb12rsb3g6ebblq"              i did not find any default demo app videos to match requirements  protected video that would have several video tracks  one of which would need to be higher than device resolution   therefore i could not reproduce the issue with default demo videos 
hi  fmichielssen    you are right that it shouldn't affect the manually created service in any way  although it seems to me that it does delete the services  i've tried it with the original example configuration on minikube and with a slightly modified one using kubernetes with acs  the problem were the same in both cases    i've tried to collect more info about it  please let me know if i'm missing something and maybe that causes the problem     in the config file  i use the following settings   in the log  you can see that before the delete operation there is 2 available service  shinyproxy srvice and kubernetes  although we don't have any service associated with the proxy and  getproxy proxy  getservice    value is null  the two service gets deleted    looking at the kubernetes dashboard i can see that the pod is successfully deleted  my shinyproxy service is also disappeared  and the kubernetes service is restarted its age is just a few seconds     i'm not familiar with the kubernetes java client  but could it be the issue that the filtering at  kubeclient services   delete getproxy proxy  getservice       line is not working as expected and if it gets a null value it deletes every service    it would be nice if you could do a quick test with the example config and see whether you can access the service after shinyproxy deletes the pod 
using the query to do the prepopulation will work very well   this resolves my issue  but a couple more thoughts on the original issue   concerning which methods i would recommend being abstract  it appears that all your methods are performing necessary functionality  although if a user were to be implementing their own queryview  i would imagine the points of customization would probably be in initialization  on refresh  adding an item  and removing an item  however with all the functionality the methods that perform these operations contain  i would only want to override them and make sure i called the super method in my implementation   maybe the real issue is that the lazyquerycontainer accepts any implementation of queryview  but it seems that your intent is to enforce the lazyqueryview  maybe it would just be easiest to remove the final modifier on lazyqueryview and tell users it's their own fault if they extend it and don't call the super methods

 johnmcclean aol thanks for the fast response  this sounds great  seriously  decent pattern matching and higher kinded types are the things i miss most in java  so your project gave me hope   a really cool thing too would be a gist how to "idiomatically" use the typeclasses in cyclops  tbh  i tried to implement one but gave up after being overwhelmed with the amount of additional types and interfaces i had to look into  i think that would make the project for people with fp background but not experienced with java more accessible 
15 9  although iirc it might've been the same for 15 10 as i had tried to test it in my own personal and more updated modpack 
it sadly doesn't happen only once and i can reproduce it   it would be awesome if you could release bugfix release  also off topic but will you drop 1 10 2 support soon and just continue developing for 1 11

that is a temporary solution and considered a bad practice  the solution to this problem lies in the concept of handling lifecycle callbacks and is an important concept for all android developers to learn about  solving this issue will help them learn about it and implement it in a project as well  i would not encourage locking the screen orientation   
didn't keep the original crash  seemed to be something with shift clicking out  but i can't be sure  will submit it again if it happens again    og
haven't tried to recreate it with just actually additions but taking off my back pack makes it stop plus it does it with every tile entity being placed on another tile entity  must be a problem with iron backpacks  sorry for wasting your time dude xd

hello benas   yes your modifications is working till some point  sadly all of the other annotations and the methods for checking the annotations should be modified if we want easy rules work behind a proxy like cglib  however i started to think that it is a very specific request and i suspect that it may not be that common  anyways less talk and more code   i have prepared an integration test just for checking if easy rules can work behind a proxy  you can checkout my branch from here   https   github com cgonul easyrules tree integration_test_for_proxying  my new branch is up to date with your latest changes   here is the codes for integration tests   dffdf6b3d68d578d9d35b11530c6b71dcaadc6bc  in here all of my beans is served behind a proxy with the help of aspectconfiguration  when this happens the classes annotated with  springrule becomes the child class of the non proxied original classes  you can comment out the  configuration annotation in aspectconfiguration class to disable the proxy   you will see that the integration test is not succeeded  it fails with the following argument exception    which is triggered from ruledefinitionvalidator since easy rules can not find the condition annotation on the dummyrule class  since the dummyrule is created as a child class of the original dummyrule by the cglib proxy      how ever she can find the  rule annotation since it is inherited thanks for your last modifications checkruleclass method is succeded     this weekend i will work with this integration test and make easy rules works behind a proxy  the challenge for me is that you do not like annotionutils from spring core dependency  i will try to localize it   thanks

 ashish bansal  hi ashish   as i tested  it seems like that bug has got fixed   great job  yashwanth krishnan
there was no output in the window where i ran  bin che sh start  i  when i attempted to goto definition  f4  or autocomplete  however  in that case i think i was using they wrong key binding    i did not use the java stack or use the default template  i do have jdk 1 8 on my stack machine  the maven project type is selected for the project and update dependencies worked the second time i ran it   since that workspace broke  #286   i created a new workspace  now update dependencies fails  here is the output from my last attempt 
https   gist github com 4489935 i share this videopannel which can display two image on it i copied some code from yours   i grab the image from another thread and if i reproduce this crash again i will report here thanks it just some times happen 
sorry  it was my fault  i thought it's not the connection because another signal user told me he has the same problem  but this router blocks voip  this was the problem  i still didn't get a debug report 
i used the default one that dbeaver downloaded when i created the connection  there is any option to force full unload of the driver 
 foghina  the device crashed is asus t00j  since the api of the fresco are different between 1 3 0 and 1 5  and our project originally use 1 3 0  i do not try to upgrade to latest version   i tried to rebuild the 1 3 0 by adding the flags ' mstackrealign  mincoming stack boundary 4'  but the output library libstatic webp so has nothing different in the size and the function entry  and the app still crashed when using that library  i guess that may be not the esp disalignment leaded to crash

i have no idea what you're talking about  ekager   no one said anything about replacing any buttons that's all fine  brampitoyo   but i think you guys have lost the point      whether it shows as "open in fennec" or in the "open in    " menu thing is    bikesheding  the bug is that fennec is both not showing up as its own button nor in the "open in   " menu when focus klar is set as default  there is no way to open the webpage in fennec at all  but  in contrast  the xiaomi browser does show up in the     menu  maybe i should submit an issue to fennec    to anyone else having this problem   the work around i've found is to hit "share" then i can open it in fennec through that menu  it's a bit weird 
i used it with an attackhook   to make a name tag mod it checks the items name then sets the name tag

dubbo作为一个严谨的框架，既然hessian1未废弃，就应当保持一致性，因为其他人可能在使用。  这是我第3次看到dubbo的master，合并到主干时未考虑兼容性。  建议先完成：功能性审核，再讨论代码样式和规范。

the user reported back saying this was the problem  according to  gnome keyring documentation  https   wiki gnome org projects gnomekeyring keyringintro  "login" is the default keyring and it seems like this one was not present on the system   still  rather than crashing cryptomator should just not offer this feature then 
yes  it's still the same issue in v2 1 4 as of today  10 10 2015

sure  wilkinsona    that worked prior spring boot  1 3   the  messagechannelmetricwriter  was declared in the  metricrepositoryautoconfiguration   plus the  metricschannel  has been declared there as well   that's why my old answer on so is pretty simple  http   stackoverflow com questions 29627061 subscribe to spring metrics channel   not sure that it was a good idea to declare a channel as an out of the box feature with its own  taskexecutor   so  i don't see reason to reinstate it  from one hand we are already far away from  1 2   from other the doc clarifies what to do http   docs spring io spring boot docs current reference html production ready metrics html#production ready metrics message channel integration    i think  metricexportautoconfigurationtests#defaultexporterwhenmessagechannelavailable    should ensure that  messagechannelmetricwriter  is present in the  metricexporters  
i don't have the code anymore but it was an overlay with a button and a vcat in it which contained a hcat of boxes or something
just using the ui    afaik the proxying is related to the layout type   just for the reference 

i don't use a file  i'm just capturing the screen from the host side then recored it then send it to the client  the problem ocuures on client side  the example above works perfect with javacv 1 3 3 but the example does not work with javacv 1 5 1 no statment execute on client side after grabber start   statment unless the inputstream that associated with the grabber closed 
no matter this is a bug or not  it is definitely an incompatible change  because the above example works with bazel built before 9c5b310
there exists a race condition  exhibited in the stack trace  where the service was started before the target is set  i can't reproduce it either  but from the code the race condition exists 
ah all rights  i need to type  kbd space  kbd  after  toreview  before it's actually added in  the  toreview  already appeared on the list of selected labels  in a faded state  before that so i thought it was added in and press  kbd enter  kbd    another behaviour is that while the  toreview  is in the faded state as above  if i click on the  toreview  label  it will show as being removed  crossed out state  although it's correctly applied after confirmation 
i don't know  it's from the zip file my friend sent me  i assume it's the latest version

hi  max dev   thanks for looking into this  we finally realized the problem was our   jsonignore  annotations  we didn't want our regular rest api including the complete referenced object  so we added that annotation  finally we realized this was probably interfering with the reference   can you point me to the code you use to replace the referenced object in the json serialization with just the url  i would like to apply something like that to our rest api as well

nope  just a standard steam pipe 
i tried the dev version v1 8 1 dev_b52d9274 1527369785  the result is the same  i e  got 2 entries each time   the original app has the visceral index  you can see the captured image of my previous issue  #248    btw  visceral is measured as an index  not in kg or   
because my class has a billion of rows  the query above is simplified just for your test
thanks for your answer   i'm trying to make web application which can auto fill behalf of the users   is selenide library not working in spring web projects 
natively   the steps are  1  open a workspace   maybe do some work  2  in the dashboard  close the workspace   often  it will not close  and you have to forcibly stop che    the cli will show something like    1  restart che if needed  and re open workspace  2  sometimes  the issue will occur   if not  stop the workspace again and restart it   the issue can usually be reproduced consistently   after i successfully reproduce the issue  simply stopping the workspace again and restarting it will fix it 
i think this problem appears because i am using m b  battlegear 2   in which melee weapons can't block completely
mmmm i cannot reproduce it so let's say this is fix  the copied value are now the right one 
no_connection should in fact be included in the algorithm above  it is merely a last resort  basically the try catch around everything     this would allow a more detailed control in the operations  the  test    method would have to run more tests though 
will do that  fix is coming up

hmm  the actual underlying exception was    not sure if  com google api client auth oauth2 tokenresponseexception  401 unauthorized  is a great message to report back 
distributed session implementation such as redis and hazelcast  only update the modified part of session data to session storage   and the session modification is captured by calling  websession  setattribute   only modify session data's value without calling  setattribute   session data will not be updated anyway   for example   the following code will not add  "key"  "value"  to session key a_dict_type_session_key 's value  if use redis or hazelcast based distributed session      setattribute  is overwrite by redis or hazelcast based distributed session to capture session data's modification   for the above reason  we finally got "authorization_request_not_found" in some case since the code failed to update session's data 
i understand the rationale  the scala community is pretty big and i feel like exposing it in the default ui would motivate more scala developers to invest in vertx to build their applications  otherwise  people are more likely to dismiss it as a java toolkit that isn't worth their time  this is my personal impression  it might be wrong though 
thanks guys  i haven't had access to anything but my work laptop for some time  lacking a dev environment hurts    expect to see more from me in the future 
i doubt that because the fragment list is inside a singleton class  maybe the fragmentmanager are not cleared up correctly 
i do not have habmin installed at the moment  but i will try and get to that tonight and see if i can still reproduce the issue  are there any logs beyond the log for openhab that i should pull 
yes  i think so  i'll test it again when i get back home

thanks for investigating this   in general  we have a  package info java  with annotations  but not in the default package where i put the test class   i have uploaded my   class  file here   issue616 zip  https   github com spotbugs spotbugs files 1965950 issue616 zip  can you reproduce it with this   is the class path relevant for this kind of problem  i have  among others  guava 23 6 jre  spotbugs annotations 3 1 1 and jsr305 3 0 2 from com google code findbugs on the auxiliary classpath 
yeah i'll get you a log when i get home tonight   it's not supposed to currently be possible for the client to be stuck in an infinite init loop like it is if client prefs is the only file missing  right    i mean i don't think this is intended behavior 
job timeout still not getting honoured for different job instances  resources and artifact upload for different job instances seems to be working   raised a different issue for this   #632 
my reasons to use lux    in lowlight conditions  mainly at night  the screen is too bright for me  the  black transparent  overlay reduces the brightness further   i can create sensor reading screen brightness pairs and control the auto brightness this way  i understand the tap jacking concerns  for me i found a solution now    actually i found two          1    in the lux app there  is an option to use an "alternative overlay"  which does not cause the unresponsiveness in the owncloud app  i dont know  if that alternative overlay works for me like the standard one  but i will see     alternative overlay causes the same issue  2  the lux app has a list of apps  that cause the overlay to be deactivated while one of these apps is in the foreground  this list contains the android package installer per default  which seems to have a similar tap jacking protection   so i added the owncloud app to that list 
ah  that should be it  i am still on the latest stable  1 3 x  i'll test with 1 4 x

 luluzhao yes my code is also multi threaded  in my case  i think  but need to do more investigation  that i have     one background thread which finishes some trace segment  if this segment tips the trace over the threshold set in  defaultstreamingstrategy  it starts to stream part of the trace    the main thread  in parallel  returns and finishes the trace at the top level  this then causes the main recorder to send the whole trace back to x ray  if these aren't properly synchronised  it's possible for them to clash giving rise to the "segment already emitted" errors  i could do this synchronisation externally  in my code  but it would make my code a lot simpler if i could rely on the x ray library to do this for me 
it needed a complete server reboot  a battlearena config reload causes it to break

thanks for the quick fix  i'll give it a try tomorrow   regarding eureka and sba client  there might be apps which are not providing any services discoverable via eureka  but from your question it sounds as if it's best practice to register anything with eureka no matter if there are consumers of the service and having sba query eureka for the available apps services

hi  thanks for the quick fix   for the second point  if tai    null  we go to that part of code    in my case  i don't have a status annotation and i got a deserialization exception 
sounds as if the lifx binding does a stateupdate with a decimaltype parameter instead of a percenttype    
 ahus1 i followed the guide here  https   asciidoctor org docs user manual #taming svgs
i haven't tried any other versions nor operating systems  i'll try the previous versions of the sdk  though i'm unable to test on windows or linux  if someone is able to try either os  i'll push this code to  my fork of the repo  https   github com kkirigaya java discordrpc  for someone to test on

sorry    i've not been that much clear in my first post     i'm using swagger editor  export to json format my api spec  the json generated with swagger editor is      without quotes for the version number  is expected

ah  of course  should have included that  here's the  build gradle  i used

i'm using a nexus 4 running android 4 4 4  i haven't tested it with the sample apps yet  will try that and let you know if it happens there too  thanks for the quick responses 
when you did the test  your global thru account host had the direct  access to the destination host  so you cannot tell if you get there via  global thru or not  you should try to connect to the host  that cannot  be accessed via global thru account   best regards  frolov g v   on 10 16 2012 03 38 pm  andrey hitrin wrote 
yes  it is working now

the actual output looks like this     i am not sure why there has to be the exception stack trace at all  for this specific case  
there's only shown "event cache"  not earth cache as i wrote at the beginning  in the filter panel above the list    the switch button solved my problem  now i can see all caches again   so i think the "recycle bin" icon is not supposed to clear the filter if it was set on the main screen 
i've tried this after updating project configuration as 'simple java' the problem still actual

hi benny   yes  no problem   this is my simplejavamail properties file   simplejavamail smtp host smtp production host simplejavamail smtp port 587 simplejavamail transportstrategy smtps simplejavamail smtp username username simplejavamail smtp password 1111 simplejavamail defaults from address from default com  mailto simplejavamail defaults from address from default com   and this is the constructor of my emailservice   public emailservice         	file propsfile   new file properties_filename       	if  propsfile exists          		logger info "overwritting simplejavamail properties from external file '  '" properties_filename       		propmap   configloader loadproperties propsfile  true       		logger trace "java mail properties read   "  propmap       	  else       		propmap   configloader loadproperties configloader default_config_filename  true       	      	mailer   mailerbuilder buildmailer    	   and i get the exception when building the mailer instance  by taking a look into your code  the property simplejavamail smtp password is expected to be a string but it gets converted to an integer object on the configloader class   static object parsepropertyvalue final string propertyvalue    if  propertyvalue    null    			return null  		  		   read boolean value 		final map string  boolean  booleanconversionmap   new hashmap      		booleanconversionmap put "0"  false   		booleanconversionmap put "1"  true   		booleanconversionmap put "false"  false   		booleanconversionmap put "true"  true   		booleanconversionmap put "no"  false   		booleanconversionmap put "yes"  true   		if  booleanconversionmap containskey propertyvalue     			return booleanconversionmap get propertyvalue tolowercase     		  		   read number value  		try   			return integer valueof propertyvalue   		  catch  final numberformatexception nfe    			   ok  so not a number 		  		   read transportstrategy value 		try   			return transportstrategy valueof propertyvalue   		  catch  final illegalargumentexception nfe    			   ok  so not a transportstrategy either 		  		   return value as is  which should be string  		return propertyvalue  	   maybe you should try to convert to integer only the properties that need to be integer such as port…  i hope that it helps   best regards 
tried again  now it works     hmm
it worked in older builds  1 7 10 70 and older   but it hasn't worked in any of the 'lc2' builds to my knowledge 
i will try to reproduce this on similar environment  if there is any progress  i will update it here 
1  start a session with recording on  2  close the session  recording quits after 2 minute or whatever is the set time period  3  start  the session again  just after quit recording is send and  before recording docker container is killed  error occurs because docker container for recording is already up which is about to die   
was posted in the irc channel by sammyshp  so i don't have any further details

sorry about the mixup  i've made corrections to the title  and the version of the app is the newest release v2 0 12 beta1  free    i would have provided the crash log  but unfortunately  i don't have my adb device present with me currently  let me know if you need anything else  please  thanks
i do  but it's completely empty  no text whatsoever 
 leonard84 thanks for the explanation  that's what i thought as well  and i strongly agree with this should be mentioned somewhere in the documentation  also the exception here should be clearer in reflecting what the real problem is  right now saying  is very misleading
 s9mmober do you have an example handy where this happened 
it was mostly simple terms aggs but also one global agg with a filter  iirc the query itself was that same filter being applied to the global agg

i tested without ds and sf  and still happened  i'll do some more tests to see what mod is breaking things  the odd thing is that it worked correctly in a similar setup  that had ds and sf   so i'll run a diff between the modlists and see what's different 
it was full screen  i have viewed the jad indicator working on the same screen setting on a friend's computer  and this was my reason for getting it myself  the plugin is turned on  so i don t know what's up  the only difference between me and my friend's situation is he has windows and i have mac

the native code  which was formerly in com redhat    modules is now part of ceylon test  and test test js tools call runtesttool function directly 
it keeps getting flipped back and forth between the old and new model  i don't know how to work git too well so here's a fix
ok  that's what i want to suggest 
sorry to bother you but after a few more tests that came to me over coffee i found out it was an id missmatch between the server and client i replaced both the server galacticcraft and te files with the client ones and it fixed the problem  sorry for bothering you 
hi marcel   thanks for your prompt response   thought i attached logcat to github but it’s attached again to this email   clearing xprivacy data has restored wi fi connectivity  never thought to do that as previous upgrades didn’t require it  now have to re enter permissions authority on each of 214 apps but well worth the time and effort   do i need to run xprivacy free and xprivacy enabler concurrently or should i just run free or enabler with the pro license   thanks again for your assistance   coop  from  marcel bokhorst  mailto notifications github com   sent  wednesday  december 04

using latest windows 10  eclipse running on java 1 8 0_181  i've re enabled "egradle project decorator" an i do not get this error anymore in startup log  but i removed some plugins since my initial post  so it could be that    i'd say that if you cannot think of an obvious cause for the stack trace i posted  don't spend too much time on it 
i am using the shardingsphere4 0 0 rc1  os ubuntu 18 04 
there are two places where info is recorded  there are the  sets of iris  one for classes  one for restrictions  one for each kind of property  etc    these are only kept for the duration of the parsing  then there is a multimap  which records guessed at types  removing them if an explicit type is seen  this is stored in the format that is kept in the ontology manager   the hack of  pretending that the cons cell is really a class or a datatype does not need the multimap   this class and the triple handlers should be refactored  i believe it will have precisely two    
it happens on occ on my 1 15 1 client  maybe text components are handled differently

it's not about formatting bit about highlighting  i added a bit text description into pr description   it works incorrectly also on github and atom in some cases when referencecontent is a first field   but for che this problem is even more "critical" since dashboard  or maybe che server  sorts fields in way that highlighting is kind of always is broken    sorry  i really don't know  it's a editor that is used in master branch by dashboard   tsmaeder could you share more about new based on monaco editor  is there somewhere pr in dashboard that changes editor

in spring data we support annotations and meta annotations that are annotated with jsr305 annotations to discover whether a package  class or method has opted in for non nullability  we do not express a limit on meta annotation nesting  so one can use either directly jsr305 annotations  spring framework annotations  that are annotated with jsr305  or further  composed annotations    that's  why we are using  annotatedelementutils     nonnull 's  when  attribute expresses non nullability or allows opting out to express that a particular argument or return value may be null 
hi  pascalav  thanks for looking into this  and for your detailed analysis   first  i don't think we want to change any of the logic around when  isvalid  is called  primarily because the existing  of  and  with  methods have a specific contract  which always returns a valid  interledgeraddress     here's a summary of the current naming conventions       interface of    methods are like a constructor  whereby you supply all of the required fields to construct an object  and you get a fully constructed  valid  immutable object back  typically a static method on the interface      interface from    methods are like a factory method  whereby you supply some "raw materials" that can be used to derive everything necessary to call   of     typically a static method on the interface      interface with    methods are called on an already constructed object  append some information or data  and return a a fully constructed  valid  immutable object  typically a non static or default method on the interface or abstract implementation of an interface   note that most interfaces in quilt do not have a "with" method  because most objects are not appendable in the way  interledgeraddress  is     interface builder    methods return an instance of an immutables project generated builder that can be used to mutate data before actual construction  for example   interledgeraddressbuilder       builder from     this has a specific meaning in immutables project generated builders  see  here  http   immutables github io immutable html#builder     with that in mind   interledgeraddress#of  is  meant to function more like a constructor  and _not_ like a builder  in other words  when you call "of"  you will receive a complete  fully valid  interledgeraddress   likewise  the contract for  interledgeraddress#with  will always start with a valid  interledgeraddress  and result in a new ilp address with an additional suffix   thus  in order to accomplish something closer to the builder pattern that you identified above  where callers can append portions of an ilp address before actual construction  we have several options   1  do nothing  force callers to construct their ilp address as a string before calling  interledgeraddress#of     1  extend the builder generated by immutables to support this functionality  and then just have developers call  interledgeraddress#builder   and use that thing with the new "just append a part of your ilp address" extension method  unfortunately  i don't think  immutables  immutables github io  supports this in the builder out of the box  but it might worth investigating  if you can't easily customize the generated builders  perhaps it would be worth logging an enhancement in the immutables project   1  define our own custom builder that extends the immutables generated builder  and is then returned from the static method  interledgeraddress#builder    overall  i haven't run into a case where i've wanted to gradually assemble an ilp address using the  interledgeraddress  or  interledgeraddressbuilder  classes  instead  a much more common use case i've encountered is where i have an ilp prefix string  already assembled  that might look like   g us foo    and i need to append an account to it  e g   "myaccount"   so i will often only be doing this     with all that said  i vote for option 1 above  since i've never encountered a use case for option 2 or 3 and it's not clear if option 2 is even possible   thoughts 
i agree that would be best to match transit  transit has an index with the time departure and after that says the line and more things in the map view  but in the itineraries fragment it just says "1  takes 5 min"   so  we can add the index and always say "1  3400m   5 min" instead of  "1  ride 751m takes 2 min"  in the map view  to have information about the distance  i think that is good to avoid the use of ride or walk here to have the same output for all the bike routes even if they start with a little leg of walking  also matches better the idea of the transit part  in the itineraries fragment we can just say "1  takes 4 min" if it is ok  as it is in transit  being this way more verbose in this part than in the map view   i have tested netherlands server and it happens the same failure with  itinerary  fields  so i will report the bug   2014 01 29 sean barbeau notifications github com

unfortunately the smartphone is not mine and i can't install the newly updated version on it again  it's android 4 4 2  galaxy s iii   what i can see is that the smartphone doesn't riconnect to the band when it's in proximity with it  and in notification centre the band is displayed as always connected  despite it's actually not  
this is for loading just 10 per page   i don't have the specs for our application server but i don't suspect you need much for a simple query like this  perhaps it's a database issue  i'll follow up once i know more

oh nice  didn't see the listener laglistener   i like to use udp so i'm sticking to jgn for the time being  as it _promises_ reliable in order delivery of udp messages  there are no other _simple_ java network frameworks i know about which do that   however after running a few tests with the emulator i'm not so confident about that any more  seems like i will have to write my own udp reliability control   on topic  as you said  they are very similar    the laglistener sits on the endpoint so you do not have to reroute all communication through the emulator address    i'm unsure if kryonet updates it's connection logic before notifying the listeners  if that's the case then the lag introduced by the emulator would also affect kryonet's inner workings in addtion to the application that listens for messages   if kryonets inner workings are also implemented as listeners  then i see really no benefit by having the emulator  you could simulate packet loss also in the laglistener if you wanted   on the other hand if you think this would be a nice utility to have  i'm all for the inclusion into kryonet  i just change the license to the new bsd license and you copy paste the class into your project or how does that work

we've not encountered it when using waterfall  it happens on the first attempt to connect to a server the next one usually succeeds 
replicated  here is the log  https   pastebin com fnu04ldr  log starts after i did  ess debug 
https   pastebin com uezwctqh changed domain to my domain com  interestingly  it only shows things for port 443  and yet  my access log shows   and the reverse proxy didn't work until i added port 80 to the virtual host 
actually  the cleanup method is called twice from different threads when running in local mode  one does not have the output stream initialized  cf  log output with the null check applied 
i decided to do a bit more testing with a more minimal setup to try and see if it was a cross mod interaction   i created a new instance which only had  commoncapabilities 1 12 2 2 4 5 cyclopscore 1 12 2 1 6 0 integrateddynamics 1 12 2 1 1 1 integratedtunnels 1 12 2 1 6 10  i then repeated the above setup but instead of the charged light collector i used a flowerpot with a poppy inside  this resulted in the flower pot being duplicated  so it appears to be entirely this mod causing the bug   i was also able to use a more complex setup to duplicate lapis   on a separate network  1  add an inventory reader to the chest from the above setup  chest 1   and store the variable inventory count  2  have another variable set to an integer with the value 90  3  construct a variable using the "  " operator with the above 2 variables 4  attach a variable store to store the first 2 variables  5  attach an item interface to the chest  chest 1   6  place another chest  chest 2  with an item exporter on it  7  set this item exporter to export 1 item and have it use the variable from the comparison set up before  8  place 63 lapis in the first slot of chest 1  then place a single item  not lapis  in every other slot  9  place a lapis ore block in front of the world block importer   the world block importer then places a lapis in chest 1  which triggers the second network to export 1 lapis to chest 2  and then the cycle repeats  with more and more lapis being produced   the same also works with redstone ore   while i haven't tested every possibility  i believe this results from any block which drops more than 1 item when it breaks  and is easiest to do with blocks which drop 2 different items as then the first slot can be entirely empty 
i think this is not an error  the app works but it doesn't looks good  yes it happens always 
ok  you're right about the fact that the library is part of the app  that went through my mind and i didn't understand why the strict mode policy was thrown    i tested the sample app with the same emulator and i don't get the exception  so it must be something i'm doing wrong in my code  note that i'm extending  com nononsenseapps filepicker filepickeractivity  and  com nononsenseapps filepicker filepickerfragment  to provide file folder thumbnails  maybe it has to do with that  i'm gonna have to investigate and try some things   sorry for the false flag

yes i'm pretty sure   i've also reproduced the issue locally  my test case consists of 3 threads   thread #1   connects 1000 users to a channel " users user " + id  simulate load  thread #2   connects a single user and disconnects him every 100ms  simulate locking when adding removing resource  thread #3   sends a group message to group " users " every 1 second  testing this with 1 0 6   reaches 4000 threads testing this with 1 0 13   after 10 minutes run  already around 9000 threads and keeps climbing   the only change i did when i upgraded to the new version   changed the messages offer to dispatchmessages
now every flow starts and looks as new integration   probably intended change  if so  we can close this one 
it does happen constantly  it didn't at first  and then started to appear  i don't know why     but thought it might be worst reporting in case it had anything to do with qupath  i might just try to re install qupath and see if it comes back 
you used the same code  i tried this on 1 12 2 aswell now and get the same error
it's right there first line  it's  something like '  case  ' or '  case id  ' i realize now that case is a liquid thing not necessarily a java or clojure keyword  i think the parser does not like ppl using those words

it's mac os x v10 11 6  according to the cppbuild sh of tensorflow  i think only gpu version is supported  is it right  my computer doesn't have any gpu  so i build tensorflow cpu version  i wonder it is the reason or not  and should i install tensorflow through cppbuild sh

i think  that is the best solution  another one is not to execute xsd2java or wsdl2java by default  and execute it only when it called explicitly   for example 
here's the log   lsp log  https   github com microsoft vscode java debug files 3966544 lsp log   i also fixed the url to link to the project workspace if you want to try it yourself 
more importantly  error is about "table does not exist" vs "schema does not exist"  i've updated description 
i guess so  yes  while then we should probably still add the null check since that is still the better way of handling it instead of an npe crash 
it shows that exact message in the android gui near the repo path — "interrupted system call"  nothing more  unfortunately  i didn't open the web ui  there could be more details  will do that when it occurs again 
it should    closing this one  will reopen it in lightblue rest 
my mistake  i've corrected the bug report 
 sberyozkin prometheus is supplying jwt token when scraping  metrics page  i would like authorization header to be ignored as there is no security on  metrics or  health endpoints by default 
i have no clue    i played with constraints then i got this  i cannot seem to be able to reproduce it

hey  nezihyigitbasi   sure we can test to see if the new version has fixed the issue  for time being  we will increase the timeout for hive metas tore rpcs to mitigate the issue

 jgcmarins no it’s not crashing  just the image is not being shared in whatsapp  check the description i wrote in op 
thanks for the quick reply  yes  the file is actually there  is there a workaround to create an  ipa file  i've tried "  gradlew createipa"  which is working well  except that it uses the development code signing identity instead of the distribution code signing identity  is there a way to change this 
sorry for the late response though we were busy releasing new versions of our software and fixing the mess after updating plenty of external dependencies    we updated the client configuration of the pub sub command handler to throw away any incoming  or left over  commands while redis is currently down as the commands aren't the most important stuff in the application anyway  we've therefore added the following lines to the configuration     though we have to test it again and see if it fixes the issue  i hope i'll find time tomorrow   regarding your question of the object root for the majority of  keyargument  instances  we can send you the complete heap dump if you like  in that case we'd prefer some secure channel to exchange the file as the heapdump contains some sensitive data even though it contains only development related credentials 
the error continues after running the following fsck command  tsdb fsck   fix '1d ago' avg os disk fs space_free   zkquorum ny devtsdb01   the output of that command  and full error are provided below   "what tool did you use to get that data " q d script i wrote  https   groups google com forum # topic opentsdb pegdapyjbpe

no  as you can see the service instance is created on the first line without any problem
the bi directional edge based algorithms would not work properly with the behavior in querygraph due to different edge ids for same edges when using different edge filters  node based algorithms do not have a problem with this behavior since they use ids of nodes to store costs which are still the same  edge based algorithms would use the edge id to store costs and therefore the ids should be the same as long as it is functionally the same edge  in my pull request #158 there are tests for bi directional dijkstra and a   which do not pass due to this behavior  i turned off the tests temporary  e g  see  dijkstrabidirectionreftest#testviaedges_fromequalsto     
the uninstall or reset all app data via appmanager in the android settings  or wait three days   the important thing is that between the first and the second part of the sequence you don't use the same caches  or clean the cache cache   or simply only fo the second part of the sequence after a reinstall 
if you kindly instruct me towards its folder i will try harder 
with a pick   i tried the simple test again with an open hand  just resetting the slice'n'splice  so the power monitor had a full buffer  and got this    monitor 2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10668463 5884668 523afe3a a315 11e4 83c1 9a3ff16c7fca png   when i right click the power monitor on my full system with an empty hand i still see the 20rf tick difference 
thanks for getting back so quickly  just tried it in  2 0 0 m8    i think mapping to  singlerootfilesource  will work in the scenario where the subdirectory is directly under  src test resources   as is the case with  root  in the  autoconfigurewiremockfilesapplicationwithurlresourcetests     however  when pulling in stubs that come from a  jar  dependency  the resolution from  urlresource  to  file  is causing this exception     which appears to be happening because of the  jar   protocol in the url   https   github com spring projects spring framework blob b2f900e518eeb5aabf57a6deb8f267256af7b22b spring core src main java org springframework util resourceutils java#l216 l220  should the mapping actually be to  classpathfilesource   it looks like that class is doing the proper parsing of the url and extracting the  jar  portion   https   github com tomakehurst wiremock blob d36516bb76b3b7b8fb84fe2254fc2597b3fce11c src main java com github tomakehurst wiremock common classpathfilesource java#l68 l72  i put together an example demonstrating the external  jar  behavior   https   github com reillylm scc591 consumer https   github com reillylm scc591 dependent api stubs   scc591 dependent api stubs  contains the wiremock stubs and  scc591 consumer  contains the test with   autoconfigurewiremock   you'll have to run  publishtomavenlocal  on  scc591 dependent api stubs  first to make the jar available for the consumer project 
try this  1  unzip titan 0 5 0's zipfile 2  cd into the titan 0 5 0 hadoop1 or  hadoop2 directory  according to whichever version you downloaded and unzipped  3  run  bin gremlin sh  4  type at the gremlin prompt as follows  assuming the path separator char on your platform is          the  titan berkeleydb properties  file that ships with titan is not useful for gotg because it only configures a storage backend without an index   note that i used  titan berkeleydb es properties  above  which does configure an index 
yes this works  thank you 
firstly i tried to update it  but as described at commons  it didnt worked well  so i have realised  it will be faster to delete former version and replace it by a new version  so i download it  i am using windows vista 
 stephanrauh actually  omnifaces is not part of my web inf lib folder  i was just investigating omnifaces's solution as you advised me in a previous post   before moving to bootsfaces i was using primefaces and never got such warning  do you think it is maybe be due to the blend of bootsfaces and primefaces 
 defl could you please provide a code snippet on how to reproduce this as i still cant reproduce this issue   #63 added a test to ensure that it is not null  which passes without errors 
link to orespawn  http   www orespawn com   that's the mod that adds the entity that i want to add  i've found a mod that has this function  but this mod adds a lot more and i want to use this one  i'm not sure if commands clash  but i'll try it   four other things  firstly  as i have previously said  i'm using this in place of spc  it adds a noclip command which lets a flying  opped player go through walls and blocks  i'd love to see that in this mod  secondly  there should be something in place that retrieves the unlocalised names of entities  just so that people don't have to post links to mods so that you can add them in   thirdly  the input failures are happening with this other mod that i'm testing  see above if you skipped past that   finally  if you lost the repo  then why don't you decompile the 1 6 4 version of the mod  and then work things out from there  i know that it's hard  but there are a variety of tools that are out there to help you  just search for some java decompilers and you'll come across something that works        edit    this mod  sadly  does not work with the other  replacement mod that i'm using  it's called server commands   i've been getting internal exceptions with commands  even with vanilla commands like  help    github link  https   github com chbachman servercommands  thanks

i haven't looked through the enunciate code  but i would think the parameter type  inputstream  would be the most relevant thing to look at   can you read the method signatures or just the annotations

yes  that's what it should do    problem is that it doesn't go to half  it goes to a bit more than half  i thought the screenshots explanatory text would explain it   my screen is a 4 3 screen  1280 1024 pixels  it should try to fit it to half the screen  then notice the client doesn't fit  and make it as big as it has to be   but  it makes the client slightly bigger  see  black bars  these can be removed if i manually resize the client   if it's not clear  i can make a video on it   ps  sorry for not replying  deathbeam  i must've forgotten  if i use other programs  they take half the width  but they don't have a minimum width  if you know of a program that also has a minimum width  i can test it

hi  thanks for the reply  i briefly looked into parent triples map already  but i had the feeling it should be used in cases when you have multiple source files  or tables in the case of a relational db   in my case  i'm only considering a single tsv file  but i've just tested this approach and it works for my case  albeit a bit verbose      p s  i've found that the examples of parent triples map in http   rml io spec html#integrated mapping contain some syntactical errors  there's twice a set of square brackets too much around the  rr joincondition

not sure just yet  needs to be looked into   installing them all may lead to issues  not sure  don't think so since they're classpath loaded in on launch   i think the best option would be to check the libraries when play is clicked and create new fields in the instance json for the os and version it was installed on so that if they change  the libraries are reloaded in  sounds like the best solution  but may be other ones 
and it's needed for a project that uses jsps  which many do  the server runtime supplies this jar on the classpath automatically  but you can't compile jsps or run them locally without it

https   img okezone com  content 2015 03 13 20 1117973 dirjen pajak blunder soal pajak jalan tol hhkw9dov48 jpg  the image has appeared in my recyclerview but the streaming progressive jpeg didn't work  it should have seen the quality of the image start out low and gradually become clearer 
i think there is no other way  but i might be wrong anyway  it would be better if   arg 0   will return alias

 jelovirt well  it seems the client package is built without xep support anyway   there's something wrong here in both cases  either the doc should mention you can't use xep with the default client distribution  and redirect to how to build the dita ot from source for xep  which actually does not exist  or ship a pre bundled fo jar with xep classes within the client distribution   in any case  let me know if i can write something up about that

i have tried using only what mytown provides and then also attempted the forgeessentials mod   it worked with allowing mytown commands to be ran but also allowed students to break blocks inside of protected areas and gave op commands as well   it could be my lack of knowledge with fe and how it works exactly but it felt like it would require running through 1000+ commands one by one in order to get fe to work properly with the edu setup and combing through every command to learn exactly what it does   i tried their denydefault but kept getting syntax errors  again  limited updates due to forge 1291    i tried mytown cmd outsider    and mytown cmd everyone    by itself with default fe permissions and with mixes of many attempts of other setups   all led to dead ends and frustration w o permissions working the way i thought they should or wanted   there could also be something behind the scenes with the edu version with permissions but documentation on it is pretty much non existent   i have started combing through the code for their wrapper and launcher but have limited time lately as life is a bit busy   i'll keep chuggin along to see what happens   any advice or thought is appreciated   thanks

 samtstern i call it first thing in oncreate  in my application class   also  before i try to use any firebaseanalytics call  i check that the firebaseapp  the " default " one  exists  but even if i tried to initialize it in some other place  for example when i get a response from my server   even by losing some events  should it be a problem 
done  still same behaviour    splashscreen   blank window eclipse sdk   log file indicates same error
it happens a bit random  probably by connecting ihl cable directly to ic2 cables

yeah i saw the orm and it would be great to use it  but the app's so not ready for it  there's so much spaghetti and view stuff talking direct to the database almost  it needs pulling apart  that's what i was trying to do with the forum package but there's so much hardwired into using int ids and building making database queries and network requests  it's a ton of work and it's basically a rewrite of a lot of the app  the appended id is a good idea    since it is sort of another 'thread'  and it'll never show up anywhere else  and get purged after a week anyway   only trouble is the thread id is an integer in the database  and  of course  everything's pulling rows out of the database and expecting ints from that column  i'm not sure if we can quickly hack this  i'll have a look at it though  i'll push the tweaks i made to the parsing code  hopefully it's a bit easier to follow and it should fix some of the gotchas with reply calculations  there's other fun stuff that needs fixing though  like ignored posts aren't added to the post database at all if 'always ignore' is set in the options 
etc etc etc
yeah  latter i've noticed that the class being in the wrong place doesn't break the build  but the class can be found at  https   github com internetarchive heritrix3 blob fbb0173459b698b1bb9fcedf4ea3c4ac7b5f0cf6 contrib src main java org archive util onelinesimplelayout java

nope  sorry   i have only just started to look at spring boot gradle   i did try boot 1 2 0 m2 and have seen the same problem   right now i have to figure out the correct way to change dependencies in gradle so that my project doesn't loose all of its natures and source jar links   "cleaneclipseclasspath ecliplseclasspath" is not doing it for me   but that is off topic for this issue 
mh ok seems to be a connection error  i'll try to fix it and get back to you 
i'll have to give it a test in a clean environment later tonight  my production environment is quite heavy 
i _believe_ i only had one driver running  that's why there's only one command line with   driver embedded in the report  that causes that particular instance of the tool to start up a driver as well  the default is to not start a driver

hmm  that's really weird  i'm level 23     yes i am using the latest alpha release  according to pogo i can't upgrade my dragonite further  which is extremely weird  perhaps it's just a fringe case with me  hopefully others can chime in  as i don't have enough stardust to get another max cp cur   
unfortuately it is quite rare  even though we run a lot of jobs everyday  no discernable pattern to reproduce it  and we have seen it occur in two different jobs   we use the repo plugin to checkout source code from multiple git repositories  and the npe occurs right after checkout is completed  but only occasionally  not always   so it is not readliy reproducable  is there some logs   info i should look out for when it occur the next time   maybe some extra checks is needed around the offending line " jenkins plugins slack activenotifier getchanges activenotifier java 115 "   since the repo plugin is used right before the npe  the list of changes in this particular case has something a bit strange   " revision  author  unknown    on committer     on  this project was added to the manifest  "  this might be causing the problem

of course these indexes can be created manually  but having  index and supporting it for raw types and not for collections is not really fair  as the secondary index performance issue is there for both collection and raw types  i can do it manually  but i was relying on achilles generated ddl for validating my schema integrity  and in case there is a need for explicitly making the developer choose  there could be a configuration parameter where indexes for collections can be enabled  disabled by default  along side indexes for raw types

i don't quite understand the parsing code and it seems to fail not even in the docker code  so i guess the first question would be if the reply from the daemon is ok or not and why the parser does not like that  in a json validator i did not get an error  i assume one should be able to reproduce this by changing https   github com docker java docker java blob master src test resources samples 1 22 info 1 json  looks like one might be able to just add the "some host name" part from above

i guess that you create new images at some point  just create them as static fieleds once   instead of calling return fmuiplugin getimage imgpath   every time just cache them   see configurationmaplabelprovider getcolumnimage  the images might actually already exist somewhere   we could also just rewrite the method fmuiplugin getimage to cache the images in a map

i set the layout width and height to match parent and scale type is center  but the photo take from the phone camera is very small actually  it is a big one 
you need change the phone language  and after that  you need reinstall or refresh the metadata  i tested it  with development branch  in real device and in the emulator  and i have this bug always  i tested it against hnqis and hnqis dev ci with my user

seems the parameter is on place  why the error appears only on 2ns run of the crawler  when   workdir  already exists

when i added a deadline or timeout to the request  it terminated after the expected duration with a timeout  however  no request was ever initiated over the wire   i looked over the places where the  catch  throwable t      log    pattern is used with executors  in every case i saw  it looked like the log was a last ditch effort to alert the user that something that should _never_ happen had happened  since these cases represent legitimately irrecoverable errors  perhaps _catastrophic failure_ is appropriate  grpc can't fix the problem  and likely the user's code can't either without recompilation 
i don't think ycm causes this  because i looked into the ycm log which i had attached above   and here is the formatted received message from jdt ls by ycmd                 "jsonrpc"  "2 0"          "method"  "textdocument publishdiagnostics"          "params"                "diagnostics"                                          "code"  "570425421"                      "message"  "the value of the field homecontroller datastoreservice is not used"                      "range"                            "end"                                "character"  51                              "line"  23                                                    "start"                                "character"  35                              "line"  23                                                                      "severity"  2                      "source"  "java"                                                          "code"  "570425394"                      "message"  "logger cannot be resolved"                      "range"                            "end"                                "character"  14                              "line"  37                                                    "start"                                "character"  8                              "line"  37                                                                      "severity"  1                      "source"  "java"                                              "uri"  "file    works testunusedimports src main java com halodu homecontroller java"

ok i just moved the issue from seahub to seadroid  looks like it has been fixed in the current gplay version 
 problem languages zip  https   github com draquet polyglot files 719010 problem languages zip  here  you go  both these languages have been having the problem for me  let me know if you need anything else  thanks for all your work on this program  it's so helpful and greatly appreciated 
i still have to generate the bug report for cytoscape tracker     for future reference this occurs if you save a session that has filters   when you reopen the session and try to add a new filter cytoscape left hand panel crashes 
there aren't 
after installing both rstudio version 1 2 834 and visual c++ 2017 with  the links you provided  i am still encountering the same bug "the application was unable to start correctly  0xc000007b "  any further information i need to provide for better inspection  
i made the slave account and admin and that helped after a reboot  so it seems to be a permission issue  i will check if giving the necessary permission without making the user an admin is possible and comment the results here  also the functions succeed when run as a normal user locally   shame that the library cannot tell about missing permissions with a checked exception  this also happens with some linux methods where calling getserialnumber methods return empty string when not run with sudo  i don't know if it would be even possible to detect the missing permissions in these cases

hi  hideki    i'm currently on couchdb 1 5 0  couches lite version i think is very close to master   the ton of query to get document changes can happen even when there aren't many or any changes at all from the remote server  it can be the application running over night  and when resuming in the morning  the logs keep coming on changes  i have a few assumptions guesses so far   1  i have seen this logs like this before  not sure how frequent   but after this happens  i do see the flurry of logs after    can something like this happen when you have more than 1 pull replicator on a database or recreating database object when one already exists   cheers kien
captainellit but i put wood
the context  the   u0000  marker is hard coded in generated rules that are automatically added by the parser generator to the rascal grammar to delimit holes  when i get it back as   a00  it no longer parses  so the above behavior may be correct from a unicode perspective but it causes a problem in this context  at least somewhere during the processing an inequality occurs that causes the parse to fail

hello   thank you for your response    "why are you attempting to log within the dofilter method itself "   a couple of reasons   use cases  1  loggingfilter   the sole reason it exists is to log the path  request path   time of request  user who made the request etc 2  somexauthorizationfilter   which does some authorization checks and logs basic information including "user u attempting to perform an action a with and some request parameters"  we are currently using micronaut filters for both these reasons   one of the workarounds we have thought of is to replace filters with interceptors because we found that logging inside filter method is not instrumented for tracing   hope that helps  your inputs on this will be valuable

 tylerjewell   reply to  1  if you mean my distro i mentioned that in my original report  arch linux  2  yes it runs fine the output is    1  the link you provided seems to indicate that i should try   docker run   rm  t  v  var run docker sock  var run docker sock eclipse che start   if so  please read my original report again as i mentioned i tried that and it failed  if you meant something else please be more specific  i'm not trying to be rude  it's just i don't know what you meant for me to do by sharing that link  
this is on linux with openjdk version "1 8 0_91" the launcher is version 3 2 3 1  i had a quick look at the launcher's code  it looks like you have your own code for deleting files  which looks similar to the apache commons file utils   would it be an option to use the original file utils for doing the job  if yes then i can do a quick test if this would fix the problem 
for example when i want to run the analysis for multiple profiles  which means multiple projects in sonar  
i am currently running in eclipse  but i believe this issue would happen in any osgi container   if i do something as simple as    this is because flyway is expecting "org flywaydb core internal version txt" to exist within the custom classloader   if i instead have flyway use its own classloader  then of course flyway can find "org flywaydb core internal version txt" within the flyway jar  but it will never find my sql scripts in a different bundle 
yes  the berkley database  when the web application crashes for any reason if you try to deploy another war  for example with a fix   you need to restart the web application server  in my case  as the database stays locked  maybe using the servletcontextlistener  when the application or servlet gets destroyed  undeployed      the database can be unlocked before that   is a very small improvement in the code but should be a few lines of code  will some research on this and post the results
i agree  
i have tried testing the issue again but i can't seem to reproduce the issue   the steps i took were  1  launch app 2  select any novel chapter 3  move the page a bit 4  open running app page  my zenfone has a dedicated button to it  5  close baka tsuki  6  launch app 7  open to previous chapter with "resume novel" or manually  at the time this issue was happening every time but now it doesn't  i am still using the same android and app version  let me know if you need more details 
two actually  the second apparently being the official  and rootless  fix     swap the   family lang "zh hans"   lines with the   family lang "ja"   ones   add "日本語  日本）" in  settings → language   input → languages   if you have any chinese ones  drag it above them   second one assumes an unedited  fonts xml   ofc 
as it turns out  this issue has been fixed since 9 0 1  i sent you a pr for the passing test  just so you can add to your test suite to prevent regression   https   github com jmrozanec cron utils pull 407
forge  14 21 1 2443
i've added hyperlinks to the resources  you can run into this issue when creating updating apps through the rest api  importer or data explorer 
trying now
sorry  i actually removed pushy completely from my project as version 0 4 in a tomcat environment was not sending all push notifications and was not logging any error while with version 0 4 3 i cannot start tomcat at all  i no longer have any webapp set up to make the test

oh indeed   i wondered why i had been finding it more annoying than usual  but it's just because i've been working more in   rmd 
this is one 
yea just checked it seems to be happening on all three whats causing this 
i used water buckets in this example but same goes with other liquids  the locking track is in boarding mode  i have tried putting water directly into cart  into loader and into tank feeding the loader     2014 12 22_13 30 26  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 20052 5525533 493a5fa0 89df 11e4 9497 90d4622d696b png   in all cases when cart was partially filled and there was no water anywhere else the cart was not sent off and it would be stopped after i have sent it off with the button   the cart get set off the moment it gets fully loaded with any of this 3 methods and it won't be hold after it goes around  whatever i try the behaviour is identical to "force full"   i use version 9 4 0 0 and i have some other mods present like growcraft  botania  opencomputers etc    i don't have ic2 mod though 
using version 2 5 3  just updated from the previous version  and i do not have "fetch detailed notification for apps" checked  it seems to be a new feature in this update 
i can't access into che master http 503   the state of che pod is  readiness probe failed  http probe failed with statuscode  500

i would prefer some kind of a border for selected item or different background of the item  but this also works 
it was a few days ago and happened several times during this day  i would have to re check if the problem still exists

i don't really follow the math within the carbon reduction handler  so i'm not sure if the errors derive just from the gameconst stuff or the internal math of the handler    if it's possible to get it to output reasonable values for testing that would be awesome

i'd already updated to feed the beast 8 1 1  and with it  updated tt to #963  so i'll watch for any new errors 
i followed pimotte's suggestion and tried to debug the issue  but once i built everything from master branch the issue was gone  eventually i traced it to some jars in c  program files  x86  syncany lib left from the previous syncany's installation  clean install solved the problem completely

i used 8 tbu fuel to show this bug  i split them  first 4 i put inside just vanish  no depleted fuel and no energy  then i used the other 4 and they process just fine  now i can pipe tbu into the reactor but if i try a different kind of fuel it will disappear unless i put one manually and let it disappear before piping in the rest  best way to describe it is that the first fuel i put into the reactor sets the type and then i can pipe that type into the reactor  i play on modern skyblock 3 latest version   3 4 2 nc version is 2 11a   1  https   user images githubusercontent com 3329748 45632911 281b9080 baa7 11e8 978d 00478461798d png    2  https   user images githubusercontent com 3329748 45632912 28b42700 baa7 11e8 90a6 365de472bfbd png    3  https   user images githubusercontent com 3329748 45632913 28b42700 baa7 11e8 9c82 db30d8028764 png

all three issues are actually quite tricky  i'd consider them as low priority for now  and move on to other things 
i believe so  xbrowniecodez that's the only one that logged that i noticed anyways  however if you manage to fix it for that check  look and see what others will also cause that issue
they return false for  listwithnulls occursat  1  null    and in fact  now looking at  firstoccurrence   which doesn't optimize away invalid indexes  but should i think   it looks like you'll get   1  for  listwithnulls firstoccurrence null   1  maxinteger   since it is defined in terms of  occursat 
i already knew that  doesn't item getitemfromblock block  do the same thing   anyways  changing it from that to  new itemstack block   getitem    since you need the item and not the itemstack  right   doesn't seem to help     is there any reason why calling ignorenbttags would cause it to work with the getnbt method  but not with using the + to craft   i've tried debugging by creating an identical itemstack to the one i'm having trouble with  and then calling getnbt on it  and it seems to be ignoring the correct nbt tags  while the in game + feature seems to be having trouble   actually  now that i've checked  it doesn't seem to be working for items  either   i've been looking through your code  is isidentical in stackhelper supposed to use itemstack areitemstacktagsequal   shouldn't it be filtered through getnbt

i tried to debug this "caused by  java lang illegalstateexception  current vaadinsession is not open" exception  it seems to be somehow linked to spring session fixation and might be a corner case timing problem  we will get this exception if there is vaadinsession that is still alive and being killed by spring session fixation and at the same time we are logging in and new vaadinsession is being created  spring will throw this exception  since the the session being killed is closed and now uiscoped bean can be instantiated to that context  the application works since soon after this new vaadinsession is alive and uiscoped bean is instantiated with it

sure  1  at 30 hz  things run okay but once in a while you'll notice erroneous values come through  for example a variable that has the same value written to it all the time  zero   will once in a while have 15  23 or some random number written to it  at 50   80 hz it becomes more common  the value set to zero will spike in value every 5 seconds or so  and above 80 hz  the connection will break and data will cease to be sent to the phone  2  the gibberish in the serial monitor only happens when the connection never initialized  or after it breaks  so at 1   80 hz  the serial monitor is accurate  but there will be random inaccuracies in the data transmitted  3  altsoftserial is the current choice as it uses the high resolution 16 bit timer  there's another one out there  but it isn't packaged as a library  but as a sketch and it uses an 8 bit timer  it will have the same issues altsoftserial will have with no clear advantages       https   s3 amazonaws com pushbullet uploads ujze3q5ouqw zqgrlpgh9emvqkjaiwsmgbgrkpw7fvct screenshot_2014 10 12 15 11 53 png     75 hz  the gold spike to the left is at the value that 0 is supposed to be written to all the time       https   s3 amazonaws com pushbullet uploads ujze3q5ouqw bhksvdwzkeirbbnxk10rb1ujfirbpnes screenshot_2014 10 12 15 11 29 png    50 hz  random spikes

i tried to understand  what the reason could be  usually i work with phpstorm in 4 divided areas and growing numbers of tabs  at the end tons of open tabs  each change of focus from one tab to another  also in the same divide  throw one new line with the same error  regardless if it is a fusion html fluid scss yaml js file   i reduced the numbers of tabs gently and restart phpstorm a view times  because the first error throwing was at the start  at the end i had two not complicated fusion files open  each one in the own window division partition  also there  the focus change throws a new error  also when i restart  reduce to one big window without no partition tabs and a restart did stop the throwing  now i'm on 4 partition back  with 8 files  no error until now  probebly at the beginning there were about 40 tabs   because the settings for tab limit is on 10   at the end of the day the tabs number will be growing back around this number  but until now unfortunately fortunately i can't reproduce the error too  maybe it will come back  maybe it is not one particular file code  maybe the amount of tabs or something else really hard to detect for me you  probably i have to restart phpstorm in virginity without dividing  than grow up the amount of tabs gently like today  if error throws again  i will send you more information  if i can find define recognize

i did not have any other mods installed  however during the time i started using it  there seems to have been a "sneaky" update to spigot to fix a exploid bug  this seems to have altered some things so in the end it appears that it was indeed the server it self even though they kept claiming it was not them  they just did not realise there had been an update that altered permission stuff  it works fine now although i feel that the 1 11 version was a lot more stable and reliable on the printer function  it now produces a lot of ghost placing that when you move away dissappear  however that is something entirely different  sorry to have wasted a little of your time today  i know you are busy and i do hope you will continue making this awesome mod even better

uh  my bad  probably  i updated the script  i indeed omitted the  chmod u+w  part and single quotes around  eof s  and i can't reproduce it anymore  it's probably an id10t issue on my side  sorry for wasting your time 
using  t claim     not manualy creating plots      any command i attempt to use with plots whether im above below or in the middle of it results in  same error    build #122
i thought the purpose of this button was to open the user's preferred file manager  so it would make the whole feature less useful  maybe we could use that as a fallback if the intent fails 
yes  the android mode i'm using is the latest stable release available through the contributions manager 
i will update once i install the latest
i can also reproduce now on my 4 1 2 test device   i am not sure what you mean with "between dialog window itself and border" and how thick this area is  if its small i would give it the same color as the border  afaik white  else as the background  afaik black  
yes to me  these informations could be useful while debugging  the question is not about human or bot but if it is useful to fix an issue or not  i think we need to be consistent  if these are displayed in the json logs  should be display either in the text logs 
sorry  my mac was about to reboot itself so was trying to get the issue done as quickly as possible  so     this is an ionic project  on android  and basically if i load the app for the first time and close it immediately  what i assume is happening is it tries to download as many assets  in this case js files  as it can before i close the app  when i close it quickly  i'm assuming that it's not getting them all  next time i load the app up  i get stack trace errors in chrome   inspect basically about how it could _not_ load angular because it doesn't have those script files  they don't appear in the sources tab either    so my guess is i just haven't given it time to get all the files  when i leave the app open  about 30 seconds to a minute later it hits a breakpoint i set up in the function block where it gets events from the native side  saying it's downloaded all the files  then it works fine on each new reload    does this sound like what you'd expect to happen  i figure if it knows when it has downloaded all the files  it should also know when it hasn't  and it shouldn't look for them in local storage until it knows they exist there   granted  i'm closing the app a lot quicker than a regular user would because i'm just testing out hot code push  which otherwise works great 
i couldn't remove the salvaged generator until i spawned a normal one and replaced the salvaged one with the normal one   also  i am using optifine  so that may be the issue  i suppose

i'm sure that dealing with this one will help by using zap proxy through jenkins plugin  most of companies will use zap proxy through automated tools as jenkins plugin  so this is my selling points          all the developers to home i presented zap proxy and how to use with jenkins told me that they have to obtain a delta between two or three jobs and need to tag false positives    as you know the managers need also the information to see how the issues are dealt with and the only thing we can get when using zap as daemon is the report   i hope you understand the importance of the fix      thc202   the alerts are shown with green flag    thank you all for your help   best regards   abdellah azougarh

2 1 0 – latest version in the develop branch 
 marfgamer i doubt it would be due to my code because sometimes the user is disconnected even before the first packet is sent   anyway  here is the code    and sometimes the code does work without any issues  the client connects and joins the server  but sometimes the client gets disconnected randomly   most of the times it gets disconnected until the last playstatuspacket is sent  but almost every time it gets disconnected even before the server receives any packet from the client    as you can see in the log i shown above  the client is disconnected after the "system out println "client from address " + session getaddress   + " sent packet with id 0x" 						+ integer tohexstring packet getid    touppercase   + " on channel " + channel  " code but before the "system out println "pocket packet id  0x" + integer tohexstring packetid  touppercase    "  that's why it is strange  nothing happens between those two things except logging  and getting the pe packet id   but what's even more stranger is that the code sometimes works  and sometimes it doesn't

it's not always reproduceable  but my impression is it happens more often if the numbers are not changed after they are set from the suggest button

what i ment was adding new conditional flow step inside of one condition in existing conditional flow step  so it would look something like this   webhook    conditional flow 1    log  conditional flow 1  condition1  condition2  condition3  condition1  flow start    conditional flow 2    flow end        conditional flow 2  condition 4  condition 5 condition 6   in current ui implementation you would get lost pretty quickly and navigation between those conditions would be really hard  i agree that some special selection columns for conditions needs to exist and your suggested solution with simple ui changes may solve the issue

we actually encountered this bug in a workshop where people had empty spacer columns  they would all have the same name  the empty string    people have the weirdest csv files so we can't expect every file to be in the perfect format  it's more a question of how to handle this   to solve this    we could ignore the second column and simply not import them  although that seems rude    we could add suffixes to the column names when we encounter them more than once  e g  "2012a"

well i use massivecombat in terms of keepinventory  but it should only apply if you have a pvp flag   the duplication happens when the item is dropped on death  then there is an actual stack  they stack on each other  on the floor  which is then also picked up as stack in addition to the other items that already existed   i already set the oversized stacksize of essentials to one to stop such non stackables vom stacking  but it still happens

i meant that i was only looking at the code for  try   i assumed wrongly that if the methods there contained  class x      parameters then that would cause issues   i didn't actually check  however  all those methods have a   safevarargs  in place already in the 2 1 1 i'm using  so  again  the problem seems contained to  fluentfunctions

i have not examined in detail what is happening when the state machine reaches the terminal state   i will do that   having said that  i don't immediately see why there should be a relationship between the state machine being stopped or started and its current state  i had intuitively viewed the different between start and stopped being whether events were being processed  why link state to start stop  even if a state machine is force stopped because it is in a terminal state  surely i should still be able to ask the state machine what state it is in   my use case is that i am modelling human centric workflows as state machine instances  so you can view a state machine instance as represent a ticket  when a ticket is finally completed  e g  approved or rejected or whatever that causes it to reach a terminal state  i need that to be persisted   i am using the state machine context as a way of view tickets in different states  i e  new  in progress  complete   with the current behaviour  when looking at the state machine context in the persistent store it never reaches the terminal state and you cannot distinguish between state machine that are genuinely in a penultimate state from those that are actually in the terminal state 
i had a problem with an update from 1 1 4 to 1 2 1  so i deleted all versions and installed the new version 1 2 2 which works fine  https   github com cryptomator cryptomator issues 395

i tend to prefer  xcollection    over  collection    whenever i know that the relevant documents can't be in subcollections  so i do not have to bother about whether subcollections are actually present or not  defensive programming against changes in the database layout     it is not relevant for the bug  though  the error is triggered with  collection    as well as with  xcollection    
ok i will do 
sorry for the delay  i can confirm that bat mode now works perfectly with this version
i think updating the user guide to say replace step 1 from https   sourceware org gdb wiki buildingondarwin with 'brew install gdb' and following the rest of the steps  then going into keychain to ensure the self signed cert is always trusted should be a sufficient update  i could try my hand at writing a post explaining it all later on if that would help 
i did  since it is also mentioned in the tooltip  "if true  shows the hunger  and saturation if " + show_saturation_overlay_name + " is true  that would be restored by food you are currently holding"

in the case of searchly  all administrative features of elasticsearch are restricted from the api  according to their documentation  that doesn't leave us with a lot of room  does it  i'm sure that searchly have their reasons to do so  but that is one case out of millions of users  and many of them are not developing in shared environments with special restrictions   i still believe that the right endpoint to call by default should be   _cat health  which could be overridden via configuration properties   instead of having  management health elasticsearch indices   we could have  management health elasticsearch endpoint  _cat health

 yegor256 it seems that using an isolated repository for the integration tests  as far as i understand  this is the case  is the main concept of maven invoker plugin  but i see here an option to set  localrepositorypath  outside of the project build directory  e g     in this case  maven  downloads  actually copies from the local repository  all the artifacts only once and reuse this new isolated repository in future even after  mvn clean

it was recent changes that caused the bug filed here
so that during the compilation of  module info java   the java compiler sees the packages exported by kotlin  otherwise  javac complains on the first  exports  clause  claiming there's no such package    however  in #99 and #101  we've established that we won't be changing the destination dir of  compilejava   or any other task  at all  instead  we'll add the destination dirs to modulepath  for compilation   or produce a special "merged" dir with outputs  for run test

about the lost item  i noticed  hence my question     well   fromcallable is marked beta and wasn't in the core when i wrote that code  20 months ago  i'll check if it works for me as the above example has a very simplified stripped down version of what's going on in the process method   i would suggest to change the doc line on doonsubscribe into _is subscribing_ instead of _is subscribed_ as it might be misleading  it was for me   also  the solution i came up with isn't _that_ weird  is it  there is one general result stream  subscribe to it with a filter for your id  take 1 and the subscription will get unsubscribed after receiving it because of oncompleted  but too bad one can not postpone putting items on the subject until a subscribe happened   thanks for the fast reply

yes  that's the issue i was referring to  sorry for the bad wording     i am using dash content  and i agree that it is usually not a good idea  however  it is necessary when you want to get down the latency by shortening the segment duration  fractional seconds in my case   while avoiding a bad compression efficiency through frequent usage of keyframes  this way you can end up starting with a number of consecutive segments without keyframes when tuning into a live stream

 valodim    i obtain k 9 mail from the f droid repository   the latest version offered there is 5 010  alpha and beta versions of k 9 mail do not seem to be uploaded there as unstable releases     do you mean to address the most recent master   unstable   development release  currently k 9 mail v5 109 alpha  in https   github com k9mail k 9 releases with  "the latest alpha"    depending on how long you plan to maintain the k 9 5 0xx current   stable   maintenance branch  it may be unfortunate not to fix it in this branch as well     anyway  i am sure willing to test a k 9 5 1xx alpha version  if necessary  will i be able to downgrade from a recent k 9 5 1xx to 5 008 flawlessly   or do i have to expect configuration breakage etc   when doing so    cketti  i am not an android expert   can you please provide a bit more concise description  where i may find that "stack trace  which  should be logged somewhere "  and  a hint  what file name  components  i shall be looking for 
here is a typical crash report  the crash does only happen in a very few cases  it mostly works fine  my app is using the proguard for obfuscation  so method names in the following stack trace are missing  but the line numbers and class names should be correct 
how do i go about getting the logs  i tried the same area with all my plugins disabled as well

links should be stored in the persistent entity nbt data and point at the other entities persistent uuid   this is all handled in linkagemanager java 
because it messes up my values   i setup my mock with various services and characteristics with values  if i connect to the mock later and setupnotifications      for a uuid  the value of the characteristic for this uuid becomes 1  and 0 if i unsubscribe from the notification     new byte    byte   enable   1   0     i think this is a bug and the value should not be overwritten

the way we are getting the device count is incorrect     hostmachinedevicemanager getdevicesbyhost   getalldevices   size    gives the count of all sims+real devices  ideally  we should read the caps and get the corresponding devices and add it our  devicecount

marc  thank you for the reply   let me check with my collaborator  as it is his data and i don't want to be sending it out without his consent     it is worth mentioning that the system we are exporting from is running only one instance of peptideshaker  and the one we are trying to open it on is two time zones away and trying to open it in the only running instance of peptideshaker   i have also tried doing this all in our lab  copying the exported file from one system in our lab to another and i get the same error   is there a different method i should use if i start a peptideshaker project on one pc and want to open it on another   this particular project took  36 hours to open the searchgui results  on a system with 12 cores and 60gb of ram  so i'm a bit scared to close peptideshaker on it until i know i have a project that can be opened on another system

download all feeds the first time the app loads  cache them  download only newer items from the news app and let the user chose how many streams to display  like k9mail does for mails  and then at the end of this x items per feed something like a button with "show more"  that would be my preferred option 
no  and if i _do_ allow the link to open in chrome  copy the url  of the form https   matrix to #  roomid matrix org   paste it the composer and send it into the timeline  then click on the link in the timeline  clicking _that_ link works fine   so it's only clicking the link in the tombstone event that invites me to open it in the application of my choice

hi renato    for anyone taking raw http from a 3rd party source and feeding it to this library  like i am  i think it'd be surprising to need to decode the raw http content before sending to rawhttp   if it needs to be an option  the least surprise would be if rawhttp handled encoded content by default   to steal from the xom library's goals   "correctness  simplicity  and performance  in that order" seems like a good philosophy   in my case  it is especially hard to workaround  20 because if i replace it with a space for rawhttp's sake  it run into this   https   github com renatoathaydes rawhttp blob 91fccad19292be8ae6489dd4a9aae62c481aa7d5 rawhttp core src main java rawhttp core httpmetadataparser java#l145

i deleted this plugin and reinstall it again  i deleted the prison files  to make it work  but it didnt work  here is the following what do i mean  i created rank  k  as the begging rank  and a made alot more ranks like j free in rank free  the last rank  i did  rankup again  it changed me back to rank k it didn't say that im in highest rank  so i suggest doing  prisonranks create  k  start  8  3k 8  100000 this is a example  prisonranks create  rankname   level   prefix   money  level allows me to make the rank first rank or last rank or middle rank like changing start with  finish  and middle  mid  starting  start  please say that you understand me
yes  thank you

i don't think it's related to item textures for my router blocks specifically   the bug affects  all  held items  e g  an rftools block    other than chests  which seem to render fine   but i know they have some special rendering     i don't think it's relevant  but my routers do use a custom baked model because they can be camouflaged   but under normal circumstances  that custom baked model just returns the parent model  i e  the router's real baked model    only when camouflaged does it return the model of the camo block being used   no  i'm pretty sure it's down to that   bindtexture     call i make in the particle rendering code   if i comment that  all your rendering is fine  but my particle rendering breaks  of course

i think i cancelled it  but not sure at this point  was on vacation and not paying close attention   sorry   i think the main thing i would have expected is for the size reporting to have a reasonable value  or switch to showing just bytes transferred if it can no longer calculate percentage  since it appears to be tolerant of deletion  this is good i think    at least the display should be corrected    there's also something to be said for having it only check size once    does oc actually tolerate the file size increasing during the upload process    however  i can also see some justification for  if it's going to continuously check the size   it might be worthwhile to note the deletion and abort the transfer   i can also see the opposite   oc could protect against an accidental deletion if the upload was already in progress     no strong opinion on the behavior choice   but the ui shouldn't display a gibberish percentage when it doesn't know the file size any more    another option   grab the file size continuously as you are now  but cache the last successful one  if you can no longer determine the size  use the cached value going forward  but highlight that it's out of date in the progress ui in some manner

i tried the latest build network drives seem to operate faster but  selecting a new file still takes like 2 3 seconds and the more you select the slower it will get until it freezes for a couple of seconds  little annoying but much better than before  scraping of 4 videos takes 1 2 minutes  which seem okay  writing files of 4 videos takes about 1 2 minutes   ok as well   in explorer the network drive is explored in an instant and files open instantly as well  the cursor does not change when the program freezes while selecting files   the network drive uses the samba protocol on a arm router  asus rt n66u  running modified asus firmware "asuswrt merlin" with the linux kernel 2 6 22 19  accessing is quick and without any freezes on osx  debian  win7  win8 and android

no this is about you having to manually set permissions on entity classes before a user can do anything  it should be runassystem so if a user has edit rights on an entity he she can annotate that entity without problems  on 14 september 2015 at 20 59  morris swertz notifications github com wrote    ##   mark de haan genomics coordination centre genetics department university medical centre groningen

interesting  it looks like i misinterpreted what i experienced    you're right it has to do with the list length and not the contents  that makes a lot more sense  i've updated the issue to include the latest information including that this was found on a motorola g4 running android 7 0  it seems to has to do with when items need to scroll   i'd be ok to close this since i think you're right there's not likely to be anything we can do

what i wanted is a behavior as an e g  when you have gdb or firefox or any program running from the console or command prompt  unlike say torbrowser launcher which detaches the window and doesn't allow any sort of debugging  the command prompt allows for knowing what is happening  something like this      this is a partial thread from a gdb instance running some program  i am more comfortable when things are attached to the command prompt rather than having a swing terminal window  it just feels more natural and probably is more easier to understand debug  does that make sense

you can give a lamp object a wire by right clicking it  this won't cause the block to update if the only wire is another lamp with a wire in it  the two won't connect  it works fine if you feed it wire next to an ordinary cable on the ground because the other cable block updates the lamp but if the other cable is a lamp with a phantom wire  neither will connect

yes  i agree it makes sense to support ootb behavior    i like your idea of a path pattern based selection  an admin could say "these areas of the site are not access controlled  ie  don't have special permissions  and thus we do not need to authenticate the request"  on the other hand you could also have a field where you specify which paths you do need to authenticate  sort of like exclude and include fields  not sure if that makes it too complicated    wdyt 
that's amazing  i did not know that  let's do that for starters  set the canvas background to use the dynamic system background color   i think doing that will remove the mismatch between the canvas and richtext  but i think we can make this bullet proof for the aforementioned examples by removing the background fill altogether from richtext

for what i have read now the updated title is the exact meaning of old devices   i have discovered that the format string to set the time in the server request was incompatible with that devices  and changing it has solved the problem in my device with 2 3 7  in the format we used 'h' for hours and now i have set 'k' as it's explained here   http   developer android com reference android text format dateformat html  i would like to test the solution in more devices  but until late afternoon today i don't think that i would have access to the other device in witch i have discovered the issue   maybe is better to wait to that test to make the pull request  although in the 2 3 7 device the problem was present with "playstore" version and master of development and now it's ok

i had at the time  though i wiped everything because i do that when i get frustrated with software  lol  i just loaded up 0 1 3 and it tells me that my bot token is invalid  despite it being the same token i've been using  cleared the config and re pasted the token  says it's still invalid   edit  this is using the autogenerated two line config 
i'm good  thanks   
i ended up disabling ee3 integration in thermalexpansion  thermalfoundation configs to get it to work  i've been running a uber forgecraft like server for over a year now  over 330 mods   so i'm not sure if you want to see the logs  it can be quite lengthy  but if you still want it i can provide it in a zip file over dropbox  oh and thanks for the reply pahimar  i've been watching your tutorials on modding  good stuff brother 
 philwebb  this is for actuator endpoints  please find sample code here https   github com jagmohansharma springboot2issues  i added custom content negotiation configuration but disabled it  now it is a plain spring boot configured and have set  spring mvc contentnegotiation favor path extension true  with spring boot 2 0 1  so here test  contentnegotiationtest  is getting failed where i am executing info endpoint   this works fine if we use spring boot 2 0 0 or set  spring mvc contentnegotiation favor path extension false  with 2 0 1 itself 
sorry i confirmed this was still happening with out tt but forgot to close this ticket closing it now

when i try to  bazel build  using the cache after having built once and accepting this file on the cache side  the build actually fails    just based on the difference that if i stop saving keys for that sha from the cache  the builds no longer fail
it is an existing user   problem started "a few months ago"  after adding english as second language he says  its working now  not sure whether in english or hebrew  i asked the user 
i can't reproduce it reliably 
confirmed it is from the machine  still figuring out how to fix it 
i just saw that the new version si available on f droid
yes  i was using wifi 
the issue is intermittent at startup  this is a code quality issue in bookkeeper with how it is integrated with zookeeper and how it checks and handles state at startup  since it's a bookkeeper issue  i'm closing this as a non issue for pulsar 
no   this would make somehow no sence as it would be out of xprivacys capabilities     i just open up the normal phone app  using cm10 2  and dial a number and establish a call
sorry for the late reply    so here are the pics  and  you know  i know what i am doing with server side    you guys are awesome in programming  but server side is my stuff    again  here the pics     unbenannt  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 5807595 10167364 83b24a5a 66c8 11e5 8452 17fc3d7fe2fb png     unbenannt2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 5807595 10167372 87e23e14 66c8 11e5 8c18 6a4d775de388 png    also one more thing  is the pegasus gate intentionally not working  like setting itself together to a ring  or is it just this build   and if so  is the pegasus gate actually dialing with the lights  or as a normal stargate  in this version of your mod rewrite of course     
not at all  allow a few days for me to get a pr done    thanks for letting me know that it's already fixed  i did scan through the list of new commits but apparently not thoroughly enough to realize that #181 fixed the issue   thanks for your help 
yes it is set with the server running  why would a server reset the config back to the previous state after a restart though  also what would be the point of having the ability to change a setting live in the game with a command if it reverts or the ability to reload the config after changing the setting via the config file 
yes  i made reset to this commit and now it works ok  thanks

i downloaded the whole repository in zip to see them without any automatic change  and i saw that these two files contained  cr   lf    the files were created by  devaigergely81  not myself but the problem occurred in my working copy    i work on windows  and i think git showed these files changed because it knows that when i push into the repository  they will automatically be converted to have  lf  instead of  cr   lf  although all files in my working copy have  cr   lf  line endings due to the automatic conversion   i only added this as an issue because it happened now with three files and i thought we should look further into the matter to find the source of this problem

thank you  we are looking forward to use a recent version again       
well i sometimes place a quarry near bedrock to only mine the interesting stuff  such as diamonds and gold  i found this bug by accident   on the overworld this normally doesn't cause any issues but in the nether one could place a quarry on the bedrock ceiling  near y 127  to get on top of the nether world 
when i tried it several times  it does something different than what i wrote here  mostly the spawner does nothing  the spawner just does what spawner wants  i don't understand how work 
when i click on my profile informations  mail phone     and then back to the main view there are 2 of 3 of the external sites rechable in the menu  else there are no external links in the menu  this bug is weird 
no  i didn´t change anything in setting except music  this isn´t the first time i have problem with this mismatch  even in previous versions  no setting changed   but after first restart there was no problem so i thought it is my computer´s failure 
crafting the recipe by hand was fine  of course that i made a lot of components by auto crafting  cannot pinpoint which one of them was causing the crash  i reverted back to a backup and crafted the coils by hand    i thought that it might help to post such a crash here 
to reproduce  add the following to control flow ds in tiger
http   i imgur com fthg2yc png
sorry  i checked with  greenwich sr2  and the problem still happens 
oh no  it seems to be a heisenbug  putting a breakpoint has caused it to work    
no  i am using 2 0alpha6  
nothing fancy really  just the spring property server servlet contextpath  data all 3 tests were done with the same code base and configuration  just switching the springfox version 
here it is https   github com kancic state error reproduction git  thank you for the quick reply   
yeah  that seems to have fixed the issue
i'm using the version that the build process downloads  3 2 2    which mvn  returns nothing for me 
i want to get a bit more info to check  tttppp's suspicion  i will also add a couple of other gifs  i suspect there may be a couple of actual rendering bugs but could be wrong
i get this result whatever the way i goes on a stream  top streams  features streams  followed streams and so on   i have the static image of the stream but bottom shows "stream is no longer live" message everytime and i can't play it within the app   even more strange  i can use the three dots and ask to play it in an external player  and in that case it works  so it's only stream within the app itself which is broken  and status check resulting in the display of this message    no useful information can be obtained from the  adb logcat  above 
that's the modpack  http   www technicpack net modpack technelogia 4 lite 613399 the version that i used on the video is  iron backpacks 1 7 10 1 0 4 universal i removed it from the modpack cause of the bug  i'd like to add it again     those are the steps  fill the bag with items put the bag on slot 1 close and open it 2 times open the bag remove all items from the bag without close the bag press 1 while mouse is on an another empty inventory slot simply toss the bag while is still open  never close it   pickup the bug done  i hope it helped  if still cant get it done dont esistate to contact me again regards
here is the crash report of the server  crash 2016 12 24_18 06 15 server txt  https   github com princeofamber cyclic files 672261 crash 2016 12 24_18 06 15 server txt   thank you
 kbagchigwc hard here means it didn't happen to all our real end user   i firstly found it in fabric  then we reproduced it during our test   this morning  i reproduced it in the voice quickstart android project   you can reproduce it by simple doing   make a call  hang up  make another call  hang up  and so on 
 grzesiek2010 now that you have firebase crash access  you can take a moment to look through the different crashes and see if you get any ideas  if i recall correctly  the index value isn't always the same 
hi uslss  cant dowload the ea version now but lowercase the end after a case statement solved the problem   
no  i used the old format  i e   the current default format   anyway  there is no reason that all my  changes get lost just because i save the editor

ah—it works when it's set  same with the same project level attribute  so  closing 
thanks for the reminder  only having one a     c cable makes connecting harder now that logcat apps don't work     
that's a great guess  but i've already compiled most  if not all  of my static dependencies pic   i'm out sick today  but one example is that dyld won't be able to find the shared library for gtest main   bizzarrely  that's a bazel built shared library completey unrelated to the other dependecy with the static child  which happens to be grpc    so in this unit test example   ''' cc_test        deps        "gtest main"     "grpc"  # depends on static foo a             the so for gtest main will not be found unless i set linkstatic 1 on grpc   strange but true 
i rewrote the ore spawning system so i asume it does  might we worth checking
dear alexis  in fact  with help of quang  the preference affected is the synchornize display  this issue happen with the synchronize on  the length of console does not take any effects 
i'm gonna make a new issue with the new problems
i've now run my pronom parser  for issue https   github com digital preservation droid issues 237  on all the signatures for v91   these are the ones which can't be parsed at present   fmt 899	4d5a 126 128500 50450000 20 0b01 66    0000 1000    fmt 900	4d5a 126 128500 50450000 20 0b01 66    0000 1000    fmt 1105	4244 12 0003 6      01    00 fmt 142	52494646 4 57415645666d7420  10  3     feff    16   64617461  so we have three things which need clarification   1    multi byte lexicographic comparison    0000 1000  2    bitwise   operator               01                 3    not a 16 bit integer             feff     multi byte lexicographic comparison   the spec says to compare multi byte values lexicographically  but droid does not support this   it will treat this as a range of 00 10  with the other two 00 bytes added to this set  which means it's still 00 10      bitwise   operator   the documentation states that this is to only match even values   this works in droid  because the       operator is a byteseek bitwise operator  that says match all values matching the set bits   so you get all the odd values with  01  and all the even ones by inverting it with the       operator   this signature almost certainly doesn't work at all in versions of droid before v6 or v5 when byteseek was introduced  the   operator is also used in a few container signatures   it's really useful to be able to specify what bits must match in a byte  but there isn't currently a standard for it       not a multi byte sequence   the documentation for this signature states that "wformat tag not equal to decimal 65534   0xfffe"  there is no support in droid for matching "not a sequence of bytes"   this will be interpreted by droid as not either of the two bytes ff and fe  rather than "not ff followed by fe"     recommendation   bits of byteseek syntax are creeping into pronom signatures   some signatures use multi byte sequences which aren't currently supported in droid   tna should define the official syntax that pronom and droid supports 
good question  maybe an "open file as new tab in current project" option is missing  too

 stuartwdouglas thanks for responding  i haven't been able to inject sse into a field  doesn't break startup  but the variable is null  nor a resource method  breaks startup   i was able to inject most of the other things that   context  provides   uriinfo  and others like i said in the issue body   i can also confirm that   context  is being resolved by arc   removing the annotation or replacing it with   inject  results in a bunch of npes
there are no errors in the console log  all is starting fine  spigot version is 1 11 2

ah yes  it being classcachetweaker makes a lot of sense since it is quite a hack   i can confirm that removing it indeed fixes the problem  i'm on the latest version for both classcachetweaker and tickprofiler  so a conflict does indeed still exist   thanks  nallar   
thank your all for the reply  i just git pull the latest code  and re import the maven project into my spring tools suite 3 9 4  it prompts the below error  maybe is it a sts version problem    img width "628" alt "image" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 25098175 58142419 8671c200 7c79 11e9 8288 0ea6694099e2 png"

i am pretty sure i have latest of all bundles on development branch   matteo was able to replicate following those steps  i also completely reset virgo to make sure  deleted folders work and stage and emptied repository urs files and re deployed   could be that you have to clean up virgo  or do the re deploy thing  to make this happen

i discovered this a couple of days ago and wondered since i thought we implemented that  then i discussed this with osio che team and not everyone thought that we should implement it  but we agreed that it is better to ask you and stevan 
yes  "outofmemory" is also what i assume i ran several tests yesterday on a samsung galaxy s2 and a galaxy tab  both crashed if the imported gpx was "too" large  it seems to be independetnt of the gpx file i used splitting the gpx to smaller files   40mb  works well  yet  when i import a second gpx file  again c geo crashes  if i restart c geo and then import a second or third file  with another restart inbetween  it worked and i could successfully import the whole file of 160mb so  there seem to be two issues     when importing the file  c geo should monitor the system ressources and abort the import gracefully with a error message  without crashing the app  if it otherwise would run out of memory    after finishing the import  it seems that there is no sufficient cleanup of the used ressources  that is why a second immediate import exceeds the system resources and the app crashes
indeed this is  ndk r14 and indeed aarch64 is the problem  is it an issue with the ndk or bazel

yes  i believe you are correct   the schema  in the picture above  does not show all the properties because it is schemaless as the properties were created by the etl process   one fix could be to check existing schema  or data  and use the case of the imported data and not the case of the supplied "indexes" field   another fix could be to force schemaless properties to use the case of any indexes if indexes are already defined with the same name   finally  what would happen if you had a schema for your class and imported  via etl  some other data that had the same name but a different case than the property name    i don't know that i exercised this but i would assume that it works by finding the correct property to shove the data into   either way  it's not a huge issue but it's still a bug that could cause someone to lose time  and hair

no  i don't have any ideas on how to check this    it might be fine if the exception is just wrapped with another internalerror with a different message though  if the filename of the offending class is included in the message it is trivial to diagnose the problem  that will already help tremendously

ok with  passlimit 0 the server seemed to survive the 15 minutes idle  wierd thing was that when chopping the first tree it took some time 3 blocks for the physics to kick in 
this was in version 5  beta  works in 4 1

exactly  it will only place as a normal block in the world and not work as intended

i booted in by deleting maxlock apk  reinstalled it  uninstalled clearing data  and deleted the dalvik cache  installed it again  strangely works but it keeps getting optimized at every boot   additionally  could i request you to add an option to lock apps upon screenlock  and also  may i know whats "pausing" as stated in 5 2 update 
i guess this might be the relevant part

sure  i could fix this by throwing exception but am not 100  sure that doing so would fully address problem   if you look at stack trace  you'll see that i'm not directly calling constructor  i make a seemingly reasonable call to setstylespans int stylespans  with a non empty stylespans object  i probably need to investigate what's wrong with arguments to this call  perhaps i'm adding empty span via stylespansbuilder  should that be prohibited  whatever the case  it's probable that error condition could be detected before paragraph ctor is invoked

 hmottestad thanks for looking into this  i'll need to revisit this to jog my memory but from the top of my head  yes  updatecontext was added to handle isolation  iirc the way it is set up is such that  addstatement  without a context is actually the "special case"  that is  it translates to an addstatement with a null updatecontext   as for removing that line from the test  i did that because the compliance tests should validate the _default_ behavior of the sail  especially since this config option is not  yet  available as part of the sail config template  but if removing this line makes tests fail we should perhaps raise that as a separate bug instead of trying to fix everything in this branch 
so far i was doing nothing on it programmatically  but i have even tried it after that    i am using jellybean and a 10" china tablet 
yes  add one more field please to mock    that should trigger it   as far as i understand   annotationinjectfieldsearcher findfield  will return a field only if the target class has only one field with that specific annotation   it's a bit weird that it +only+ looks for the annotation anyway  it should probably use the mock type too  or  actually  just the mock type  as we already know that the mock metadata comes from a scanner that just scanned the target class and extracted that metadata from it

hi  it was on ios wallet 
it looks like the behavior on red hat is the same  and the dev version of  shinytest  took care of that  so that's a duplicate   but it didn't fix it on the ubuntu instance  javier and i took a look  we debugged  sd_initialize  in  shinytest   the error that triggered was  private web go private getshinyurl       then we tried debugging and somehow using the public url was fixing the problem  as in     it suddenly once or twice and then went back to failing  it might be a timing issue    using screensharing   javierluraschi wrote half of this  and i wrote the other  
i could  but it wouldn't show anything  i'll try to record it happening   edit  can't record it  i'll try to take a couple screenshots
 tsmaeder hard to say for sure 
 marcphilipp thanks a lot  it works as expected now  as a side effect the config's error tolerance has been changed  the next example has passed the test in the past but fails now  see the lack of ampersand in the lastest value  
umm  not sure it helps  the query service returns the client server parts of the span already merged into one span 
 krharsh17  i was able to fix it  the issue was with  constants java  file in that the colour resource was not preceded by '#'

 philip lamb the original issue was that keys are detected but you can write a different key by mistake if you release the input outside of the target key  the pr fixed the problem but has caused missed keys instead   i pushed a new solution in https   github com mozillareality firefoxreality pull 1159  which captures the down key until the press is released  so it always types the correct key even if you release the pointer outside

 ahus1 thanks for the quick response  no need to apologize  asciidoc in intellij is always a joy to use  on another pc that does not have intellij installed  a fresh install of 2019 2 with the latest asiidoc plug in works as expected  i'm starting to think that there might just be something wrong in the windows environment on my other laptop  i'm going to re install intellij 2019 2 there as well and re test   hopefully  it is not an asciidoc plug in bug

sure  currently in morphia you can call the addall   method on the updateoperations with the last flag set to true in order to perform a  pushall   specifically on line 83 of updateopsimpl you'll find a reference to updateoperator push_all  the  pushall operator has been deprecated  http   docs mongodb org manual reference operator update pushall    however  rather than discontinuing this in morphia  it could simply be replaced with  push and  each   this is similar to how the updateoperator add_to_set_each works  line 207 of the updateopsimpl

this problem occurs only when there are enabled such modules as "override"  "harvestleveltweaks"  i apologise       i tried to change harvest level of some blocks using this modules  but i found much simplier way to do this   only with "override" module enabled  when "harvestleveltweaks" is disabled  i haven't this bug   i noticed  that in config file i have only   _one_   variant of each material  that registered by tcon and tgreg  in other words  2 _real_ materials transforms into one material in config  because itt uses name of material instead of id    i can say  that itt exactly overrides durability and mining speed of material  other stats of materials are result of mixing tcon's stats and tgreg's stats

i bumped up my glide version from  4 3 1  to  4 5 0  and the issue is now gone  if i go back i'm still getting the warning  it seems the okhttp integration library doesn't actually make a difference for this issue  in my case updating wasn't a problem so i'll use the latest    thanks 
i get a red line under "satisfies bar alias"  and when i mouse over the stated error appears

it appears to be working now  which is odd   after changing the color codes and prefix  and doing  petadmin reload  the new color codes were working in chat but the old prefix remained   now after a server reboot the prefix is gone and everything is working   it seems that  petadmin reload doesn't update the prefix  i haven't touched anything since i posted this and the automatic server reboot fixed it

i don't have stable version of android studio  but it's beta 6 already  so should work fine  all i did is git clone the repo  and open it on the ide  all gradle settings weren't changed from their default ones    the error occurred when updating the project to lates gradle version   however  after trying to import it again  without updating the gradle version  and it got a different issue     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 5357526 31053027 5761ea1c a69c 11e7 8f88 ec7b5b0f4f04 png   then i chose to sync project again  and now it works fine     however  i tried the "comparison" sample  and out of all items there  when i tried "fresco"  with "network"  as i did for all   it took more and more memory  till the app crashed silently  is it intended to be this way  almost all others just got the memory have a random number  but none really crashed    i also noticed that sometimes when i try to build a sample i get a warning error     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 5357526 31053493 2a91d4f6 a6a7 11e7 9a19 8eb07fdfaaaf png  sometimes it warns something about architecture  however  when i choose to run  it runs fine

wow you're right i did not remember about this setting haha  i was reacting to this comment from a user  maybe they did the same mistake as me 
i use iannotate and i confirm modifications are still ignored with 1 6 1  workarounds  1  and  2  above work consistently  but  2  requires pressing "refresh account" after another pdf in the folder was uploaded using "refresh file" as in  1     i haven't seen owncloud upload files automatically  anything else i could test 
 siddta and i have looked into this issue before but we're not sure where the issue is since the error is coming from an external package that we are using for conducting loess smoothing 
will do tonight

well  in 2 x map loading was done within a blink of an eye   1s   but in 3 x it takes at least 10s  the thing is we don't want to lazy load maps  in fact  our sw is build upon the feature that maps are loaded with all the data once and for all  at a given time  is it possible to bring back that feature  and provide some kind of map loading policy configuration  to be able to choose whether i want lazy loading or not   thanks 
the bug is still alive if in  else if is someclass   domeclass is an union alias 
i forgot to mention that i've already tryed the steps on #18  running manually it was showing the certificate error  then i fixed it and it now runs manually  then i tried using the mirror hook and that's when it started to show this process timed out error in the logs 
hi  rmpestano  that is ok for me     don't you to extend the faces config xml     supported locale en_us  supported locale     and by accident i added file faces config navdata with commit a2dc37f which should not be required  netbeans autogenerated file 
 danielleberre sorry for the confusion  let me explain a little bit more with an example   assume we have the following folder   gopath  └── src     └──  test_project          ├── a go         ├── b go         ├── coverage xml         ├── report xml         ├── sonar project properties         ├── sonar scanner properties         └── test xml  and a go is    package main  import   	"fmt"    func main     	foo   	fmt println "vim go"      while b go is   package main  import   	"fmt"    func foo     	fmt println "in foo"      after we generated the coverage xml  report xml and test xml  and then run sonar runner successfully  we will see the uncovered lines is unexpected       coverage   uncovered lines   uncovered conditions                   a go   0 0    10   – b go   0 0    9   –   as we can see  uncovered lines in a go should be 2  and b go should be 1   so  when a certain package contains no test files  each lines of the packages will calculated as uncovered lines  and that is not corrected

just tested with the latest betas on curseforge  things appear to be working now 
thanks for the update  a similar issue was reported in python storage system test  it was fixed by making the test to be more generic and use values set in the environment variable  as mentioned in your comment   would really appreciate if thats done 
thanks for replying so quickly   yes  i need an aggregation without _id  for my development purpose  but i managed  to ensure with a real mongodb that the code is working correctly  it is just a bit annoying not to be able to use fongo for one test  whereas all others are ok  for automated build matter   i understand that it'll stay on the todo list for a while  no problem  i know it is small use case     may be i'll try to propose a fix  whenever i found one  

i do not see any errors in the console  no 
i added a commit to my branch that should  in theory  test for this fix  but i can't seem to get it to work  and i'm not sure if it's my weak gradle skills  or what 
yep  same issue  but the fix is only for non referenced namespaces  referenced namespaces will always trigger the name check       image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6814629 20835492 444045b8 b89b 11e6 91ca 25c737ee7439 png   plugin version is 1 2

 laszlocsomor prepending  msys2_arg_conv_excl  to the binary call   msys2_arg_conv_excl " " node  e "console log process argv "  something   will disable the path conversion   but that puts the onus on bazel developers to be aware of an implementation detail  usage of msys on windows platforms  inside of bazel  i'm not sure how many are aware of this caveat   are there any cases where the path conversion is desirable  perhaps the flag could be set by bazel when invoking msys   off the top of my head    inside shell scripts proper one is always using win32   any path sent in by the user running bazel on a msys shell will reach bazel already converted
this happens when i enter a server that has the latest build of this mod installed  and the clientside has it too 
sorry  forgot to mention that  it has been tested with orientdb 2 0 5 and the current develop branch 
i've done the backup with the old version  i'm rather sure it did not contain any of the new directory logic  independent of the exact build date  since i wanted to avoid that code before travelling to asia a month ago   then uninstalled manually and installed the new version  i'm not sure if cgeo recognized to migrate anything  i have not seen any ui indicating a migration  i'm fine with closing this 
hi andrea    actually i was using eclemma to generate a code coverage report for me  however  i found that it may in inaccurate  i tried cobertura instead and i am seeing much higher code coverage results  thank you for your prompt reply    i also had a question though while looking through this report    is evosuite able to generate tests for classes that use dependency injection or not   i also noticed that my code coverage was low when my code called services  other than services that need mocking  what are the types of items that evosuite does not generate good tests for     thanks  pooja

i will leave the queue decorators as there are topic decorators there   it wouldn't make a lot of sense to only have one type if these are to be general utilities   messagedigestutils    only has one method that takes a byte array and string appends to turn it into a string   was replaced with new string bytes    reflectionutils    one this isnt jms specific  but there are also several reflection helper apis that are more mature and already support the full functionality of this class  for example commons beanutils http   commons apache org proper commons beanutils api org apache commons beanutils methodutils html   topicfactorybean    this one is very tightly coupled to spring   one of the main problems with this class is that it creates a topic from a connection then proceeds to close the connection and session   according to the javax api this should also close the underlying session and topic http   docs oracle com javaee 1 4 api javax jms connection html#close 28 29   i am guessing that the only reason that this worked is that the author used spring's cachingconnectionfactory http   static springsource org spring docs 2 5 x api org springframework jms connection cachingconnectionfactory html which hijacks the close call to manage connections itself   if we want to simplify the basic functionality of opening a topic from a connection then we can put it into a static method on a utility class   this way it is useful both inside and outside of a spring environment 
i can see people wanting both behaviors but my instinct is to use the current value for the  cyclecount  if the parameter is omitted   after all  what is the point of using  editstream  to set the values if you just have to repeat the values again when you call  playstream

yes  of course  three reasons this makes sense    it's currently guessing invalid credentials and hurting the user experience    using the provided root credentials is what the orientdb console does when you create a new database  see the resolution of #6564     it's consistent with the existing behavior    the existing behavior was to log the user in as an admin  and the root credentials have admin level access to the database

in english thanks for the corrections and have added some things   the release date for films is not actually used  but when i used the scraper in kodi added the director tag and then edited all nfo's to use as serial  tv show   because at least for me is more beautiful and more organized  the dates also help to give the right order in the episode  since we do not have a website to organize videos using to episode has a certain number  example  s01e35 or s2015e35    thank you again        em português   obrigado pelas correções e por ter adicionado algumas coisas   a data de lançamento para filmes não é usado realmente  mas quando eu usava o scraper no kodi adicionava na tag diretor e depois editava todas as nfo´s para utilizar como seriados  tv show   pois pelo menos para mim fica mais bonito e mais organizado  as datas também ajudam para dar a ordem certa no episodio  já que não temos um site que organizar os vídeos usando para episodio tem numero certo  exemplo  s01e35 ou s2015e35    obrigado novamente

thanks for such quick response  i appreciate it    i have encountered that while building response just for tests   in real world there always  or usually  are headers  or header  present  i've just found inconsistency in logic  there was not a null check for headers and after that there was an operation on the map assuming that headers are present  but there is a possibility to build response without them  as a result there was a npe thrown without any meaningful information

thanks for the quick fix    much appreciated   as far as the boot logging you were interested in  here's a comparison between 2 1 3     as i understand it the slave response for ip xxx yyy zzz 67 is arriving in a separate packet before xxx yyy zzz 65  which seems to be overwriting  or somehow losing  the response from 67   if you want me to log a separate issue for this let me know and i'd be happy to   thanks again 
thanks for the quick reply  and ha  i figured you'd ask  we definitely want to use the 'native' options in unirest over a custom client if we can  as far as i can recall  when we last looked at doing this  there were several options that unirest didn't support  below i've done my best to recall the options we need and look up their current support status  but there may be one or two i'm missing  feel free to correct me on the support status as needed     user agent string  supported via  setdefaultheader    or  adddefaultheader      connect timeout  supported via  connecttimeout      socket timeout  supported via  sockettimeout      max connections  supported via  concurrency      max connections per route  supported via  concurrency      disable redirect handling  supported via  followredirects      redirect strategy  unsupported  although this may not be needed    allow use of java system properties  supported via  usesystemproperties      disable tls validation  supported via  verifyssl     looks like the unirest implementation  may  work  but we'll need to test   we also explicitly define a default  socketconfig  with the socket timeout we want  in addition to the default  requestconfig   due to some historical bugs in the http client library  i suppose we could reassess if this is needed  but i know it was an issue in the past   overall  it's looking like much of what we need is covered by unirest  so i think i'll give it a spin and test things out 
with this fix  it works well

must have done something wrong when i tried code fences   thanks for edit   yes it is similar i need to install on a test box to test one more time and capture details   i remember lots of java error issues though   i am ok if you want to close mine referencing the other as i am fairly confident that once you guys dive into the code it will all be resolved   i can follow the other one and even test builds since they sound similiar 
hey  harshil7924 and welcome   have a look at our  quick start guide  https   github com movingblocks terasology wiki dev setup   in particular  you should familiarize with our  entity system  https   github com movingblocks terasology wiki entity system architecture    for this issue you might start investigating at  org terasology logic inventory itempickupauthoritysystem#onbumpgiveitemtoentity  which handles the item pickup 
 levelx2 version 1 4 4v12
release 1 7 3
i got both essentials and placeholderapi installed   and thats the only issue i get  the plugin won't enable
that works perfectly fine  access via browser and desktop applications look good 
i'll see if i can set it up and test it   just 0 20 or also 0 90 
unfortunatly this would mean that we enable the workaround in our production environment since we cannot reproduce this issue on our local devices  and i think we should avoid this  see_no_evil    but we could try patching the renderer and add the mentioned devices to try if this reduces this failure 
yes  this is with the current version  but you're right  i should systematically include it in the issue

 kofemann already sent that to you and paul last night via mail     didn't it arrive 
that seems to have fixed it  that also explains the lack of errors in my program output window   thanks  now to recreate my workspace and projects 
the app didn't crash but i see this in the logcat  no modifications  1 job   here's the code  https   github com shadowsocks shadowsocks android blob master src main scala com github shadowsocks job aclsyncjob scala  you might want to tweak it to make it return reschedule so that you can try it out 
hi  thanks for trying to solve that  i am not sure to understand what i can do for helping       1  create a new empty category   ok  understood  2  i add only items that are already in my other categories  notepads     3  i do that for plenty items and check if some can be erased or not    nb   i tried to create a bug report  but my phone doesnt work correctly with android device monitor  device not seen     
 robotia did not try with official    kasperfranz beehappy 
its most likely some kind of firewall  however i wouldnt know what plugin would cause it  i've gone trough the plugin list and asked to disable all the ones that i tought might change something about placing blocks but didnt come up with annything 
hi  sengsational   some phones can have dark mode during the evening   with the new q release you can turn dark mode on for all uses and apps  i don't know if all have this beta installed  if not then i can look into it     best regards daniel

ok  the bug is fixed in the last version  i can use also telespazio's maps for my tests  thank you for the answer  if i'll find another problem i open another question  bye 
my device is the lenovo p2a42  using a  custom rom  https   forum xda developers com lenovo p2 development rom havoc os v2 4 t3918141     how do i attach logs or send a bug report 
 dsyer i see this error when i use boot 1 5 3 release   i am using pcf 1 9  scs 1 3 4 with spring boot 1 5 3 release  if you update the pom from the above sample project to 1 5 3 release and push to a cf env with a config server bound  you could see this error 
yes  that can be done and need to handled explicitly in the conf  so was just thinking if this could be made as info as this seems to be important metrics to keep an eye on cluster

hmm  i tried it again and it seems to work  i have no clue what was going on   sorry to bother you
varchar 500       my team extend executebatch  method，we set lock_key  longtext ，but to this issue just add log is fine   这个问题，我认为加一行日志就好，方便问题定位，lock_key默认值一般就够了。因为我们扩展实现了executebatch ，所以我们设置这个key为 longtext ，但我不建议其他人这么设置，数据库大字段操作不易优化。
we upload the file and then we launch the index ws  we get the next logs from opencga log and sge log

yes  they are in my quality profile "i created a quality profile containing one rule from the findbugs repository and all of the rules from find security bugs"  i see the profile exporter is what's used by the findbugs plugin to generate the findbugs included xml   but the exporter is setup to only honor findbugs and fbcontrib repositories   see    https   github com sonarsource sonar findbugs blob 2 4 src main java org sonar plugins findbugs findbugsprofileexporter java#l61  it seems like it would work if i could put a findsecbugs rules xml where it could be found https   github com sonarsource sonar findbugs blob 2 4 src main java org sonar plugins findbugs findbugsrulerepository java#l48  but i don't know how serverfilesystem works   everything i'm seeing makes it appear i need to build my own version the 2 4 findbugs plugin with a findsecuritybugsrulerepository embedded directly  but i'd like to figure out how yours is working to run without such changes 
using java 8 works better  interestingly enough  since the pom file specifies java 8 to be used    but generates other errors as below

hi   here are some details about the app i built when discovering this issue    front   backbone spa   back   nodejs +  json server  https   github com typicode json server   express based mockup rest api server    so no servlet engine   1  the front calls the rest  post  api with xhr and sets  content type  application json  charset utf 8  2  esigate gets the char encoding and affects it to  content encoding  then calls the backend 3  node + express refuse to process the request for  utf 8  is not a valid value for  content encoding    i guess to reproduce  you just need to make an http  post  to any node based backend through esigate   since the oppening of that issue  i added a request interceptor  middleware in terms of express  that overides this header  it works fine now with my current backend   eric bretonniere  with whom i work at sncf fret for that study implemented an equivalent backend in both cxf and spring mvc  from what he told me  it seems like they are not impacted by the issue  as if the header was discarded by the jvm  instead of causing a rejected request   415 unsupported media type   like express   please feel free to ask me any question that might help you reproduce this issue     cheers 
i can provide more information if needed  but basically it seems to be impossible to make it not happen if you use map matching for the request   when this happens  converting the response to a directionsroute using todirectionroute   leave voicelanguage as null   when this is ultimately passed to navigationinstructionplayer  languagesupportedbymapboxspeech will be false  line 25    therefore when initinstructionplayers is called  line 91 will not be executed  and so mapboxspeechplayer will not be initialised   which is the only place is could be initialised   from that point on  any calls to setmuted  onoffroute  or ondestroy will crash

hi  odrotbohm   sorry for the delay  i am working on trying to debug and dig deeper of where the object mapper changes from my custom one to a new one  not quite there yet but will work on making the sample project today to show you the behavior    thanks

i'm having trouble reproducing the problem  i created a new unity project added a script and imported the project in consulo  this time though it didn't pick up any of the unity classes either  as before though it still found the namespaces    i tried restarting the ide but that didn't work  then i deleted the    consulo   project directory and imported the project again and this time the everything worked correctly  including the astarpathfinding files   i've tried deleting the project an creating a new one but now i just cannot recreate the problem  i've also deleted and reimported my other project and that's fixed the problem

hi   i attached an example generated file  once with and once without the flag xreplaceprimitives  if you look at lines 168 169 in hashcode and 210 211 in equals you have e g  the lines 
unfortunately  that is the full log as it appears in the console    neither the server nor the console are crashing  it's just console spam 
yes  it work  thank you   +1 
i cannot reproduce it either in new sample project  but it occurs in our production code at work  i'll try figure out what causes this strange behaviour and then let you know 
i do not think that it is a memory issue  cpu is not busy at all  we see no gc activity in our logs  and no progress is made until we restart elasticsearch  for  30 minutes

ah sorry  i got a bit to hasty when writing my test   i was trying to catch a plane    i did mess up the read write statements  that is what happens when i copy paste too fast     i have corrected the test to use an actual udt generated read write  which now makes a lot more sense as to what error i am seeing in my application   the udt generator is creating the following read  which works correctly     where type 197978 is the condition enum    perhaps i am over looking something  d   anyways  sorry about the bad test  i believe it is correct now   please let me know what you think    thank you  trevor

sorry for that  i've updated the code accordingly  as i was doing it  i noted that the trace issue has to do with the  ishdragenabled  and  isvdragenabled  restrictioning  because when i write  int dx   x  int dy   y   instead no traces are caused  but i don't know the reason 
a loading bar  or warning about generation would be nice  i do not need 5 levels of each setting 3x3x5  45 levels  ready to go  i rather wait 30 seconds with a warning or loading bar  than have my battery drop so drastically  if you really need generation  maybe allow the first puzzle to be pregenerated  and only generate one puzzle in reserves  i do not see a user completing a puzzle in under 30 seconds

but the same happens if i query the vehiclehistorygraph db  i have a question  if  i have a query doesn't return any result  why getcolumncount   throws an exception  is it not possible to read the meta data another way   i have this problem by using birt and orientdb via jdbc driver  in birt you can create some filter parameters which are applied as prepared statements on the data set  since this parameters are set dynamically by user birt cannot create a schema at the time of data set definition because of sqlexception  with the sqlite db this use case works without problems

i will provide an example soon  and i forget to say  the file handle leaks is really related to the bootstrap because when the client disconnect  the frontend channel  client to proxy  channelunregistered   and channelinactive   functions have been called  and the backend channel  proxy to server  channelunregistered   and channelinactive   have also been called  so even when these 4 fonctions was called  some file handle  related to the bootstrap was still open  i checked using lsof  p pid on linux

no  i just stripped out everything but malisis doors and it's fine  i then re added quark and the problem presents itself  so it's an interaction between quark and malisis doors   further testing shows it's something to do with the double doors code since it doesn't affect single doors   i'll report this to quark's git as well since it only affects when _both_ mods are installed   quark r1 0 59 autoreglib 1 0 2  cheers

hello  surli   monperrus   apologies for the late reply   i ran the basic example today  without any modifications    i guess without any changes modifications the classpath import is still prefixed to system out println  i have observed an other issue with this   the new out put file if you observe closely  the system out println  "there are two enclosing   "     instead of system out println "the proper syntax"

yes correct the timestamp that is being sent by the device contains the correct timestamp  graylog extracts the timestamp then adds 7 hours to it  the timestamps being sent by my device are set to utc  i live in pdt which is utc  7 so i do not get alerts until 7 hours after the fact  and they do not show up in my dashboard  i can find the message if i set the time to include messages that are at least 7 hours in the future though   the only thing that makes sense to me is that graylog is assuming that the messages are set to pdc timezone  i don't understand why though because the original messages do not contain anything that says pdc or utc 7 or anything that could be misconstrued as pdc or ptc  what confuses me is that if graylog assumes utc if it cannot determine the timezone then why is it extracting as pdc when there is nothing in the original message that can be interpreted as pdc or ptc   my original message shows a very typical example of what comes into graylog and the screenshot has what is extracted  it definitely adds 7 hours to extracted timestamp   here is the exported extractor

sorry about the typo  redis version is 5 0 2  don't know what to say other than the issue has been reported and can be closed because it is not reproducible  are there any config settings you can think of 
verified  thanks 
here it is

 kevinushey yup  removing the emoji from that line seemed to have fixed it  thank you  that's so interesting that it would have such an effect 
thanks for your interest  garagatyi a good documentation for motivation of nvidia docker can be found here   nvidia docker github  https   github com nvidia nvidia docker   it does not use any special image  it uses same image as native docker but it helps us to deploy gpu based application on specialized hardware i e  nvidia gpus  so basically nnvidia docker helps in containerisation of gpu application while native docker only capable of containerisation of cpu based application   in the eclipse che  i am trying to create a runtime stack in order to run the cuda c c++ programs  hopefully  this feature can be added to eclipse che for the other users in the later versions     and currently i am using  kayush206 cuda devel  https   hub docker com r kayush206 cuda devel   image to create the custom cuda stack 
maybe because of this https   youtrack jetbrains com issue dbe 4050
there's a couple of other places where i've seen odd things like this   i'll wait for the dev to drop as a release before reporting any others 
haven't been able to test that yet  but just looking at my spawn with 4 merged plots  it happens 
i ran "gradle eclipse" before importing the project into eclipse 
yep  i fixed my my code so that i send the request in a listener plugged on the handshake future but still get this  java nio channels closedchannelexception  
yes duplicated by #5741

that's on the develop branch with no additional patches applied  i take a photo in portrait orientation then while the image is semi transparent with a progressbar below i rotate the phone to landscape orientation and wait for it to finish  then there are two photos displayed  if i rotate the phone back to portrait it all becomes normal  only one instance is visible 
not sure how to install 1 7 6  i can only install from playstore on current phone and that is still at 1 7 5  happy to do if guided 
 laa i reran the scenario and there is not much else in the logs   i then increased the disk cache size   oglobalconfiguration disk_cache_size setvalue 16384    and  the issue went away  but the problem is that our application cannot be shipped with such a high value for cache    i am attaching the full relevant logs      orientlogs log  https   github com orientechnologies orientdb files 1908204 orientlogs log 
sure     use this model  and when the model pauses  look at the simulated time  it should be the last day of the year  23 50  the following step should add 10 more minutes  making it to one year simulated  you will see that the time simulated is not correct    img width "380" alt "screenshot 2019 02 23 at 7 22 33 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 15722750 53285823 7a708400 37a0 11e9 9e3f 0d41e8bffbe5 png"    img width "402" alt "screenshot 2019 02 23 at 7 22 42 pm" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 15722750 53285825 7b091a80 37a0 11e9 8710 7f51121b6bd9 png"    here it should be 1y 00m 00d 00 00

it is living for only a few seconds  what i see from the system explorer   additional 300 mbs  so short term  during the first several modules build  it will consume more memory  but the average memory consumption and the peek one will be definitely less with the fork 
it solve the issue  but each time i run pod install issues start again  thats the real issue  why react is installed like a pods module 
hello ilayaperumalg   thanks for your fast response  the last step that had the status unknown actually completed successfully  i was also just wondering why the second step still hat the status started and the last step already has the exist status executing    let me know if you need any further information to fix that issue 
i use java 6  though we plan to upgrade soon  thanks for the fix 
yes   it started right when i added these 2 mods   i tried last 2 versions in a clean instance and they worked fine   and now in a clean instance with same settings and these 2 mods it loads into world fine   no optifine in either instance
hi  yes in htop i can see that it's filled all 8g of memory i told it to use   we're running it on a large volume  probably a few million files   perhaps it's legitimately filling the memory   i was just assuming there's a memory leak somewhere 
yes  i do have that set

filename  luckperms sponge 3 0 71 jar it looks like the most recent version is  74  will update and and check to see if the problem persists 
i import a rgb image as a mask  select one to one  the only option that actually works  has something to do with worldmachine   so it gets imported as annotations   i then use a brush or global operations  using 'only on yellow annotations' as a way to select  or any annotation   then if i click on an area with any sort of annotation  it covers those as well  so if i have an area with red and yellow annotations  and select to affect only the yellow  it will still affect red
yes it does
our test environment is using xtext load option

i set the api key in a separate non cloneable  non serializable  non deserializable class with a public void method  this is the class's only function  all riot api calls   orianna are in their own class    i haven't looked too much into security   would it be possible for someone to introduce a modified orianna jar that would just print the key  any tips for keeping my key secured 
i tried first time with v3 7 4 and had the same problem  i updated to dev build just to make sure isnt that version

hey  rucquoy   i think this would be a great thing to take a stab at  if you don't mind  it would be great to get a build together so that  lime124 could see how it feels on device  with these changes     thanks so much 
sorry  i'm working in a complex application so i'd have to create an example only for this  before of create an example because it will take some time for me to create it  can you answer me this question  who is starting the listeners if they are registered in tracingjmslistenerendpointregistry  the method which starts the listeners is in jmslistenerendpointregistry  start  because of the implementation of the lifecycle interface  so i understand that this method will be called if the registry is defined as a bean  and with the last commit there is only one registry in the context the generic jmslistenerendpointregistry which is not used by the jmslistenerendpointregistrar

sorry for forgetting about the vital infos  version is 2013 09 19   does the content of the field gets uploaded to gc com at all when i use the "bearbeiten"  engl  translation  button  but not the upload button  i only use "bearbeiten"  never upload  so there can't be any remote content  as i would understand it  when i observed this behaviour i was surely not visiting the website  with that lousy gprs reception out there i would surely remember    i do not even see a „note“ field on the website for that cache  is that a premium feature  i never used it   some other strange thing  when i just looked at the notes in the app  there was only an "bearbeiten" button  no more upload  i could edit the note fine  removing the doubled portion of the note  when dismissing the pop up edit box for the note with "ok" now i have two buttons again  bearbeiten and upload  does displaying the upload button depend on some condition  may it be connected to the other issue   i now pressed upload  and it tells me about success  but still no sign of my note anywhere in the listing on gc com   enjoy your holidays 
oh  sorry   i ended up working around this by adjusting the url path on the nextcloud server to better match the one on the proxy server   then  nextcloud mydomain com redirecting to nextcloud local machine nextcloud now   nextcloud mydomain com redirecting to nextcloud local machine  this made the overwritehost and overwritewebroot directives on the server unnecessary  and the android app was much happier

6 0 8 2 at this moment  i'll need to re test this issue on the weekend  but i got an infected ear at the moment and am out of order 
i don't think the issue is removing the server dependency  it's removing the   controller contract  dependency   we're using the  pravega client    pravega common  and  pravega service  jars from http   asdrepo isus emc com 8081 artifactory nautilus build pravega  the issue is with the service jar  if you download and unpack  service 0 0 1092 4905199 jar  http   asdrepo isus emc com 8081 artifactory nautilus build pravega service 0 0 1092 4905199 service 0 0 1092 4905199 jar   you'll see that it includes  com emc pravega controller stream api v1 controllerservice asyncclient class   the missing class in the  noclassdeffound  message   if you download and unpack the next build   service 0 0 1095 8b6e93f jar  http   asdrepo isus emc com 8081 artifactory nautilus build pravega service 0 0 1095 8b6e93f service 0 0 1095 8b6e93f jar   it does not include that class  and  clientfactory withscope  is broken from that point forward   the diff between those two builds is http   github com pravega pravega compare 490519   8b6e93f  the only commit in that diff that looks relevant to this issue is https   github com pravega pravega commit 7e32e9742ea393e6c7081d2f42b6e29308cc9e17 
the thing is it breaks if you enable merge paths but doesn't if you turn them off   i have the same behavior in my flutter port and i'm looking for clarification on these mappings   flutter's been great   i nearly have parity with the android version and i'm hoping to release an initial version soon  need a pr i have open in the engine to land that enables path measure and path operations  
as long as the page is open  it's just lag  as in  slower everything  tooltips  moving items  etc    every vehicle is on that page at 1080p it seems  https   i imgur com 3mygovn png  gui scale is normal  
also  your reply that "this is a limitation of gradle itself" seems to ignore my initial statement    do you still need a sample from me   i'm not clear at this point 
i just checked  the issue does not appear with optifine removed 
no  actually the other browsers i have work just fine  firefox beta and chrome   i had no other launcher left  so i have installed hola and there it seems to work 
i will take a look later sometime again

hi  bhelx   thank you for a quick answer  ok  i see your point related to the  site_id   yes  i created one client per site  and here is the code i am using to get subscription of the specified account    as the result i see empty pager with no  data  in    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 4493267 74422894 04a17480 4e58 11ea 8df3 c064893ee40a png   i did a double check on the console  and for this account i definately have one subscription 
each sunday my server reg will perform unattended system upgrades  here were the steps i did     spotify connect  keeps the connection to the client my case  my main computer  and just has a timeout till the connection to the spotify servers is back and afterwards continues   maybe we are missing some timeout parameters 
so yeah could not replicate it btw cp  had like 40 spawners going over night with just as many killer joes no crash  i am thinking it is tied to random things blood moon event  http   randomthingsminecraftmod wikispaces com bloodmoon
okay made a simple 3x3x3 passively cooled reactor  http   br sidoh org #reactor design length 1 width 1 height 1 activelycooled false controlrodinsertion 0 layout x  it does 42rf t when it should do 107rf t with the configs we have  default being 268rf t  with 0 4 2a2 it does 42rf t and with 0 4 1a2 it does 107rf t  i didn't notice any difference from ssp smp  sorry about that part  my friend noticed the differences and told me about that part  i didn't test until just now 
now it works  thanks 
version is following   jdk  1 8 0_152 release vm  openjdk 64 bit server vm
awesome  it first occurred using timetracker 2 3 0  but upgraded to 2 3 1 in hopes that it would fix the issue  the jira version is 6 4 6 build 64021 on java 1 8 0_40 from oracle  i hope that helps

the activity didn't close when it opened the next activity and thus it was still active  plus it also showed in the recent list  although i think that was fixed in a fly by  needs testing 
thanks  then i will try with cwm
 bhargee "access 502" is a synthetic method generated by javac to handle field read write from an inner class  or something alike    dwightguth you are right  i will fix the missing stack frames first 
i'll attempt to reproduce it when i get home  it's happened to me on all servers 
the cached values were not empty  but iirc the lists were  i evaluated the functions that compute the cached values manually with a debugger and got the results mentioned in my first post   i did not modify glide's registry and neither did i register any custom components   unfortunately i wasn't able to reproduce this problem yet  since after a restart of the app it disappeared 
i'm at work right now  but i'll make a pr when i get home   note that it'll really be three prs  since github prs only target a single branch and i want to fix this in all the active branches 
show a warning that it was not able to understand the coordinates 
dear  dariuszseweryn   i have checked this issue in 1 4 0 snapshot  this bug is occur too  however  bluetooth is crashed on samsung note ii  rooted   i can not make bluetooth on samsung j7 or htc u11 because they are not rooted  is crashed   thanks
when app first starts      internal instance   new internal    at  line 131 is called  and then   return connectionpool delegate   at line 141 is called   after photo gallery windows is shown and returned back  when call is made  neither of previous lines are called   i also checked if injected version of okhttpclient is the same and it is    i also noticed another crash  probably the same reason  during  the call that was made right before activity was destroyed     it's different error  but probably the same problem  so i guess it's not necessary to create another issue for that   
  2018 02 04_19 34 34  https   user images githubusercontent com 8956281 35784985 7fc91fa8 09e2 11e8 856d 1cb099c0fdbc png   here is a  multimc  https   multimc org   instance of the setup   nuclearcraft test zip  https   github com turbodiesel4598 nuclearcraft files 1693562 nuclearcraft test zip   i also found another bug   if inf water source block touches a reactor port  it will drain the reactor of rf 
i'm running 6 1 4 201908041900  is this the latest version or is there a newer version 
sure  i can file provide a fix with unit tests for this issue on 2 2 x branch and file a pull request 
 nik9000  i will get that once it returns to a failed state again 
not sure if this helps because it need to distinguish if the event target is the local client or a remote one   in case one player hosts the game  he should still get the renaming popup for himself because he would be the authority too 
found out  that the app actually does ask for gps permission  but only if gps is enabled   if the position mode is only set to gsm position the app does not ask for the permission   so the app only works with gps but not with gsm positions  don't know if this is intended 
yes  it fixes the problem    i will try it with the command line option to provide an extra file and report back  however  i think the property should be included out of the box  otherwise there are files in the payara micro jar that are somewhat superfluous 
yeah  the line #70 is called a "diamond route"  where it divides and serves different parts of a neighborhood on alternating trips     btw  i can kinda understand why otp is doing what it's doing with that trip  since it's always trying to transfer you to the 19 at some point  so if you say you'll walk a mile  just put you on the 19 and forgo the 70    the strange thing though is that it's not consistent in telling you to walk to the 19 when you say you're willing to walk 1 mile     same trip with a fairly small change  e g   a trip start point 200' to the east  gives you the 17th   rex routing on the 70   it's inconsistencies like this from otp that make me worry there's not a scale of problems underlying the routing choices  hence the desire to get someone to take a look 
i've fixed it in a slightly different way  though the result is of course the same
 coreutils  are installed  it's just that the macos version of  readlink  doesn't have a   f  option 
it started a long time ago but just now finally narrowed it down to what the issue was   i had avoided the issue by looping things differently in past   but i would say i first ran into the issue at least a year ago but it may be older than that
hi  i used your example with no modifications  then modified it with the files i have and the above mentioned modifications i did made no difference to how the app reacted  it works when i first use it even with no modifications to your example code  but when i leave the screen to another screen in the app and come back and try to use it i get the error i wrote out  what i don't understand is how can it work if i have a  lite with 2 possible answers and the example has in one class a definition of numresults   6 and in another numresults   5  yet it still provides me a correct answer when using the app    i could remake the  lite for the project but you could remake it really easy too  i can't unfortunately send you the original as it's proprietary and from a client i'm making this for  but it's a  lite with 2 possible answers as is the accompanying txt file which has the names of the options written out  as i said the example works great  i get a result meaning the file i'm using works and has worked on an android version perfectly  however  here i keep getting this error after using it going to another screen in the app and then coming back    contact me if you need help with making a  lite file  i'll be happy to help you solve this   
okay  i tried the build you linked to   it downloaded to it's own folder so i opened it as a separate instance on my desktop   i was able to start it up and log on   i copied the contents of the old configuration folder to the new folder and was able to preserve my settings  sort of  a few things got switched around with the highlights somehow  it seems a bunch of the colors got moved down one string    the main problem i'm having now is that the field experience and room windows are not working   nothing is showing up there   i'm getting " " prompts in the game window every few seconds that weren't there before   all other windows appear to be working fine   not sure if i'm doing something wrong with copying folders and such  i have no idea what i'm doing    really digging the new timers  though   any suggestions at this point before i muck it up even further   as far as the old instance goes  i found the log file   i'm going to email it to you directly

essentially save scumming strategy for many other games  save before a fight  then load the save if you fail  every time you do this  the game brings over the damage done to the npc after your original save  so  you can technically attack for some damage  die  reload your save of the same profile and kill an npc since they took damage and held the value

yes its still got some bugs for me  when ever someone issues the command  tictactoe accept  playername  by pressing the words in the chat  it will work but it will seed them an unknown command message for some reason  also if player 2 who received an invite to play from player 1 accepts then leaves mid game     if player 2 then invites player 1 to a game  when player 1 presses accept  it will say that he doesn't have a pending request from player 2   this is really hard to explain  i tried to show in the video  im now running the latest version  14 and its still having issues  even if both players are op'ed with all privileges    im happy to arrange a time for you to come on my server and see for yourself if that helps

 xli thanks for looking at this  the pipeline view is always displayed as the screenshot shows  we generate the pipeline via a jenkins job which runs a java jar using the gocd sdk    i've put logging in place and that shows the order in which the pipelines are created is build  pat  undeploy_pat  prod  undeploy_prod  we do not change the order after creation    also  undeploy_pat and undeploy_prod are just created  they should not have a build pipeline   what i find particularly confusing is that when we specify an environment  e g  auprod  that should have pipelines which run after the prod pipelines they appear in the correct order  not sure if this helps   if you have any more queries please let me know

do you have try it on windows  my system is xp  maybe this is the difference 
well  we test it several times and fps droping to 1 from 60 only when ability being charge  and yes its flushing console
i'll work on a repro for this soon  i wish i hadn't found it in the midst of "jam code" so it was easier to extract   
opened https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 29086 to fix this   cd  does not change drives unless   d  is also provided

thanks for looking into this  adamretter  i've given it a try with https   github com exist db exist pull 1864  which does indeed reduce the amount of information in the logs  but does not fix the problem     perhaps i hadn't stated clearly enough in my original report that the problem isn't just the logging  but the fact that retrieval of the binary files with  http send request    actually fails with the same error message   after your commit  behaviour remains the same  in exide  a first call to  http send request  http request href "http   localhost 8080 exist apps dashboard resources

this issue was reported by automated testing   i never reproduct it too  can we try   exptable   logtable a  + logtable b      modulus   1  +  modulus   1      modulus   1     to solve the problem 
yes   overheadhunter this is comparable with #984 haven't detected this one before  sorry  but difference is  i can provoke it constantly every time and an interesting fact  my computer is a dell as well  dell latitude 5580   but with an intel hd graphics 620 connected to an dell universal dock d6000   i'll test with 1 5 0 beta2 asap  as long as it's beta  i'll not aim to migrate my vaults

i've tried to post some data on a website  i cannot give you an exact example  i've managed to solve the issue with such code     as far as i understood  i should have encode my encoding and then use existing method addencoded 
i am planning to apply advanced string manipulation techniques  will just add a width attribute to image

the walls track shape is derived from the simulationbody class in the sample program  it is made of a number fixtures made by link objects 
if the property exists type declaration  eg   class   assign null  it does not detect if necessary  if the assignment is not null  only use empty   for testing   these may not be a good idea  my english is not very good 
can you explain what you mean by "not released properly"   i thought the release succeeded   on mon  nov 6  2017  10 54 am niklas baudy  notifications github com  wrote

okey  after fully restarted phone  only than it started work in english  probably i don't really know  how to terminate and restart app without restarting androi  thought i know how to do it     
for me when the app was uploading a new page and a new image it was just hanging on the upload for a new page and never completing  waited for a few minutes   however  if i can fix this issue by  1  tap the image 2  select retry 3  tap the image 4  select cancel  5  back out to site pages  then the page uploads successfully  just revalidated a few flows and this looks like it's an issue on other media blocks as well not just gallery

sorry sir  i don't think i have a good plan  because in other databases  i'm not sure they follow the standard  as versions upgrade  other keywords may be added  so we have to have a unified standard that is compatible with any database  which is more complex and requires a lot of research 
same issue with our fork than with your fix  there was a misobservation when trying our fork   the misobservation is really strange   when executing twice this command 
because it worked ok in chrome 38  fitbounds in leaflet seems to cause this  in leaflet changelog there is one bugfix for infinite loop when changing map center after setting map center  maybe this is it  fix is changing leaflet from 0 5 1 to current 0 7 3  i'm working on pr and testing if this breaks something else  currently it seems that everything is smoother now 
i guess you're right  the  rfc states  https   tools ietf org html rfc7230#section 3 3  that    so in that case  i guess the client should at least send a  0 r n  body to send an empty body if nothing has been sent   right now the client sends the following     is there something wrong with this request 
thanks for the quick answer  i'm using the following maven release  which i believe is the latest release  as 3 3 6 is still snapshot   there seems to be no such constructor  new fftw_iodim int n   which would let me specify an array length  the only constructors present are   new fftw_iodim    and  new fftw_iodim pointer p    so do i have to use  calloc  or  realloc  to allocate a void  array   put my fftw_iodim in there and then use the pointer cast constructor  new fftw_iodim pointer p   with that array   also  suppose i would not use the  fftw_iodim_do_not_use_me  class but instead the normal   fftw_iodim   how would i set the parameters 
thanks for fast feedback  usually i have the cache turned on   it's only when i was debugging my more complex search queries i wanted to be sure that unexpected result doesn't come from caching 
hi philip   the document and process identifiers seem to be fine  possible examples are   ### document identifier    documentidentifier scheme "dbc docid"  urn www digitalbusinesscouncil com au dbc einvoicing doctype core invoice xsd  core invoice 1##urn www digitalbusinesscouncil com au dbc einvoicing process einvoicing01 ver1 0   documentidentifier    ### process identifier    processidentifier scheme "dbc procid" urn www digitalbusinesscouncil com au dbc einvoicing ver1 0   processidentifier    i tested the current version of smp and it accepts the values fine   i don't know your code very well but i was thinking  very simplistically  to initialise the length values and regex values from environment properties for a quick fix  default values are the current ones  override with  d arguments

my client only consists of a default application class starting the service and a scheduled job trying to access a oauth protected resource     actually  i want to use a webapplication  which is disabled in the application yml in the original post    but since singletonscopedconfiguration has a precondition  i tried this  but the stacktrace remains the same regardless of web environment being on or off 
 no2chem i think so   i wanted to refactor some code to  the way the layout future is leaked all over the place is not good   i'll just submit a patch to make invalidatelayout synchronized and then w can revisit this problem later
 cityscope_kendall zip  https   github com gama platform gama files 796611 cityscope_kendall zip    almost the same model as road traffic but indeed the gis file are "dirty"  i am working on finding other gis so it's not an emergency for me but more a way to track the difference between the 2 versions of gama    actually in some release  i have different release version  the rendering is very strange with some z value on some other there is no problem at all  so i guess the gis has lots of z strange values that might impact on the triangulation  maybe  i don't know if it's generic enough  we can by default flatten  remove any z composant  any gis file

try to move the map and wait a few seconds  inside a building  without gos connection  it's ok   try it outside with gps connection  if you move the map the text changes to "send selected location" now wait a few seconds without touching the screen   the text changes to "send my current location"

im not sure if its related or not but my guess is that it is  and its  major security issue    one of my players was able to lag himself really hard and spam commands until a "you are not activated" message shows and without  login he was able to use commands  i don't have many details as hackers like to keep this stuff a secret but i do know it requires bungee

nice  thanks for that  i've been trying to put together a modpack  so my overall experience playing with the system has been brief  from what i've noticed levels seem to come a bit too fast for the bonuses you get  i'll try and remember to give a better review when i'm not playing in cheaty tester mode 
i made a fresh mvn clean    mvn package on master of spring boot  used it with my app and now it works as expected  great    i am   was using rc3 before 
 kaikreuzer i thought you probably know best about last refactorings  the code isn’t so alien to me because the thing type migration has actually created by me 4 years ago    but the mentioned code about  registerhandlerlock  was added later  and removed again a little later   
we encounter this issue already since around 15 nov 17 all the time in a gateway which is permanently performing lifecycle tests  so there is a chance that indeed a matching storageservice component is not available at that point in time when the  stream    call is made  which in turn is called indirectly by the  automaticinboxprocessor  activator method  but it might also be the case that the storageservice is present  but its   getvalues    returns  null    trying to gain access to that information  also to which storage provider is used  the commit id the esh bundles are based upon should be 6d32c35f934b6b5a627cc4a32ff91564902bdc2a
i don't have it fixed locally just bypassed the bug in my code  but i can make a pr for it  and with the other issues that i have found 
nothing that i could detect

no  simply remove this view from the resource perspective  users may open it  when they need it  it should only be openened in the featureide perspective per default 
yeap  fine  changing cpp flag makes some progress and again fails
sorry it took me so long to get back to you   it was actually aroma1997's mining world that first led me to suggest it   i had a type 4 panel and noticed that if was raining or dark in the main world the panel would not gather rf   but  if i traveled back to the main world and slept  the panel would be charging when i checked it next   now my mining world is an all sunlight world like a mystcraft dimension or the biomes of plenty dimension   could be i just need to update aroma1997's mod   thanks for making a really cool mod and taking the time out of your holidays to look into this   on thu  dec 25  2014 at 6 51 am  nauktis notifications github com wrote 
i could not recreate this   i tried a new world  same seed  with beta 3  ran around and found five villages all as they should be   the only thing i can figure is that when i got your mod and added it to my world  the current villages were devoid of villagers   new villages were fine  the others were all empty   not killed off  as i started that world the day before  not enough time  only day 3   so i started a new world  with the same seed  and the same name  but i deleted the old game from the client   deleted the old worlds  started again  same seed  beta 3  completely different world name  no issues   all villages i had investigated are there   could there have been an artifact in the game that associated the old save with the new world   i assume i can avoid that by not using the same world name    i assume it had something to do with the names of the worlds being the same   i know little about mods  but it seems logical to me   interesting mod  thanks for developing it   glad to be of help  even if it appears to be a rare issue   cheers 
 arunans23 thanks for your interest   what we have done with other apps  e g  the intermine registry  is to set a variable  e g   datelastupdated   when the data is updated    then on the next request we check that variable  if  now    24 hours +  datelastupdated   we do another query  if it has not been 24 hours since the last update  we just give the user the cached information   does that make sense

if it is not possible to change the rule such that these tokens are treated as 1 token  i suggest that we live with the false warnings   i think false positives are less bad than false negatives

hi  milosmns   i've tried with the numbers you can see in the code  2000   2016 with 2008 as selected  the value that i get is 4016  obviously it is rounding up to 1 with the percentage  are you sure mminvalue should be added to mmaxvalue   percent  i would say it should be a subtract  _   didn't review the logic too much so maybe i'm completely being a fool  if i have time next weekend i will play a bit overriding the method 
actually just before i sent screenshots i tried updating to indicate every single pr event not just opened   rescoped and the build button appeared   i wonder if it's also related to the ui save method e g  the save buttons in each area  i noticed sometimes i had to remove extra configurations that were added to leave one 
i don't recall the cursor flashing but then the actual dialog hadn't finished rendering when alt tabbing away so no property field was active   note that being full screen isn't required for this to happen though i'm fairly sure the op was running full screen   was only able to reproduce this with a large number of token properties and the edit token dialog took several seconds before it finished rendering the properties tab

looks like architecturecraft blocks stored in the dank null are causing this  couldn't try to update to latest version as this was on a server that i don't own or manage so i had to try to replicate the bug  what i've found is that holding any type of dank null and scrolling to architecturecraft modified blocks that come from the sawbench  as seen here https   www cosc canterbury ac nz greg ewing minecraft mods architecturecraft doc usermanual html  will crash the game  then just having the dank null in your inventory will continue to crash whenever you log in  rendering the dank null in any way will continue to crash the game  in a chest  on the ground  still crashes    i have updated  dank null and your library and the same crash still happens  here is the crash log on the latest version  hope this helps  for now i'll make sure to not store any architecturecraft blocks in a dank null  https   pastebin com vfzkfzq2
we already have that ability in "project" menu  it should impact the whole "project explorer"  so folders in   projects  too 
i don't have the code on me  but there is nothing to fancy to explain   the project consists of a form in which you can upload two files  two separate file fields   and a submit button  which send a post request to an endpoint which has one parameter   the 'form'   in the controller i try and retrieve the files from the form  but it returns nothing  the size is 0   however  what i can do is retrieve the file names by iterating through the map of values  although that is not very useful

correct  not using the gzip option as of now   might be worth pointing out that we also set the dispatch interval to 0 as per the customers request  via tracker setdispatchinterval      we saw this on a pixel  1st generation  with 8 1 0 and a nexus 6p with 8 1 0 but did not actively test the scenario on other devices at the time   currently we don't have a minimal example available  if i find the time to create one i'll add it here

right  when first exporting a file  probably also copying it into the correct folder with the correct name  it will import everything except username and password  which is as it should be  
tried it  still happens 
i sent the report  but with no notes because there right here 
from what i understand this affected all versions 1 8 1 12  viaversion wouldn't solve this problem since viaversion doesn't work that way  i'm already using 1 12 2 spigot so obviously  there's nothing to inject there

we are running this on a number of nodes in a gke cluster    we have 3 web services running and we use an end of request handler to calculate the request timing and send them to stackdriver as a custom metric   we inserted the middleware on just our   health  endpoints to test out the dependency which was the latest in maven central at the time of testing   com google cloud google cloud monitoring 0 17 2 alpha    we then let the google cloud load balancers hit our health endpoints as the normal do and watched our metrics  the load balancers in gcloud hit the endpoint 2 3 times a second   after a few minutes of metrics we notice a ton of the stacktraces above  we are not doing anything to batch this data up we are simply logging a single  int64value  with a timestamp to stackdriver   let me know if you need anything else 
i use the last version skillapi v3 106 i will try  class customize

this was my docker file for gensecserver    the server jar is irrelevant here as it was not used  so you can just replace that with any command that will keep running  like for instance " usr bin sleep 99999999"

i cannot say specifically what triggers this error  so far it has happened only on my dev laptop  not on my desktop pc  but several times already  always after upgrading as  last time  a couple of months ago  i was able to fix it by reinstalling as + clearing build caches  but this time this did not work  so i started doing some more internet research  there i found several people having the same problem  not always with a solution at hand  finally i found the solution that worked for me  extending proguard config  here  https   github com serso android checkout issues 138  it also includes a possible cause  proguard config of another component being too agressive   since i have added those lines to my local proguard config  every build is stable again  and without those lines every build directly crashed with the error shown in the first post

i cannot test this as your explanations branch does still contain the cycle dependency already fixed in develop branch  can we merge develop into explanations 
i prefer leaving our own fetching  although flawed   but adding javadoc to that method disclaimering we are not a fetching library  thus the fetch faults are not necessarily the parsing faults  as well as wrapping the fetching line with a try catch segment logging out a short exaplanation that the sitemap failed the fetch not necessarily the parse    i do think there are will be many cases where people will need a fast sitemap parsing and they won't want to delve too deeply into their own fetcher etc  they will look for a quick and dirty sitemap fetch 
here it is    but it does not works when i register a basic lambda with the builder method  withfallback  
raw junit5 test  i mock all dependencies  for a service  all repositories  for a rest endpoint  all services         according to me  using   quarkustest  is for integration test  my definition of a unit test is a test testing only one composant without any dependencies     so this is a best practice to use raw unit test  without any framework support  and mocking everything so all my tests runs in a few hundreds of ms from my ide

hi  jgrandja    thanks for the pointer  it just works as you have described  but it is not what i have been looking for     background  i have many rolebased annotations with should be used in our code base  i want to simplify usage in test cases  so the name of the annotation itself describes the role very good and i don´t want that other developers have to handle annotation parameters     using the annotation itself i have to write n withsecuritycontextfactories with the same implementation  but with different annotations as parameter    testwithrolexy   createsecuritycontext testwithrolexy customuserlikeannotation     testwithroleyz  createsecuritycontext testwithroleyz customuserlikeannotation     the implementation is the same because i am using reflection to read the annotation parameters and the annotation parameters are the same for all annotations     this leads to more code  easy code  and i only want to say that it was easier before    this ticket can be closed if the previous behaviour will not be reverted     i saw some changes by  rwinch in the classes which processes the withsecuritycontextfactories  so maybe you know more  rob   thanks  jens

dear  svenefftinge   i am using   inline  in two contexts    i am using   inline  in my java libraries  http   www arakhne org afc  in order to enable better java code generation when using the library functions from my dsl language    and my dsl compiler is detecting "simple" functions  with only a return statement  for generating the   inline  annotation and attaching it to the generated java function   it should be nice to enable the use of   inline  annotation outside xbase lib  indeed it is almost ready to be used   because it is a nice feature for helping the xbase based generators to generate better java code   nevertheless  even if i'm using   inline  outside its planned scope  i have discovered inconsistency in the meaning of the   inline  parameters from my point of view  as i have explained in this issue   i have added patches for solving this in my dsl compiler  and it's working fine

first example  if you host jetty directly on an ipv6 address and you use an ipv6 client  the request log says  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1      25 apr 2017 08 27 20 +0000  "get   http 1 1" 200 2802   if you however enable the http forwarded module and send a request using curl like    curl  h 'forwarded  for " 2001 db8 cafe  17 "  for 192 0 2 43'  g "http      1  8080 "    2001 db8 cafe  17       25 apr 2017 14 16 50 +0000  "get   http 1 1" 200 2802   so the behaviour is different  with ipv4 it's the same   second example  our application uses the iprangepredicate  1  from opensaml   they pull the ip address from the request and check via com google common net inetaddresses to see if its a valid address  which it isn't because of the brackets    final string address   httprequest    null   httprequest getremoteaddr     null  if  address    null     inetaddresses isinetaddress address        return false     i was wondering where it should be normalized    but since rfc7239 states that it must be enclosed by brackets in the forwarded header  i think it's up to the consumer  jetty in this case  of this header to normalize this into an parsable ip as if jetty was approached directly and not via a proxy    1  https   git shibboleth net view  p java opensaml git a blob f opensaml profile api src main java org opensaml profile logic iprangepredicate java h 0161ce469a7d8531ca5f96c909cc14f79fde705a hb head#l100

hi  marcanpilami  i will recheck it on monday   the issue was in text selection   logs displayed correctly  but  i was can't select them  so  i can't select some part of logs and copy paste it to somewhere  but  without time filter everything is ok 
issue resolved  apologies  i should have specified that i am also using the wonderful stomp client on top of the okhttp3client websockets  https   github com naiksoftware stompprotocolandroid by nickolay savchenko  nickolay savchenko naiksoftware   this library does an exceptional job of implementing the stomp protocol integrated with okhttp3 websockets   this is where i fell short by using the wrong stompclient over method to provide my url  which will create a default websocket instance that has a default socket read timeout  30 seconds     the  solution for me was to use the alternative stompclient over method  allowing for a reference to an application instance of the okhttp3client  this allows the application set it's desired timeouts beyond any defaults   thank you to all of you who did try to assist me 
would correct the problems seen the huzzah feather board 
so  the end result is that i had to copy the entire assets dir to the parent directory of the jar  and then reference it through libgdx normally  since gradle exports everything inside of the  assets  directory to the classpath of the jar  i had to put everything inside of a subdirectory called  resources     when launching the jar  the assets directory will be extracted to the   working directory    this means that if your working directory parameter in intellij is blank  it will attempt to copy the files to the root of the project _i think_  below is an example of a working jar configuration    screenshot from 2015 10 21 20 51 25  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7645647 10646802 87a249b6 7835 11e5 8b97 8afcc289c35d png

um  well it's a bit of a long story  but i started getting lag spikes in game every 30 seconds or so since around march 20th which got so bad as to make the game unplayable  i've been ripping out mods  java   mc  doing fresh installs   rolling back my gfx card drivers ever since trying to cure it   last night finally found out about ghost chunk loading  i took a look at the log this morning to see if there were any mods left which were causing cascading worldgen and the ones showing up were ge  ore shrubs   recurrent complex  which was the worse out of the three by far    i'm still getting the lag  but after hacking out about half the mods i had installed and with the remainders tweaking configs which impact on world gen  still testing  still tweaking  still getting the lag but it's a pyrrhic victory   from what i can guess at  something changed fundamentally to cause a cumulative effect   significantly shit on mc where once the mods more or less played nicely together    um  you asked for my mod list before   please accept my apologies  i didn't see your post    my bad  this is todays modlist  as yet untested with all the chunk related additions   https   www modlister com user nexusdog  if i can provide any information or be of any help  let me know 
are you referring to  atomicinteger  https   docs oracle com javase 7 docs api java util concurrent atomic atomicinteger html    i'm not convinced that it's a thread safety issue anymore  see last comment   but changing to atomicnumber would certainly be a good idea  just to be sure  thanks

i thank you for taking the time to analyze my humble request and respond in kind   my goal was to suggest or provide myself  a slight enhancement to your very rational approach to a rules library   keeping things simple  not trying to boil the ocean   i'm buried right now  but i will submit a pull request and examples for you to consider  within the coming weeks   i think the deep hierarchy issue requires more analysis   i'd love to know the more complicated use cases engaged by library users   my intuition says it's probably not as big of a problem as one might think  especially if you manage expectations up front  a user of the library who cares to decorate an abstract "rule" class gets the responsibility of implementing their solution s  correctly     btw  i'm using your library for an iot project at a fortune 10 company  and i've noticed that the division of code implementing the when   then   methods is seldom 50 50 but more like 90 10 or 80 20 in either direction  so that might factor into the deep hierarchy analysis   best wishes  dave
offset by 180  happens in both portrait and landscape
i have windows 10  no  i don't use remote terminal  it's locally  before open properties tab  you must resize dbeaver to small window and then open properties with columns to see bug 
i get this when invoking the shortcut for the first time and then after that it appears that nothing happens if i invoke it again   the other error occurs every time i invoke the shortcut 
actually the change updated it to 25 0 1  added you in cc  maybe they are doing something wrong on their ci about it  since it is not breaking with ndk12  i think we can remove it from release blocker 
don’t know how to fix  never updated 
no  it's a timezone problem     the simpledateformat instance need a defined one  otherwise some "default" is used  and the default depends on the machine the code is running on  but this only happens if the format pattern does not contain a timezone information like in "yyyy mm dd"
just run initialize twice 
yes  sir
yes  this is also in the master  i've fixed the specific flagrant instance of it occurring in the mref select box by escaping the character but it occurs whenever people write unescaped non ascii text in static resources that get served to the client

no  just the app needs restart 
could you specify what version should i use in docker compose to do that  if it is manual process is there instruction 
cool   bgogetap thanks for the tip 
mmm i cannot reproduce it  i download the last release and it's not there anymore    yesterday i noticed a switch between arcball and freefly even if i didn't trigger it  and then if you double clicked  to reset the view with a top view  it stayed in an already oriented configuration  let's assume it was a very weird configuration  i close the issue and i will double check if it rehappens 
sorry  my mistake  i been doing it as you said  i've corrected it above 
the stack is fine  at least it appears to be fine   but the sample application  aspnet web simple  doesn't pull in any code and the project type is blank instead of c#  i've added a screenshot and updated the issue description to try and be more clear 
i'm using the arrows on my  seats plugin  https   github com eufranio openseats blob master src main java io github eufranio openseats seatlisteners java#l91   i can use any entity for that  but arrows were known to be the  ridden entities  in the past  so i first tried with them 
i think nothing special needed to reproduce the issue  "openiabeventmanager" gameobject is on the scene with appropriated script attached  all event listeners subscriptions inside onenable   and ondisable   also includes restoresucceededevent  restorefailedevent and transactionrestoredevent   i also checked this list of events and they raises as expected    billingsupportedevent   queryinventorysucceededevent   purchasesucceededevent   purchasefailedevent
my phone is a nexus 5 with a 1920x1080 screen on which i changed the dpi setting to 360 dpi  which means the virtual size of the screen 6 12 inches  the real size  though i don't think it matters here  is 4 95 inches   the tablet is a lenovo a3000 which does not have any fancy setting  it has a resolution of 600x1024 and a size of 7 inches 
the filter is invokded  but the response is not expected  it seem the setting of zuul debug host is not valid  how do it should be configed   actually  i want to use it as the blue green deployment 
so our application has to hold the reference to the orientgraphfactory 
just noticed that name  command works with 'execute sql statement' but doesn't work with 'execute sql statement in a new tab' 
ok  versions  idea 14 0 plugin 0 10 1 haxe 3 4 0 haxelib 3 3 0  i use hxml file project configuration  it's the only one flash debugging works with   here's my hxml file    it's of course possible that i'm doing something wrong  but i never had libs added automatically to a project 
i did not call the 'seteventdispatcher' method  so it's the default one   i ran it on a windows 7 64bit machine
 tolusha  i fixed the problem by adding the following entry below the spec  https   github com eclipse che blob e3999fcc8b040a537c11300de178358acaef4396 deploy kubernetes helm che custom charts che jaeger templates deployment yaml#l17

whoops  forgot to mention   1 7 10 1 8 2a  so i guess i'm a little behind now  is that what's causing the multiplayer issue as well 
not immediately sorry  our tycho build is not yet ready and we have some other pending changes that we want to validate before making a pull request  i haven't made a commit yet  the changes are still in my working space 
oh sorry  yep i mean the workspace root  i had to reduce it because my file paths were getting too long for windows  i changed the workspace root in p4v  closed p4v  moved the folders to match the new root  and re opened p4v  everything was fine in perforce  but now i am getting this error in android studio  somewhere the old root path is being saved  i checked the registry and couldn't find anything  p4v and p4 cmd both say the root is correct   thanks for the quick reply   
that's strange  the blocks beneath me in this case are dark oak logs

hi alex  i just updated to the latest version  7 99 17   but i still get the same behaviour of the quarry   attached is a screenshot about a "crazy" quarry  the top beam is moving out of the defined quarry range  the quarry doesn't break any blocks in this state   i hope to help you thomas   2018 05 18 17 49 gmt+02 00 alexiil  notifications github com  
hi  croesch   yes  i ran the tests without that one and they all passed   i well understand you in that the issue might be open for a while  in fact everything still works well  but yeah  this might become an issue at some point  anyway  thanks for everything 
i will test web service as soon as i find bad signal area  using oc with a stable and fast connection looks pretty good  so i'don't think it has anything to do with perfomance problems   the point is  of course it can take a while to load the file list  but it shoud show the "loading" animation  or "pls wait" message  or "connection failed" message  instead of freezing and crashing 
the version on google drive had no package column on the entities  it should have one  set to gids  to reproduce the problem  i don't know if it got updated or if i uploaded the wrong version of the file   that said  the issue changed a bit in 1 10  in 1 9 the importer lists 4 entities on the validation sheet  in 1 10 it lists only 2 entities  as expected   unfortunately  it does still throw an exception 
there are no errors  it's bug of spigot  when i click to item in my inventory  using gadget   event of playerinteractevent calling 3 times and gadget using 3 times 
in the editor  it happens in both cases

yeah  it has been fixed a while ago 
this failure consistently occurs
i did some research and seems that it conflicts with  mrcrayfish's furniture mod  https   minecraft curseforge com projects mrcrayfish furniture mod   v4 1 5   both of these mods works fine when they're alone  but together they duplicate the sounds   client log   latest log  https   github com orecruncher dynamicsurroundings files 1699681 latest log

ok  i try to explain what happend 1  every request will execute method  org springframework cloud gateway route routedefinitionroutelocator#loadgatewayfilters  and it will traversal a arraylist param  filterdefinitions   2  u can find method  org springframework cloud gateway route routedefinitionroutelocator#loadgatewayfilters  usage in  org springframework cloud gateway route routedefinitionroutelocator#getfilters    u can find the implements of list are both arraylist  3  some times we must refresh  org springframework cloud gateway config gatewayproperties#defaultfilters  or  org springframework cloud gateway route routedefinition#filters  or both them  if now the request thread is excuting the method  org springframework cloud gateway route routedefinitionroutelocator#loadgatewayfilters   it will throw  java util concurrentmodificationexception   i'm sure is not happen all the time  but i think it can make our service return the error message  it's terrible for users  thank u   stack trace 
what happens is that k9 stops when it's trying to sync inbox i e  the "circle" on upper left corner of the phone goes around and around  no error messages  after a while the "circle" just disappears and new messages stay unsynced 
the code works with the bootsfaces 0 8 1 snapshot  thank you very much for your efforts 
i did not  and after enabling it and rebooting my phone  on demand fixed itself  the  on demand  logs now appear  and that despite the fact i already had rebooted it 3 or 4 times  wiped caches  etc  to make sure that wasn't the problem     anyway  the  no field msleeping  error still pops when i start xprivacy  but the rest seems to have decided to work magically  so i'm fine  sorry for the inconvenience

 gsmet    just updated  its v1 2 0 final
i'll try it as soon as i get to it  in the next few days

hello  sorry for the delayed response on this  i uploaded my college sketch here  https   www dropbox com s 98im01wj1iso3ru testcase zip  it contains more than needed   anyway  str   after opening it with processing 2 1  go to line 36  right after the comment  press enter  now type 'setc' and let it autocomplete  select "setcurrentmagnifier" and press enter  as you can see in the following screencast it works sometimes and sometimes it does not  see http   screencast com t 9xzy3uln5wda  name of the sketch main file  sintomark

well  so it seems that for aspects setting  proxytargetclass true  does the trick   however  as far as i know  transactional is always implemented via cglib proxies  unless there's an interface to implement  this means that new testcase for this situation in the updated test cases below will never work  at least  unless there is an interface for the stage    testcase tar gz  https   github com tng jgiven files 662256 testcase tar gz

 machour you can go ahead and take care of it if you dont mind 
yes  i set it to maven  if i right click on a module pom and press update then sometimes it becomes a java project but only until the next restart
yes i did  i use it with ionic 3 
you are correct     compile sh  took care of it for me 
 pron nop  still nothing reported by  verifyinstrumentation   i will try to make a simpler example

thank you for your interest  it's appearing but pressing anything and it disappears  so far i only managed to press the "report issue" button  i will try to make a screenshot if it's possible 
yeah on playerjoin

plus the type name of the exception   both for http2ex and cause 
ok  i've looked a lil bit closer  if you use https for admin  then link will point to proper https orientdb address  the strange thing is that this address still is somehow "autoredirected" to http version  so  link shows https  but browser  ff  chrome  on both windows and linux opens http version  and i still have to change address manually    even stranger  when i "copy link address"  and paste it it goes to wrong url  but when i change url manually  and copy it again  then pasting it causes it to go to correct url   but this is probably browser fault  and probably can't be fixed from here  in fact i'm gonna ask stackoverflow of this peculiar behavior   second scenario  when orientdb is using https  while dropwizard is using http  link explicitly shows http version  but that's really uncommon configuration and i understand that it is not worth supporting   feel free to close 
currently it's "if the existing file is in the database and the file does not exist  delete it"  i'm proposing "if the file from the database is not in the file list  delete it"

agreed  such a thing already exists here   https   github com eclipse openj9 blob 02fdf14c71fb83f76deaa4f264b5c6748afc820b jcl src java base share classes java lang string java#l87 l93  although i think i've encountered at least one place in openjdk where they reach into string via reflection and extract the field  it should instead be calling this getter 
correct  i never noticed it before because amidst used to open a log window  then amidst4 removed that window  good idea  but wasn't running on one of my computers so i went to view the log via the command line   it's a low priority issue because launch4j is still passing commandline args to the app correctly  i e    log amidstlog txt  still works  and because anyone who needs an interactive commandline can use the jar    yup  that would be the problem    command prompt returns immediately  because we can't pick  stayalive  dynamically  i'm not sure which way it should be  we could leave  stayalive false  until someone adds a feature that needs commandline output 
oh  yeah  i forgot to write it  tried  nothing has changed 
i think it doesn't exist  but the program shouldn't crash anyway    
once the circuitbreakingexception comes  the heap usage doesn't reduce  suppose heap used is 5 gb at that time  it remains close to that  may i know why 
i tried several input scores including all examples shipped with audiveris  none of them works in my mac  i cannot speak for windows linux because i don't have an access to either for the time being 
hi  for me normal spaces are not working  here is a little sample where the problem occurs 
 sleshchenko my installation of openshift does use https  at the minute it is using certificates signed by openshift while i wait for certificates signed by our private ca  nonetheless once i get certificates signed they will still not be signed by a public authority 
it's version 2 2 8 349 in direwolf20 1 7 10  don't know which part is important but        minecraft crash report         hey  that tickles  hehehe   time  3 11 15 9 27 pm description  exception while

hi   i´m german   you too    imho there is a  little  bug  regards  jochen  am 03 08 2014 um 17 46 schrieb lars 
nope  this must be the lack of api testing 
none of them work for me  just keeps trying to load price and fails  top bar is changing colors while it tries to load   on may 4  2017 6 39 am  "aefeinstein"  notifications github com  wrote 
nope  it's done that since i've started playing the 1 10 version  even while moving 
boot 1 5 doesn't appear to be affected  for example   this test  https   build spring io browse boot pub7 job1 1417 test case 217332935  takes less than 1 second  that may be due to the tests being different in 1 5  i'm not sure 
i used 0 2 3
yes  the installation on my server runs fine since months  i am using oc 5 0 7 and the app is 1 4  i get messages like this in the apache log while verifying the url  get  owncloud status php http 1 1" 200 77 propfind  owncloud remote php webdav http 1 1" 401 291
i'm running macos mojave version 10 14  i will install archi on a windows 10 vm and see if i can reproduce the behaviour 
it comes up even if there's no   git  directory  even after a brand new installation  it also up when i choose  open project  and  new project   it's the same behavior as if i run   usr bin git  from the terminal  but what i mean to say is  if i have no interest in version control and never chose to do anything with  git   i still keep getting prompted to install it and xcode because the git executable is  correctly  set to   usr bin git   so i effectively have to tell rstudio and macos that i'm not interested in version control by telling it that the  git  executable is something incorrect 
oh  right  what was i thinking     forge 1566 minecraft 1 7 10 agricraft 1 7 10 1 4 5 jar  sorry
 noahdietz   yes  see the following where we've added that in  synth py   https   github com googleapis google cloud python blob 8c8e3606ecd214aafae4644d0ce6d4b293f32fa8 logging synth py#l41 l47     no worries
since there most likely won't be visitors on kafdrop and in our case it is not even connected to the internet i guess no  but in general if you run a website and you use the link then you cannot guarantee that google is not collecting visitors data and therefor you have to embed the fonts  so yes 
sorry for filing this report because it is definitely a matter of the local file system  on the sdcard there is fat by default which doesn't allow ' ' in the file names   fyi what i did  i used the  'myownnotes' app  https   f droid org repository browse  fdfilter myownnotes fdid org aykit myownnotes  which creates file names with ' ' in it but on the server  the server of course allows such names because it usually uses a modern file system  which is ufs with freebsd in my case  and not fat  but when i try to download those files with the owncloud client then it fails to create the file locally   i suggest to make the error message more clear because it says 'download failed' but actually the download is ok but the file creation fails 
version was from yesterday evening  as you see in date time  today it worked from current nightly  i'll make another one from your fix in #441 and try again 
i tried both  didn't work  have you tried a fetch spec with a parameter 
just realized this is also happening in firefox  tried version 19 0 2   so i guess it doesn't help to try your solution  right   any other suggestions   thanks in advance 
oo  sorry  hqm the journey 4 4 0 
thank you for the quick reply    yes  there are testng dependencies on the classpath   one we explicitly provide  6 4   the other is from powermock modue testng  which transitively brings in 6 2    i cannot remove these from our pom for two reasons   first  it breaks eclipse   there are a number of "type org testng ihookable cannot be resolved   it is indirectly referenced from required  class files "   i launched with  clean for eclipse and did a maven refresh project configuration and clean build just for paranoia sake    second  it breaks the maven command line build  which uses testng for both unit and integration tests   the plugin did appear to work fine before this last upgrade   sorry  i do not remember my prior version  which i know is notably unhelpful    invoking a test via run rather than debug works fine    saish

hi dennis  good hint  here are the values     however  i am using your official plain docker image without any modification  so this is _wrong_ out of the box  in my opinion this would have to be adjusted by the  graylog ctl reconfigure    script 
i respect the decision to keep it   but it is simply the principle of deleting a file  when delete  delete forever  from everywhere  perhaps i could fabricate a few extreme examples in which this small "feature" could expose secrets but i'm sure you know what i mean 
this one was beside the bar on mos le'harmless  but i assume it's the same for all of them
it breaks so easily for me    how can you not reproduce this  maybe it's windows lr stuff anyways  i will provide you the exact steps  1  go to collider wurst in the standardlib with folding imports enabled  should look like this    1  add another newline after  import fx  by pressing enter 2  add a newline after after  import linkedlist  by pressing enter at the end of it 3  fold the imports     the newline we added in the previous step is being folded  even though it should not    4  place the cursor in front of the 9th line  constant real default_collision_size  and press enter  creating a newline between the imports and the constant 5  remove the 2 empty lines between  import fx  and  import timedloop  6  fold the imports    it will automatically unfold again and you will be presented with something similar to the screenshot        http   i imgur com kqh7ksb png   as mentioned before  this is just one way to make this happen  sometimes blank lines are being eaten  and suddenly re appear  the 2 dot boxes appear at wrong places and multiple times

i think this mod has only one version 1 0 so we probably use the same version we both get it by "import github mod" and several gamers succeed in joining the game i don't know their situations  but when i update the game to 98 1 i succeed in joining other's game in the local network instead of steam network does it mean this bug is fixed i couldn't check if it will be succeed through the steam network because there isn't anyone playing games with this mod i will try to check if it will succeed 
my bad  it's my jdk environment corrupted  reinstall  then it worked  but seems not working behind the proxy  will raise another issue 
hi   i tested using the latest snapshot  same issue  wether with spring boot 2 0 0 or 2 0 1   also  the case appears each time  for the first as for the following    what do you want to say when you say "does it affect your webfluxes"    i can take some time to prepare a reproducible case to give you more facilities to figure out the problem if you need it    thank you for your help

yes  when the animation is complete  it gets redrawing and is accurate  i guess  it is because of integer zoom level and animation starts after zoom level changed  i think  if animation started with old zoom level it would be accurate animation

i use the version 2 2 0  i read the lastest release  this problem was resolved  i am going to upgrade it to the new version  thanks 
 zhuinden thanks for your help  the warning and the bug is gone with this version 
yes  this is reproducible  it occurs only after clearing history     android  10
nothing in that area was altered  i reinstalled the v2 2 released on spigot and the issue seems to be gone  not sure whether it was a restart or jar change that fixed it

 shobhitic thank you  please send pull request when it is ready 
of course  i have it running on my server consistently  so i will always get firsthand experience regarding what is and isn't working properly 
step  1  use default setting  format wrong 2  change the delimiter  format ok now it's ok maybe my workspace is create too early 
chrome for mobile  but i think its not the browser  i think it is currently not responsive 
i don't know if haxe or haxelib were involved at that moment 
yea  but i have stacktrace only 
sry for the late answer  you wrote  _"it hangs and i get outofmemory "_ that's something we experienced too      we installed your plugin on our production bitbucket and tried it on a huge repository with a long history  as soon as we noticed that it runs very long   and our normal users cannot access to bitbucket anymore   we restarted the server to have it accessible again  so we did no experience the outofmemory as we restarted before   after this i wrote this report      your proposed features are the same i thought about    
deegree version is 3 3 18  i would rather have a fix for 3 3 x than wait around for 3 4 since we are planning to make use of deegree for our national public delivery of datasets with wfs 2 0 and gml 3 2 1

no error messing in the gui  and i can't see anything related in the server log  i'm trying to change the triggers selected altering which check boxes are selected but changes aren't being saved  also as i now have 2 notifications i tried to delete one but it didn't delete    i have tried editing from global manage addons link then configure  and also by selecting pull request notifier from repository settings page     i don now since seem to have been able to delete one of the notifications  but not sure which page it worked from as no change was apparent at the time i clicked delete  but after leaving page and then going back to it the item was no longer there  also now the remaining item i can see from the repositories page  but does not show up on the manage add ons configure page for pull request notifier

unfortunately i'm not able to provide the project since it's private  in my project i have a method like so     where the incorrect package name is being generated from the codahale project   i can try to reproduce the issue in a smaller non related project if that would help 
ahh  hmm   you are correct  those tests are in fact marked local  whoops  this can probably be closed non actionable then   though as an interesting side note  nothing that _isn't_ local ends up in java log  which i think is what mislead me  are other execution strategies supposed to generate log lines as well

don't think that is the case   etc opentsdb logback xml is the only logback xml on the system 
nothing  the next prompt shows up  that's all  additionally  nothing shows up in event viewer  it's as if the program is starting and then closing normally before displaying anything   also  the java edition opens and appears to work  but when i load a custom seed  it just sits at a black screen for a good five minutes before closing 
actually i don't think that this po is necessary at all since it should always be of the right type as far as i can see  but it would probably be a good idea also to try this example in vdmtools as well 
if all things are equal for all countries  should gdp not increase either    i think the trend prior to kyoto was that for countries who's gdp increased more  their co2 emissions increased more too    i think it might be worth trying to model reality a little closer on this as it's not a particularly tricky issue  and it also shows quite nicely what would've happend without kyoto 
we are using default helm chart that configures basic auth  the command i tried was  app default processor app name   version  the new default version to set   also  some additional info  i have setup cd to always do   force  on installation of new version of the app  this might be causing some problem when existing streams deployed are using current version and new version is installed and forced to become default but it cant since existing stream using current version and etc

i misunderstood that as well  changing as you suggest would be perfect  a clear way to say you are just interested in the current context 
i've tried previously to    switching to another sms program and switching back   staying with qksms and hitting the resync button   restarting the phone  qksms must recognize the contact because it's displaying their contact photo  but just won't display their names  there is even the "add to contacts" button next to their phone number  but when i click on it  the phone pulls up their contact info 
it's referenced in the push fixes branch  so it will close when that branch is merged

 m aj it's visualvm 1 4 running on macos 
pretty much   i did a bit more debugging  it looks like the problem can be fixed by stripping all the whitespace from keys returned by 'keyfor  '  commit  on my fork   4c223cbf5384fd3a0213fba2b34797bc895a536d  i think that's not a good idea in general though   i installed timbre  search seems to work  it would be good to see how they're doing their search 
the macs display for the hosts  but on the main section where you scan for hosts  the main device mac does not display properly   it just says   02 00 00 00 00 00   about the second part  you are correct   the section where you scan for hosts 
yeah i tried delete it thats how i got on last time  this time it kept say that almura was offline and could not download the mod pack  what ever they did fixed it again  if it happens again i make sure to get logs n screen shots up straight away 
actually i also cannot reproduce this anymore right now  although this happened multiple times in the last week  i know for sure that on several different days when i deleted a past event from the cache details and went back to my event list  it would not refresh the list and show the same number of caches  back to main and then reopening stored caches showed less caches afterwards  as expected 
can't easily tell as we can't go to version above 1 1 x without breaking the build due to the  objectid  been made final so we are stuck here until we find a work around for our  class entityid extends objectid  thing or the morphia devs _un final_ it   p  in any case the offending line from  mapper tomongoobject    is still there  now in line 616  https   github com mongodb morphia blob r1 3 0 rc0 morphia src main java org mongodb morphia mapping mapper java#l616  and so is the  mapper getdbrefs    which is unchanged so it would be quite safe to say it still happens 

great  it works now  thanks a lot sir 
thanks a lot i will synchronize this pr later

i failed to mention  the files are images and contain the graph png  as i've said before  a new copy is created _every_ time  graph png is requested  basically  just browsing the server and refreshing creates them  so  yes  i guess they are temporary files that just don't get removed   have you not seen those  in intellij  they are shown as unversioned files  which is why i became aware of them in the first place 
i can't seem to place the coffin anywhere except where i placed it initially  i'll try a vanilla bed and check the version and report back in about 5 minutes  maybe

i think reported issue is my wrong usage  so enunciate should do one of  1  throw exception in such a case and shut down with message telling exactly what is wrong  2  provide general support for generated sourcesets so dev do not experiment to find working combo     as you might guess i needed to include generated sources for mappers dto  query beans  as they reside in a different folder  i think there should be support for it natively  thank you for a wonderful tool

hello again     sorry for bringing poor information about the bug  i was a little busy  today i have been 2 entire hours making a deep investigation on this bug on a new empty server  and i figure it out a lot of things    the first thing i have to noticed  is that the bug doesn't actually comes entirely from essentials  and now i'm confused about considering this a bug or not  maybe it is likely more a conflict problem that was actually fixed by essentials  but not fully fixed  you will understand it after reading the how to reproduce the bug     how to reproduce the bug  step by step     you will need the following 6 plugins  vault  essentialsx  essentialsxchat  chatinyector and its dependencies  placeholderapi and protocollib   forget about luckperms  i used it for letting "test" shout a message to demostrate you that the format  shout  is already fixed    2020 03 05_11 17 36  https   user images githubusercontent com 43190931 75990759 1e246200 5ed4 11ea 8910 ed90d028469b png    after having the 6 plugins downloaded  you must download player expansion for placeholderapi with _ papi ecloud download player_  then  the only thing you need to change on the config yml of essentials is on the essentialschat section  you must enable the radius chat  changing it from 0 to any number higher than it  in my case  100 blocks     on the "format " you must change it from "  displayname    message " to "  player_name    message " and here it comes the big question  "why would you change the displayname variable with player_name " well  first of all  remember this is the fastest way to reproduce the bug  but on my detailed server i use it for avoiding players who used to be vip group with their nickname changed  to show their realname whenever their vip group would expire  or also to obligate players with staff groups inherited  to always show their real name  even if before becoming staff they had a custom nickname defined  there are a lot more reasons about this  but i won't be splashing much more on this  as it's not the topic    you can now restart the server  and after you do  you will need to join the server with two differrent accounts for obviously reasons  one of them will need to have op so that way you can "spy" the messages sent by the other account when it is out of the chat radius     so  after following those steps  you will notice this results      2020 03 05_11 17 28  https   user images githubusercontent com 43190931 75992507 d6eba080 5ed6 11ea 9719 070f65bdb94c png   the name i used for the one that is op and will spy the messages is "tomi010817"  and for the one that will send the messages  is "test"    as you can see  when "test" sent a raw message as local  and "tomi010817" was out of his chat radius  "tomi010817" didn't have other alternative of spying the local message  so you can clearly see that the placeholder on the spy local format " l  spy " gets bugged  showing the name of the one who spies it  in this case tomi010817   this also happens with other placeholders intended to show stuff owned by "test" instead of "tomi010817"  for example his rank  i will attach an extra example image of the bug including group ranks also  at the end of the reply   i think that this should be fixed by essentials and not by other plugin author  because essentials has already fixed this problem with the local format " l " and with the shout format " shout "  you can see on the image above that the bug doesn't occur with those chat formats  so i will guess that essentials only forgot to also fix this problem with the  l  spy  chat format     below this  i will also bring you the same example but also using group ranks    2020 03 05_11 09 25  https   user images githubusercontent com 43190931 75994040 23d07680 5ed9 11ea 922f b60e2d35df90 png    the last message sent by "test" on both example images  is the same message but "tomi010817" is inside the chat radius of "test"  so "tomi010817" doesn't have any need to spy the message  and you can see that that format is fixed    in short words  essentials maybe forgot to also fix the compatibility with chatinyector  on the local spy " l  spy " chat format   hope you can read this  and if you could  thank you very much for taking the time of reading this long text  💜 if you want more detailed info about the problem  or even join the server and see the bug with me  you can add me on discord  tomi010817#8699
the only way to change my name that i know of is going to mojang's website and i only did that once  my name was not gumball when i created my minecraft account a long time ago  i changed it to gumball a few months ago and never touched it again  is this the only way to get this error  because if it is  then i think there's a bug

unfortunately  locale information is not available in google's crash report 
it's not clear to me  after exploring a bit more  if this prevented me from doing anything  but it was puzzling at the time  because i was looking at the preferences while working through the tutorial  and this was not available   thank you

i just tried creating a new game with the same modules active  all that potions is dependent on  and i was unable to reproduce it as well  i think it is safe to close this issue since it was most likely a local issue with that specific save  i'll keep an eye out for it occurring again when i use the game later tonight

no  not sure since when i tested  but it never worked on lineageos on that smartphone model  sure  if i can download the compiled apk 
but what if the two registrations of the device are the same   ip port     the first registration of the device is successful  but for some reason the device is restarted  the device sends a new registration to the server  unfortunately  the device's ip and port remain unchanged  in this way  the device receives feedback on successful registration  but apparently on the server side  the map    regsbyaddr   has no information about it   am i right in this analysis  thanks

hi  yes i am using the build in chrome emulator  i am using the below custom capability provided in the chromedriver exe  i am trying to emulate apple ipad device 
it was on the logical flow page with ie 
rather sporadic  yes  only happened once   https   gist github com sunconure11 75237792a443823ec8032870d056087f
i'm still try to reproduce like a integration test  but without success  but at our test cluster  this bug also manually reproduced  and looks like this   2 nodes 1 4 2 with centos and oracle jvm 8  first node contains shards 1 4 5 7  second contains 0 2 3 6  8 total  0 replicas  query     i have this error only if query  executed at second node  if first  all is ok  with search shards api  looks like 3016 route to 7th shard  second node does not contain 7th  but first does   any ideas 
ok i have tested and it seems a different mod is interfering with it  not sure which one  if i discover which one i can let you know 
hands isn't really an item  just a placeholder in the absence of anything else  it should automatically default to hands if there is no item  it shouldn't be an item   and this may be a pain  but i'm going to have to ask you to update your fork fully  and i mean fully  there was a ton of changes with the pull requests and i don't want to have to turn down your pull request because of the recent issues i've been having  it may not be a problem  but just check before making your pull request   thanks 
look at the gif in the comment 
yes  the directory exists  let's see if this log works  thank you  https   cloud disroot org s rbz2q8mzywxnf6b
the crux of the issue is that we provide an imap service to certain clients and while we haven't made explicit changes to the encoding they are asserting that the version update has caused this to start occurring with "all" of their incoming mails 
thanks for your reply   1  i'm using firefox on windows and ubuntu 2  the warning was thrown by textidote  in general  the problem is solved for me  i'm fine with using my linux machine for the spell check  but i'm happy to provide you with more information  in case you intend to dig deeper into it     btw  thank you very much for your amazing tool  it's much more convenient than the other solutions for using languagetool on tex files  including texstudio  
can we put rewrite true by default no 
yes  i'll try it   tomorrow   _as soon as there will be a nightly downloadable_ and report back here   
hi  the issue also happens with signed tokens   i just narrowed the reproducer down to the most simple case  it seems as if the zlib compression implementation changed between 0 10 6 and 0 10 7 but i couldn't find any related issue attached to the version

it's a bit different   chrome and firefox have well defined set of protocols and ciphers they support  they try strongest and go trough the defined set   in our case when okhttp is kind of a proxy and we don't know if  a  set of ciphers on platform is complete or do we have some custom ciphers which we should or shouldn't use  b  what about protocols  tls 1 2  and selecting routes 
seems so  i just tested this on a beta3 and there the switch is working for all bulbs firmwares 
they are 2 blocks high  the top half is the filter  bottom half is dangling below the filter  there are 2 filters side by side  nothing above or below the filters  it was meant for them to drop down a 2x1 shaft all the way to the void  so yes they seem to be stuck in the filter suffocating

ah  okay could be  ill try thx

fantastic  i'm able to load this into my project now  thank you very much  jamie beardedhen
i am going to collect a wire log with wireshark today  if this is what you meant   meanwhile  want to double check what permission you have used  here is my bucket policy   also  for this test  make sure that you are using aws credentials of someone other than bucket owner  lets say another account wants to access your bucket and pays himself  
 luigidellaquila thanks  could you perhaps also check whether orientgraphnotx#drop   is clearing all caches  stores etc  luca fixed an npe in drop   a while ago for 2 2 x see #6171   maybe thats related  otherwise the issue can be closed  i already use the workaround i described 
no i only have the industrial grinder+bp tube
i create a redisclient when the service create it has been use whole cycle llfe  and i test it by high concurrency
i can create a new account on our test instance but you may have a faster dev experience if you create a data shape with a large number of fields

no  i think a title is quite essential
same behaviour  should i submit a pr which removes the close   calls 
ok  i will give it a try  thank you 
yeah
thanks for looking into this bug  i have been talking with the stream provider  and they said the issue lays on the iis server they are using  unfortunately they cant do any changes here because of internal reasons  they said are working with a new streaming platform that will fix this  until then i have to rely on the "order swapping" manifest  the streaming platform will not be available for some months     is there other ways to rely on than streamindex to bypass this swapping 
i'm running a simple python script  by using sikulixapi jar 
quite often  it's difficult to describe how often them spawn  maybe 1 2 per 10 chunks  this pockets contains water from bedrock to surface 
the function is our performance  making for almost each http request additional http request that sometimes  not sure is it always or not   make query to database     is unacceptable solution 
where do you prefer to make the libraries available to you 
yea  only for x seconds   after some while  we can see him  it seems to clientside problem   i can't see him but my friend yes    and conversely 
i am currently working on a modpack  so that is what i am testing in

all these alignment options in 608decoder are based on assumptions what the content provider intended to achieve by adding whitespaces around the text  as the negative value is caused by incorrect content  we should probably not trust the values and the safest could be center alignment for pop on captioning mode  but other modes cannot be center aligned  the only other common mode is roll up  always left aligned  so something like this    note  also added the condition suggested in https   github com google exoplayer issues 3533

hello alexey  thank you very much for looking into this so fast  unfortunately  the change didn't seem to fix the issue    i was able to reproduce it in isolation  https   gist github com belowm 379718a5d772fcbb5c32ab9f34ffd2d8  when running this in a jvm   it correctly outputs   0  1  2    whereas the emitted javascript produces   2  0  1   
i was pretty sure it was on the oracle jdk 1 8  but it was on some other people computer  so i need to test it on my own one before being sure 
http   mcpeuniverse com texture_packs 0 13flows hd shader music v1 0 by bdx  i don't know if it caused it to use too much memory  it worked fine stand alone  but when i opened blocklauncher  it crashed   no mods  it worked in safe mode  i believe because when it is in safe mode  no sounds are played

no  the default configs in jed basically do nothing at all  if you want to reproduce this  enable the worldinfo override option in the jed main config  via the in game config menu for example   and then create a config file in  config justenoughdimensions dimensions json   like this  https   pastebin com izmtfawh where the  dim  id is whatever the advanced rocketry dimension uses  this should cause jed to try to find a spawn point for that dimension  when the dimension is loaded for the first time  it doesn't yet have its own  level dat  file   for testing debugging  i'd also recommend enabling the verbose logging option in jed  so you get log messages  at the info level  about when jed does certain things  like tries to find the spawn point

based upon your comments i did some more digging into how spring data is processing the sort request parameter  you correct spring data does support the csv format   however  the csv format appears to be processed differently than multiple sort request paramters  for instance  the sorthandlermethodargumentresolver parseparameterintosort it would appear that only one direction is supported so in the example that i provided sort firstname 2clastname 2cdesc the direction on first name is set to desc   java doc states "if the last element can be parsed into a direction it's considered a direction and a simple property otherwise "  however  when the values are submitted as sort firstname sort lastname desc the sort request parameter processing set the sort direction on firstname to asc and lastname to desc   so even though its supported the functionality is different which is why we are detecting a regression   i will work today to put together a sample applications but hopefully this clarifies the issue more   i didn't realize where the break down was happening until you mentioned that spring data rest was successfully parsing the comma separated values 
alright  after some testing  it seems that it loads fine on forge 1474 if i don't have liteloader loaded 
i use mviactivity and didn't try to reproduce in the sample applicaiton  because only  productdetailsactivity  extends  mviactivity  and it doesn't use  unbindintents  method   i've just tested with clean project with classes listed below and when i leave the app  go back to the app few times  logcat shows only one  bindintents  and many  unbindintents      mainactivity java

you are right  i'll check why my browser won't display it but it is indeed there

we can add a simple  atomicboolean  flag to the  tracker  object  and raise it when  setuserid  is called  then in the following call to the  track  method we could check that flag after the call to  injectbaseparams  and if it's  raised  inject the "deviceparams" and lower the flag  what do you think  d4rken    i ran a little test and seems to be working fine now 
i mean when you change both the dimension of the environment and the dimension of the circle from #m to #cm  nothing is displayed   to display a 1cm circle in a surface of 2500cm² for instance 
add  set and sub works just fine  it's only get that's weird
i'm using a zoom level of 150  or 200   and you're right  looking at the diagrams at 100  does not show the described behaviour

thank you for your quick response  yes i understand  plex is optional  but it is good option 😄  every time happening for me  just play a video from your sd car  external storage   when it is playing try to push back button  not working for me  after 2 3 seconds try to push again  just 1 time   not working again  3rd time  push to back button  carstream will crash  if you want  i can try to send a video to you 
ahhh  i haven't seen this option before  i'm sorry to waste your time

thanks for that   i just tried to use that latest jar  did a complete clean setup of the proxy i built to query verdict and it still failed unfortunately   i'm running the following query just to try and get it to work     uptime  is a simple table  with a single  string  column and a single row   i've tried a few other variations as well but it's not working unfortunately   are there perhaps other tests i can try 
thanks for the comments   i got the plugins from here  yeah chest terminal is not working at all  but lucky blocks works fine they just cant make them but they can open them   if i knew where in the code it was looking at the recipe for the autocrafter i may be able to fix it  but its strange that its the only machine that cant take in heads  it can output them just not input them 
not every time  its a one time thing for this upcoming update  i've written most of the code and will probably be making the change within the next day or two  so people me included  will have to click the clear _clear database_ button  and rescan their libraries    i just did some thinking about this  and you're right  but i still need a way to uniquely link an uploader's computer to the songs they've chosen to share though    i think i'm going to go with the uploader's mac address  that'd uniquely identify the uploader  without compromising their network location    that's not an issue here  the original uploader is the person who creates the  torrent file  no one else can  because song's are unique  when another person clicks play  they're just grabbing the torrent file that the original uploader made

 example project zip  https   github com qoomon maven git versioning extension files 3392737 example project zip  see attached file  i've tried to simplified the project as much as could and kept only the relevant information  as you can see  we have a  version  specified in the root pom xml  this tag refers to a   revision  property  defined in the same pom xml  the maven module pom xml inherits from this root pom xml and also refers to the   revision  property  at first  the   version  from the extension didn't like the fact my version was referring to a property  so i've hard coded the version directly in the version tag  but still didn't work for maven module that also refered to   revision  property   anyway  let me know if you have enough information with the attached file  maybe it's the way we are configured with the flatten plugin

checking screen state is useful to exclude other logs that look like gameplay logs  by only logging during a game we don't get confusing messages displayed    for example  immediately before a casual or ranked match you'll get logs like this     these look the same as logs that occur during the game  so in my first version these messages were displayed as if each player had played their hero power when the game started    which wasn't true  the messages just indicate hearthstone setting up the game  i stopped those misleading messages by checking the game state  when  loadingscreen  identifies that the mode is tournament the messages are ignored  once the mode changes to gameplay the logging starts  is that going to be a problem when using rxscala

hi  smillidge   tried to put a minimal example together which reproduces the problem  but haven't succeeded yet 🤦🏻‍♂️  i've checked all the jars in the app where it's not working  and the only one i can find which includes a version of asm is groovy  however  when i include the same dependency in the example everything starts up fine   one other difference between the broken app and the working example attempt is that the former uses a custom domain xml  i'll have a go at including that in the example app next week and see if the error pops up then   as always  your help and thoughts are very much appreciated 😊  will get back to you when i know more   cheers  c
with the value set to true  the tests don't run at all  they just seem to hang with their corresponding spinners spinning away  i did try pausing execution  and it looked like it was cycling between three different lines in the time4j library  looked like it was maybe waiting for initialization  but i unfortunately didn't make notes of the lines in question   with the value set to false  the tests fail quickly as described

hi  these are the steps i followed  #  i created around 6 workspaces of different stacks recent workspaces lists always shows the old ones and not the last updated workspace though the status is running #  also during workspace creation if i consider 'stack authoring' and have docker receipe   the workspace name which i provided in this step is not same as the workspace name once it is created  in other words  workspace name provided during creation of workspace by stack authoring does not seem to work   yes  will upgrade to 5 4 0 version and check with the new version too

 yegor256 that way  we are making assumptions that the underlying  back  is using only the socket incoming data  for example  bkbasic  is using localaddress  inetaddress  localport  port  may be it is not a good example  but in general we cannot make assumptions on what properties of the socket will be used by future implementations of  back   as a proxy simulator  we should also take back passed socket outputstream to report it on the original socket  that is ok but complicates  bkreuse  a little bit  if you're ok with such assumptions  i will consider it a taken decision and close the issue 
i've verified this problem is gone now  i've already wrote simple integration test for this particular issue  https   github com redhat developer che starter pull 279  i'll do some more testing with che starter and che6 in next few days  closing this issue  will open new one if i find something

the problem occurs for each writeable number item  which shows a slider and has therefore several lines   the slider is overlapping with the following item in the list  in the screenshot  each visible slider belongs to the item above it  "change mode" is an enum item and has no slider   firefox and chrome show the same result  ie does not work at all  as you know   this is the thing xml   2016 08 22 paper ui overlap bug   thing xml txt  https   github com eclipse smarthome files 432479 2016 08 22 paper ui overlap bug   thing xml txt   thanks for checking

thanks for reaction julio   it seems i don't describe my case correct   i've made some investigation in my and your code   so  bug is caused by typeselector   i e  more detailed my case is   abstract class anode   int i  int typeid  anode next     class cnode1 extends anode     stuff    class cnode2 extends anode     stuff    and i use type selector to determinate which class to use during deserialisation   it cause typeselectortypeadapterfactory added in gson   as i see in https   github com julman99 gson fire blob master src main java io gsonfire gson typeselectortypeadapterfactory java on line 62 and 63  typeselectortypeadapter make default deserialisation without pre  post  hooks

the thing is i cannot recreate the failure in a sample case  i was hoping on you giving me an advice on when one would get this problem so i can fix it  do you think this could be jmockit bug or rather my own code issue  
from what i can tell  it has to do with drones from pneumaticcraft i think

i yes i did do that 
the default renderer works correctly for typical use case  uniform tile shapes and sizes   however when using a map that has a fixed map tile size  i e  250x150   and differently sized tile images  i e  250x250  and 250x300   you will get the overlapping effect seen in the first image   i believe this is because the default renderer is rendering tiles from bottom to top   if you invert the process  rendering tiles from the top to the bottom   the tiles appear correctly  second image    it can be reproduced by creating a map in tiled that uses tile images that are larger than the tile size on the map     screenshot from 2014 03 30 18 16 08  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1435884 2562826 4f07d886 b861 11e3 966b 71f724304c79 png   my map loading code is simply using the default tmxmaploader   load   function and my rendering code is using a standard orthogonaltiledmaprenderer render call  nothing fancy at all

hi  spencergibb this used to work before    finchley m9    
well light is set only direction setdirection 0 0 1   so its away from camera  plane is set to 0 0 20 with this settings plane gets nice light as it should  but if i rotate plane on z axis for 180° then it looses the light 
hi cp    thanks for the quick response   here are the requested screenshots     in the first  i have connected the reactor rednet ports via the rednet insulated conduits and set both to channel "pink"   the second and third image is the gui for the big reactors rednet port which allows it to emit a redstone signal upon certain events   in my case i have set the reactor control rods to automatically be the same   as whatever the internal battery level is thus shutting down the reactor   starting it up depending on the drain  going into your very cool capacitor bank    this also happens when i connect the power monitor to the the reactor rednet port via the rednet insulated conduits and tell it to emit a redstone signal is the power drops below a certain level  interestingly  in this setup it does seem to emit a signal  seen by attaching a redstone light  but does not "go into" the rednet port   this is a very good tutorial on what big reactors are and can do if you wish to find out more about them    https   www youtube com watch v sev05vjkgay  btw just a personal thank you for making such a great mod  you keep a 43 yo tinkerer very happy       2014 10 16_09 12 45  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9249158 4659442 1d424a86 550d 11e4 90d5 f21f2fa84453 png    2014 10 16_09 12 51  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9249158 4659443 1d47d03c 550d 11e4 85a8 0582974f6de7 png    2014 10 16_09 12 55  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9249158 4659444 1d490998 550d 11e4 8a0a e15836c9cbd6 png 
sure  it should have been created like this  we use a script that is auto generated to create the index  i tried to reconstruct it in a few lines  but there could be syntax errors now  
 erikfleischer yes that's what i meant  i will do some tests with an emulator to see what i can do 
i just upgraded the intellij to 2019 3 and i tried out the debugging and now i am not encountering constant load on the cpu  it goes up to 115  but just for temporary  after starts to drop down  for me this operation acceptable now  thank you for your help 
 oscerd can you guide me on what 'from' and 'to' patterns mean  i would expect that the get event would be an initiation step of a flow like  1  i get a specific event 2  i do something with the info what is the use case when 'get event' is an end action  can i do sth with the result that it returns 
the bug is fixed on the master branch  and there are instructions on the readme on how to use it   i'll cut a release as soon as possible 
the client_name is the application name according to the schema and comes from the dynamic registration rfc  there is no thirdpartyapplicationname in the schema   the rfc describes the client_name as the human readable form of the client_id and it makes sense that if this were service providing third party it would be their name  if it was a handheld application it would be the application name

https   cryptomator org downloads #windownload  the sha256 listed on the website for cryptomator 1 3 0 x64 is indeed   6970c7b40f3e87b415a80bfe2c9b906effba3518c2d9672724cf5c9c5bc0de18   but the sha256 i'm  was  getting is different   tried downloading it using a different browser than opera  and the hash matches  somehow downloading it on opera with the built in vpn enabled screws up the download  oddly enough though  the first time i downloaded it  i was using chrome  it also didn't match back then  but i'm getting the correct one now   i'm still curious as to why the signature has also disappeared from the binary that was already installed 
this issue reproduced only in codenvy 
yes i've verified this on 1 7 2
this is an interesting concept  i think we should probably keep a default mapping  but perhaps add better documentation around customization so that a developer could do that trivially if the default doesn't satisfy their use case    i'm thinking that the change proposed by this ticket will allow us to support all use cases though  although we'll know more once i finish the ccp codecs 
ahhhhhh yeah  i had "screen sharing" turned on   after disabling the screen sharing  the server starts fine and arquillian integration tests with payara embedded all work fine as well   thanks   i imagine this would be a hazelcast port colliding with the vnc server port then   i wonder what the best way to resolve this would be within the embedded server 
yes  the vallues

images at http   imgur com a hjdbm the problem occurs if the mouse goes over the red diamond  that widget does not have a text filled in so tostring tries to use a null pointer  one image is before i fill things in  2nd image is after adding materials   the machine processes one cycle and then stops   25mb of water is used and 25mb of liquid growth medium is produced and piped out     i guess that's a bug too since it has a valid recipe but isn't processing it     crash 2017 08 23_10 21 48 client txt  https   github com forestrymc binnie files 1247945 crash 2017 08 23_10 21 48 client txt   edit   figured out some more info   it wasn't just one cycle    the machine ran until water got down to 475mb and then it stopped   i want to let the water run dry and reuse the same machine to process a different recipe  and it refuses to continue until i give it more water   so imo it is indeed two bugs but i'll leave just this one report for now     
i apologize  i haven't but i have now  working as expected 
i'll wait for release    not a big issue

thanks for your help  maybe bug https   github com raiman sikulix1 issues 258 prevents me from getting a stack trace  confirmed if i use guava 21 0  then this problem disappears 
we have a pom called  grails dependencies  that basically is just used to refer to other dependencies  when this is declared as a dependency in the app  the pom is included in the built jars  lib  directory   i don't understand how this can be "pilot error"  it is quite common practise in maven to publish just a pom that includes the necessary dependencies without publishing an associated jar file 
doesn't get truncated  and doesn't _seem_ to break anything  just weird because we have a limit and it's not enforced 
hi  filiphr  yes we have  unmappedtargetpolicy   reportingpolicy error  and it compiles  for example  if i remove the annotation   mapping target   "isadded"  constant   "true"   the build fails with compilation error  so it is problem only of the plugin
hello serge  i did a quick install at work  via marketplace client  without draw2d this time   same versions  same behaviour   maybe the following is relevant  if you want i can attach today's log  a mere 300 lines  a 3kb zip     ps  i also tried with added draw2d and in  a new workspace  with the same  non  outcome
fixed in https   github com molgenis molgenis pull 1039
thank you very very much for your efforts   the second version worked  only thing that was weird was that the migration upgrade process took less then a minute and i read that it takes 10 to 30 minutes  but after a short view my permissions seem to be correct   perhaps you are interested in that i didn't have a  data data biz bokhorst xprivacy xprivacy db   file   again thank you and best regards to south holland   
now i can no longer reproduce the problem   this morning i tried to insert the profile picture and it works   now i try to reproduce the problem   what i know is that last night i didn't open the screen to crop the image   🤔
we are using version 1 7 0  thus  this is somehow an issue in our environment  i'm going to debug into it   update 1  slingrequest getattribute "com day cq wcm componentcontext"  getparent   is not null  don't know why  still investigating  but seems not to be a  component error handler issue   update 2  while calling a not existing page in cq 5 6 1 the includeoptions in wcmcomponentfilter are null  thus the currentpage is null and the a context stack is bulit with two component contexts  a pagecomponentcontextimpl and a toplevelcomponentcontextimpl   i've disabled all of our custom made filters  same behavior  thus this behavior seems to be by design  maybe  checking componentcontext isroot   is not enough  maybe  an additional check for toplevelcomponentcontextimpl is needed 
yes  any object  window blinks  but nothing happens  nothing appears in log file 
i am not aware of  pgenerareapps  how to set this profile  do you have any documentation on it including the later part

i think we should display a short report at the end  as a toast  how many caches were refreshed correctly  how many errors and maybe why

we can wait for the next release  of course     it really is a very minor issue  smile_cat

all right  i'll let you know if it happens again since i don't know how to reproduce it myself  thank you

oh of course  sorry oneplus a3003  running op3_o2_open_26  android 8 0 0 patch 1 sept 2017   thing is  they were gray in the beginning  then they suddenly changed colour   
kind of tight for time  though i do appreciate the scaffolding for unit testing that you provided   i do think though that my description of the problem is complete enough such that you should be able to take one of your unit tests and reproduce this 
inconsistent but mostly seems to slow down  all id elements are set to 1tick rates but extraction often slows down to once per second  this also happens a lot while inside a compact machine with the item storage claimed via ftb utils and chunkloaded via chickenchunks   since most inputs are always on farms i cannot easily tell the difference between  5s tick rates and a full stop  will try to test in creative with vanilla nether portals     edit    tested a bit in creative with the same modpack and could not get a full stop  so it might be a severe slowdown due to the increased load of my "main" world  i _did_ catch the transient end of a slowdown though  the id transfer system appears to be working at a significantly slower rate while i am in a different dimension despite being chunkloaded   my test setup consists of a series of te ducts drawing from an infinite item source into a chest  here  aa large crate  vanilla chest works too   from there id transfers to a second chest  which is much faster than the ducts while observed directly  the second chest is then emptied into a trash can by a larger number of ducts such that the second chest is always almost empty   i then enter a nether portal behind me  wait a while in the nether  then go back through the portal and immediately open the first  id "input"  chest  depending on loading times and waiting time in the nether the chest will contain a significant number of item stacks  which are promptly drained into the second chest and removed as the system picks up speed again once i am in the overworld  i have also observed this behaviour with the ender chests in my compact machines   test setup    2018 02 27_17 21 05  https   user images githubusercontent com 22204328 36743800 75603608 1beb 11e8 8a85 3dcb55061753 png 
i see in   p messages       when i load page first time the message not happens  but  if i try login with wrong passaword  i show the error message for user   with my error message appers   "error  unable to find resource bsf  css default icons css"   if i remove the bootsfaces  the message not occours   ps  i have not tried without maven 
no  i was on the go  i suspect there was some problem downloading  or maybe some momentary down time  should just catch and retry a couple of times  in my opinion
logcat  https deamon 
this wasn't an issue  per se  as i had not tested or even 'try' to burn dust as fuel in my sessions   however i saw this in my log and figured i would share for you  dust was the only aa item listed in this error list  two others were unrelated mods

indeed  seems fixed today  assuming this was due to bad osm as you pinpointed  thanks  karussell     feel free to close    
 thatslch   no  but i disabled a reasonably big chunk of the mod  here's the config  http   asie pl ae2 644 cfg
originally i observed the problem on a more complex circuit  i have reduced this circuit to its simplest expression to test this problem  there remain only three inputs connected to three outputs with the test vectors file as shown in the figure  i added "not" gates so that the outputs are in error with respect to the vector file  i could also edit the vector file without modifying the schema  this problem arises as well for 1 0 errors as for e or x
the problem is not the compilation stage which invokes gcc  that can be handled with crosstool  it's invoking some intermediate binary compiled by gcc  which need proper ld_library_path to work because of the mismatch of system level gcc and the gcc used to compile the binary  the only way i see is to add rpath during compilation which looks like a hack 
yes i tried without any texture pack  it happens even without optifine 
i add a player to a group temporarily with the command    lp user player parent donor addtemp 30d accumulate   after 15 days i want to increase the time by 30 days in the same group    lp user player parent donor addtemp 30d accumulate   when sending command to check player's parent    lp user player parent info   should return the value of 45 days left  initial 15 plus 30 added 
it works for me as well  sadly only on certain phatloots  some of them don't work  spigot 1 9 4  last phatloots version 
i didn't encounter errors during installation  but i'll try reinstalling everything 
 sanjaypujare oh wow   that worked  thanks very much  i updated  com google protobuf protobuf java util 3 9 2  to   com google protobuf protobuf java util 3 10 0  thanks   
this is old sample i would like to convert using synthool https   github com googlecloudplatform java docs samples blob d50c7d4636fabb0fb13166a4d8caf8556df4f5aa iot api client manager src main java com example cloud iot examples deviceregistryexample java#l784 l806    from the parameter named data  i assume that string data should have went into bytestring copyfromutf8 data 
not yet  other than it does seem to be specific to the makeup of the procedures in the failing script  trying to recreate the problem with anonymous code 
no i don't have any repositories  if i remove the module in tiapp xml it works 
yes i will   might take me a few days ish to detangle this issue from my code base   will get this to you as soon as i can 
we are currently using forge 10 13 4 1492 universal  after turning off android spawning we were able to play for several hours without incident  i transformed myself into an android and spent a good portion of that time as one without incident  although for some reason it wouldn't let me take the damage upgrade  but i was in creative at the time so it may have had something to do with that   i'll let you know if anything else comes up  and thank you for looking into this 
i downloded mods from steam workshop  such as xmax lootplus and stuff  i didnt changed edited anything from the game folder  also there is tqrespec log but it is empty  zero kb 
figured out that setting the colors in the activity cause the problem  i set the colors in the xml it works

ahahahahah  gps was switched on  of course  that was my first verification      anyway  this morning i made some more deep testing going to work    here is what happens     with kalman filter off routing doesn't work  as previously described  and location provider message says  gps  this morning on the first attempt the app crashed  on the second one the position was stuck at starting point as previously described   with kalman filter on routing works  even if it  always  asks to switch on gps even if it's already active      hope this helps you  do you confirm to try the above attached app or do i have to wait for some other modifications  some other random comments     translation of kalman filter toggle should be improved  now italian translation is "legare il movimento"  quite confusing   would it be possible to modify it in "movimento fluido"    speech synthesis is always in english  not a big issue  but it would be nice to have it according to device language   the app keeps on creating a "pocketmaps" folder in the download folder even if map location has been moved to another position  again not a big issue     many thanks  francesco
yes both android usage data and extra usage data are enabled  still nothing 
i found out that restlet does not support odata v4  so that must be the problem  
yep   solved the actionbarsherlock problem  add android_sdk tools to the path to have access to android command 
yes  it does 
yes i do  if that causes the bug then i will gladly delete optifine  on fri  oct 4  2019 at 2 27 pm silentchaos512  notifications github com  wrote

hi  johnscancella   many thanks for the quick response  my d  drive is a partition on a hard disk  i wasn't aware that the zip functionality has problems associated with it so this information is extremely useful as we're using zipped bags to add data into our digital preservation system  archivematica  and i don't believe that our vendor is aware of these issues  if you could elaborate more on them i would be most grateful  or point me to somewhere i can find more information   thanks for the workaround  i will share it with my colleagues

sorry forgot to mention that it works if it is deployed under windows 7 and access from 127 0 01    but if deploy under linux and access from another windows 7  firefox  problem happens  there is no error log displayed on ff console   it happens from the current master back to the the commit made by  davidleoni  maybe even more back but i have not tested more   but for the way of deployment  the following is good   # good   c68c1bb2b11a2c4894c0a7bbb7ec9b048a7367f4  upgrade to clojure 1 5 1   switch to clojure slim jar   #792  i tried some bisect  but the result was confusing  i don't think it's correct  so i won't post here 
attached is a simple test   it includes source code and jar in target subdir   how to perform the test  1  switch simple mode to off in paper ui 2  install binding and create a thing for it in the paper ui       during initialization  thing will create one channel type  called static channel type  spawn a thread and return from initialization         every 10 seconds the thread will create a static channel with random name id  using the type id created during intialization  before that  it will remove the previous static channel  if exists        additionally  the thread will also create a new channel type id called dynamic channel and a dynamic channel  using the just created id  and random name id for channel type and channel   before that  it will remove previous dynamic channel type and channel  if exist        after first creation of the two channels  it will set thing state to online 3  go to thing in the ui and unfold channels  there will be two channels updated every 10 seconds  ui reflects the updates in the channels very well  4  just after the channels are updated  click on the icon to unfold items and click on the plus sign to add a new item to the channel       it will work for static channel  since its channel type was created once during thing initialization       it will not work for dynamic channel  since its channel type was created 10 seconds ago  when ui was already open  it will throw js exception in the browser where it can't find the type in scope   of course  such exact situation will not happen in the reality  but similar one happens   when user works on his her setup and changes remote device configuration  at the same time having browser with paper ui open  the conditions needed to happen here is having browser open when channel type changes  in case of my real binding  this happens  when changing configuration of the remote device  it causes reconfiguration of the thing  if i keep browser open at the same time  i will need to refresh it in order to be able to add items   since channel changes are perfectly dynamically reflected in the ui  i thought it should also work for channel types    org openhab binding test1 tar gz  https   github com eclipse smarthome files 1068876 org openhab binding test1 tar gz   thanks pawel
that's it  after cleaning the cache it worked as expected  this solution apparently was too easy for me      maybe it would be a good idea to prevent these pages from caching as long as it is in beta state  or at least to set short expiry dates  e g  maximum 1 day

i tried the goto station action  to no avail   it was with version 7 0 3   this is more a suggestion then a bug i suppose  it is not an issue when i define a work area 
i'm running 1 3 1 as a chrome extension
 mohamad amin the problem that i've described is that  instead of the   correct    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  string  the code that i've presented prints the   incorrect    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   this is possibile   if and only if   the injected presenter instance is always the first that is created  otherwise it would correctly print  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  if the injection would perform as expected  creating always a new presenter instance  
oddly  ovm doesn't even ask for the location permission  android 7 0   doesn't move either   i don't know how to use logcat but i'll take a look at it  thanks   just wanted to say it's awesome you released this as it means i can finally break free from happycow

updated mycontroller to version 1 2 0 final  rebooting the test node  i get the same behavior on resources logs detail  but a slightly different error message on the server log     this one actually says "properties null" but i have no idea what that means in this context  also  i notice the payload  010003003f03 does not coincide with the resources log where i have  firmware config request  010003004003b7040102 and  firmware config response  010003004003e669     ### server log

it seems that it does work now  the script keeps connected to the correct event without issuing any crashes   however  i found a similar issue with renaming a condition  after renaming a condition  a script using the condition inside an inline event will now reference to a complete different condition  i would suggest to use ids to link conditions to scripts if possible  this may can prevent problems with renaming 
 monsieurtanuki not able to test #849 right now  but the scroll bug occured to me already some time back on several occasions  just now was able to finally track it down  latest use of snapshot a few days ago  above happens without scroll limits set and as far as i can see on any zoom level  though it's rare  you get to the 3x3 grid border on high zoom levels at all   basically it means that you are always imprisoned in this 3x3 map grid illustrated above with only the center middle map working as expected  as soon as you zoom and have been in an edge map  you get to the center middle map again 
the files are mac icon files from a born digital collection that we're processing   apparently  it's  fairly common  http   superuser com a 298798  for their file names to end with  r although from the sample we're looking at  it's not consistent  since it's a problem with the file name and not the content  i've been creating test files through bash   touch "icon m"

i now tried many different shows from different channels in all qualities  i couldn't download any of them   when clicking on the link nothing happens  meaning there is neither an exception nor a download notification  clicking on the share button besides the download button  works without an issue   i'm using the microg version of lineageos  so google services are replaced by open source microg libraries  don't know if this could have something todo with the problem  but i doubt it 
happens with every contact

hi snickermicker   i understand the workaround  the problem is with this items configuration  datetime date   "date and time    1 ta   1 td  1 tm  1 ty  1 tt "   ntp "europe berlin de_de"  knx "11 001 5 1 2  10 001 5 1 1"    the config transmits the time to the knx binding at a set inderval   this results in formatdatetime datetimetype datetype  string dpt  receiving dpt 10 001 with the  line 579  calendar cal datetype getcalendar    calendar instance fully populated  and from this it is supposed to extract and format a timeofday  which according to knx documentation also includes a day of week   when the code then uses 'if  cal get calendar month   2 ' to exclude the day of week formatting  it fails in march in my example since march is month 2   10 001 might not have any date information  but in order to calculate the day of week in formatdatetime for timeofday  there needs to be room for a fully populated calendar instance  hence using the calendar month for flagging 'no day' should maybe reconsidered  if the case was that the calendar never had any date information  then  line 584 return datetype format locale us  " 1 ta   1 tt"   might as well be removed   i might be overlooking something here  so please just consider this my observation and correct me if i am wrong    
the phone has not been changed   after posting my question i realized a possible change that might be affecting the situation  the patient started wearing a garmin vivofit2 ble wrist worn device that has an app installed on the phone  can the phone not handle two bt devices   or is xdrip somehow assuming it will be the only one   when i try to install xdrip+  xdrip plus 20161124 9bf0276 apk  it states "app not installed"   on dec 28  2016 12 22 am  "tzachi dar"  notifications github com  wrote 
 kasper piskorski you should wrap transactions in an auto closable  try     block so that when the test fails  it remembers to close the transaction  this doesn't solve the root cause of this issue  but it helps to not cause other tests to fail due to transaction clashes   i've made this change in my fork  in case this change hasn't got into master by the time you work on this  you can see  and pull it  here  https   github com haikalpribadi grakn blob refactor test integration test graql reasoner atomic query atomicqueryunificationit java

no i do not have antivirus stuff installed  can reproduce the bug consistenly  performance monitor only shows "system" proccess accessing the file   i'm using administrator user profile and i have full control rights to the file  i tried opening full control rights to all users for the file and the folder  and the only thing that did  surprisingly  is deny the deleting of the original  jar file   i think windows won't let you rename the file that is open at the moment  maybe you need to make a small batch or command file to cleanup and run it after updating 
i can't think of any  the sql injection is only  likely to only occur with function arguments  form and url scopes anyway and not all variables anyway  i picked the above because it seem fairly common thing to do   i think another area where it comes up is when setting boolean   int  values like so    cfif somevalue 1 cfelse 0  cfif

from my understanding of what those users reported it does not seem to reappear after restart but only the next refresh after restart solved the problem  for now i asked for a complete list of the custom settings to find out if it is perhaps related to a special combination of settings  debug log will be difficult  due to the fact that the used devices are all  4 1

hi  i did debug and it seems that in the "taxserviceimpl" class  the "zone" value is never allocated  the different conditions  if        else if       etc   are never verified  the exception occurs at the line   taxrates   taxrateservice listbycountryzoneandtaxclass country  zone  taxclasses get taxclassid   store  language    i replaced this line by the previous one in a previous condition  just for test   taxrates   taxrateservice listbycountrystateprovinceandtaxclass country  stateprovince  taxclasses get taxclassid   store  language    and the program pass through without throwing the nullpointerexception                           i was suprised that none of the condition was satisfied  e g   if taxbasiscalculation name   equals taxbasiscalculation shippingaddress           i changed it to  if taxbasiscalculation name   equals taxbasiscalculation shippingaddress tostring          and the condition was satisfied     but ther should be something else bad  because the even with that the "taxrates   taxrateservice listbycountryzoneandtaxclas     " continues to thow exception      your help will be appreciate 
i found it on 3 0 1  master branch still has same issue 
 cweitkamp  yes  sure  the issue is not with the host definition   this is the docker container external port  the issue is the internal side of the container where openhab   the bindings are running  basically you need two parameters to be able to resolve this  the one for the host that indicates other external devices how to contact openhab and the internal for the binding that indicates the binding how to access the container internally  you may want to look at the most current version of the homematic binding  they had a similar issue and resolved it by adding the internal parameter and the behavior indicated in my resolution proposal

 martinlippert sorry  this problem has not been solved  the most intuitive feeling i get from performance problems is that they are caused by compilation  win10 processes often go into a state of suspended animation   which may only need to solve the compilation problems introduced by java9 modules  perhaps it was a compilation problem  and i was also in a state of suspended animation when i used the prompt in the springboot project application yml file i apologize for not being able to provide a sample project for this 
i'm still using 1 3 3 because i have to generate the bottom navigation items dynamically instead of through resources  this means i also don't have a tab xml file  because this wasn't introduced back with my version

i suggest to replace jpa entities with annotated entity classes  or the other way around   this will simplify development and get rid of a lot of issues related to subtle differences in implementations

hello  the version is v1 3 6 when i installed it for the first time last week  after you replied my answer  i reinstall the plugin with the version v1 4 0 again and then i found the same problem again 
thanks for the quick reply   it's a work project  and it has happened on two unrelated projects   let me see if i can get a minimal working reproduction

yes i upgraded to 1 1 1 and it worked fine
side note   apparently  https   github com dokan dev dokany releases tag v1 2 1 2000  the dokany library can return the version number  so perhaps cryptomator could display it under its own version number    dokan1 sys  is at  1 2 0 1000  and hence outdated  i assume that this is the version that got installed alongside cryptomator  1 4 15   which required a reboot by the way  so plausibly dokany was updated then  however  cryptomator's  dokan1 dll  is at  1 3 0 1000   so weirdly that one is up to date   i uninstalled everything  dokany + cryptomator  of which there were two entries in the control panel   restarted as dokany asked for  installed cryptomator  1 4 15   which now installed dokany  1 3 1000   so i don't really understand how i ended up with  1 2 1000  yesterday despite having to reboot yesterday too   with the newer dokany version  the   issue is resolved    thanks  so i guess if anything  the remaining question is how to get dokany to update properly along with cryptomator

it is very desirable to allow multiple loads to support components that must consume messages from multiple schemas   that is why we are using otf decoder in that case  so we don't need to deploy multiple sets of generated code   it would seem that header would always have to be the same for otf to work  in summary  i think it is okay to only store one header  but just don't leak when the same header definition is loaded from multiple files

yes   pulquero i can use constructors instead   indeed  it appears that i should  i remain puzzled that a single instantiation  one triple in the sparql update query above  could results in a wildly variable number of rule executions    i re ran the experiment this morning and got hundreds of time stamps  screen capture below      it seems as though my rule is in some sort of loop and reaches some sort of limit  probably resource driven   i'm curious as to what the source of the loop is   could it be as simple as adding the first time stamp generates another run of the rules because it alters this instance  and that subsequent time stamps likewise generate subsequent rule runs   i guess my question then is  what prevents any rule that alters the state of the instance from running repeatedly   i'm not seeing this behavior when i'm running rules that generate error messages  but the error messages  datatype properties  are the same from run to run whereas the timestamp is not   hmmm  maybe i do have multiple instances of the datatype property  but the workbench filters them out as in select distinct making it appear that i don't have duplicates   that's probably it     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 20132242 16847104 ee605d36 49b4 11e6 8efd d51653942140 png

the project type is maven  we were able to make it work on another javac project by manually specifying the jars  but so far have been unsuccessful with maven projects  i tried the sample maven project in order to see if it was something wrong with my project or with the overall setup  since the issue occurs in the sample project this points to either a system setup issue or an issue in codenvy    the issue seems to be isolated to the ide classpath  since we set the project to type maven  we cannot edit the classpath  the buttons are disabled in the popup window  shown under project  configure classpath  maven downloads the defined jars into    m2 repository  directory  i am not sure how codenvy resolves this directory  another interesting thing we have noticed is that dependencies defined in maven do not get resolved however java utility classes like java util date are correctly resolved by the ide  you can see this on line 8 in the included screenshot     correctlyresolve  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10276740 16619176 1418e90e 435b 11e6 962f eb8f370d4599 png    classpath  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10276740 16619179 17033494 435b 11e6 868d 1a253871faf0 png

dear ron  1  same windows 7 build as you 2  i'm actually using the french  canada  keyboard  i see the same expected behavior as you  press twice to have the "hat" accent in french  in any other application  but rstudio ide    actually  i found that the bug is happening more cleanly when i switched from english to french keyboard   1  using windows language bar  i've mapped the sequence "ctrl + 1" to get english keyboard  and "ctrl + 2" to get french  canada  keyboard  quick way to change between language when programming   2  the freeze happened systematically when i pressed the "hat" key after switching from english to french keyboard using the ctrl keys  3  if i switched between keyboards using the mouse  there is no freeze when typing the hat key   i've downgraded to rstudio 1 1 463 and everything working as expected  there is no interference between switching keyboard using ctrl keys and the hat key   thanks for your help   hans

interestingly it also works for me on my local environment     the example error logs in my original post were taken from the same application deployed on the same ec2 instance with no known configuration changes  the only difference in the deployed versions of the application code was to upgrade spring boot version and add the 'logging path  ' property  this upgrade has jumped me from embedded tomcat 7 0 56 to 8 0 15 so not sure whether that could have anything to do with it   
unfortunately the same thing happens with versions 1 1  and 1 2 of javacv and javacpp  is working correctly on version 1 0 and windows 7   in the rest of cases is not finding at runtime the proper class 
it's almost like the cpu is being bogged down at consistent intervals  so if a video is playing the video playback will stutter slightly and resume  audio is not affected  same thing with gifs  in which they will stutter slightly  i'll test it tomorrow and give you the timing  the problem is solved by ending the program with task manager

yeah  i know what you mean  chat events tend to get a bit messy when you have formatters and filters all listening and acting on them  in my case   chatcontrol  https   www spigotmc org resources chatcontrol 271   is the main incompatibility  i have to set its "formatter" listener priority to "monitor" in the config  which then breaks my punishment plugin's mute command   edit  scratch the mute thing  that seems to have broken with a recent update of chatcontrol     
thankyou
 fviale yes  something similar was used     however  i think it's more a workaround since the same configuration  i mean number of pa nodes and tasks submitted  but a different sleep timeout value in task code  reduced to 25 seconds  does not make exceed the default limit  this last observation let me think it is more an application problem than a system configuration issue 
perhaps anvil damage would have been a better term  but i was referring to how using an anvil has a chance to turn it into a chipped anvil  then damaged anvil  then being completely destroyed 
never mind it's just some albums that i downloaded recently and that put a   between each artist name   but the issue is real  i rebuild my entire library and it's the same on the nightly    yes it work perfectly  it's only on the other views

i've created a minimal demo project that reproduces this issue   https   github com sudr restdocs demo  it's configured for the html backend and works as expected  you can switch it to the pdf backend on line 33 in the pom xml and validate that the request and response snippets aren't rendered in the generated pdf 
okay  edited the issue to actually write what you want  the plugin fail to load on startup  so then i tried to plugman enable discordmc and it gave a class not found error  but no matter how many times i try to fully restart the server  the plugin won't load

hi no  you missunderstood my version statement  i have tested different versions of the osm droid library to find out when the bug has been introduced  the npe has nothing to do with the ide version  since it is caused by dereferencing an null variable inside mapview   i have not tested with different api levels  but i can not imagine that this is the reason

i have just build the qksms 3 and i noticed that the design changed and the search works differently  no need to go back to the parent anymore   however  i have also noticed that the keyboard newer closes if i switch from chat list view to new chat view and vise versa  the keyboard is always there  is that expected behavior  it looks like you want the keyboard to be always visible in the chat list view and the search onfocus  but when i decide to close the keyboard than switch the views the keyboard is there again  not sure if that's a bug or something you have consciously decided to implement 
here you go

sorry  bad click on file upload 
i did not look how the library use the reference  but i looked where the information is lost   when a new  java lang url  is created  the constructor does all the parsing job  then a  java net urlstreamhandler  is called to finish the parsing  the reference part is properly parsed by the url    when we start a spring boot application with the  spring boot loader   the  org springframework boot loader  is registered as  java protocol handler pkgs  and   org springframework boot loader jar handler  is used as urlstreamhandler  but this handler does not use all parsed information of the url  source  https   github com spring projects spring boot blob da550efc6ba8cce601e2ce34432d1224184a2477 spring boot project spring boot tools spring boot loader src main java org springframework boot loader jar handler java#l214      the reference information is available in the  context  object but the method always set a  null  value   i don't know if this behavior is voluntary or if it's mistake 
well  the root cause is that in the mysql jdbc preparedstatement settimestampinternal method  there is a checking  this serversupportsfracsecs   which is to detect  the current connection agains the mysql's version   but when connect to the sharding proxy  the response of the checking detectfractionalsecondssupport is false   and btw  my mysql server is 5 7 25 version and the jdbc driver is 5 1 43        below is the code in the mysql driver preparedstatement for your reference

 efraespada  thankyou for your help  but i still cannot test 0 8 version  i get gradle sync error   "could not find com stringcare plugin 0 8" version 0 6 or 0 7 have no gradle sync error  only v0 8 show me error log   about fingerprint  i understand difference between app and library  if i use same signature for app   lib  then fingerprint also same  right  i will manage that carefully 
 blfrantz indeed  this is a specific issue in sql  if you used an sql query in canvas in your test and still see the issue  it's very likely that you are using a version of elasticsearch that doesn't have the fix  the version labels in this github issue as well as the versions mentioned in my latest comment should be ones that will have the fix 
i'm playing around with oc now  but i'm not at the level to control the reactor  so i did not tried the computer yet  but i'm glad that the computer port works with oc

 sobychacko a basic app with a single binding should do the trick  we're using spring boot  2 0 5 release  and  2 0 1 release  of  spring cloud stream   to reproduce we've configured the application to connect to a local kafka instance  after booting the app with the kafka stopped  producer creation will eventually fail with the following exception      we were expecting this to be reflected in actuator but it's still reporting the binder as "up"  an app with just a consumer    enablebinding sink  class    and no available kafka seems to constantly attempt to connect to the broker while also reporting as "up" 
i'm not sure about it as it's not happening to me  i'll post additional information if i get any 
hi  laxersaz   sorry for not replying back sooner   work got busy   i investigated a bit more and the issue isn't browser specific  it occurs in all browsers   the issue occurs only when there is a data table at the step level       below scenario will not render graph because there is a data table at step level   
please ignore my comment regarding  onapplicationready    i checked it again and it works well   regarding   postconstruct   i disagree that this is consistent behaviour  developers expect that once a bean is initialized  all its dependent beans are initialized  flyway is not a piece of application code   it is an infrastructure tool that helps initialize the database   i don't see a use case where you want to use the _old_ schema version in a   postconstruct  and then have flyway run and change your schema

android 7 0 can you reproduce this crash 
sure  is there any way to share it privately to you 
 jpountz i've tried to reproduce on my environment and it didn't happen anymore  the only difference was that i updated from alpha 2 to aplha3 using rpm  i've tried to do it again but the error didn't happen  i'll close  thanks 
 anajosep can you help with server logs 
sure   here you go 
well not for me
version 2 9 0 140 it doesn't happen often  it is probably a kind of race condition bug between input and search 
here's a logcat from when i launched the application   http   pastebin com 0zvwx7pu  i tried launching the app without having an internet connection  and it crashes instantly  that should be much easier to reproduce

below is the code to reproduce the problem   please kindly check 
decouple means that validity for a platform shouldn't be checked on data entry but only before upload  right  if so  either    the upload button should be greyed out and the message in red below or   the message should appear in a popup when pressing "upload"
this was tested in single player originally so it doesn't seem to be a desync issue  just ran a test on our server  which is running the 1 11 2 version  and confirmed the behavior in that environment also 
sure i can do better this is maven project i reproduces  this bug   https   www dropbox com s 2q3ynvz8f7wog1h bug_tab_tabris_1 4 zip

i cannot reproduce it either on the latest version  closing  and if anybody find this issue  we will reopen

i think we probably want to make the load balancing strategies pluggable  i’m generally not into pluggable things  why not just include a good implementation in the box   but in this case i think being pluggable gives us options we can’t build otherwise   one strategy i really like is from what grpc calls an external load balancer  https   grpc io grpc core md_doc_load balancing html https   grpc io blog loadbalancing
  the repetition of a bug  permit priorisation of a redundant detected bug    _correspond to number of testcase where the same bug id has been created on the corresponding tag execution _      yes  that what i had in mind  "testcases affected" would be a clearer title for user understanding      i have in mind the fact that bugid are open to the testcaselevel  but it seemed to me that it was more precise to open a bug at the execution level because the  country robot combinaison could impact the execution   but in reality  this is maybe too specific to my organisation and some users do not use countries in cerberus  so yes  link the testcase associated should be the better solution       if  noko fa    then no bug reported      the collapse could be close like screen attached  user will be aware of the feature  but it would not disburb users  what do you think      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 29098010 32368318 afe149dc c085 11e7 8399 17ea16fa7cde png   here is the new mock up        buglist  https   user images githubusercontent com 29098010 32370121 3813c4e6 c08c 11e7 8c23 f2497a816a87 jpg

to get an idea of what can be put there  look at what you can extract  get type extra   that covers the primitive types  strings  parcelable data  the android equivalent of serializable   arraylists of such types  etc

sure  logging already on  and i'm going to send you the logfile as soon as i record two uploads of the same file again   edit  i have just manually uploaded five older files  separately  one at a time  and they all are there just once  but the the last one automatically uploaded five hours ago when i came home from work  20161213153311 gpx  got uploaded again        the issue is probably related to opening and closing the app  does it do some sort of file check upon start and upload files that have not yet been uploaded  maybe sometimes it "forgets" the upload status of a file  well    let's wait for the logfile    
hard to say  if it's something that'll show up after 2 3 weeks of usage it seems like it could be a p0   could be related to the same kinda thing that qe reported   the result of the timeout is that the ui displays a big error instead of integrations

to my understanding it's just a matter of timing   anyway  it would be great if you could remove all of the null item state assertions  it's not a feature of the handler to set them to null in case of an error  so it is consistent to also not check for it in a test case which targets the handler   thanks for taking care of it

thanks for your answers   i've tried to build 1 6 1 from sources without success  problems with my competence on ant  but i've remarked that from 1 6 to head  sole maven plugin and doc have changed not the jflex jar lib   as a result  i give you all the materials i can   here is a simple test snippet  the input tested is a valid ada program from acats  
at least the bluemana 1  part is a call to a method that returns a mana object  https   github com magefree mage blob master mage src mage mana java names were defined a long time ago and they are ok in my opinion 
yes  this happens on one device and on the other device first it would not even open the camera  i fixed that  #96    but  it still crashes in the newcontentactivity
okay  i dug further into this and it's definitely a mod interaction bug   specifically  enderio dark armor is using the gadgets in inventory as a battery   same symptom   the gadget drains while walking around  assuming you're wearing the armor    but totally different cause     i believe you can prevent this by making   ienergystorage extractenergy     https   github com direwolf20 mc buildinggadgets blob 6a11e1d0f7f6c47dcd49c2f2e958bfa6aa43dd30 src main java com direwolf20 buildinggadgets common items capability itemenergyforge java#l31  always return 0   sorry for the confusion   that's what i get for investigating player issues at 2 30am

hi saudet   sorry for my incomprehensible question  the problem is when i used typedef like this     there is an error when i compile    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10292378 9294710 9ca96858 4455 11e5 9755 ac47ac7983e6 png  which tells that javacpp  cannot convert from vector_p_double to std  vector double   std  allocator _ty       it seems that javacpp does not understand the new type vector_p_double defined by the typedef command   without using  typedef std  vector double          vector_p_double    or more exactly using directly  std  vector double    it works fine like in https   github com bytedeco javacpp issues 22  so the question is how could i use  typedef std  vector double          vector_p_double    hope that you understand my question now   thank you for your help  thanh liem

 hbf  i have sent you a mail on  kf iaeth ch dated october 29  2013 with a sample file which was giving me segmentation fault  can you try to run it on your machine and see whether problem replicate on your machine   though you might need rbox to generate points 
i updated the error report  it happens at a random time  there is no such problem on my device   there is such a problem and i sent it for you to see  there is no serious problem right now  i noticed it through firebase crashlytics 
the main use case is for testing   i have a set of jersey test tests that will call the service which takes the json patch   my tests currently use maps to construct the json diff request   it would be nice if the tests could construct the json patch objects 
yes forcing doesn't really change anything  something odd going on    i eventually manage to open things and create a project to work on but sometimes it requires several attempts of closing the software and opening it again   bit random  i've tried the same files on 0 2 0 m2 and m3  this happens only in m3   regarding the projects  would it not be possible for qupath to create some sort of temporary project automatically when it requires it  which would be deleted if the image gets closed 
thank you  sorry i didn't find the original issue 
all connection normal 
so  after a restart the mediator sees the state as open which is what i would have expected  i only closed bob's ticket so it is probably a ui bug somewhere where it marked both rows as closed even though only alice's should have been closed   i've updated the description to make it more clear what actions i took 
apologizes for the late reply  for some reason  i wasn't notified by email about your messages   i'm afraid the problem remains using jabref 5 0 dev  snapshot  2019 07 15  master  e89d60370 jar   my locales are in french

sorry   zacblanco  i could not find a template  there is no pinned issue showing a template nor could i find an example under https   docs alluxio io os user stable en contributor contributor getting started html    alluxio version    2 0    describe the bug   in file  alluxio_home bin alluxio in line 83 the call ps  aww fails because busybox doesn't know the 'w' flag  busybox is used when the environment is alpine  docker image      additional context   i suggest using pgrep instead of parsing the output of ps like this   replace   for pid in   ps  aww  o pid command   grep  i " j ava"   grep   keyword    awk ' print  1 '   do   with   for pid in   pgrep  f " j ava   keyword"   do     portability of ps   1  if you're providing dockerhub with your own base image you do not have to be portable  the complete idea behind docker is to not rely on the availability of certain tools or certain versions of tools  when writing a dockerfile you are 100  in charge of the environment and it  the container  will run  almost  everywhere  you don't have to care about the difference between gnu  unix  busybox  mac  wintendo  etc   long story short  for your docker image it is irrelevant what is installed on some computer somehere in the world   2  you are right  there are still a lot of local installations and "on premise" installations  you want to use the "least common denominator" between all relevant platforms  but that would not be bash  it should be sh  and as you pointed out  the   w  flag is not part of the unix specification of  ps   and then you have gnu and gnu is not unix     but gnu is a more popular than unix  so why stick with the unix specification  and what about windows  there are a lot more windows installations  why not stick with microsoft's wsl then   you got the picture…  3  it is always a bad idea to parse cli tools which are intended to print out human readable stuff like  ls   use  stat  or  find  instead    ps   use  pgrep  and or  pkill  or pid files    free   etc   because these tools are formatting the output according to the values they print  e g  count the whitespaces in  ls  l  output for different directories     4  disclaimer  i'm  not  here to start a flame war  its your choice completely how to fix the  ps  aww  issue  i don't want to change the way you write code or anything  i don't want to offend you in any way  the points above are just remarks  nothing more  please feel free to not comment everything of my way too long text  i'm sure that your fix  whatever it is  will work just fine

unfortunately i can't get the nightly build version running  tested 2303   i get a fc as soon as i click on any button  only "about" is working  i saw you have done a lot of good work  but i can't enjoy it    android 1 6   is it known or should i raise another issue for that   back to c geo ver  04 01 2012

in latest  16 02 2012  available on market and i also tried latest nightly  21 03 2012  and had the same behaviour  not visible on stored list if it was stored on ealier version  as searching storing opencaching pl cache in latest nigthly seems to be broken   
correct  the rest of the settings in the index template are applied successfully  and most days the field limit is as well   i did output all the index templates and go through them  this is the only one that applies to logstash  
all 3 of those options sound good     a  very poor  example of the implementation in the configuration file   
i agree with you something strange happened  i will investigate this deeply later  maybe we are in the case we have an ongoing handshake with read epoch   1  just after the change cipher spec  and so no established session     so we have an ongoing handshake bu read epoch is not equal to record epoch   but in all case  i think this code should be as robust as possible  and any client_hello with epoch  0 should restart an handshake  this will avoid any blocking state 
i can not even assign a name to a flow  not sure if it is what we wanted

hi  renyuneyun the application is the  sms backup +  application  and the intent is the action that triggers a backup   note that the "run commands" profile "am broadcast  a com zegoggles smssync backup" makes the job  while the "send broadcast" with the corresponding parameters does nothing at all  this makes me think that the problem is in easer and not the other app  since a command is able to run the intent  but i may have missed some mechanisms  please tell me if i can be of any help

thank you dadoonet   that is correct at the moment i don't have any instances running in the second zone  this is my current setup    the problem is that when a second zone is added to the configuration file the communication between the nodes is terminated  i'm using autoscaling so depending on traffic i may need a new node on a different zone or if traffic is low the nodes in a certain zone can be shutdown leaving that zone empty

i was looking into and can propose two solution  if you like any of them please let me know i will write the code  unit tests and create pull request    the fix could be implemented in   org mockito internal creation cglibclassimposterizer   class     my first suggestion is to try again class creation in catch block using different class loader    when creation of requested class fails  code could try again using class loader of the requested type  so something like     i investigated other possibility  searchingclassloader   but unfortunately i don't see solution using it  the problem is creation of searchingclassloader already causes the access issues and defineclass is final in java    if it wouldn't we could pass the call to parent and everything would be working   to be fair i think the proper solution should be implemented in cglib library   they should not use reflection to hack the defineclass in my opinion they should ask for class creation interface  where we could simply proxy our call to different class loaders  defineclass is protected     but i guess noone expended those can of issues at the point of library creation      what do you think about it  is any of my solution viable  or would you like me to try something else

i haven't reported it to cofh yet but plan to  i wanted to get some more screen shots and see if i can do a screen capture video of it  what i am seeing is two behaviors one  a redstone block is broken by the quarry and red liquid comes out and spreads and stays and continues to spread until the source block is filled or picked up with a bucket  the other is i break a redstone ore block with a pick  red liquid comes out and quickly drains away leaving the ore pieces  it's no big deal and to be honest the only reason i have the mod is because it was one of the recommended mods to be able to use the bc tank mod

in other word  if i click superlike button some times eg：12 times  quickly and in a short time  the cardstackview would swipe to top direction  this is not the bug   but when i raise up my finger  the cardstackview cannot stop immediately and still swipe to top some time more this is the bug i find     this is only in ver 2 1 0  not find in ver 2 0 0

actually  ignoring of sitemaps plays wery well  so stopping happens immideately  i guess the issue may be when such gigants  as g  or y  appears in the crawling list  they have huge xml maps  and parsing them is an issue itself   you may create a kind of recommendation for collector's users to 'reject at url filters section' very big and popular sites  if there is no actual need in crawling it 
just for the record  our workaround was to extend the "ref" and the "on" references to generate a unique id to each listener on the js side and manage the callbacks inside our application  the problem was that every callback function had the same id  so we included a generated hash on the prototype of the function  allowing the firestack to know which listener to detach on the "off" call

in the underground structure that looks like that included photo  if you use the block breaker from actually additions to break the respawning ore block it will collect the ore into the actually additions block breaker inventory and it still drops the same ore onto the ground  so you get 2x the amount from the structure  not sure if that is sufficiently explained now  maybe dupe bug is the wrong term

helllo  bclozel  thank you for the reaction   in our team  we provided our own custom  requestedcontenttyperesolver  for  requestmappinghandlermapping  to convert our own accept header and content type header   this is because the accept header controls versioning    usually  handlermapping is executed in the following order   1   webfluxendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver   2   controllerendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver   3   requestmappinghandlermapping   customrequestedcontenttyperesolver   the value of mediatypesattribute cached by  headercontenttyperesolver  of  webfluxendpointhandlermapping  is cleared when  controllerendpointhandlermapping  ends   however  for some reason  our team executed handlermapping in the following order   i am aware that this is a rare case    1   webfluxendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver   2   requestmappinghandlermapping   customrequestedcontenttyperesolver  3   controllerendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver    in this case  the mediatypesattribute value cached by the  headercontenttyperesolver  of  webfluxendpointhandlermapping  is inherited by  requestmappinghandlermapping  without being cleared  therefore  we can no longer resolve the mediatypesattribute with the customrequestedcontenttyperesolver   manipulating the handlermapping order can solve the above problem  however  if   webfluxendpointhandlermapping  alone can clear the value of mediatypesattribute  can the value of mediatypesattribute be handled without depending on the order of handlermapping   what do you think

yes  but i think this has nothing to do with my issue  it's supposed to solve the problem when _children_ views are catching the events  not _parent_ views  ie  drawer layout in my case    i am thinking that if there was a getparent   requestdisallowintercepttouchevent true  somewhere in the ontouchevent code  eg  after we make sure the listview should handle the event   it might work   ps  i just got your reply through ajax while writing this and i see what you mean about usability  i have already implemented list item removal through a popupmenu  the swipe functionality will be a bonus eye candy    
jade is a typo  supposed to be "jadx"  i learned about this bug due to the following situation  i had classes in the same package  one is called z and one is called z  only difference is lower upper case   when running jadx decompiler  not jadx gui  on the apk file on a case insensitive file system  i found out that only the file z java exists  and it holds the content that the file z java should have held  i tried to do the same thing using a case sensitive file system  and found out that neither of the files exist in the package  instead appeared files calle c001 java and c002 java  when i opened the files there was a comment at the beggining      renamed from  package name  z  reason  case insensitive file system      the only way i could make jadx decompile the apk successfully is to run it on a case insensitive system  but have the output folder be mounted on a case sensitive volume

yes  as long as i move around the stuttering is pretty much constant and occasionally you can hear the sound cackling or popping 
there are several ways of making it noticable    spawn a block and notice that it is way too small    connecting blocks  making the arguments change text and thus length   carefully move the knot to the point  frame  where its index changes and the arguments aswell  in most cases the arguments are now larger then the block   but if you keep moving it resizes sort of correctly again  this one is really precise     everything where the total argument length suddenly changes 
actually the protocol is in swift  but this also happened in obj c     actually  now i see that in the myapi protocol i have methods with no parameters that are working  the difference is that i don't specify the selector there 
hi  roytmana  thanks a lot for your feedback    what you called "scrambled highlighting" has been solved     i wonder if you are seeing a regression or a problem that's always been there  sounds weird that you say the difference is dramatic but you can't reproduce it  it might depend either on your queries or your analysis chain  would be great if you can open another issue with some examples of what doesn't work 
hi  remkop    i just did it and now the options appear as expected  great work 
no they are different  when i remove an item from a recyclerview the method of convert called then the gifdrawable set to gifimageview again and gif stopped when i  postdelayed set  gifdrawable set to gifimageview it works
this is what i used in the test case 
i guess it depends on the beans the user creates  i guess my question is  should atlas be dependent on a user created  resttemplate  
an error occurred while switching the database
hmm i don't remember how we fixed it   i think we worked it around at the time by using the index of the elements   i'm seeing this kind of issues on 'block   trackers' switch in new privacy   security submenu as well     uiobject blockanalytictrackerentry   testhelper settingslist getchild new uiselector                    classname "android widget linearlayout"                   instance 2      and           uiobject blocksocialtrackerentry   testhelper settingslist getchild new uiselector                    classname "android widget linearlayout"                   instance 3      refers to same element  analytic tracker switch   although uiautomatorviewer says the latter one points to the social tracker block switch  i have to change the  instance   index to  4 from 3 to toggle the social tracker   really a mystery

ms sql server 2014 and 2016 produce this error  prepending the table promptly shows the correct results  but directly typing the field name will only display table names in another table specified out of this subquery  i e  out of scope 
the above code change fixed the issue for me  i have to first ask to for approval before i get contribute a fix  same as for the other issue  once i have that i can create a fork and fix it unless you don't just want a diff 
i'll give it a try  setting up an empty server with fe as the only mod

normally i don't have any problems with using iex pry though not all parts are as easy to debug because of the supervisors  but even if i disable the entire supervisor tree in the start function it gives those errors  it looks like when it's trying to  int ni all the modules in the project   and that is probably also causing another problem when i increase the ets tables limit and succeed starting it  because everything is bound in the debugger including the libraries it slows down the project so much i get problems with our supervisors timing out  though with increasing the timeouts i can get the project to work with the debugger though startup takes about 50 seconds on the first request    when i manually use the  int ni i don't have that problem but it's probably because everything is being debugged now

my idea for a change is two fold  1  add a 'forcepull' option  default false  if true  ignore isclean and discard any local changes  take from remote  2  add a logger warn statement that triggers if local repo goes dirty  this log statement could include details about which files are dirty 
 boaks i don't think i need to check the alert message after the exception has been serialized  so for me it won't be needed  but maybe others want to check the alert message even after it has been serialized  is there any reason not to serialize the alert message as well

i am not sure   i have seen it while posting it and my guess was  that i was near to the cache but without gps fix so it would be the shadowed circle around my position changing the colors  i will have a look if this could be the cause by comparing

that was also my thinking  but i tried it with only gc com active and it still shows the same thing  i force stopped c geo and restarted it and the log looks exactly like above  then i activated ec com  alone and in combination with gc com  and can see the same behaviour also for ec com  the requests are also send twice  
forge forgeessentials  there's no error in the console from what i see but i'll search the logs properly in just a moment   the database was new over the weekend  i can get a copy if you think it might help  it's the only one on there so it's not like there's something else trying to use mysql or anything

thanks for the quick response   the thing is i love mucommander  and trying to make it fit my needs   where is the jira page  clicking "report a bug" from mucommander  nightly build  leads to  this broken page  http   www mucommander com bugs   which redirects to the broken trac subdomain   i encountered several issues  not sure if bugs or misuse on my part  like    i was unable to make anything in commands xml work  for example i tried making f4 open sublime text as editor with many variations on this line   command alias "edit" value "c  program  files sublime  text  2 sublime_text exe  f" type "system"      on my windows machine  right clicking a file has "open with" which is always grayed out  wanted to know how to add commands to this submenu   sftp does not work for me  using a passphrase protected private key  i am easily able to login using another client  winscp  but with mucommander i get invalid credentials    wanted to read a little more about commands xml in order to add more commands to it  since mucommander suppresses the native windows right click menu    for example  wanted to add  ctrl+shift+v   send to virustotal   and  ctrl+d   dos prompt here    wanted to suggest to add a "cut" operation on a file in addition to copy and move   wanted to suggest a preferences setting to suppress the move dialog  always move to the other panel     wanted to suggest a "duplicate file" operation  or even better  simply allow  ctrl+c then ctrl+v  and paste the file as  original name   copy  or  original name  1   or similar  right now  copy then paste results in an error dialog   and some more      footnote    for now  i have solved the hotkeys   commands xml problems i have above by simply writing a autohotkey script that overrides the commands i want   so f4 sends alt+shift+c to mucommander to copy the selected file path  and then i handle it in autohotkey

can't test right now  but from how i read the code it doesn't make any difference besides that it isn't getting less blocks to harvest  https   github com crazypants enderio blob master src main java crazypants enderio machine farm farmers treeharvestutil java#l71 i assume whenever there is a big tightly forest with a farming station it is taking ages as it goes through all blocks inside the region   what about this   instead of calling the harvestup again the block gets added to a list  one per machine   than on every tick one or multiple entries of this list get send to harvestup   or you put in a safety cut that does stop after +n runs per machine during one tick

i am sorry that i reply so late  this phenomenon does not only occur in time_12  it also happens in the repair process of math_85  the buggy program from defects4j  i am not sure but personally i think that math_85 is fully deterministic   the details are as follow  i set the   maxtimetype as 30 seconds  it is originally 5 minutes but i think it is kind of long so i set this to 30 seconds   however  the it costs more than twice the 30 seconds to repair the faulty statement  and unexpectedly  it doesn't generate plausible patch when repair the faulty statement    the output information is as follow   "the repaired suspicious statement  org apache commons math analysis solvers univariaterealsolverutils   198 suspiciousvalue  0 058823529411764705 the repair time for this statement is  64688ms"  another failed repair output is   "the repaired suspicious statement  org apache commons math analysis solvers univariaterealsolverutils   198 suspiciousvalue  0 058823529411764705 the repair time for this statement is  19794ms"  the repair time is less than 30s in this case   but these failed repair trails  where nopol repair the faulty statement but do not generate the expected patch  just account for a very small percentage  for instance 2 out of 100 in math_85   so this strange phenomenon about the nopol repair still puzzles me  can these failed trails be interpreted as a small bug of nopol   thank you for your answer and guidance

 gunterze  the problem still seems to persist when accessed from a private window  the specific installation i'm currently working with is running on a vagrant vm  but i've also experienced the issue with installations not running on vms  for the time being  i've still just gone through all web applications and removed the property  which seems to work     screenshot from 2020 03 03 08 15 26  https   user images githubusercontent com 28839674 75751657 4a4eb000 5d27 11ea 8735 6de5cf950da3 png

apologies  i wasn't clear  in the example code i sent  the lunch break is given a small  20 minute  window in which it can be "delivered"  this would  at least i think  make it more likely that routes are generated with the lunch break unassigned  thus causing the cost penalty override to be applied  you could give the lunch break a wider window in which it can be taken and the problem still occurs  though   in practical terms  it is more important to insert a break than a job for legal compliance  the cost of a break not being in the route should be  and i think is in the current code  disproportionately high   with the random component to the problem appearing  i'm trying to identify "special" measures the code takes which then gives the break location an identity  in localactivityinsertioncostscalculator  you appear to have initially added some provision for breaks being handled differently  perhaps you had something in mind here as a problem

i'm looking at andlytics src com github andlyticsproject console v2 accountmanagerauthenticator java which seems to use the ubertoken method described in  http   nelenkov blogspot se 2012 11 sso using account manager html  excellent blog post btw   that blogpost mentions under 1  in "logging in using accountmanager" that the first step is to get a clientlogin token   if it's not a clientlogin token  what token is it used to pass to issueauthtoken 
in the console i obtain this error  warn    file g  doc_01 test preforma manuals 100 thumbs db is not an accepted format  as i checked it happens when i check with 100 or 1000 files 
that is  strange     the log that was on minecraft launcher when the game crashed showed something about vengeance spirit  the only thing i can recover from it is the following    i will make sure to update the report if it happens again 
yes i tried    refresh dependencies    classpath "org junit platform junit platform gradle plugin 1 0 0 snapshot" 
docker is on 184  sorry  i've copied the wrong curl line for you  i've edited now  i have changed the real ip to a fake one  but i'm curl'ing the right ip  hehe
i'm not sure if i understand what you mean  if you just use the current demo for cards  https   gwtbootstrap3 github io gwtbootstrap3 demo #card  in firefox  you'll see the issue i'm referring to here  i confirmed that it's not something on the recent version of firefox and went as far back as firefox 31  does that make sense 
 ryanjbaxter sure  is there a  snapshot   version of spring cloud gateway that is already using that  if not  how can i override the spring cloud version 
yes  i feel so stupid now  i didnt know that could cause the problem my bad  i turned it off and the problem is gone  thank you 
i added pe to material energy 4  standing near my minechem stuff and i think i was opening the transmutation tablet   i'm thinking back and there were a couple other crashes   a ticking memory error but that might just be my comp and a java lang indexoutofboundsexception that made no mention of any modish things   i'll add them in case they help  http   pastebin com 8mv8taaa http   pastebin com qrxjivcx  i think i updated fluxed crystals somewhere in there to see if that was the problem   there was also an odd instance where the redmatter hammer seemed to have vein mined a hunk of the loaded ae mining aria  mining the coal  redstone  lapis  ores  everything but the stone  and then it lagged out when picking up the matterballs

focus navigation with remote control is kinda weird  as sometimes is not clear where the focus is and what the next action will be  as far as i recall it happened in all categories  including while navigating in detail view  when the focus is supposedly at the mid level  items list   btw  for using serenity in an android box  do you suggest to use the standard or the tv ui option   as per the app settings 
well  i guess this would be enough 
because of this in assemly xml    the filename mismatch   and this is also error prone  python discards the ' ' from the name so we're stuck here to 1 1rc58 
can't use that beta as library  since it's obfuscated       runs off to get bon working   heh  i could just set this up properly too    instead of the lazy way 
 colintheshots yes  sorry  should've mentioned that the list of apps doesn't pop up to choose the default  the toggle doesn't trigger anything  the screen does just a kind of refresh  it was reproduced on monday  on the 2018 10 21 build 
i don't see a problem with that   i could see backspace being the expected button for removing things anyway
