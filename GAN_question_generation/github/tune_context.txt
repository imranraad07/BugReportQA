connection failure to repository database not catched anymore   the connection failure to the repository database is catched in the  getrelease  method of the  repositoryupdaterservice   when a  sqlexception  is thrown by the  connect  method of the  idatabaseconnector    in order to handle the optional schema name property of the repository database connection  the call to the  idatabaseconnector#connect iconnection   method has been replaced by a call to the  iconnectionservice#connect idatabasetarget   method  but unlike the  idatabaseconnector  method  the  connect  method of the  iconnectionservice  throws a  installerexception  when it fails connecting to the database  hence  connection failure to the repository database is no more detectable by the  repositoryupdaterservice

support work around for the flatland bug   since a lot of servers have old worlds based on v1 0 8 and v2 0 0 beta  odds are  we have a lot of flatlands generated out there   we think we have fixed it  in newly created worlds   but we have no way to fix "already generated flatland"   we might consider making something to accomodate these servers   i e  either having an option of adding a miny    0  that is used in the level calculation      and possibly used to clear blocks below     or possibly cleverly try to guess if it's flatland  and only remove it if it is  grass  dirt  and bedrock

many problems on windows with amazon cloud drive and netdrive2   i'm not sure where the problem is   i'm using netdrive2 to map an amazon cloud drive to a drive  then using cryptomator with that mapped drive   i'm seeing many problems   i don't know where the fault lies  with netdrive2 or cryptomator or elsewhere  but i've only seen the problem since using cryptomator  so i assume it might be there    1  i could not create the vault on the mapped drive directly using the cryptomator ui   i had to create the vault on a local drive then move the files to the mapped drive  then add this to the cryptomator ui as an existing vault  2  delayed write failed   when i try and transfer files into the vault i'm getting a lot of these 3  a device attached to the system is not functioning   i was also getting this   netdrive2 has the option of mounting a cloud drive as "local" or "network"   i tried both with the same result  well  with local setting i got none of the delayed write failed but instead got more device attached to the system is not working    i also went ahead and tried another product  expandrive 5  for the amazon cloud drive mapping and that also failed  though differently   it allowed me to create the vault directly in the app  it did not throw delayed write errors  it did not throw device attached errors  but it did throw cryptomator warnings about possibly malicious changes and any attempts to actually open the cryptomator stored files failed in the windows apps    beautiful project and idea

emoji in rmd file causes rstudio to core dump repeatedly   this seems like a serious issue  something that sounded like the same thing was reported to me by a participant at the geostat18 conference where i was lecturing based on these slides  https   github com geocompr geostats_18 blob master spatial tidyverse rmd  i've just got a fresh install of r rstudio on ubuntu 18 04 and when i try to edit the file it crashes r  the reason i think this is serious is that when rstudio is next started  it instantly crashes  you can start rstudio in specific projects with  rstudio myproject  but if it starts in a project where the crash happens  it just crashes again  which could lead to some users uninstalling r    the solution i found was to delete the contents of     rstudio desktop    i think the person who mentioned the issue also did this   ### system details      rstudio edition   desktop     rstudio version   1 1 456     os version        ubuntu 18 04     r version          3 5 1  ### steps to reproduce the problem    ### describe the problem in detail  see above   ### describe the behavior you expected  1  rstudio should not crash 2  rstudio should at least be able to start next time it's launched  i tried various things to enable me to open the file  i tried installing   xaringan    i tried installing   emojifont    no luck  i guess there's something in the file that makes rstudio die         ## update  i've found the cause  it's the emoji in line 3 of the file   when the offending line was removed it fixes it  i have also submitted a pr that fixes it in our repo  https   github com geocompr geostats_18 pull 2 files  i've not merged that change because i think it may be useful as a reproducible example for others to test on          depending on the problem  the following may also be helpful  1  the output of sessioninfo    2  the r code in question 3  a diagnostics report  see https   support rstudio com hc en us articles 200321257 running a diagnostics report  thank you for taking the time to file an issue

minor anoyance  wrench behavior goes wonky when used with morph mod   there appears to be a minor annoyance issue when enderio and morph mod are used together  this issue sometimes applies to thermal expansion pipes as well so i believe the issue is directly related to the players hit box changing its shape and size when you turn into something   but when using the morph mod and turning into a non humanoid monster eg bat squid pig wrenches cannot right click on the conduits and shift right clicking will not cause them to break properly

case sensitivity affects query results   let's say we have an index   people   of   person   documents like this one    however  if the index uses a standard mapping  with standard tokenizer analyzer   then all the terms will be lower cased  basically the nested  select  query will return the names in original casing  starting with a capital letter   but the main  select  will fail to find any matches  because it will search within lowercase terms   seems like this is by design  but also contradicts the sql logic and intuition 
default navigation and map   this one is from email     so i noticed a new issue on the app  the settings that i've set up is to have maps as the default map source to make it easy to navigate   when i am in a cache detail page and want to view the cache on the map i hit menu and default navigation to open google map to view the location on the map   all i get is a blank map with no cache location   ok no problem i go back into the setting and change the default map back to radar and go back to a cache detail page   i then click menu and navigation then map to load google maps   i then am able to see the cache location   kinda weird that it is viewable in one setting but not the other   thanks for the great app

lag with discidia   hitting mobs while fully attuned to discidia causes a tiny bit of lag   not fps lag    to be fair  my computer isn't the  best  for running modded minecraft  but with multiple mods    how i tested it   superflat world  only as    baubles  installed  spawn some cows  or any mob   and hit them  they should instantly be damaged and knocked back  now  attune yourself to discidia  every time you unlock a perk for discidia  the knock back from hitting a cow will take more time  after unlocking all the perks for discidia  there should be a noticeable difference in the time it takes for the cow to be knocked back   albeit small   the difference is more noticeable if you use an attuned sword  since the sword also lags a bit  wearing the discidia mantle of stars makes the lag even worse   the differences in timing are not a big deal with just as  but i found that the more mods used along with as would increase the lag  with my 130 mods  the delay was about 2 seconds   in my defense  most of those mods are small

openhab on  rpi2   zwave binding   northq 9021 wakeup no meter update   hi   i have openhab running with zwave binding 1 7 1 on raspberry pi 2  my zwave network has 7 nodes  including the controller   everything works great for all nodes  temp sensors switches contact sensor  except for the northq 9021  power meter   in the zwave binding zwave mastercontroller is set has true  so that openhab will receive the wakeup and notifications   northq 9021 is a battery operated device that will wake up every 15 minutes and the node has the wakeup class configured  see the attached screenshot binding gif     the node wakes up correctly and communicate this to the node  1   every 15 minutes  as expected  however  even if one item is configured with the meter command  it will never gets updated  unless the device is set in real time mode   it seems from the log  see zwave log in attachment  that  as the node wakeup  it is never requested a meter command and will just go to sleep again   i also tried different configurations for the item  unfortunately without success  even with refresh_intervals from 1 sec  1 minute  10 minutes  15 minutes   zwave "2 command meter" or zwave "2 command meter refresh_interval x"  please  any idea of what could be the solution  thanks  ps   it is working as expected with openzwave and openzwave control panel  every 15 minutes the meter command is sent over    binding   binding  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 15078703 11440500 3510250c 9503 11e5 9efc f6e4b8163583 gif   log  zwave txt  https   github com openhab openhab files 45672 zwave txt  ##

protocol buffers test skewed by joda localdate string conversions   i ran the benchmark under a profiler and noticed the protobuf side of the test was dominated by joda string conversions   the jackson converter uses the  localdate  numeric fields directly  which is far more efficient than formatting   parsing strings on the protocol buffers side   given the large number of  localdate  fields this makes the pb benchmark perform far slower   i put together a quick test consisting of only basic types and found proto3 to be about 5 times faster than jackson on both serialization and deserialization   my results are here  https   github com phensley protobuf vs jackson

alarms not updating with low quality internet connection   boilr had internet  other apps had it and i was browsing with np  alarms didn't update for more than 30mins  i had them set to 1s  30mins after  boom  btc price was up by  10 while boilr still hadn't updated     this happened twice  i think it happens when i go somewhere where the connection might be weaker  the only way to solve this is to force stop boilr and relaunch it

add font refresh option to language properties screen   dev comments  polyglot retains and embeds fonts in its files  for this reason  automatically refreshing fonts to the newest version that an os has access to is not expected behavior  however  when polyglot searches for the font to embed  it returns the first match  rather than the most recent  to correct this   1  when selecting the physical font file to embed  search all fonts within relevant folders  and make a list of those which match the font family  of those  select the most recently modified  2  add a button below font selection which will refresh all fonts per the latest installed in the os   original user text  hello  this program is really great  even if there is some things that should be added  but i found a bug  i created a font for my conlang  installed it and used to create a language in this program  then i changed my font  reinstalled it  and    program still uses old version of font  i tried different ways    i deleted font and installed it again  i used "import font" button  it all didn't help  even when i deleted my font  rebooted a system and started this program    it still have this font in fonts list  even when it don't exist anymore  i solved it by using another name for font  i guess program somehow saves fonts by name and don't update it when it changed or even deleted

with git integration  reset time on commit   with the git integration  i have an enhancement request  when it automatically injects the time into the commit messages  can it reset the time automatically   it seems to me  the the intent of the feature is to log the amount of time it took to complete the commit   however  following this example  1  work on a something for 2 hours 2  execute a commit 3  inject the commit message  "took 2 hours" 4  work for 5 more minutes 5  execute a commit 6  inject the commit message  "took 2 hours 5 minutes"  again  to me it seems like the commit message in step 6  should likely say "5 minutes"  since that commit really took the difference between that commit  and the prior

throughput test converts double to int   the test spec for throughput  http   deliverymind github io lightning test_types html  specifies that minthroughput accepts double numbers   internally  it looks like it converts that number to an int before comparing it against the actual throughput  as a result  specifying a throughput less than 1  e g  0 95  gets compared against a number that loses precision  and is reported as 0     the relevant code in throughputtest java gets the actual throughput as an int before comparing it against the double minthroughput   actualresult    int  transactions getthroughput      if the test allows double values to be specified  it should report compare on a double value

cyclic imports and missing declarations cause parsing error   if i have 2 ontologies that import each other and one of them has annotationaxioms  the ontology with annotationaxioms will not resolve properly due to how the ontologies are compared for equivalency  the first time an ontology is evaluated to see if it is equivalent  the object used is without the annotationaxioms  after it passes and is renamed  it is added to the list of ontologies in the closure  then  after the fact  the annotationaxioms are added back into that ontology in the list  when the ontology is evaluated again later  it fails because the ontologies aren't equal because the object passed in doesn't have annotationaxiom whilst the one in the list of ontologies does   is this the intended design  not processing annotationaxioms in the config is not an option for me either 
item duplication when doing extra utilities autocrafting with storage crates   hi  i've opened this bug first with extra utilities  but after testing a similar setup with jabba barrels  where everything worked as expected  and a reply from rwtema i thought i'd try placing it here   see https   github com rwtema extrautilities issues 306    extra utilities autocrafting pulls an item from each of the nine inventories behind it and crafts the matching recipe  when this autocrafting mechanic is used with connected storage crates a single item will be used for all  connected  slots  this allows for crafting an octuple compressed cobblestone from a single piece of cobble  this also allows for duplication of other items that can be crafted into blocks or require multiple items of the same type  iron  gold          2014 09 12_02 09 02  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4005102 4243636 2a3834ce 3a11 11e4 9b61 0a0b252cfab4 png    crate  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4005102 4243667 bde92872 3a11 11e4 9ce5 93c3873e7705 png    result  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4005102 4243668 bdef469e 3a11 11e4 89d9 5d25c676be70 png   tested with versions  extrautilities 1 1 0i betterstorage 1 7 10 0 9 4 111

also  i tried multiple java tomcat versions and all failed  strangely  when i tried it again in another clean digitalocean machine and my local osx with the same environment  it worked  i guess that anyone can easily reproduce this error because the same thing happens again even on the newly launched ec2 instance  please let me know if i'm missing something here  ## followings are the stack

increased number of ip packets  segmentation by tls layer below the mtu size    we are using netty as httpserver and also http client   it was observed that ip packets which contains the tls application data  are segmented in the tls layer  significantly lower than the mtu size of 1500 octets   this significantly increases the number of outgoing ip packets  typically  a hardware based segmentation is done by the network adapter on the ip layer  therefore  a software based segmentation by application at tls layer seems unnecessary   i am eager to know at which level this segmentation is happening  is netty doing this or the underlying ssl implementation  any idea or advice  this is a crticial requirement from our customer     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 16151092 13005295 56f772be d181 11e5 8867 f8f74347b47a png

box2d impulses are totally different in android release mode   i use libgdx and box2d and i found a strange behavior while integrating box2d in my game  engine   i started to implement https   bitbucket org dermetfan libgdx utils wiki breakable and everything was fine  until i tried the same game on my tablet   look here  http   youtu be p9objfnlf_w  if i have a breakable object in desktop version  it behaves like expected  on android it seemed to be much more breakable then on the desktop version  so i started to check where this behavior comes from  the strange thing is  that in debugging mode the behavior is like in the desktop version  only in release mode it breaks faster  using fixed timesteps    i logged the normalimpulse or the sum   by implementing a custom contactlistener  which delegates to the breakablemanager   in the callback of my breakable object i log more detailed information  all components of the normal impulse   but only if the body is destroyed  look at collision nr28   desktop   normal impulse  0 29399997 collision nr26 normal impulse  0 29400006 collision nr27 normal impulse  3 79384 collision nr28 normal impulse  0 29400003 collision nr29 normal impulse  0 29400003 collision nr30  android   normal impulse  0 29399997 collision nr26 normal impulse  0 29400006 collision nr27 normal impulse  54 596504 collision nr28 nomalimpulse  3 79384 n0 nomalimpulse  50 802666 n1 tangentimpulse   0 93856573 n0 tangentimpulse  5 5101436e19 n1 box strained with normalimpuse  54 596504 tangetimpulse  5 5101436e19 critical collision destroying body 20 0 normal impulse  0 29400003 collision nr29 normal impulse  0 29400003 collision nr30  as you can see there is a significantly higher impulse on android release version  nr28   and the component of n28 is normalimpulse n1  which is exactly the differnce  normalimpulse n0 matches the normalimpulse on desktop version  so now i can ignore n1 part  but i guess something is wrong here   in debugging mode everything is fine  like in desktop version  i found some related issue  which could be a related problem  https   github com libgdx libgdx issues 916  any ideas to fix

long string in default value causes infinite loop within usage printer   in using picocli version 0 9 7 as part of a groovy script i am writing  i have uncovered an infinite loop in the usage   printer  specifically  i have a command line so        command showdefaultvalues   true      class maincommand            option names   "  config dir"  description   "the path to the directory holding the configs"          file configdir   paths get getclass   getprotectiondomain   getcodesource   getlocation   touri    getparent   getparent   resolve "configs"  tofile          this results in a long path like so   c  users username development my_software my software config configs   this value  after running through break iterator  results in the value of variable text within method  commandline help texttable copy breakiterator line  text text  text destination  int offset   being   users username development my_software my software config configs   which is unable to be wrapped when used by  commandline help texttable putvalue int row  int col  text value   line 3013  this inability to wrap causes the wrap iterator inside that function to go into an infinite loop   now  my workaround is to stop outputting the default value  but i imagine this could bite others as well  but that makes my script less clear 
"namespace cleanup enabled" is not always true as the doc states   currently cube defaults it to false when the namespace is going to be destroyed  there are two issues with this approach  1  it's different than docs 2  projects that use arq cube can rely on  configuration isnamespacecleanupenabled    to cleanup their own stuff  and thus they can get the  wrong  value false when the user explicitly didn't set the value true for this property

slidingtimewindowreservoir gettick   can overflow and break   the gettick   function of slidingtimewindowreservoir uses a collision buffer to allow for measurements which are happening within the same "tick"  the default clock tick is provided by system nanotime     under certain circumstances  nanotime   returns a long sufficiently large that when multiplied by the collision buffer  it overflow into a negative number  the next line in the function will then check whether the new tick  nanos    buffer  is larger than the old and  if not  it will return oldtick + 1  because of this  the gettick   function returns ticks which are always incresing by one  therefore distorting the window   to fix this  i added an absolute offset value to the class  the offset value can be a final field which is initialized when the class is constructured or a static  following each call to clock gettick    we would reduce the return value but this absolute amount

timers can be wiped out when using gesturedetector   due to the  introduction  https   github com libgdx libgdx commit da8fb9e108abdf593f02258f0b3f52093124c937  of  checkstatics  https   github com libgdx libgdx blob 1 3 1 gdx src com badlogic gdx utils timer java#l262   if any timer is created within libgdx  it runs the risk of wiping out user created timers  specifically  if one is created after a pause event  and before a resume event  the timer constructor will call checkstatics and will clear existing timer instances   since gesturedetector creates a new timer instance every time the touchdown event occurs  it could do this if it happens to run before resume  the following code demonstrates the issue by manually calling touchdown on the pause event  simply run it  then switch to another window to pause it  then switch back and the timer will not resume     this issue was  previously reported  https   github com libgdx libgdx issues 1930   but it was closed because it did not have a test case   it looks like checkstatics was introduced to solve an  issue  https   github com libgdx libgdx issues 1548  that occurred on mobile where the game's create event is called when the game is resumed  preventing old timers from running again  perhaps a better solution would be to call checkstatics when this event occurs  rather than every time a timer is initialized   additionally  i suggest that checkstatics use thread dispose   because it currently isn't cleaning up everything  it isn't calling removelifecyclelistener for example

auto upload folders from previous installations won't go away and are creating duplicate folders     ### actual behaviour    i reinstall the app and it creates auto upload folder connections to instant upload despite the fact that i have deleted instant upload folder and have reinstalled the app so that i could start with fresh auto upload folder connections  ### expected behaviour    after a fresh install of the app  i would like to be able to explicitly choose which folders get auto uploaded and where they connect to     ### steps to reproduce 1  i installed the nextcloud phone app last month but my phone was a mess and i didn't have time to do the auto upload settings   2  it asked me if i wanted to auto upload to a folder called "instant upload" so i said yes  and it uploaded some things to that folder   3  it didn't upload everything though and when i tried adding things to the instant upload folder through the web ui  i didn't see the changes reflected on my phone  4  i finally got around to organizing my phone filesystem   5  i deleted the instant upload folder from my browser web ui 6  i went to update my auto upload settings  i added some custom folder connections to a new folder called "phone"   7  a lot of stuff was not syncing between phone on my server and my actual phone   8  there are also still autoupload folder connnections connected to instant upload  i don't want those folders connections anymore but i can see no way to delete them   9  i reinstalled the app and confirmed that there were no leftover files from nextcloud app in my android filesystem   10  phone app still shows incorrect auto upload folder connections upon reinstallation etc   perhaps those settings are being held in a database or something     ### environment data android version  android version 9  device model  google pixel 1  stock or customized system   nextcloud app version  3 3 0  nextcloud server version  14 03  ### phone logs    also i've attached some folders here below  in the process of taking screenshots on my phone in order to explain the issue it actually kickstarted the system and made it recreate the instant upload folder    i however  still can't delete those connections  and as you can see from the screenshots  it means that i have duplicates of the auto upload folder connections junking stuff up  if there's a way to get rid of these excess connections so i can only have the auto upload folder connections that i want  that would be super helpful     screenshot_20181017 180124  https   user images githubusercontent com 9451726 47121576 c9c60700 d238 11e8 88b6 da5a58fe6028 png    screenshot_20181017 180135  https   user images githubusercontent com 9451726 47121577 c9c60700 d238 11e8 96b8 c2bfc9a4c0b0 png    screenshot_20181017 180145  https   user images githubusercontent com 9451726 47121578 ca5e9d80 d238 11e8 867e 89bacae1e8a3 png    screenshot_20181017 180226  https   user images githubusercontent com 9451726 47121579 ca5e9d80 d238 11e8 8f77 efa7d9a4f19c png    screenshot_20181017 180248  https   user images githubusercontent com 9451726 47121580 ca5e9d80 d238 11e8 90d5 575eb66e23dc png

responsewriter should not throw runtimeioexceptions   the responsewriter returned by servletresponse getwriter   violates the contract of the printwriter api   of course  responsewriter doesn't throw  checked  ioexceptions directly  but wraps them as unchecked runtimeioexceptions as soon as the application tries to write additional data  this seems to assume  that the application will use checkerror   after every invocation of "write    "print"  or "append  "    which is usually not the case  as a result applications have to add try catch statements in order to deal with the unexpected runtimeioexceptions  without such changes  ugly stacktraces are logged each time a user closes the browser during the processing of a request  or in other words  an applicaton which runs "silently" in another servlet containers  i e  tomcat  must be changed for jetty   i understand the wish to "fail fast"  but applications can do that by using the output stream  perhaps wraped by a "writer"   if the application chooses to use a printwriter  then it should get a printwriter which behaves like a printwriter  i o errors have to be queried by "checkerror

delay bug after last bukkit update    after last bukkit update about 1 week ago from today 11 05 2013  there has been some severe problems for me playing on a server which has this update   the same problem is present for both me and my brother on the same server   i've ran numerous tests  testing hardware  internetconnection pings  software problems etc etc   always coming up with the same problem related to this server only   the server runs the latest edition of bukkit  and a whole "bukkit" of other plugins  prior to this update there was never any problems and everything was running smoothly   after last update  something really strange has happen  where the only ones on the server having severe problems after doing any type of teleports   is me and my brother   i have tested the same things on other servers    and theres no problems  the other funny thing is that it only happens to me and my brother  so the obvious conclution is that its client side problem right   but no this is no client side problem i assure you   this is a short description of what i have encounterd  when ever i teleport using  home  warp  spawn or  tpa i will have a delay for anything between 10 60 seconds  after the teleport    where i cannot open chests  the chat does not update  i cannot run commands i can only move around   same thing happens with my brother   now thinking this was a client problem i ran all sorts of cleanup  fixes etc etc  i talked to my isp i reset and reconfigured my router  i reset modem   and nothing helps   and when i test this against other servers there is nothing that indicates the same problem at all  the only problem is on this one server where the latest bukkit was installed  and its very strange how it only affects me and my brother and noone else   after the 10 60 seconds have passed it seems to be alright   where i can move build and anything really running commands and opening chests with out any obvious problems  but everytime i do another teleport  i get the same 10 60 delay  i might have minor ones now and again   but that does not neccessarily have anything to do with my primary problem   now i've had the admin help me try locate the problem    and the server is only ever using 3gb out of 16gb the server keeps a constant solid 20 20 tps  now how and why it only affects me and my brother i have no idea   but we both are using pretty hardcore systems that runs just about any game on max settings   my system specs is as following  win 7 ultimate 64bit  java 64 bit  16gb ram 1gb dedicated graphic card memory  quadcore 950 intel proccessor  7200 rpm ats2 2tb hdd 50mbit upload and download speed fiberoptic internetconnection   i've also tried out fresh minecraft install  and removed any additional settings or texturepacks   yet this problem persists   the problem also occured only after last bukkit update   and was never even anywhere like this prior to this update   hope someone can make sense of this  or if someone have a topic they know of which is related i'd be happy to visit that one

renderer visual debugger overhaul   terasology uses a deferred renderer  each frame it renders a number of separate layers  stored in fbo attachments  which are combined to produce the image seen on the display  existing bugs or newly introduced bugs affecting the rendered will tend to negatively affect its visual output  from small artifacts to issues affecting the whole picture  i e  a blank screen    an important aspect of debugging these issues is to isolate and identify the rendering node that introduces the problem  currently  we have a visual debugging system in place  displaying the content of a number of fbo attachments when enabled  the current system has a number of shortcomings however     it is hardcoded and does not take advantage of the new  node based  extensible architecture of the renderer    a number of nodes may write to the same fbo but the current system visualizes the content of the fbo only at the end of the frame  ideally we'd want to be able to inspect the contribution of each node separately    the contribution of a node might be subtle  a facility to highlight a node's contribution  i e  overimposing a semi transparent color on it  would be beneficial   the current system visualizes the color attachments of the various fbos but does not allow inspection of other important attachments  for example depth and stencil buffers    the current system displays the content of an attachment and only that  there is no label allowing the user to uniquely identify the attachment on display nor additional metadata such as attachment type  size in pixels  size in memory and any other useful information   a new system should replace the existing system  take advantage of the node based architecture of the renderer and implement solutions to the various shortcomings described above

idle elastic java low level client continuously create new tcp socks   i was testing a new backend service  which created connections to a cluster of three boxes but it didn't use the connections at all  i accidentally found out it was creating 3 new tcp socks every second  when i ran  lsof  p pid  to examine open file usage    i commented out all communication modules  with only few lines of code creating es connections left  it became obvious that es connection caused the problem  my production system didn't have the problem as it actively used the es connections   i guess it is the es connection heart beat that continuously opening new tcp socks every second but it didn't close them    i think this is an issue that should be fixed  it likely opens too many files that will cause serious problems   i am running es 5 6 0 server and java client

 ruby  don't replace backticks with plus signs in comments   currently the ruby generator is replacing backticks  i e  code markup syntax in markdown  with plus signs  which is rdoc syntax   however  we are generating yard format documentation using markdown  so we actually do _not_ want this replacement to happen  this issue is causing a lot of syntax critical pieces of documentation  like regexes and other format strings  to be misformatted and or mangled    jbolinger marking this as p1 because it's quite difficult to reverse this after the fact in a synth transform  i e  determining whether a plus sign is a literal plus or a transformed backtick   but i assume it would be easy to remove the replacement in the generator  would you be able to get a quick patch in

memory leak when enabling  wiretap   and other tcpclient bootstrap options    ## expected behavior adding wiretap  or other tcpclient bootstrap options should not create excessive micrometer meters   ## actual behavior when enabling  httpclient create   wiretap true   extra metrics are created like so   this is because the id is generated from the  hashcode  of the bootstrap and the bootstrap is a lambda    see https   github com reactor reactor netty blob d6a4300c69a8deb83f2e252e576975833faaab87 src main java reactor netty resources pooledconnectionprovider java#l168   ## steps to reproduce create an httpclient and enable  metrics true  wiretap true   and make several calls and check the meter registry   ## possible solution don't use a hashcode for the id  or leave the id off by default

parsing of boolean  additonalproperties  inconsistent with openapi 3 0 0 specification   i'm used to setting  "additionalproperties"  false  from jsonschema  hence did so in an openapi 3 0 0 file  especially as it's  allowed by the specification  https   swagger io specification #properties 99    using version  2 0 0 snapshot  of  swagger parser v3  as found on oss sonatype org for openapi file validation  i get a parse result message saying that  additonalproperties  is not of type  object    i'm aware of issue #366  but i think either   the parser should accept boolean values for  additionalproperties  as well or   it must be clearly stated in the specification if the parser is supposed to frown upon such values   in addition  the message is a bit misleading because it is reported only once and only for the top level of the object definiton  even though there were several occurences of  "additonalproperties"  false  on deeper levels of this definition  providing a more precise location would have helped a lot with debugging this issue 
webrequesttracefilter calls methods on the request and response to retrieve information that then isn't included in the trace    org springframework boot actuate trace webrequesttracefilter gettrace    is calling a number of methods on the request even when they are not going to be included in the trace  the issue is that the  add  method is passed an  include  and the data to include  this function calls that generate the data are called even if  add  never actually adds anything to the trace   this came up during performance testing of an application at loads of about 500 requests per second  in particular  the call to  getpathtranslated    was showing up in profiles as taking 5  of the overall execution time  on linux with openjdk  this method makes native filesystem calls which are relatively slow  this is especially bad since  default_includes  does not include this data and it's never put in the trace  if i remove this one call  i see between a 5  and 50  improvement in throughput depending on total throughput and concurrency   the add method should be reworked so that the data is not generated until it is added to the trace

upgrading from 0 8 to 0 10 causes configuration data loss   i upgraded to 0 10 from 0 8 this evening and the container settings got wiped  in particular the image names  volume mounts  dns settings were all blank in the new configuration format   reverting back to 0 8 restored them     you should put a comment in the plugin that indicates upgrading will cause data loss    it's a pre release thing so this is expected  but it is a bit painful having to re enter everything

application crash upon loading large folder   ### actual behaviour when opening a large folder   1 5gb  on the android nextcloud application on my phone  the application will load for a couple seconds  then crash  after this  subsequent attempts to access the folder result in an instant force close  this folder has 268 files  all audio files  all other folders work  including folders with more files  removing a few files from the folder solves the issue  so i believe the issue has something to do with the amount of data stored in the folder rather than the number of files  i can view the folder just fine on desktop   the folder on my nextcloud instance is audio unsorted  ### attempted solutions debugging  1  cleared data and cache for application  2  reinstalled application  3  recreated folder by downloading all data from original folder and re uploading it into a new folder  4  tried a different phone  a huawei honor 5x kiw l24  same version of nextcloud app   5  tried a different nextcloud instance  same version  being run on a different server with the same folder contents  6  deleted roughly 50 megabytes of data from the folder  which stopped the crashing   ### expected behaviour the folder should load normally    ### steps to reproduce 1  open nextcloud application 2  log into server 3  navigate to a folder with a large amount of data   1 5gb or more   ### environment data android version  7 0  device model  alcatel a30 5046g  stock or customized system  stock  nextcloud app version  3 1 0  nextcloud server version  13 0 2 web server  apache 2 4 18  ubuntu  php  7 0 30 0ubuntu0 16 04 1 mysql  14 14 distrib 5 7 22 openssl  1 0 2g  1 mar 2016 server os  ubuntu 16 04 lts  linux kernel 2 6 32 042stab127 2  ### logs #### web server error log    note    be super sure to remove sensitive data like passwords  note that everybody can look here  you can use the issue template application to prefill some of the required information  https   apps nextcloud com apps issuetemplate  error on android    screenshot_20180603 202958  https   user images githubusercontent com 7649759 40896467 c70c336e 677a 11e8 9b4a bee909a2a8db png  folder causing issues    folder  https   user images githubusercontent com 7649759 40896468 c70e6d50 677a 11e8 8814 3c9c0eb0c8c1 png

strange behavior when querying for nodes with self referential relationships   i have reproduced this on 1 8 1 and 1 8 2   create a node that has 1 link to itself   the query below is designed to return the node and its relationships separated into incoming and outgoing relationships  it also includes the start nodes  for incoming relationships  and end nodes  for outgoing relationships       when the node has 1 self referential relationship  either the links_n_in or links_n_out array is populated with the expected relationships  but not both   and the behavior seems to be nondeterministic   sometimes the links_n_in array is populated and sometimes the links_n_out array is populated   note the use of optional relationships in the query  when i do not use optional relationships  omit the ' '   this behavior does not occur and both arrays are populated as expected   when the node has 2 self referential relationships  this problem does not occur and both arrays are populated with 2 relationships as expected  this is true regardless of whether optional relationships are used in the query   however  when the node has 3 self referential relationships  both arrays are populated with 6 relationships instead of the expected 3   in other words  each relationship is duplicated   similar behavior also results with more than 3 relationships   this occurs regardless of whether optional relationships are used in the query  note that adding distinct inside collect links_n_in  and collect links_n_out  fixes this problem

different actuator port changes http status codes on errors   using spring boot actuator 1 5 4 and spring boot admin 1 5 3 we cannot see the "environment manager" tab for our client applications   the problem is caused by the wrong error code returned by the refresh endpoint with http verb  head    the spring admin expects  405   method not allowed  but the actuator endpoint returns error  500    this problem is related to the definition of an alternative port for the management  in that case the dispatch servlet has only one exception handler and not the standard two because it is configured by the  endpointwebmvcchildcontextconfiguration  class   if we use the server port for the management  without an alternative port  the request on refresh endpoint with head verb returns the right code 405   for us the alternative port is necessary and we didn't find a workaround to solve the problem

upload from android share menu fails   i'm new to owncloud  i looked for thi bug in the issues but didn't find it  hope not to generate a duplicate  when i try to upload to owncloud a file from a different app  like ghost commander or download   it doesn't work  no error is generated  the correct sequence is this    i select the file in the other app   i tap the share button   i choose to share to owncloud app   a pop up tree of the ownclud directory appears  i choose the directory where i want to upload the file   i tap on the "upload button"   nothing happens    if i look in the owncloud web app  the log doesn't show anything  so i suppose is something happening in android  not regarding the server    on the other side  uploading a file directly through the owncloud app  works

possible bug in requestprocessor stop mechanism   hi   what is the purpose to add isstopped flag in requestprocessor  the problem is that it's never set to false  i use same service across an application   i call spicemanager start   in activity fragment onstart   and spicemanager shouldstop   in activity fragment  after rotation requestprocessor is stopped beacuse it is same instance  in spiceservice unbind   requestprocessor is stopped and spiceservice oncreate is not called after but only spiceservice onrebind    same problem is in requestrunner  this is simple robospice usage  i don't know why  but spiceservice oncreate   is called only in first orientation of activity  in second one there is only onrebind    for example  if i open window in landscape  then it works only in landscape but not in portrait  no matter how many times i rotate device

transaction manager  wrong incoming zcl command matched to outgoing request   the following situation led to a  classcastexception  when reading an attribute via  zclattribute readvalue    1  a 'read attribute' command is sent out to a device  and is assigned transaction id  20   2  simultaneously  the device sends out a 'report attribute' command  for a different attribute and a different cluster than the read attribute command   and  by coincidence  also assigns it transaction id  20   3  the 'report attribute' command is received  and  due to matching transaction ids  the transaction manager considers the 'report attribute' command to be the response to the 'read attribute' command  this leads to a  classcastexception   here  https   github com zsmartsystems com zsmartsystems zigbee blob ef8abce88cb3328052d44a987b29aa8e6a342e3f com zsmartsystems zigbee src main java com zsmartsystems zigbee zcl zclcluster java#l482  in  zclcluster readattributevalue   when trying to cast an instance of  reportattributescommand  to a  readattributesresponse   4  the actual response to the read attributes command is received from the device  but is no longer matched to the read attributes command   i wonder how implementors of zcl transaction management are expected to deal with such a situation  to me it sounds normal  though rare  that two devices  by coincidence  concurrently send out a zcl command initiating a transaction with the same transaction id  like  in the above example  a read attributes command sent from the one device  and an attribute report sent from the other device   should the transaction manager deal with this situation by not only comparing transaction ids  but taking more info into account   e g   by also matching cluster id  or by never matching two commands that are always sent out as a request but never as a response   or should this be dealt with in another way   i did not find much on that in the zcl spec  only that 'the transaction sequence number field can be used by a controlling device  which may have issued multiple commands  so that it can match the incoming responses to the relevant command '  which is rather generic advice     chris  do you have any thoughts on this   for completeness  here's the three log messages showing the three commands with transaction id 20    and here's all the  zsmart  log messages from before that happening   logs_classcastexception txt  https   github com zsmartsystems com zsmartsystems zigbee files 4229519 logs_classcastexception txt

gate is not remembered after relog restart   gates in the dimension you spawn in will look like the edge y blocks  not like the round stargate thing after server restart or a relog  this is only valid for the dimension you spawn in  you can solve it if you re place the dhd  it will not get rid of the block textures  but the gate will work at least   note that the blocky texture for the gate is still there although theres also the round texture in the background    like there are 2 textures at the same time but some blocks are missing therefore you see the round stargate there    rc 48

recoverysourcehandler error message has source and target doc counts switched   in all versions of elasticsearch where i've checked the source code  there's a bug in the error message for when a shard can't recover from the primary because the number of docs differ   it lists numdocstarget as the doc count for the source node  and numdocssource as the doc count for the target node  but it should be the other way around  since the only way i've found to fix these problems is to remove the shard that we've deemed to be wrong  this can be really dangerous and cause removal of the wrong shard   relevant line of recoverysourcehandler java

initializing cluster metadata should handle  managed ledger path better     managed ledger  can be created automatically by brokers without initializing metadata  so in helm deployment  all pods are usually started at the same time  hence the race condition can happen between broker starts and initializing cluster metadata     broker starts triggering creating   managed ledger    cluster metadata initializer attempts to initialize cluster metadata and fail since   managed ledger  is already there   it can be handled by adding more checks in  initcontainer  before starting brokers  however i think we also need to improve the logic on initializing cluster metadata to better handle such corner cases

race condition when using localizedresource   we have a service that uses the cda api  it caches cdaentry instances and does things like    i e  for both threads  the locale of thread b would apply  the locale of thread a would not be used to get the field of thread a   we could solve the problem locally by synchronizing the method that contains the piece of code  we would need to take care not to introduce it again when using cdaentry in other places  though   it might be possible to solve the problem in general in the cda api by deprecating replacing localizedresource setlocale string  and localizedresource getfield string key   adding localizedresource getfield string locale  string key  or so instead   localizedresource setdefaultlocale string  might also be deprecated replaced by a constructor argument to avoid another race condition  but i don't know where this method is used    what do you think

opening link in new tab in custom tab is confusing and opens about blank in normal browsing   ## steps to reproduce 1  open link in custom tab 2  long press on a link and open in a new tab  ### expected behavior    we don't support multitasking in custom tabs so why do we have this option  i think we should maybe take away the option to open in a new tab if in a custom tab and instead maybe "send to focus"    ### actual behavior new tab is sent to normal browsing focus  currently opens about blank
pex migration   user cannot be found   hello i have run into an issue after migrating from pex to luckperms   ### description   after migrating from pex to luckperms  all luckperms commands do not work with usernames  it seems i have to use uuids only to edit or pull up info about a user  i know its better to use uuid anyways  but not all plugins have uuid placeholders  such as ezprestige  or other ranking plugins   it is very strange  though  because the plugin seems like it has all the info it needs  if i run the command via uuid it even outputs the correct username    note  i  voidangel  have logged on to the server multiple times after migrating  so i should be in the luckperms cache  but it seems i am not somehow  see the below console output   ### evidence    is there a way to fix this  perhaps a command  or something at startup to correct all the users   things that don't work  1  restarting the server 2  being online while running the command 3  turning on "use server uuid cache" does work in a sense  but the _luckperms cache still does not update_ d  i'm worried about too many requests to mojang by leaving it on  i have a lot of servers and a lot of players so i have to be careful about that  correct me if i'm wrong please

build fails when anything other than "orsroutingfile" set for "routing_name"        if you have a question or improvement suggestion rather than an actual issue bug  pls use our forum           https   ask openrouteservice org c ors     #### here's what i did      include request urls  link to app config or other relevant ifnormation      setting the routing_name property within the app config and building ors        #### here's what i got      we  heart  json outputs      the build fails with on the unit test testcreateroutefeaturetype in simplefeaturetypetest as it expects always to be named as orsroutingfile even when a value has been set in the app config   it seems that the creation of the feature always accesses the app config even for running unit tests        #### here's what i was expecting      try being as explicit as possible here so we know how to fix this issue      that ors should build when a value is entered in the app config for routing_name  also  the name of the property itself is a bit vague  and it seems that when applying the name to the feature  anything after a space is ignored        #### here's what i think could be improved  either the unit tests should ensure that the app config is not used for building the object  or the test should be removed as unit tests shouldn't be dependant on external items

kubernetes service gets deleted with the pod   running shinyproxy inside a kubernetes cluster  the created kubernetes service gets deleted when shinyproxy stops the shiny app's container    i am using shinyproxy with kubernetes based on the given example configuration  https   github com openanalytics shinyproxy config examples tree master 03 containerized kubernetes  using a loadbalancer service type instead of nodeport    i figured out that it is caused by the kubernetesbackend's dostopproxy function as it deletes the kubernetes service    if shinyproxy is used inside a kubernetes cluster and the service is created by the user during the deployment  it shouldn't delete the service  i guess it just needs to check whether the proxy is used internally or not and delete the service if needed 
lazyqueryview should be extendable  or caching and debugging should be abstracted from it    i understand the comments made on  this issue  https   github com tlaukkan vaadin lazyquerycontainer issues 12   but the lazyqueryview has so much good debugging and caching functionality  that it seems a waste to have to either copy and paste the code to make your own changes  or to have to loose all those features    the simplest solution seems to be to remove the final modifier  but in light of the aforementioned issue's comment  at the least it seems there could be an abstractqueryview that lazyqueryview can extend  and thus make the caching and debugging functionality available to anyone who wants to implement their own queryview

regular ldap  users cannot start connect to a workspace   i have an issue where 'regular' ldap  users cannot start and connect to a workspace   my setup  docker  on an ubuntu 16 04lts vm  4cpu 20gb ram 300gb disk   local  eclipse che 6 9 0 a d  configured in keycloak  the steps to reproduce this are  1  login to che with a 'regular' user account 2  add a new workspace  in this case using the 'php' stack  3  open ide  the window changes to the ide window with a 'loading  ' bar but does not complete  i can see the container gets started with 'docker ps' and can connect to it manually with 'docker exec'   if i try the above steps as the che admin user it works fine  another interesting thing is if the che admin starts a workspace and shares it then the 'regular' user can connect to that just fine also   the issue appears to be that the user cannot start and connect to her own workspace    i tried to look for some logs and do some debugging  i try to curl che host 8080 inside the container and it works ok  i've looked at the bootstrap log on this container and a working container that admin started and they are identical  i've looked at the logs from the che container  docker log che  but it only says    'starting workspace 'some test' with id 'workspace    ' by user 'someuser'   then  around 7 minutes later     'workspace 'some test' with id 'workspace   ' start failed  i also tried setting up a complete new setup on a different server and i get the same results    im not sure where else to look for logs or debug info  i looked at the section in the documentation about workspace starting failures but this didnt not help   thanks

missing explicit compile dependency on guava   when attempting to apply version 0 6 0 the build fails with     this is a dependency on a google guava class but there is no explicit compile dependency on guava  i suspect that the build of this project is succeeding by a transitive dependency on guava  i believe that fix here is to add an explicit compile dependency on the desired version of guava

when you serve spring annotated rules behind a proxy like cglib   hi guys   first of all thanks for the great library  we are serving our spring beans behind cglib proxy by enabling the configuration       enableaspectjautoproxy  proxytargetclass   true    i think lots of people tend to do this  when we enable this configuration  the proxy classes become subclass of the target class and the annotations are not preserving  so the class  ruledefinitionvalidator tends to throw exceptions like   these two links may highlight the situation  http   stackoverflow com questions 1706751 retain annotations on cglib proxies http   stackoverflow com questions 8974475 method annotations null when proxying via cglib  in my current environment i manage to work with cglib proxied  springrule annotations by changing the easy rule annotations like this    if it sounds ok i would like the work on a pull request for easy rules supporting cglib proxied spring rules   if it is not a good idea  i will continue on my local fork   i have prepared a very rough commit 7aa26c303f28a957894354e59021eab944d40d91  thanks again for the great library

server does not enforce login   currently  a login message from the client is no more than a way to set their user name  it's possible to run any command on the server without first authenticating  below is a proof of concept i made by connecting to the server with  telnet  and running a query and a start game command without any prior login     tested on ed3a80ba54cf99fbf4a3fc05eb6ebca853f1684b  current  develop     this related to #347  i ran into it when trying to fix that issue  closing the socket would raise socket io exceptions because the server immediately after sending an error back would start to process any other messages received from that client   the server should keep track of which clients are authenticated and limit most commands to only those clients  the only command that should be run by an unauthenticated client that i know of is the login command

unsupported gauge version  this version of gauge intellij plugin only works with gauge version    0 9 0   i've a gauge project that i've been using since january 2019 and out of nowhere i started getting this unsupported gauge version error  i thought it was due to an update  either in gauge  intellij or the gauge intellij plugin but this seems not to be the case   i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling gauge  the gauge plugin  intellij  creating a new sample project on my machine and manually specifying the gauge binary path and home  none of these have made any difference  the new sample project has the same issue  however  other machines running the same project seem to have no issue  even on the same version of gauge and intellij  that said  i'm not sure if this would make a difference but i'm running on an ubuntu machine  18 04  while they were running windows 10  i've followed the documentation for installing gauge as specified in the following question  unsupported gauge version  this veuge inrsion of gatellij plugin only works with gauge version    0 9 0  spec files steps are shown unimplemented  i can still run specs  but some of the functionality of the plugin is no longer available  in particular  where before when running each scenario in a spec was separated into it's own header which had it's own log  now all the scenarios are grouped into one log  often times causing most of the scenario logs to be lost due to the amount of lines in the log   edit  i'm running with the following gauge version  gauge version  1 0 6  commit hash  2bc49db  html report  4 0 8   java  0 7 2   screenshot  0 0 1  as for intellij  intellij idea ultimate 2019 2 gauge plugin 0 3 16

add fdroid fennec id so that fennec shows up in open in      ## steps to reproduce have firefox klar and firefox fennec both installed from fdroid  set klar to be the default browser  ### expected behavior in the menu bar i expect a "open in firefox fennec"  ### actual behavior i only get a "open in    " menu listing  if i select that then i get an option to either download firefox or to open using the system browser  that comes installed with miui   ### extra note  the weird thing is that if i set firefox fennec to be the default browser then everything works   i get the expected menu item in klar  but running fennec as default sorta defeats the point of klar  ### device information xiaomi note 5 with miui latest version from fdroid

saving an image using sugar orm    hello   so  i am trying to save an image using sugarorm   i first turn it into a bytearray  and save the bytearray  and then when loading  i turn that bytearray back into a bitmap    now  all the other values i am saving works fine  and i have also tried to display the image by first making it into a byte array and then turning it back into a bitmap and then deisplaying it  this works fine  the problem arises when i to load    after loading  the bytearray gets a value  but after turning it back into a bitmap and diplaying it  it just shows a white image  and the bitmap has the value null  so something goes wrong during the conversion from bytearray to bitmap i guess  since the bytearray has some value after loading  i do not know 100  certain that this is the same value as i saved  but i cant see any reason why it would change  s  this is the code i use for saving and loading      imagetosave is a variable inside the trackedevent class   the trackedeventobject is saved from the mainactivityclass on line 439  doing this      newevent saveimage        newevent save     where newevent is an object of the type trackedevent    the rest of the code is available here  https   github com smholsen bigdaycountdown tree master app src main java com simonm bigdaycountdown  any idea on what i am doing wrong

v2 0 5 1 exception on nested projects   this is a change between 2 0 5 0 and 2 0 5 1  so i've had to go back to the earlier version to get any work done    not sure if it's relevant  but probably is    nested typescript projects  with the outermost one referencing the same files as the inner two  as a dummy that never actually gets compiled so it knows where to look for things   using grunt for building so nbts is only handling the editor side of things   after updating all of the  ts files are getting an error on the first line    unknown source root for file path to xyz ts   all of the tsconfig json files are getting this error    error communicating with node js process   there is also an unexpected exception  which looking at the two commits between releases makes me think something got missed  and is responsible for the editor warnings

tokens mistakenly pos tagged as punctuation cause wrong boundary insertion   another side effect of the issue discussed in #309 is that non punctuation tokens that are mistakenly part of speech tagged as punctuation cause a boundary to be inserted at the intonation level where there shouldn't be a boundary  this can lead to random  unnatural pauses in the middle of sentences 
parse failure  nullpointerexception   query is pretty big and i have no idea what's causing it  i don't think that's relevant anyway  imho the code should check for nulls and throw a more specific exception  otherwise we clients are left in the dark about what we're doing wrong  here's the stack trace

search parameter files created via the gui and the cli are not identical   hi guys  i hope you can help me  i am new to peptideshaker and am using the bionformatics for proteomics tutorial  april 2016  and resources you provided there to develop and and validate a command line pipeline for use on a linux cluster  i am getting very different results when i analyze the mgf file with paremeters generated with searchgui  as per the tutorial  then when using the   par provided in the resources of tutorial 1 4  i can't figure out why this is  as i assume they should be the same  when using the data provided in tutorial 1 3 but the  par i produced using searchgui  i get no ms2 quant values  and the percentage coverage for the protein q15149 i get  0 26  and only one psm  is very different from that described in the tutorial  the only difference i believe is the parameter file as i can produce the expected results when i use the  par file provided in the resources  i tried using the identificationparameterscli to produce the correct  par file as well  but am experiencing the same thing  when i load the different  par files  they all have show the same settings in the gui but seem to give very different results   i attach the  par file from tutorial 1 4  analysed using mac  java build 1 8 0_65 b17    tutorial april 2016 par txt  https   github com compomics peptide shaker files 245383 tutorial april 2016 par txt   parameters produced using searchgui as per the tutorial  using mac  java build 1 8 0_65 b17    searchgui par txt  https   github com compomics peptide shaker files 245384 searchgui par txt    screenshot 2016 05 02 15 50 58  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10395695 14958739 636d3840 108c 11e6 81a4 fc49a5c92d16 png    screenshot 2016 05 02 15 51 32  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10395695 14958740 6510737e 108c 11e6 9bc4 3630cc49d401 png   paramaters produced using peptideshaker identificationparameterscli on linux server  jdk1 8 0_31   identification par txt  https   github com compomics peptide shaker files 245379 identification par txt   i am using searchgui 2 8 4  peptideshaker 1 10 1  please not the  txt after the  par files is simply so github will let me paste them here   the original files are too big to upload easily  but if needed i will upload them using google drive   i will really appreciate feedback on this  as i hope to use these tools heavily for future work  especially the commandline interface   my current workaround on the server is to load in the working  par file from the tutorial and modify it with the parameterscli on the server  but i am unable to have luck with just searchgui or the cli alone   thanks

random qa tests failures   hi all   after merging #583 some random test failures started to appear more frequently  we had already some random failures on qa tests but they were occasional   after digging a bit i discovered that is a problem related to how liquibase script are loaded and the fact that the kapua liquibase client  is run from many different places concurrently    the kapualiquibaseclient was implemented to copy resources from the jar to a tmp directory and then execute it immediately  with the improvement contained on #583  all scripts gets copied and then executed    for the fact that kapualiquibaseclient is run from different places it can happen that the copied resources gets overwritten by another kapualiquibaseclient is executing them  with even more chance that now that apply of liquibase scripts takes a bit longer   i'll fix this making execution of liquibase script  synchronized  as a simple patch   regards   _alberto_

techreborn causes wrong amounts of redstone in jei recipes   first thanks for all the effort into making this wonderful plugin  i'll share my findings later in a more appropriate place but yah  had to be said     ever since i started my "technical minecraft" experience  i collected my own set of "tech mods"  including yours  i started to notice the wrong amounts of redstone  dust  being displayed in recipes  even official ones  like the on for the clock which you can see here     2017 01 18_14 33 09  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 25201078 22066399 2319f0de dd8d 11e6 94e1 eff3ec6f19fd png   at first i suspected something wrong in jei  but when i checked out their issue overview i noticed a closed issue dealing with the same thing where they pointed at a plugin going wrong  i removed all my "tech plugins" and for sure  everything was back to normal  so then i re added plugins one by one until i came to yours   i didn't go as far as to check the situation with only the reborncore  but my assumption was that the library is pretty passive and therefore this test wouldn't do much   hope this helps and that you can fix this 
change of aspect ratio during playback is not detected    minor issue for the sake of completeness   might also be a limitation of exoplayer   change of aspect ration during playback is not detected  i e  when watching a 16 9 programme and a subsequent broadcast is in 4 3  the picture will get stretched and the ar indicator on the info bar still says "16 9"  i guess it's the same the other way around  4 3    16 9   switching channels or stopping and restarting playback will fix this  so in general  aspect ratio detection is working fine

slow loading analysis all action   hi guys   when i try to view a list of all analyses that have been run on our sfu instance  it takes a very long time to load  i get a "processing" message and it hangs for around 10 seconds sometimes    i wanted to establish whether it would be realistic to expect it to take this long for about 1200 analyses to be listed  i'm assuming that all results are being pulled out at once and the front end framework is handling the pagination   i suspect this is a resource allocation issue for our application server but having some more insight from you guys before approaching the university team would be helpful   thanks

0 188   planning takes much longer for query involve large number of partitions   we recently upgraded our presto cluster from 0 166 to 0 188  after the upgrade  we have seen performance degradation for certain types of queries  with some investigation  it seems there is a change between the two versions in terms of the way how it generates the query plan and the get_partitions_by_names   let us say we have the below query   and a has 1000 partitions   '2018 04 02'  with 0 166   there are multiple get_partitions_by_names rpc call with each call asking for tens of partitions  and the query start executing before getting all 1000 partitions  this is usually pretty fast   with 0 188   there is a get_partitions_by_names rpc trying to fetch for all 1000 partitions  and that rpc call could take up to hundreds of seconds to finish  thus slow down the query  or even fail it because of the timeout   per the suggestion from community  we tried different things but they don't help so far  more details  https   groups google com forum # topic presto users qn2m8ogdyzi

possible memory issue with command handler  or message listeners    during outage testing some backend components  databases  redis       for our applications we noticed that from time to time applications crashed with outofdirectmemory errors thrown by netty  as netty uses direct allocated memory to bypass garbage collection and improve througput we were not able to learn which objects filled up the memory directly from the heapdump  as a consequence we added the following startup properties to our application to prevent netty from allocating direct memory     which also generated a heap dump which is summarized below     mappings2_dev_oom  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1712331 25750309 98e5fe8e 31b1 11e7 8aaa eb137c994fee png   as can be seen from the image below at the time the application crashed with an outofmemoryerror  more than 12 million instances of  com lambdaworks redis protocol commandargs keyargument  objects where available in the memory counting up to roughly 300 mb of heap memory used   an image of the largest objects view on the heap reveals that the  commandbuffer  is holding plenty of  pubsubcommandargs  objects     mappings2_dev_biggestobjects  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1712331 25750890 7a8f8a52 31b3 11e7 9197 d53fabca0061 png   on analyzing the path to gc root view from jprofiler we see that both  our apache camel component  which uses redisclient internally  and spring data redis redisconnectionfactory branch into the command method of asynccommand  the difference between these two invocations though is  that we have only a handful of apache camel objects in the heap profile while almost all other entries  at least for the couple hundred entries i've checked  are strongly referenced by  lettuce nioeventloop      mappings2_dev_path to gc root  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1712331 25753774 23bf3bf0 31bd 11e7 87f0 8116a7f1fa51 png   this indicates that there may be an issue on consuming commands via the pubsubcommandhandler or spring data rests listeners  which we use also  in cases of connection issues    if you need the heap dump   766 mb  or our redis spring configuration ping back

exploring edges differs in querygraph   i think there's a bug in querygraph  until now it is not critical  since it would be only a problem for edge based algorithms  see #158     consider one directional edge a  b  if i want to get all outgoing edges of a  i would use an edgeexplorer with an edgefilter and would get  edgeid  0  basenode  a  adjnode  b   if i would like to obtain all incoming edges of b  i would retrieve the same edge with inverted nodes   edgeid  0  basenode  b  adjnode  a   note  the edge id remains the same which is from crucial importance for edge based routing algorithms   however  using a querygraph and its virtualedgeiterator results in a different behavior  consider two virtual nodes c and d which are directly on edge 0  a  c d   b   when i request all outgoing edges from node c  i get  edgeid  x  basenode  c  adjnode  d   however  when i request all incoming edges from node d i get  edgeid    y    basenode  d  adjnode c   which is in my eyes wrong since the edgeid differs   i think the problem is  that querygraph stores to much additional edges  in this specific examples  eight additional edges have been added for both virtual nodes  four edges for c   a c  c a  c d  d c  and for edges for d   c d d c d b b d   which not only have irrelevant edges for backward direction  a c vs  c a   but also duplicate edges  c d and d c    imho  the following  new  test should pass   to be added to querygraphtest      bountysource plugin        want to back this issue     place a bounty on it   https   www bountysource com issues 1440935 exploring edges differs in querygraph utm_campaign plugin utm_content tracker 2f90869 utm_medium issues utm_source github    we accept bounties via  bountysource  https   www bountysource com  utm_campaign plugin utm_content tracker 2f90869 utm_medium issues utm_source github     bountysource plugin

service operation updateinstance should wait until operation is complete   in the  org cloudfoundry operations services services  operations implementation  the  createinstance    and  deleteinstance    methods poll for the completion of the requested operation using  lastoperationutils waitforcompletion  and return only after cc reports that the operation is complete with a  succeeded  or  failed  status  the  updateinstance    method does not follow this pattern of returning on completion  but returns immediately after initiating the operation    it would be better if  updateinstance    were consistent with the other service instance lifecycle methods

features are being generated as "unknown test suite"   i'm currently using the allure cucumber jvm adaptor version 1 5 1 to run the listener through a set of cucumber tests   when the reports are generated  i notice that only a few scenarios are recognized as behaviours  normally it's the scenarios of 2 random features  out of 10 or 12    looking around the allure results i noticed that only a couple of the testsuite xml files get the proper format     is this a known issue or am i getting something wrong on my gherkin files that are preventing the proper results generation   i noticed #21 seems to be somewhat related to what i'm getting  but i'm not really sure if we are talking about the same thing in both issues 
switching between different operating systems bungs up the libraries   when an instance is installed it will install the platform specific libraries for the operating system arch it was installed on   so when installing an instance on windows on a usb drive and then taking that to a osx computer it won't launch as it has the windows libraries   this is definitely something that could be sorted out on launch so that it doesn't require a reinstall   a very minor inconvenience but one that is definitely worth looking at

add to calendar missing for past events    2015 08 30 nb1  it seems either there is a problem with event cache gc60rzk or it is not possible to add an event which is in the past   if this is intentional i vote for removing that restriction  the missing option is not really intuitive and it should be up to the user whether he wants to add an event in the past  additionally there seem to be problems with users on some timezones  maybe erratically set on their phone  leading to fail to add it due to the missing menu

hashcodeplugin not working in 0 11 0 anymore   i tried to get the  hashcode  plugin working  not the  simplehashcode   and noticed  that changing a  boolean   not  boolean   value doesn't lead to a new hashcode  after taking a look into the generated sourcecode i found out  that for  boolean   probably all primitives  the generated code sets the  valueset  argument always to  true   looking into the runtime libraries i saw that  valueset    true  means  that the original value isn't considered when calculating the hashcode   i rolled back to 0 10 0 and tested it again    hashcode is working  so there might be a problem through this new  valueset  attribute   i assume that either this part might be wrong   hashcodeplugin java 216     or the handling of the  valueset  attribute in  defaulthashcodestrategy java 155   mistakenly i looked yesterday in the  simplehashcode  class and the  valueset  attribute is calculated there differently    simplehashcodeplugin java 108   i already added a note there  the code there might be false  too   if you need more information just ask  smiley

"show user's posts" filter shows other posts  rewrites thread in db   ok  i've found out why you sometimes get a bunch of random posts following a specific user's posts  and it ain't pretty  what basically happens is    the call goes to the site for a specific user's posts in the current thread   the site returns a new 'version' of the thread  only containing that user's posts   we parse the first page of that thread  scraping all the metadata   total number of pages  number of posts on the page  etc   this rewrites the thread metadata   now it looks like the thread has shrunk  the number of read unread posts changes  a massive thread can become a 2 page one and the entry in the thread list reflects all this   then the page is handed over to the post parser   because it thinks this is page 1  it starts overwriting the post entries in the page 1 index range  the same happens if you go to page 2 of the filtered thread  and so on  the upshot is the start of the thread basically gets rewritten in the db  as you view the pages of the filtered version    but   because the rest of the thread's post entries are still in the database  when the thread view comes to display a filtered page  it requests the posts in that page's range   if those posts weren't all overwritten with the filtered ones  the rest will be the original posts for that page  probably by other people  you can test all this by taking a large thread  preferably with an unread count visible   filtering on a user's posts  and then looking back at the thread list   the page and unread counts will have changed  and the last page will probably have other people's posts at the end  you have to view the 'full' thread again to fix it   and if you don't do the 'hit the back button' thing  the unread count will be messed up  the overwritten posts stay that way until you reload that page from the site       anyway i can see why it works this way  because of how the thread display system works   it literally reads pages of posts from the db  so you have to overwrite them to change what it's displaying  not easy to fix without rewriting the whole system  i'm trying to change the way the read unread counts are calculated  but the rest is too strongly tied into the database structure   it needs abstracting

sorting filter does not get saved   after a certain point in the list the sorting just resets  this happens everytime and with every mod near the bottom of the list with many mods installed  especially with modpacks  mods near the top of the list work just fine  i know you are aware of the issue but as a temporary fix let me suggest something since you already added some wildcard functionality     as wildcard    as oredictionary    let us use the nei system of adding mod names for example if a mod does not sort by ticking the checkbox then entering  "modname" would still sort it to the corresponding chest

best way to cancel a request   i have just started using of robospice and had run into an issue  my setup is as follows    an activity that has spicemanager in control  start stop in onresume onpause    fragmenttabhost in that activity with 5 fragments using spicemanager to fetch data   every of the 5 fragments has a call to spicemanager dontnotifyanyrequestlisteners   in onpause   so they won't receive any callback when they cannot update their ui   fragments implement requestlistener and onrequestsuccess onrequestfailure methods   my retry policy is set to 0 retries   if request fails  just don't retry anymore  one important thing here is that fragments in fragmenttabhost are retained by design  so when i am on fragment#1  switch to fragment#2 and then go back to fragment#1 then #1 object is not recreated  it is reused  this results in a fact that when i pass in 'this'  which is the fragment itself  as a callback into spicemanager asynchronous execute request method then swapping between tabs won't invalidate those callback listeners  they will be the same instances for as long as activity is not recreated along with fragmenttabhost   what i do to crash it is that i switch the device to offline mode and try to jump between tabs and watch for the results  if i switch between the tabs with some reasonable speed  then everything works fine  problems start when i speed up  then  something like this happens  1  select tab#1  request#1 created in fragment#1  fragment#1 this passed as a callback listener 2  switch to tab#2 3  request#1 should be cancelled asynchronously by spicemanager dontnotifyanyrequestlisteners   in fragment#1 onpause method  3  immediately switch to tab#1 4  request#1 from step 1  just finishes and before even ui will get recreated using fragments lifecycle methods oncreateview   etc  i get a callback to onrequestfailure which tries to update ui that is not yet created resulting in a crash  i think the problem might be with the fact that dontnotifyanyrequestlisteners is asynchronous as described in the docs source code and that is why responses are able to get received nevertheless  i have also tried to use cancel request  methods and others  no success   the only solution for this appears to be to have some boiler plate code in every fragment that i have and have something like this     same thing would be for onrequestsuccess as it also did happen when being online  offline is just easier to reproduce the issue as responses come back quickly    root cause however is the fact that response reaches the fragment even though fragment is in a wrong state and its lifecycle is not considered in terms of response delivery   any ideas on what i am doing wrong  or what i should do to have it robust   thanks  maciej

fix shading   tests   as partially expected  #157 didn't quite fix the guava shading issue   i have created a work branch  shade dependencies  to attempt to fix this  i think it might be working for jenkins  but it fails if you run the tests  which i don't understand  i have not tried with any kind of security   broadly  the issue is this   we use docker java  docker java has a number of dependencies  some of these dependencies  notably guava and http commons  clash with jenkins' own  and because the plugin infrastructure follows a 'jenkins first  then plugin'  this causes all manner of class not found fails    we are not the first people to come across this  i have cheerfully ripped the pattern from jclouds plugin  which generates a shaded jar and then uses that   i have not tested thoroughly  particularly it is currently failing when the tests are run  with  for example      jglick had useful stuff to say on the mailing list and may have some insight into what's going on above   thomassuckow was also working on this 
stellarsky conflict with optifine displays minecraft clock incorrectly   when sciapi   stellarsky are on the server… clients would connect  and their minecraft clock weren't working  the animation always showed "noon"    the temporary fix is to go into video settings  turn animations off… disconnect from the server… turn them back on in the main menu  and then reconnect to the server   the problem doesn't return  until the client quits minecraft and starts it up again  if they don't quit mc  then the problem won't return and they are able to see the correct time  even if they relog on the server   the problem dates back to last march  but then it disappeared after i did an update to my server this summer  since updating again  the problem has resurfaced   outside chance that it was broken in forge 1230  fixed in forge 1291  and then it broke again in forge 1448…  but i can't remember for sure if those updates coincide with the problem    the problem doesn't occur if i remove optifine  and leave stellar sky in  the problem also doesn't occur if i remove stellar sky  and leave optifine in

fusion reactor temperature resetting after a few seconds   im on version 2 7a of nuclearcraft on all the mods 3 and i put down a fusion reactor and started it up once  let it go for a minute and then shut it off because i had to leave and wasnt sure i could keep it cool enough to not melt since i was using active liquid coolers with water and the efficiency in the reactor still said 0  fast forward 3 days  i go to turn the reactor on since i can spend time seeing what i did wrong and now the thing wont start  i put down any number of power cells or even fluxducts universal cables connected to powercells and no matter what  the temperature starts going up but after a few seconds it resets and starts from 0  but it doesnt reset my battery's charge  it keeps drawing power but keeps resetting back to 0 temp  also as a side note  in walia  its saying that 2 of the output tanks have a bucket each of deuterium and tritium  my fuels of choice  and i cant seem to get them out even by breaking the reactor block

triple click doesn't select paragraph  caretselectionbindimpl movetoparend wrongly calculates position   triple clicking a paragraph should select it  this works fine if you triple click the first paragraph  if you click any other paragraph  it will select some text before that paragraph   this could be due to the fact that caretselectionbindimpl movetoparend doesn't take into account that the cursor may not be in the first paragraph  it calculates new position as   int newpos   getarea   getparagraphlength getparagraphindex      this position is ok _relative to_ the current paragraph  but the next line  moveto  apparently expects _absolute position_   moveto newpos  selectionpolicy    compare that with moveto in movetoparstart   moveto getposition     getcolumnposition    selectionpolicy    in other words  moveto in movetoparend should probably be   moveto newpos + getposition     getcolumnposition    selectionpolicy

strange encoding in 'data view' tab   hello   after testing dbeaver 3 6 8  standalone  i've encountered very strange encoding issue of 'data view' tab durning table editing  it seems to encode result sets data always with iso 8859 1  latin 1    my data base is encoded using iso 8859 2  latin 2  and i'm running dbeaver on windows_7_64 and java 8   changing option in '  preferences    database    result sets    binaries    string encoding'   doesn't affect on data view at all  my tests revealed that this combo box is actually dummy    when i set db connection encoding attribute to latin 2 it makes totally mess  i cannot decode it properly with any editor    i've even changed jvm default encoding properties to iso 8859 2  by editing 'dbeaver ini' file  and they seem to load ok  example from '  installation details  '     file encoding iso 8859 2   sun jnu encoding iso 8859 2   but still result set is encoded with iso 8859 1   furthermore  i think this issue messed up the export to   cvs functionality  dbeaver thinks now that strings are binaries and it puts nulls to output   are there any workarounds   regards from poland  bartek

pullerinternal processinbox issue   hi there   i've been trying to find a sure way to replicate this but nothing concrete at all  this is not a crash but something that will block my entire db operation until everything is done  the output is as follows     i am seeing a ton of these in logcat  the pullerinternal saying no remote revisions to fetch  and it will keep going until the lastinboxsequence goes close to the number of documents i have in the database  the number "141245" is the number of document in my couch database in the tablet  i have about 240k documents in my remote database   the first number in the pattern  i e  "4 0 0 0"  indicates the getchangescount   from pull replicator object     question 1    what exactly is it doing  trying to find the best checkpoint to continue syncing     question 2    any ideas why this is taking forever to finish  its constantly hitting the remote database as well  constant data usage  either to get _changes or _revs_diff  usually takes 45min to finish off   cheers kien

tomcat never starts with pushy 0 4 3   i am upgrading from 0 4 to 0 4 3 using apache tomcat version 8 0 15 when starting with 0 4    no problem but after a while  some push notification are never received  without any error logged  trace level   so i gave a try to 0 4 3 as you seem to say that there has been improvements regarding threadlocal cleanup and overall support of using pushy in a web container   when starting with 0 4 3 my server keeps waiting after the line "pushmanager connection succeeded  apnsconnection   "   and eventually shuts down  if i don't change anything but the lib version back to 0 4  everything works fine     the strange thing is that with 0 4  i do not have the line "apns gateway rejected notification with      missing_token "  but i do have some shutdown problem as tomcat never stopped and i was forced to kill it  i guess that error is "normal" as it says it was sending a "known bad" notification  even though i did never receive the response in 0 4   now with 0 4 3 it does not start and i am in trace level and cannot really see any log about what is going wrong   is there anything that should be changed regarding configuration   setup when migrating from 0 4 to 0 4 3

sync directory gets clogged with syncany's temporary files   hello  i'm new to syncany  i'm trying to work with the latest alpha 1 1 on windows  i have syncany's bat file in path  i've been able to successfully configure webdav on remote machine using nginx  my repository gets created and everything is well  but if i try to sync the files from the same folder my repository is in  syncany creates a number of temporary files in the current directory such as  syncany syncanydblocal db data syncany syncanydblocal db lck syncany syncanydblocal db log syncany syncanydblocal db properties syncany syncanydblocal db script and a folder syncany syncanydblocal db tmp eventually it all gets uploaded to the remote and any changes then result in a conflict  which cannot be resolved due to the fact that files are in use at the moment or synchronization   there's a workaround for this problem  if i change the working directory to any other outside my sync directory and then use   localdir option  everything is fine   maybe i can also place those files in  syignore  but i haven't tried that yet

fission reactor fuel consumption   hello  when i input fuel into any fission reactor for the first time it will consume the fuel without giving a depleted fuel or power output  also if i insert a full stack it will be completely consumed in a sec and there will be no power depleted fuel output  redstone signal doesnt affect it  will happen when reactor is on or off  this really makes automation difficult since i cant change the type of fuel that goes into the fission reactor unless i do it manually  if i just pipe a new type of fuel into a reactor it will just be consumed without any output until i place one manually and reactor updates  ended up making a different reactor for each fuel type  thx

grip crashes upon startup   when i run grip from robot code  in c++  i sometimes get the following error message     this seems to happen randomly because it will sometimes return success  this will also sometimes happen when i try to run grip directly after deploying it through the ui 
async learning w  history processor is broken    when attempting to use a3cdiscreteconv or asyncnstepqlearningdiscreteconv with a history processor  the history processor is ignored and therefore the input data won't match the shape of the network input and you'll get an error like this    org deeplearning4j exception dl4jinvalidinputexception  cannot do forward pass in convolution layer  layer name   0  layer index   1   input array depth does not match cnn layer configuration  data input depth   240   minibatch inputdepth height width   1  240  320  3   expected input depth   1     the cause is rooted in a few places  the most glaring is that the history processor is never set on the "asyncthreaddiscrete" class in both a3cdiscreteconv and asyncnstepqlearningdiscreteconv     notice "at" is not returned  but instead another new thread       but even after fixing that  the code in asyncthreaddiscrete doesn't properly use the history processor   i've attempted to fix it myself  and i can get the code to not crash  but the learning didn't seem to be converging  although that could be because i was trying a3c with only 2 threads    i'm happy to submit a pr for this  but would probably need some pointers as to the intentions of the code asyncthreaddiscrete trainsubepoch

combat tag bug   you can break a block and "glitch" inside it and they get taken out of combat 
strictmode for vertices   hi  i want to use strictmode for vertices in a graph db  i do the following     i figured linklist is the only type that works here  i try  create edge from  select from v1  to  select from v2   again and it works  i even can create a second edge with  create edge from  select from v1  to  select from v2    but as soon as i start deleting edges  the trouble begins   delete edge #10 0  works fine  but when i try to delete the second edge with  delete edge #10 1  i get the error   "com orientechnologies orient core exception ovalidationexception  the field 'v1 out_' has been declared as linklist but an incompatible type is used  value   v2#16 0 in_  1   v5 "     so the in_ and out_ linklist can't be empty  this is strange  how can i use vertices in strictmode then  or am i doing the whole thing entirely wrong

downsides of software serial libraries   the default arduino softwareserial library proved to be non tolerant with simple libraries when used for ble communication  even more so with fairly complex libraries on top of that    we switched to paul stoffregen's altsoftserial library and things have been great    till now  from the documentation    softwareserial would break with relatively low complexity i2c communication using arduino's wire library  it proved impossible to use with the ad5933 library for similar reasons   altsoftserial works very well in this regard  but as we begin to write multiple sampling rates and frequency sweeps that request timer interrupts and reset commands to the ad5933  more frequently  the time window for interrupts to be handled shrink considerably   with the sketch ble_debug_timer that just carries a psuedo sine signal  setting a sampling rate of 90 hz is no issue  z_ble_3 however that has to measure and send impedance values  breaks at sampling rates over 80 hz and completely garbles serial communication with altsoftserial library  you only need to look at arduino's serial monitor to see the gibberish it spouts and functions it calls that it really shouldn't   we therefore probably need to move to the arduino mega for development and use the multiple hardware serial port it provides for ble communication   all this of course is a working hypothesis  i will be testing my claims tomorrow in lab  but i'm fairly certain they're right from past experience with softwareserial and altsoftserial    on we go again

personal anchors rarely keep chunks loaded    on my server  the only chunk loaders allowed are personal anchors because they are a lot less "op" then chickenchunks  and they don't keep chunks loaded forever like world anchors  though since i made that change  i've been getting some reports about anchors being very unreliable  they are supposed to keep chunks loaded until you log off  but they appear to do so only half of the time   i set up a 2 turtles about 1000 blocks away on my local server and put a world anchor next to one and a personal anchor next to another  i left the area for about 30 minutes  then came back  the world anchor was still going as normal  but the personal anchor had stopped   i'm not sure if this has any relation to #857  but i figured i would report it just in case  i also hear that quarries are being unloaded as well  but haven't tested that yet

minefantasy 2 + ars magica 2   so there seems to be an issue with minefantasy 2 causing some of ars magicas effects to not work  such as the chain component  im sure you a familiar with ars magica 2 so i probably dont have to explain what the chain component is supposed to do  but what it does do with mf2 installed is instead of the chain bouncing from one mob to another  it only hits one mob  then shows the animation of it jumping to the next but deals no damage  however it seems to only be an issue with mobs as the spells seem to work against players just fine  im not sure if this could be solved with a simple config edit  i have set every setting in mf2 and ars magica to false which has done absolutely nothing   its very anger inducing as im trying to make a modpack and i dont want to remove either of these great mods   any ideas on what i could do    edit  now that i look at the problem even deeper  minefantasy seems to cause an issue where any ars magica spell that would damage more than one entity simply wont  even area of effect spells for some reason only deal damage to one mob even if shot in the middle of a group of mobs   edit edit  i really dont want to remove this mod  its a great mod  but its destroying ars magica  there has to be something minefantasy 2 changes that deals with damage  i tried turning all the config options to false  but that didnt help  maybe you or some addon developer could somehow code a config to disable whatever feature in minefantasy deals with damage to let ars take priority or something along those lines in the next update for 1 7 10  just something to make the two more compatible

spring fox causing exception with pageable   currently using spring fox 2 9 2  my organization is using spring boot 1 4 1  but i've duplicated this issue with 2 0 5  the most current version  we tried to add spring's built in pagination to our project here and found that we were getting beaninstantiationexceptions on the pageable argument  after some tinkering we determined that this only happened if spring boot was aware of a swagger config   searches have revealed several issues with spring fox and pageable not showing the quite the right parameters  pagenumber instead of page  for example  but nothing about actual exceptions  is there a workaround for this  i'm really not looking forward to trying to make my own implementation of pageable   thanks  great api other than  y'know  this one problem

classloader not closed     describe the bug   during builds  a classloader created by the quarkus maven plugin is not closed completely  thus not releasing the jars after the build  this can cause problems when embedding maven   this mainly happens when using concurrent builds and a maven daemon  this always occurs the second time    this means that a reference to a zip file is not released correctly  even though the classloader created by quarkus is correctly closed      expected behavior   the classloader is closed     actual behavior  
 conditional flow  conditional flow inside of conditional flow   ## this is a      pre  code      feature request     regression  a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release   x  bug report       please search github for a similar issue or pr before submitting         documentation issue or request   code   pre   ## description do we support conditional flow inside of conditional flow  if so  we have to rework ui because it is not usable in such situation   basically it is not scalable with multiple conditional flows inside one  there is no button to go to parent condition  only primary flow  and if i add conditional flow into multiple conditions  it gets even more messy and navigation between them has to be done from primary flow or user has to remember names of the conditions 
validation of partitioncomponents fails for simple types   if the partition key cotains simple types  int boolean long      it is not possible to do a sliced query since the validation of the components fails   the problematic code is in info archinnov achilles internal metadata holder partitioncomponents  2 occurences      this fails if the components is of type "int" because the method takes object    as argument and int would be casted to integer   this implementation would also fail in case of inheritance  e g  if the component is of type java util date and one would pass a subclass like java sql timestamp

duplicate keys after chained reducers   hi guys   i'm trying to create the homework assignment for my course and as example i wanted to write a pact job that computes the degree distribution of a graph   how many vertices have outdegree x   the input is a file with "source target" ids per line    i have a map that parses the data and emits  vertexid  1   then a reduce that sums up the degree per vertexid and emits  degree  1   the last reduce sums up the counts per degree and emits  degree  count  pairs  unfortunately  i see duplicates in the output    i checked my code but can't see any problem  it would be super important for me to have this fixed soon   here's the code   https   github com sscdotopen graphmining with ozone blob master src main java de tuberlin dima aim3 graphmining outdegreedistribution java

problem when installed on win and profile has spaces   have a problem when it installed on windows and profile has spaces  after installed dbeaver 3 6 9 it was created a new profile folder where spaces are encoded as ' 20'  it is reset all settings  because previous settings are in the other folder   example  profile name 'sergey and marina' become as 'sergey 20and 20marina' folder where only new ' dbeaver' folder placed   p s  thank you for dbeaver developing  support and maintenance 
 request  support for partially transparent overlays  alpha blending    if i'm not mistaken  right now the overlay alpha is interpreted as a binary all or nothing  where any overlay pixel with alpha   0 is discarded and anything with alpha   0 just fully overrides the rgb of the original texture  for most vanilla style ores this is perfectly fine  but there are a few mod or texture pack ore textures for which an overlay texture could imo greatly benefit from alpha blending for visually smoother integration onto the original texture 
passing class x     varargs parameter causes "unchecked generics array creation" warning   varargs are just syntactic sugar for arrays  so using them in combination with generic types  this will always make the compile emit an "unchecked generics array creation" warning if you call these methods  this happens in several places in cyclops react   for example  the four  fn0    fn3  implementations in  cyclops function fluentfunctions   i e   fluentsupplier    fluentfunction    fluentbifunction  and  fluenttryfunction   all have a  lifttry  method taking a vararg  class x   argument  of course  we know this is safe  but perhaps there is a better way  i can think of a few    providing several overloaded forms  for one  class x    for two  for three         adding a fluent api to call once for every  class x    this is not a huge problem  but having to add   suppresswarnings "unchecked"   hurts a little every time i do it

high cpu bug correlation with failed cloud messaging event   you mentioned this bug to me on irc a month or so ago before i switched back from unifiednlp to gmscore  so when it first happened i just figured i'd disable the checkin feature as i needed battery life to be reliable at the time  i recently re enabled it along with cloud messaging after seeing a commit that stated checkin had been fixed  but i hadn't been able to tell if it was working or not as i only have one app that utilizes it  slack  which i also get email notifications for    i'm out right now so i unfortunately wasn't able to collect a logcat  but i can say that i had no occurrences of the high cpu bug for a day or so until a few minutes ago when i received the first email notification i've gotten from slack since re enabling checkin cloud messaging  via imap idle  so i get it right away   which failed to notify me through the app via cloud messaging  at this point my cpu immediately spiked  and it remained high until i rebooted  after checking top to see that the culprit was indeed gmscore   i'll try enabling checkin and cloud messaging again when i have a reliable power source nearby next week  but i hope this helps narrow the potential causes of the bug down for now   cheers

can't prevent users from stealing   i have a craftbukkit server with a normal map called "world" and a special map called "eventos"  in this world i have a lot of games like mobarena  spleef and  of course  battlearena based games    the players use the commands to join these arenas and then they are teleported to the waitroom where they select the class they want to play  the problem comes when they use commands like home or spawn  they teleport to their homes and steal all the equipment of the selected class placing it in a chest  i've tried using the "disabledqueuecommands" option at the config yml file and and placing the "noteleport" and "noworldchange" options at the defaults  onjoin  onopen or onprestart stages from the  arena config yml file but none of them are working  what can i do   this is an amazing plugin but if i'm not able to fix this issue i think i will have to discard it

abstractstatemachine getstate   returns unexpected value for terminal states   when calling getstate   on abstractstatemachine the behaviour is unexpected where the current state is a terminal state  the method is defined as follows in the 1 2 x branch currently    this means that when the state machine is in a terminal state  it returns the   previous   state  it is not clear to me why someone would want this behaviour  but more seriously it means that when using persistence the wrong value is stored in the statemachinecontext for the current state  having thought about this a bit i can see that perhaps a caller may want to be able to know the current state  including pseudo states  and also the most recent non pseudo state  which i don't think is possible currently   however the above is not clear in my opinion

 bug  too much capacitor banks crashing server permanently   hopefully this heading sums up the problem adequatly   i am using the latest enderio with the 3 tiers of capacitor banks  which are great and reduce the server load a lot   but they do lack a message if there block limit was hit within a multiblock if there is any  or just start a new multiblock structure like the capacitorbanks before   so here is the problem   i placed a lot of capacitorbanks  doesn't matter what tier  a lot means between 8000 and 13000  and while i'm online they do work either fine or crash the server instantly and as soon as i stop the server and try to start it again  or if the server crashed directly  i get the following error that i do not get if i have less capacitor banks in that multiblock

destination dir of compilejava changed too eagerly if kotlin plugin applied   i have a project where the kotlin plugin is applied but there are no main kotlin sources  only test kotlin sources   however  applying this module plugin causes the destination directory of  compilejava  to be changed to that of  compilekotlin  which breaks my build   the culprit in this plugin resides here  https   github com java9 modularity gradle modules plugin blob 4014f02a411fc4f3a4981bcc69677e10e892ab30 src main java org javamodularity moduleplugin tasks compilejavataskmutator java#l44 l46  and this is how i worked around this problem in my project  https   github com tlinkowski tlinkowski superpom blob 4a692ac44ba0a78dd838aacdb7055e50112f6dbf subprojects my superpom gradle plugin src main kotlin pl tlinkowski gradle my superpom internal plugin eagerdestinationdirmodificationfixplugin kt#l51 l67  to sum up  it seems to me that it'd be safest if this plugin changed the destination dir of  compilejava    only if       compilekotlin  is present  like now     and     there are some sources in  src main kotlin     and     there's only  module info java  in  src main java

java error  wrong casting when executing ant foraging  classic  model
is this a bug or a mistake in the comments  or  am i doing it wrong     i'm using jersey2 to handle my rest calls so  that gives me the option to handle them async  those requests calls are translated in commands placed on a command bus and eventually  a result needs to come back and returned through jersey  the command bus is constructed with a publishsubject and so is the result bus where i'm posting the results   regularly  i'm seeing timeouts happening in my logs and i narrowed the problem down in the following simple test case      first question  am i doing it wrong  is publishsubject not suited for this  it works if multiple tasks are published though until it gets unsubscribed   alternatively  what are my options  looking at the other subjects  i think they don't do what i want  i don't want them to hold state for a while  it should just receive and pass on    i noticed there's an internal class created to solve a same problem with groupedobservables  being  bufferuntilsubscriber   any help would be much appreciated

more engines types    hi  i’m here for a few suggestions to improve engines    electric engines  they come with a json defined battery  to be recharged they don’t need lava but redstone  maybe let it support rf from other mods  the « fuel pump » will be a charger fed with redstone dust    nuclear engines  boats  submarines  trin frog  there will allways be a use for nuclear powered engines  as minecraft doesn’t have any radioactive stuff  maybe use dragon breath or glowstone as « fuel »   i know technically nuclear powered engines are electric engines  so maybe make the nuclear power supply a part as the same title as batteries for electric engines  just slightly bigger  
s3mock overwrites file data with acl xml on 'putobject'   first of all   great code   helps a lot with debugging s3 code locally   while trying to use  s3browser  https   s3browser com   with the mock as a server i encountered a problem with uploading files  which translates to calling the  filestorecontroller#putobject  endpoint   after some debugging i found out the following   the application invokes  putobject    twice     once with file contents and once again with an xml that contains acl data  the code does not distinguish between the 2 calls and thus overwrites the original file data with the acl xml content   a quick analysis of the requests shows that there are some differences between the requests in the headers   which do not seem definitive enough to provide a distinction  however  there is one significant difference that seems to be most indicative that the call with the acl contains an  acl  parameter  i e    put  some path to bucket acl     for the time being i "patched" my code locally by checking if there is an  acl  parameter  and if so ignore the payload and return the  s3object  that was generated when the file data was uploaded  i do believe though that it should be handled somehow  perhaps the acl is required somewhere else   i just did not encounter such a need    as a side note   i looked for some documentation on this rest call but could not find any  i did not look very deep though due to lack of time    
question  how to use extended types as return values from services   hello  i am trying to setup a demo for work on using micronaut as our micro services framework  and have a couple of questions  wasn't sure if this is the right place to ask  so please let me know if there's a better forum for this   i have setup a simple application with 3 projects  'api'  'gateway' and 'service'  i based my code on reading combinations of the tutorial in the notes  the workshop and the petstore   i setup a "product" as an interface in kotlin  with id name fields  as the main type that all apis would use for methods  e g          data     interface product            val id  string          val name  string            class realproduct pid  string  pname  string    product           override val id   pid         override val name   pname               api interface     interface productoperations t  product             get " "          fun listproducts    single list t                 gateway client      client id   "productcatalogue"  path   " products"      interface productclient   productoperations product            override fun listproducts    single list product                 gateway controller      get " products"      fun products     single list product             return productclient listproducts                 service      override fun listproducts    single list product             return single just listof realproduct "1"  "name1"   realproduct "2"  "name2"           in my first attempt above  it failed  the gateway controller was causing fallback behaviour on receiving the values from the service  if i hit the service endpoint directly  i was getting the json results i expected  but not the gateway  the only type that worked was flowable list   product      the following caused fallbacks on other methods i tried  single  product    maybe  product    flowable  product     to fix this  i had to change the interface to an open class for product instead  and at which point all the above cases were correct  not falling back  and returning the data i required  i don't understand why though  particularly when the service calls work directly  but maybe it's the interaction from gateway to service and it being an interface  not a concrete class   however  i then wanted to allow the services to return extended product versions that may have additional fields  is this possible  my attempts to do this returned only the product fields in the eventual json response and not the extended fields of the subclass   e g          type definition     class productwithdesc pid  string  pname  string  val desc  string    product pid  pname          gateway controller and client both as before         get " products"      fun products     single list product             return productclient listproducts                 service  returning extended type      override fun listproducts    single list product             return single just listof productwithdesc "1"  "name1"  "desc1"   productwithdesc "2"  "name2"  "desc2"                  this returns the json        "id" "1" "name" "name1"   "id" "2" "name" "name2"    i can't change the service to return single  list  productwithdesc     because that causes a compilation error  as it doesn't override single  list  product    also i don't want to as i want to be able to return all kinds of sub types that may have richer sets of data   i'm not sure if this is a generic problem i haven't found a solution to  or a micronaut reactive one  i'm guessing there's a better pattern to this    any advice on the above 2 issues  a  not being able to use interface  b  not seeing sub class fields   many thanks

configuration locale change after back from intentintegrator initiatescan     greetings and thank you for the good work with this library  i have used it in an app i am working on and i really admire your work with this  i am running into a problem now and i can't find a way to deal with it  in the app i set the configuration locale to be internal of the app  independent from the device locale  i do it like this   public void setlocale string lang        mylocale   new locale lang       resources res   getresources        displaymetrics dm   res getdisplaymetrics        configuration conf   res getconfiguration        conf locale   mylocale      res updateconfiguration conf  dm      it all goes well  the locale changes but than when i do initiatescan   and when camera opens i press the back button  than the strange thing happens  locale gets reverted back to the device default   intentintegrator scanintegrator   new intentintegrator this   scanintegrator setorientation activityinfo screen_orientation_portrait   scanintegrator initiatescan     i have tried using other startactivityforresult just to be sure if i should write this to you or not   after trying it did not happen like the case i just described regarding the case with the interaction with your library  sample other startactivityforresult      intent pickcontactintent   new intent intent action_pick  uri parse "content   contacts"    pickcontactintent settype contactscontract commondatakinds phone content_type      show user only contacts w  phone numbers startactivityforresult pickcontactintent  79    the version of the library i am using is 2 3 0 and the exact dependencies i have are     do you have any idea why the configuration is changing to the  device default configuration locale in particular  and how can i correct this behavior in my app  again thank you for the library and for the hard work

does not index anything in 8 1   version 1 2 worked perfectly with nb 8 0 2  since updating to 1 3 0 5 and nb 8 1  i have been unable to match   any   file  regardless of what pattern i type   regardless of the size of the project  clicking the reindex button produces the "indexing project files" spinner for only the briefest fraction of a second  it appears as if it is not actually doing anything   this is in the ui log at startup     but still no files match   the settings for 8 1 were automatically imported from 8 0 2  if that makes a difference  but i have uninstalled and reinstalled the plugin multiple times  including from a manual download of the  nbm file — i assume this would clear the prefs and any cached data    do you have any idea what the problem is  i've had to revert to nb 8 0 2 just to get some work done…

mediachunks list handling in chunksamplesource is not robust against initial sample skipping   in the  readdata  method of  chunksamplesource   some entries of the  mediachunks  member are  sometimes  removed in this section     now  if some samples are skipped initially  e g  if the content does not start with a sync sample   the read index can be higher than the value returned by  mediachunks get 1  getfirstsampleindex     avoiding the removal of chunks from the list in general  this leads to a wrong assignment of  currentchunk    i guess it could simply be solved by making the      a       which at least works for me

word wrap turns off each time i set focus outside a tab   i'm using word wrap with eclipse luna on osx  all works fine except one thing  any loss of focus from a tab with a ‘word wrapped’ file turns the feature in that file off  that’s despite that all three ticks in preferences are checked and that word wrap by default works in a file  which is restored at eclipse launch   the bug occurs not just when i switch between multiple files in tabs  but also when i focus on any other view  e g   package explorer or search results  thus  i sometimes have to press cmd+alt+e a few times a minute  which is a bit distracting  surprisingly word wrap does not disable itself when i switch to another app and then return to the same tab in eclipse   i installed the plugin for luna from scratch and did all eclipse cleaning procedures described on the help page  but that gave no results   what can be wrong

first attempt at debugging support   hi folks  i've been learning about the debugging support of robovm the last few weeks  i've no idea to what this will lead  just wanted to give you a quick heads up   the basic blocks are described in this blog post  https   robovm com robovm 1 0 released commercial licenses a look under the hood  i also found a public llvm ir robovm debug dump online which helped reverse engineering the internals  http   pastebin com uhpkebng  with this info an a little bit of reverse engineering i was able to put back the _bchookinstrumented calls before every statement in the llvm ir  analog to your work with the shadowframeplugin    this is needed for setting breakpoints  works already      see  https   github com florianf robovm blob master compiler compiler src main java org robovm compiler plugin debug debuginstrumentplugin java  i also started a dummy implementation of the debug client that talks to the integrated robovm debugger  see  https   github com florianf robovm tree master plugins eclipse ui src debug server  currently i'm working on adding lldb debugging metadata  but not yet finished  currently llvm crashes when compiling with this metadata    see  https   github com florianf robovm blob master compiler compiler src main java org robovm compiler plugin debug debuginformationplugin java  all tests were made on linux with a simple robovm console application    many questions are still open    how are long double 32bit 64bit sizes handled in the debugger    how are stack variables read via the debugger  extracted via soot and then the offset calculated  any ideas    how are the linetables for methods generated out of the lldb debugging information    etc   thanks for your work   time

app not selecting sim and call not connecting   ### description i tapped a number from my contacts list to place a call and discovered the number started dialing without asking which sim card i wanted to use  that isn't the main point because the app might be designed that way  and if not  then it can be seen as a bug  however  the main issue is that the dialed number will start reading and no call will be placed  that means the call is not connecting    ### expected behaviour  my expectation was to use either of my sim card for calls  and also see the dialled call connected   ### steps to reproduce  after launching the app    accept the whole permission   dial a number from your contact list and note the behavior  the call will start  without asking to select sim card and the call will not be connected     ### device used  techno spark k7 os  android 7 0  ### reproducing the behavior https   youtu be nxew0 xngtk

modular routers   carry on 1st person item rendering   hi  modular routers author here   you might have noticed a comment on curseforge from silverdarkblade regarding  1st person  rendering problems when holding carryable blocks  plain white or completely missing textures for the carried block    i've done some research  and discovered that modular routers particle rendering code is definitely related to this problem  although i haven't figured out whether it's me or you at fault yet     anyway  the specific line that causes the problems is https   github com desht modularrouters blob mc1 12 master src main java me desht modularrouters client fx fxsparkle java#l61      comment that out  and the problem disappears   this code is called during particle drawing  which is run from a   renderworldlastevent   event handler   i guess the question is  why does binding a texture to do some drawing work affect your rendering of held blocks   i haven't looked at your code  but i presume you're rendering the block from a   renderworldlastevent   handler which runs after mine   and somehow that bound texture is messing the rendering up   anyway  thought i'd put this here and see if you have a better idea about it than me

how to use methoddelegation for interface type   hi  i am new to use byte buddy  and i use it to write a java agent  but now i meet some problems with using methoddelegation for interface type  sample code like this     it works well with an specific implemented subclass type like  org springframework web servlet mvc method abstracthandlermethodadapter   but when i change it to the supper interface type  i will get an exception   java lang illegalstateexception  cannot only define public  static  final field 'delegate k8sj6c0' for interface type    i know byte buddy will use asm to create a  public static volatile  delegate filed  as the picture which is shown below  when the target type is  class   but it looks like that byte buddy will do the same logic for the  interface  type     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 20675747 66988314 e79ca500 f0f4 11e9 9631 cc3203eafc0d png   i wonder how to enhance the interface type in byte buddy  looking forward to your reply  thank you very much 
anr on speficic devices when surfaceview visibility is set to gone since version 2 5 0   ### issue description we recently updated the exoplayer version in our app from 2 4 0 to 2 6 1  after that we got a lot of anr reports in the developer console  mostly from the huawei p8 lite   this is important  on most devices the error doesn't occur  but on this and a couple others it happens every time you try to set up the player    when setting up the player  the stream starts running  you can hear the sound  but the video is not being rendered   the first frame is shown but stuck  as soon as there is an attempt to interact  the anr is triggered and the app does not respond anymore   after a lot of time spent investigating the problem  sorry for the whining but it was painful 😄   we found out that setting the visibility of the  surfaceview  during the loading time of the player is causing the problem   textureview is fine  happening only with  surfaceview   we tracked it down  the anr happens since exoplayer version 2 5 0 and ever since  before that  until 2 4 4  it is not a problem   we set the visibility to show some loading screen stuff as long as the stream needs to load  we can probably work around that but i thought it would be interesting to know what is causing the problem  especially since it's only happening for special devices   ### reproduction steps we could reproduce the problem on a slightly modified version of the demo app  here is a fork of the exoplayer project with the necessary changes  we didn't release the player here in onpause because we reuse the instance in our app to show different streams   https   github com ba a exoplayer  the commit with the changes  https   github com ba a exoplayer commit 56af4de5bc3980f0182ee1c4c2456ca01329553a  to reproduce    open the app    start any video  f e  youtube dash  google glass   press back    anr huawei p8 lite   ### version of exoplayer being used exoplayer 2 5 0 or higher also tried out 2 6 0 and 2 6 1   ### device s  and version s  of android being used huawei p8 lite  android 6  ### a full bug report captured from the device here is traces log from the device  the player gets stuck in   exoplayerimplinternal blockingsendmessages   i guess waiting for a message that is never delivered   anr huawei p8 lite traces txt  https   github com google exoplayer files 1643547 anr huawei p8 lite traces txt   if you need any more input just let me know  best regards

loading images from local storage for listview in appwidget may cause securityexception   i'm using glide 3 7 0 to load images from local storage to a    listview    in an appwidget  here's a part of my code     it seems that this exception is caused by checking network state without corresponding permission  i didn't request  access_network_status  permission in  androidmanifest xml  indeed  but my app really doesn't need this permission  in my user case  glide will only be used to load images from local storage so i think it should not do such kind of operation like checking network state  maybe it's designed for loading images from everywhere including internet ok  perhaps this is most important user case   but i think it should handle this mistake if it's not asked to load images from internet  and then load images correctly  thank you

dynamic system background colors inherited from aztec cause richtext canvas backgrounds to clash   our richtext components  using aztec  inherit dynamic  systembackground  colors on ios – which is great – but unfortunately  our canvas background does not have that ability  this is fine and dandy until you go into multi tasking modes  where there becomes a clash of fill colors between the richtext instances' backgrounds and our canvas background  it looks like this     img_0667  https   user images githubusercontent com 1200432 69083870 9b50c780 0a08 11ea 9748 7e2296ccb6fa jpeg   note  this isn't noticeable in single app mode because our background color   black   is the same as ios  systembackground      to reproduce   steps to reproduce the behavior  0  switch ipad to dark mode 1  make sure app is in multi tasking split screen mode 2  open a post or page w  any richtext block on it  paragraph  heading  etc  3  see mis match between black background and richtext fill  ## proposal  i'm open to suggestions  but it seems like the best  and most flexible  solution would be to remove the background fill altogether from the aztec component either by     removing on our end by manually overriding the behavior    making the change on aztec so that there is no fill  or a transparent fill     we're soon going to introduce background colors on blocks like media   text  cover  button  etc  so maybe it makes sense to go fully transparent at the source  aztec      device       ipad pro 10 5"    os  ios 13 3b1    version wpios 13 7b

os x  odd loader issues when a shared library depends on a static only library   i haven't narrowed down a succinct repro  case  but i've observed that in the following scenario  odd linker errors occur    cc_test    cc_library foo   supports both shared and static     cc_library bar   wraps autoconf built static library    adding  linkstatic 1  to  foo  fixes all linker issues   it seems that bazel doesn't support a shared library dependency itself depending on a static library   note that in this case   bar  is static because it is built via a cross platform genrule  and bazel can't support a   so   out  on linux and a   dylib   out  on os x   select    is prohibted in  outs    thus  it only produces a   a

syntactic ambiguity and leakage in pronom signatures      note    all of what follows is the result of trying to parse pronom binary and container signatures  using the rather old spec at https   www nationalarchives gov uk aboutapps fileformat pdf automatic_format_identification pdf  and adding in the additional syntax used in container signatures     lexicographic multi byte comparisons    various signatures have double byte values in ranges  like the windows portable executable signature   4d5a 126 128500 50450000 20 0b02 66    0000 1000     droid currently interprets this as a set of 00  a range of 00 10  and another 00 byte  which gives a byte range of 0 16  given this would be more easily represented as just  00 10   i think this is supposed to be matching something else   the spec says they should be compared lexicographicallly  and also that each should be the same length   however  droid doesn't actually do this  and hasn't since at least version 5  not sure what 4 did here       so   what should a double byte range in a signature match   i guess it should match the spec   but droid hasn't been doing that for a long time  if it ever did  
there's no way to only close a tab  and nothing else    i've already said it in #2350  but as it's not exactly the same issue  i open a new one    there's no option in rightest drop down menu responsible for closing a tab without deleting its content from disk  in other words  there is a "delete" option but not a "close" option    file   close and file  quit do the same  they close the ide    i think former should close only active tab   tested on 1 6 1 and on 1 6 3

audio is sometimes sending at double speed   i have been getting reports that sometimes audio is sped up significantly  this seems to be an issue with how jda sends audio  my guess is that jda is requesting two frames every 20ms as opposed to just one  this doesn't seem to be lag  as i was experiencing this on a bot with low network and cpu load    setting a new sending handler seems to temporarily fix this  it could possibly also be a lavaplayer issue as i am instantiating the player with the sending handler  but i doubt that   leaving a voicechannel or changing the server region has no effect on this    kodehawa is also experiencing this 
potential pgadmin postgis bug with drop build indices   while doing a training  this was noticed by myself and one attendee  not sure if the others attempted after watching me fail     observed issues  1  dropping index operating never completed  after 60 seconds i halted it   not sure what _exactly_ the attendee did but he noticed the same thing  2  rebuilding the index never completed and i halted it  3  some or all subsequent queries on that table seemed to not complete 4  restarting the server didn't seem to have any effect  attendee noted dropping and reloading the db fixed things 5  no relevant log messages  commands were entered via pgadmin  not psql so cannot rule out a pgadmin bug   see indexing workshop page  http   workshops boundlessgeo com postgis intro indexing html

random restart instead of resume   every now and then when i start antennapod with a podcast where the playback was paused somewhere in the middle and i hit play  it does not continue from where it was paused but restarts playback from the beginning of the track  in the player view the progress bar and runtime still show the correct values right before starting but as soon as i press play  both jump back to the beginning   i could not track down if it is related to some special event  but it only occurs if antennapod has not been used for at least several hours  i have the suspicion that it could be related to the fact that my phone sometimes  partially   reboots which i do not necessarily notice every time it happens   this might be somehow related to #319 but i'm not quite sure if it is the same bug

classpath scanning fails for malformed class names   when using org junit platform junit platform gradle plugin 1 0 0 m1  but also org junit junit gradle 5 0 0 alpha  you can run into a crash scenario when the project somehow has classnames that are invalid    running  gradle check          which is a class generated by kotlin    i know you can't influence the code that is generated by kotlin  but i don't think the testengine should fail with an internalerror  without at least signaling the user which class actually caused that error

schemacachinginferencer in console does not infer properly   this is an issue i stumbled across while working on #1226     to reproduce  checkout branch  issues gh 1226 server inferencer  from both the rdf4j and the rdf4j storage repos  and make sure that you start an rdf4j console that uses the compiled code from both those branches on its runtime classpath   if i run a console  and create a new memory store with the schema caching inferencer  using the new template as added in the the above branch   like so     the annoying thing is that i can't reproduce this in any sort of unit or compliance test  everything i've tried with setting up a test case just works as expected  and does the expected inferences   hmottestad i would appreciate if you could take a look and see if you spot where this might be going wrong  keep in mind that you need the issue branch from rdf4j because it contains a new config template for the console to use  and you need the issue branch from rdf4j storage because it contains the spi setup  factory and config class  for the schemacachinginferencer  which is what is used to create a sail stack out of the config file

certificate inheritance in che pods on openshift           to make it easier for us to help you  please include as much useful information as possible     useful links      documentation  https   www eclipse org che docs     contributing  https   github com eclipse che blob master contributing md    eclipse che has public chat on       mattermost  https   mattermost eclipse org eclipse channels eclipse che    before opening a new issue  please search existing issues https   github com eclipse che issues      ## summary hey all  i was just wondering  is there any certificate inheritance between the different pods used by che in the openshift version  for example  if the original che pod has a bunch of special certificates in its truststore beyond the default one  will the che plugin broker pod generated by it also have the same truststore  i'm asking because i see that some traits of the pod seem to be inherited from the che pod  like the proxy settings for example   so i was wondering if it's the same case for the truststore  if this is _not_ the case  then i think this should be considered as an  optional   feature for the next version of che    ## relevant information i've been trying to set up eclipse che on openshift in an enterprize environment with a proxy for about a month now  and i've hit a lot of different errors and snags due to proxy configuration and certificate configuration  i was dismayed to realize that there was still work to be done ever after i got the certificates into the che pod  and i'm trying to figure out if there is no inheritance or if i messed up putting the certificates into the che pod       provide as much useful information as you can

server openapi document contains different values for kind   ## this is a      pre  code      feature request     regression  a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release   x  bug report       please search github for a similar issue or pr before submitting         documentation issue or request   code   pre   ## description  seems that the openapi document generate by the server runtime lists values of  kind  as camel case  whereas we store as dash ed snake case in jsondb   seems like the most correct approach would be to try to customize the openapi document generation so it uses  name  for enum values instead of  value  of the kind enum

with different versions of cubectl  also the nightly  and it always fails when starting the che server  a week ago i had a che7 version running correctly and i could use the theia editor and create workspaces on the same local machine as i get errors now  after reboot it stopped working and every try to reinstall freshly did result in the same  above described  error  also complete reinstall of

tv series not loading correctly   movies are working perfectly at the moment other than a minor issue of the background art disappearing when watching a film then pressing back on the remote to go back to the movie listing  when you do this the background art is gone   tv shows don't work when you first launch the app and pick a show from the 'latest tv series' section they will show 'no synopsis available'  if you then go to 'more shows' and choose any filter from the list such as 'top rated' and then into a show  the episodes will be present  you can then go back to the home screen and the and use the 'latest tv series' as expected with all the episodes working  very strange behaviour  once you do this movies stop working unless you do a similar workaround as tv  got to more movies and choose a filter then go to a random film then you're able to select a film quality

 webmvctest  and  webfluxtest behave differently in terms of spring security   hi   i just updated several services to   springboot 2 1 3   and observed a different behavior regarding integration tests in    webflux   and   webmvc   in combination with   spring security     in both services a custom securityconfig exists    in the webmvc service the config looks like     when implementing an integration test using   webmvctest  the custom websecurityconfig is called  placing a breakpoint in the configure method works   but in order to be active it is necessary to call apply securitymockmvcconfigurers springsecurity     on the  mockmvcbuilder   i think this is in line with the documentation provided here  https   docs spring io spring security site docs current reference htmlsingle #test mockmvc setup  when implementing an integration test using   webfluxtest  the custom securityconfiguration is   not called    but instead the standard  org springframework security config annotation web reactive webfluxsecurityconfiguration  is used  i have to use   import  on the test class to get the custom securityconfiguration to work   i couldn't find anything in the documentation that describes this behavior of   webfluxtest   i would expect that   webfluxtest  behaves like   webmvctest  and uses the custom securityconfiguration

timer thread dies on android an is not resurrected   i am working with the timer utility on an android application  libgdx version is 0 9 9  latest stable   the issue is caused  again  by android's weird policy with keeping static objects over app restarts  the following is a description what causes the problem to occur    the app launches for the first time     timer  is creating its  timerthread    the thread registers itself as a  lifecyclelistener    the app is left  works best for me when i turn off the screen and wait for the device to be pattern locked    when the app is entered again   oncreate  is called  leading to a new  initialize  ation     gdx app  is new  with a new list of lifecyclelisteners    timer thread  is not null  for it "statically survived"    it is not being created in  timer instance start   the method itself probably isn't even called  because  instance  survived  too    the timer's lifecyclelistener methods are not invoked either  because the listener is not registered any more       the thread remains dead  for fixing the problem  i suggest setting  timer thread  to null in  timer timerthread pause   if you are concerned about increased unnecessary  timerthread  instantiations  one might as well keep a reference to the actual  thread  which is created in  timerthread resume   allowing to poll the thread's state in  timer instance     additional information    strangely  i was not able to reproduce this issue when being connected to the pc  i e  a power source   so i suggest using adb over network when debugging  the problem occurred with all of our team members  which is 6 persons with at least 3 different device types

native memory leak introduced between version 1 0 1 and 1 1 0 and remains in the latest release    hi  it seems that between version 1 0 1 and 1 1 0 something has changed in conscrypt such that it now appears to leak memory when used as the ssl library with the jetty web server  the   latest   version of conscrypt also appears to leak memory   to reproduce it start jetty with conscrypt then send http 1 0 requests  this can be done with curl     limit the cipher   when only one of the following ciphers exist    tls_ecdhe_rsa_with_aes_128_gcm_sha256   tls_ecdhe_rsa_with_aes_256_gcm_sha384 the memory leak still appears     number of java classes   i does not look to ever be garbage collected  i made the jvm allocate a bunch of  byte    held on to by a weak reference and call  system gc  a bunch but that did not reduce the rss of the jvm   running jmap gives   this resulted in building a linux conscrypt i included that and started jetty web server with that along with jemalloc  however the resulting pdf   jemalloc pdf  https   github com google conscrypt files 3544767 jemalloc pdf  doesn't show anything interesting about conscrypt or boringssl   it is not clear what to do next  to help identify why conscrypt is leaking memory 
 3 x   websocket client  first message after handshake sometimes lost   i'm filling the issue for tracking purpose as i can't reproduce the problem all the time  when a websocket server  in my test  jetty 8 1 9 or tomcat 7 or netty 3 x  execute the handshake  sometimes the first message is not delivered to my handler  the message takes the form of    the issue arises when the nio layer reads the two packets in one read  in that case  the httpresponse object gets created with status code    101  but the message body  the second package  is not processed as a websocketframe or response's body  hence lost    it is pretty hard to reproduce so apology i can't share a test case  i will continue tracking the issue and hopefully i can come with a pull request

client does not always upload pdf files upon modification   i am using the android client  v 1 5 8 from f droid  on a samsung note 8  android v  4 2 2  and i am trying to keep some pdf files in sync  since i tick on the "keep file up to date" option for every file  i expect files to automatically syncronize to the server after i add annotations or highlights  i e  files should be uploaded soon after they are modified  however  this does not happen  not even if i force a sync tapping on "refresh account"  when i check the modification time of the pdfs using a file browser  i can see the modification time is older than the one shown in the client   the only workaround i found is  1  to manually force a sync by long tapping the file and then choosing "refresh file" or  2  to force the sync of _another_ file in the same folder as in  1   then the other files are uploaded after i modified them  this seems to work consistently  at least as far as i could test   i don't have similar problems with other types of files  for instance text files are uploaded immediately after modification  also there is nothing suspicious in owncloud log on the server

maploader bug in 3 1   loadall   is called with empty keyset many times   hi   when i used hazelcast 2 5 for loading a map with 75 records  to a cluster that has 3 hosts  maploader's loadallkeys   returned a set with size 75  and loadall   was called 3 times  each with with a set containing  25 records  using hazelcast 3 1 i've been experiencing a strange behaviour  although the set  returned by loadallkeys   has the correct size  loadall   is called  multiple times   3   and the given keyset often has 0 or 1 size  instead of  25  because of this maploading became extremely slow   lumpusz

projection on aggregation without _id can't work      my two cents  as i was struggling with fongo  i saw that projection can't handle the absence of "_id"  when used within an aggregation  there is a todo indeed    i look deeply into the code and here are my understandings     even if the projection is respected  i tried forked code   the collection is reinitialized with a temporary fongodbcollection   this collection is fed with resulting objects  through a call to insert which     put id when absent   just what is voluntary avoided      still through forked code  i tried to insert objects without id  then the add to index didn't add anything at all  no id  no add      then i gave up      can't see any mean to fix this  without doing a lot of job  i end up with suspended tests

plugin too strict in java code   in java class code  maybe in other place  didn't check   if you have a string containing the pattern 'cndnamespace  a za z +'  the plugin will try to match against declared nodes   if the nodetype doesn't exist  the editor will mark the string as if there were an error  but sometimes you need to reference a property that has the same pattern  for example  jcr title  and is not a node  and the error will be there  even if you know that's not an error  i don't know if that affects the build process  but it's middly disturbing   i think the plugin should warn about the fact that it's not a known node  but not mark the string as if there was an error   edit   just checked  same thing in jsps

discovery mechanism is not working properly    ## environment api version  2 124 0 docker image  promregator promregator 0 5 1  ## summary   problem statement in spaces with more than 50 apps the discovery mechanism is not working properly  incorrect handling of cf paged response   ## observed behavior we have a cf space with 123 apps  some of them running as multi instance   a unfiltered discovery of this returns just 49 apps  or 51 instances in total   it seems that promregator does not handle the cf paged response  default    50 entries  in a proper manner  filtering does not have a noteable influence since it is applied after the retrieving   my java knowlegde is fairly enough to understand the code but i'm not familiar with the spring boot framework  so i could not figure out where exactly the error is nor make a suggestion how to fix it  but afaik should an addition of " resultsperpage 6 " in org cloudfoundry promregator cfaccessor cfaccessor#retrieveallapplicationidsinspace  to lower the default  also show the wrong behaviour without the need to deploy such an amount of apps   unfortunatly it seems that the upper limit of the resultsperpage is at 100 what would not help us because we would exceed this threshold also   ## expected behavior an unfiltered discovery should return  all  started apps instances of the space

redissonset iterator in sentinel mode doesn't seem to be sticking to one slave for the lifetime of the iterator   hi    i have a redis setup with 3 nodes  master  slave  slave  and 3 sentinels  one per node   when i try to iterate over a set within redis  i'm getting some odd results that are breaking the redis scan guarantees   that is  i'm losing some entries   i'm pretty sure this is because the iterator isn't sticking to a single slave during its lifetime  and rather that it's using the default roundrobinloadbalancer switching between slaves for the same scan  which otherwise works well   #### example  let's say i have a big set with 100k entries     and i agree with the behavior of the rscript  as redisson would never implicitly know when to stick to a single server   incidentally  the latter use of rscript provides me with a workaround  but it'd be nice to use the inbuilt iterators for simplicity   hope that make sense   cheers

unknown error ocurred    hi   the android client for owncloud is throwing the following error when trying to connect over https   "unknown error ocurred " after testing the connection   i just updated recently to core version 8 2 1 and suddenly the mobile connectivity stopped working    i am using nginx + php5 fpm  5 6 16 2+deb sury org trusty+1  fpm fcgi   in ubuntu 14 04 and the nginx config is directly the config you provide in the official documentation   i put here a capture of nginx logs when the mobile app tries to connect     08 dec 2015 19 12 54 +0000  "get  status php http 1 1" 200 106 " " "mozilla 5 0  android  owncloud android 1 9 0" " "  it seems like the webserver responds properly but the mobile app fails to connect   i am trying to connecto from a nexus 5 with android 6 0  but this is also reproducible in other mobile phones and in android 5 x  this is getting very annoying and i would be very please if you could take a look   thanks in advance 
binary fields don't retain 'store' setting   assumes "store"   "true"   symptom   if you have a binary field 'blob' with "store" "false"  then you must qualify the field name as "_source blob" in order to retrieve it   details below   i figured out the bug in 0 19 4   basically  we have mappings like this  in part      when starting 'from scratch'  i e  indexing data for the first time   internally es has binaryfieldmapper element for "blob"  where "store" is "no"  which is correct   however   when shutting down and re starting es  the binaryfieldmapper entry that gets created has "store" set to "yes"   so  it tries in fetchphase execute   to place the "blob" info into the fieldselectormapper  rather than into the extractfieldnames   and  since there is no "blob" field other than in _source  it fails to retrieve the "blob" value   so   the but appears to be that the "store" "false" is not being preserved properly when you just shut down es and then start it up again

notepad deletes random item on delete when sorted by reading   hi martin   for memory  the bug we discussed already     i made recently a mistake in my notepads  so i tried to transfer an item  from one notepad to another with the "move to category" option  it went well in the destination  but not at the original notepad in the sens that it remains  as a result  my word is now in 2 notepads  so i tried the "delete selected" in the same options menu  but it did nothing  and remains   settings  in user data  my choice was   notepad   add unique only  so it is strange it could duplicate when moving  in expert settings  i think i am quite regular  no use of sd card storage  only internal memory  file based option   thanks  regards  jpierre

type parameters of supertype depend on declaration order   this code  from the sdk     compiles and everything  but if you have a  mutablelist string     is list string   returns false  because the type parameter  element  for  list  is set to  anything   from the  listmutator    if the two supertypes of  mutablelist  are declared in reverse order  first  list  then  listmutator   then it works fine  because  element  of  list  is first set to  anything   from  listmutator   and then it's set to the  element  of the  mutablelist    it was really hard to track down and really the declaration order shouldn't affect this  in any case  the compiler should alter the order of the supertypes  although i'm not sure what the criteria should be    supertypes with contravariant parameter types first   traverse the hierarchy of each supertype and satisfy the "longest" ones first  longest being the ones with more supertypes on the way to  object    this didn't happen before when the names of the type parameters were plain  but after #323   mutablelist  now has a bunch of  element  type parameters  for iterable  list  mutablelist and listmutator  and it just so happens that  list element  is set to  mutablelist element  but then gets overwritten to  anything   avoiding overwrite doesn't fix this because then a reverse order in the supertypes would set  list element  to  anything  first and then it wouldn't get overwritten to  mutablelist element

you cant dynamically register resourceloaders   this code in the engine is empty    so if you want to register your own special resource loader mechanism  say from a database  then you cant easily do it   i realize you can put a special rythm conf entries in but thats kinda the opposite of inversion of control   well at least construction of the resource loader should be able to be made external to the engine   startup   i think it should have both  static config declaration of classes and dynamic registration  ps   excellent engine by the way   very impressed with the doco and feature set

findbugs memory leak when same jvm is used   we have noticed that the static analysis tool is consuming a lot of memory when executed on a multi module build  as the openhab build     and i made some research  i will try to summarize the results here   i remember that we had a  discussion   https   github com openhab static code analysis issues 15  if we should disable the fork option  which spawns a separate java process for each execution of the findbugs plugin   but this doesn't seem to be the best option now   i have used the jconsole memory profiling tool and below can be seen the most critical leak that i have found  1 gb of non heap memory usage      sat non heap  https   user images githubusercontent com 7120104 28164676 1a1edb4e 67d9 11e7 8806 9595663bb7ae png   the memory seems to be consumed by 100 000 classes that are being loaded  the lower left window   i suspect that the problem is related to the fact that the same jvm is used  see below for more details       sat  https   user images githubusercontent com 7120104 28164936 5288ba3a 67da 11e7 95d6 064543b69e8e png   i have customized the build and excluding the findbugs maven plugin the problem disappears    i have experimented again with a fork set to true and the results are good  non heap memory usage is stable around 200 mb and 20 000 classes are loaded   the separate process consumes around 300 mb before dying     satfork non heap  https   user images githubusercontent com 7120104 28166164 92fa7d56 67df 11e7 8dd2 2b1c285f4cbe png    satfork  https   user images githubusercontent com 7120104 28166171 996b2c62 67df 11e7 8a10 3dea6e3d3fd2 png     kaikreuzer  i think the best option will be to use a separate thread for findbugs  but this change could directly affect the openhab build  please share your opinion on the topic

annotations are all assumed as one   i hate to make a issue report so soon after another has been fixed  the layers work fine with the latest updates   but annotations have now become somewhat pointless  every time i try to use one specific annotation as a mask  it assumes all annotations are the same one   the result is that if i import a mask that has more than 1 color of annotation in it  i cannot use it effectively  it fills all annotations at once  this happens with both global operations and when using a brush   i'd also like to know if there is anywhere where i can get an older version of wp

some bee specialties are produced ten times too often   if you look back at commit 03068d7ddbac45ee49f7ab067138e5e886c0becf in the code history  you'll see that when mysteriousages updated the magicbees code from forestry 3 4 to 3 6  he updated a lot of the bee products code to use floating point numbers instead of integers for the chance of producing a given product   you might have to click on the "load diff" link to see the beeproducthelper java diff  since it's a large enough diff that github won't display it by default   previously  the forestry api specified production chances as integers that represent a percentage  from 0 to 100   and after the 3 6 chances  production chances were floats between 0 0 and 1 0 instead  however  some of the updated values were incorrect  the integer 8  representing 8   in some cases became 0 8  80   when it should have been 0 08  8    so some specialty products ended up being produced ten   times   as often as intended  for example  here's the before and after part of the diff for the arcane branch of bees     notice how arcane bees now produce enchanting drops 90  of the time  instead of 9  of the time as originally intended  that final 0 9 value should have been 0 09   i've looked back through the git history  and the incorrect values are still there in the current commits of each of the active branches of the code

auto commit connection setting no longer saved   i think this started in dbeaver 6 1 2 or 6 1 3 and is still present in 6 1 4   the auto commit setting under connection settings    initialization isn't saved anymore when exiting the application   side note  why is isolation level grayed out when enabling auto commit  the isolation level is also relevant for select queries  so it should be configurable independent from the auto commit setting

ownerevent gets send to host + owning client   the  uniqueservernames  https   github com oniatus uniqueservernames  module sends an   ownerevent  to a client after it connects to ask the client to enter a new name   when hosting a game with another client  the event gets replicated to the remote client and also triggeres the hosting player  opening up the renaming dialog on the host  each time a player connects   switching the event filter on the client to  remote_client  does not work because this will remove the renaming feature from the hosting player   a simple fix would be to skip the local event if the event has been network replicated and was an   ownerevent  but before submitting a pr some feedback for this behavior would be nice     there is also a similar problem when a client sends an   serverevent   the event will trigger on the client too  however this is less likely to cause an issue as the serverside event handlers are registered as authority most of the time   simple check to reproduce test the issue  checkout the module  host the game with one player  rename the player  connect with a second instance    the host gets also the renaming popup  ##

exit effect glitches loops   i have encountered this issue several times and it took a long time to finally find where the code was going wrong   the issue arises when the effect exit integer sections is used inside of a nested loop  when the loop comes around to get executed again it will start from where it was exited rather than from the beginning and will completely ignore its new parameters  if they have changed    this can provide for very hard to debug issues as it will be extremely inconsistent depending on the conditions and data  example  setup by having one player with inventory full of stone and all other players with inventory completely empty   if the first player it looped simply had an inventory full of stone it would continue looping that first players inventory and find stone each time and message that stone was found in every players inventory   the only way around this glitch is to allow the loop to complete which requires setting up a way to ignore all iterations after you want to exit or find away to escape sections without using the exit effect 
cannot copy between a tensorflowlite tensor with shape  1  2  and a java object with shape  1  4    null    hi  i’m using a graph lite trained with 2 results and a labels txt  i have managed to get the example working  however it works wonderfully while i’m using it and i can analyze and take as many pictures as i want  yet when i leave to another screen in the app and come back i get an error like the one below stating that somehow the java object which had correctly worked and gave me a result on top of the taken image  has now changed from  1 2  to  1 4   what’s more interesting is that this discrepancy keeps growing as i leave and come back  as the next time it’s  1 6   the next  1 8   next  1 10  you get the picture  and it constantly keeps giving me this error and doesn’t go on to analyze the image therefore i get no results anymore  i have to close the app and start it again for tensorflow to work  then again if i leave to another screen and come back it starts the same cycle  is this a bug or should i change something else  i have used either 224 or 299 for image size when preparing tflite  imagemean was 128 not 127 5 but i’ve tried changing that too without any results  i have tried modifying the variables numresults  imagemean  imagestd  image sizes in main and tflite dart however i still get an error on second run  the only thing i didn’t try changing was threshold  can you please help  this is the error i get below  best regards   e flutter  23306    error flutter shell common shell cc 184   dart error  unhandled exception  e flutter  23306   platformexception error  unsupported value  java lang illegalargumentexception  cannot copy between a tensorflowlite tensor with shape  1  2  and a java object with shape  1  4    null  e flutter  23306   #0      standardmethodcodec decodeenvelope  package flutter src services message_codecs dart 551 7  e flutter  23306   #1      methodchannel invokemethod  package flutter src services platform_channel dart 292 18  e flutter  23306    asynchronous suspension  e flutter  23306   #2      tflite runmodelonimage  package tflite tflite dart 33 27  e flutter  23306    asynchronous suspension  e flutter  23306   #3      _myappstate recognizeimage  package someapp_tabbed_activity tflite tflitemain dart 74 37  e flutter  23306    asynchronous suspension  e flutter  23306   #4      _myappstate getimage  package someapp_tabbed_activity tflite tflitemain dart 25 5  e flutter  23306    asynchronous suspension  e flutter  23306   #5      _inkresponsestate _handletap  package flutter src material ink_well dart 507 14  e flutter  23306   #6      _inkresponsestate build  anonymous closure   package flutter src material ink_well dart 562 30  e flutter  23306   #7      gesturerecognizer invokecallback  package flutter src gestures recognizer dart 102 24  e flutter  23306   #8      tapgesturerecognizer _checkup  package flutter src gestures tap dart 242 9  e flutter  23306   #9      tapgesturerecognizer acceptgesture  package flutter src gestures tap dart 204 7  e flutter  23306   #10     gesturearenamanager sweep  package flutter src gestures arena dart 156 27  e flutter  23306   #11     _widgetsflutterbinding bindingbase gesturebinding handleevent  package flutter src gestures binding dart 184 20  e flutter  23306   #12     _widgetsflutterbinding bindingbase gesturebinding dispatchevent  package flutter src gestures binding dart 158 22  e flutter  23306   #13     _widgetsflutterbinding bindingbase gesturebinding _handlepointerevent  package flutter src gestures binding dart 138 7  e flutter  23306   #14     _widgetsflutterbinding bindingbase gesturebinding _flushpointereventqueue  package flutter src gestures binding dart 101 7  e flutter  23306   #15     _widgetsflutterbinding bindingbase gesturebinding _handlepointerdatapacket  package flutter src gestures binding dart 85 7  e flutter  23306   #16     _invoke1  dart ui hooks dart 168 13  e flutter  23306   #17     _dispatchpointerdatapacket  dart ui hooks dart 122 5

buggy  back could be worth looking into   many times with me and a few friends the  back command will teleport you to ground level if you were in a slightly too enclosed space underground  it may or may not be a mod acting weird on this but i can't really reproduce it a lot  just every once in a while  sounds like a good idea to get rid of these tiny bugs for beta  i'll take a look at the code while i'm at it  see if i can find anything 
spec paths are not generated correctly when javascript test source is in c  program files  x86    i have a jenkins server on a windows 7 64 bit machine that is building the  opensocial explorer  https   github com opensocial explorer  project using maven   the jenkins installer for windows placed jenkins_home at c  program files  x86  jenkins  which in turn means that the opensocial explorer's workspace is at c  program files  x86  jenkins jobs opensocial explorer workspace   this is causing issues with the generation of specs   they are being generated with absolute urls instead of relative urls   for instance  if i run "mvn jasmine bdd" and go to the resulting page  i see this in the page source     on the system that is encountering the error  i can reproduce the error by running maven from the command line in the jenkins workspace folder   i can also move the workspace folder for the jenkins job to the "c  " directory and running "mvn jasmine bdd" works   therefore  there seems to be an issue with the path   if i set a custom workspace path in jenkins such that the build workspace is at "c   jenkins jobs opensocial explorer workspace"  the builds will complete normally

java code coverage for sh_tests missing   ### description of the problem   copying from  bazel discuss thread  https   groups google com d msg bazel discuss scweny3gn w ftkyw84ycgaj  per request   we have a mix of junit tests and sh_tests that invoke a binary in a test scenario   bazel coverage         jobs 1   0  works great for the unit tests  but does not generate a coverage dat for the  sh_tests    repo is open source   https   github com batfish batfish c6658e88  https   github com batfish batfish tree c6658e88c8c9d48e393547281cc119d99b90670d  is base  and  https   github com batfish batfish blob c6658e88c8c9d48e393547281cc119d99b90670d tests parsing tests build  https   github com batfish batfish blob c6658e88c8c9d48e393547281cc119d99b90670d tests parsing tests build#l18  is the integration  sh_test    i tried figuring out how the java coverage works under the hood  but i got fairly stymied  any guidance    0     jobs 1  workaround for crash  https   github com bazelbuild bazel issues 4398  ### bugs  what's the simplest  easiest way to reproduce this bug  please provide a minimal example if possible   check out the linked repository at the linked commit and run  bazel coverage   jobs 1         command log below     note that there were 7 tests run  only 6 coverage dat files produced  the 6 tests are  junit_tests  and the 7th is a  sh_test    note that i would actually be  very pleasantly  surprised if this worked as is    i'd expect i might have to do something in the generated  sh_test  to indicate i wanted java coverage  i just don't know what that something might be     ### what operating system are you running bazel on   macos high sierra 10 13 5  17f77   ### what's the output of  bazel info release    release 0 14 0 homebrew  ### if  bazel info release  returns "development version" or "  non git "  tell us how you built bazel   n a  ### what's the output of  git remote get url origin   git rev parse master   git rev parse head     n a i believe   ###  have you found anything relevant by searching the web      bazel discuss thread  https   groups google com d msg bazel discuss scweny3gn w ftkyw84ycgaj  linked above     i was perhaps wondering if a workaround would be a skylark rule using   coverage_instrumented   https   docs bazel build versions master skylark lib ctx html#coverage_instrumented  but have not had a chance to try this yet   ### any other information  logs  or outputs that you want to share

sdk crashes app after a while in case the tracking backend is permanently not reachable   we are currently using the piwik sdk in one client app  last week the staging environment was undergoing maintenance and was not reachable for a few days   returning http 500 error codes for every call made by the piwik sdk   it seems that the sdk then retries the calls without a retry limit until the app crashes with a sslexception "unable to create application data"  which seems to indicate a resource exhaustion due to too many threads files etc   at least according to  this  https   github com square okhttp issues 3761  issue in the okhttp repo   this behaviour was logged with the version 2 0 0 of the piwik sdk integrated  but could also be reproduced with the 3 0 0 version of the piwik sdk   in the described case  the sdk always retries the calls without a retry limit  indicated by the endlessly repeating logs like this 
bug parsing qualified record ending in  delimiter  qualifier    in parserutils ismultiline a check is made to see if the line ends with the qualifier character  if so  the preceding character is compared to the delimiter and if it matches it is assumed the content is multiline data and the two characters    delimiter  qualifier   are the beginning of the multiline field   consider the case though where there is data data qualifieddata i e  comma delimited double quote qualified content such as  some data some other data "some qualified data "   the result is that the ending  " are assumed to be the beginning of a multiline field which consumes the rest of the records until some closing  delimiter  qualifier  is encountered   i first encountered this in 3 2 0 but confirm the behavior in 4 0 0 as well 
upgrading the version number in a npmimport might fail silently   in some cases  updating the version number and restarting the build won't do anything  the solution is to delete the package lock file and run the build again   this is far from ideal  users won't have any idea that the version didn't update  why it didn't update  and how to fix it    the framework needs to handle this better  at the very least inform the user that the update failed and how to retry

easer can switch do not disturb on but not off   i have a script to turn do not disturb mode on and off depending on certain combinations of ac charging and time of day  the profile to turn on dnd  ringer mode  checked  → 'do not disturb' → priority  works as expected  which is easy to verify because the android system notification for "do not disturb is turned on" appears  and the dnd button in the phone's quick panel is illuminated  however  when the profile to switch off dnd  ringer mode  checked  → normal  kicks in  nothing happens  the "do not disturb is turned on" notification is still present  and the dnd button in the phone's quick panel is still illuminated  i have tested this by long pressing the ringer on profile directly in easer's data view and tapping "trigger this profile"  still nothing     to reproduce   steps to reproduce the behavior  1  create a profile with the action 'system config' → 'ringer mode" → 'normal'  2  turn on dnd  manually  by easer script  or with android schedule  makes no difference   3  trigger the easer profile to switch ringer mode to normal  4  ringer mode does not change     expected behavior   i expect that a profile to set 'ringer mode' to 'normal' would turn off do not disturb when triggered  thus leaving the phone in normal "ring" mode     extra phone info  please complete the following information     galaxy s9  non rooted  running android 9  up to date with samsung ota patches     additional info   this seems similar to issue #154  so i tried to follow the fix described by  bughunter2  but i can't find any such "silent mode switcher" permission    easer's 'outline' screen is not showing the warning about some skills not having the required permissions   settings → apps → easer shows notifications  allowed  and change system settings  allowed   settings → apps → easer → permissions shows all 5 items enabled  calendar  call logs  location  sms  and storage     hitting "all permissions" from that same screen shows 'access do not disturb'under 'other app capabilities' settings → notifications → easer shows only the settings for easer's own notifications  show notifications on  app icon badges on  easer service indicator on  silent and minimized   and uncategorized on  let the app decide    i'm stumped  if there is a "silent mode switcher" permission that needs to be manually granted  where would i find it

anvils in certain locations ignore click events   i don't even know a better way to phrase it   on right click      event block is anvil   on leftclick on anvil   both of the above simply    don't work in certain locations  it seems to be random  i can't seem to get it to react to freshly placed anvils at all  but about 80  of anvils that have been there for awhile work normally  i don't have issues with any other click events  just click events on anvils as far as i can tell   no addons  no errors  using current version  etc etc  for users like myself this is an annoyingly large issue  as some people like myself make custom xp systems and block vanilla anvil usage completely  x

unexpected top level exception  com android dx cf iface parseexception  class name  com paypal android sdk z  does not match path  com paypal android sdk z class    hello  i've updated to android studio 1 4 and updated gradle plugin to 1 4 0 beta3  but i could not compile my project anymore  i'm getting such errors

add an option to remove the results from the kanjipad screen   hi   just above the pad part of the kanjipad screen  there are buttons  and i can't see all of them on my phone  more importantly  the last button  which resets the pad  does not appear at all when i hold my phone vertically  i have the same problem  though i see more of the buttons  with a small tablet i have   i saw that  on smaller screens  the kanjipad would take a greater part of the screen  and the result are shown at the top of the screen  i think the same layout should be kept for screens a little bigger than that  and the best thing would be to add an option in the settings to force one layout or the other as people prefer   that would also help me draw the kanjis since it's easier to have aedict recognize the kanjis if i can draw it better on a bigger pad   other than that  aedict is a nice soft  keep up the good work

allow to choose what information to include in http 2 goaway frame's debugdata   related  line armeria#145  it seems like the debugdata in our http 2 goaway frame includes only the exception message  it is sometimes not enough because some exceptions do not have a message  it would be at least very useful if debugdata contains the type of the exception as well  that is  we should use  string valueof exception   instead of  exception getmessage      also  in some cases  an  http2exception  can have a non null cause  i e   http2ex getcause      null  it would be also very useful to get the type and the message of the cause as well as the  http2exception  itself   although not always desirable  for some error types such as  internal_error 0x2    a user might also want to get the stack trace of the  http2exception  and its cause   perhaps we could make this pluggable so that we provide a few sensible 'debug data generator' implementations and let users write their own ones

seed piping      seed piping to agricraft seed storage blocks   i really hope that i am not missing something really obvious   i just can't get a piping system to work   each different mod pipes have their own problems   the most common problem is that i can't seem to numb them down enough to ignore the different stats of the individual type of seed and just put them in the appropriate block   so  is it possible to pipe seeds to their appropriate storage block   if it is  how is the data for the stats on the individual seed stored   i can tell the various filters to look at or ignore meta data  nbt data  ore dictionary info  mod type  etc   i really hope that the problem is something like  there is still another part of your storage system being developed and i just have to be patient   i can do that

commands  click  and  clickandwait  hanging on ie   unfortunately i don't know how to create a concrete test example for this one  i cannot share the test that is failing since the system i'm testing is proprietary   the problem is the following  at some point in my tests i'm clicking on a button which triggers a new page to load  both  clickandwait  and  click  are hanging when testing on ie  tried ie8 on winxp and ie9 on win7   they perform the click action properly  the page loads  but the commands do not succeed  they even do not timeout  they just hang indefinitely  every now and then they do succeed  but the behavior is not deterministic   the page that is being loaded has some flash object in there  i don't know if that might be the problem   any ideas on what might be wrong  i would also appreciate any workaround you can think of   thanks in advance

 mod interaction  pneumaticcraft drones are having trouble detecting block breaks when dealing with sand from lava starlight interactions    ### minecraft version  1 12 2  ### forge version  14 23 5 2838  ### mod version  pnc  1 12 2 0 11 7 375 as  1 12 2 1 10 20  ### describe your problem  including steps to reproduce it   i'm using the following code to dig sand generated by astral sorcery's lava liquid starlight interaction  https   gist github com mutetiefling 4df0eafd1a8927b1b5b550bafd8f23e5   if i give the drone a flux bore with anywhere from efficiency 0 to 4  it will dig up the sand as expected  collecting it by way of a magnet upgrade  and go drop it off in a chest whenever it has a stack of sand on it    however  if i give the drone an efficiency 5 flux bore  it is fast enough to 'insta mine'  at this point  it seems unable to tell that it has actually broken a block and will sit there digging sand in an infinite loop  even enabling the 'limit block interactions' on the dig area widget appears to be ignored in this case    ### any other comments   desht was unable to reproduce with a block placer placing sand  however i suspect that the block placer may well be going a tiny bit slower than the starlight lava interaction  i think it may be the sheer speed at play here that's causing this interaction    https   github com teampneumatic pnc repressurized issues 405
date text overlaps with weather icon in widget 5x1   i have custom date format set   eeee dd mm yyyy   hh mm    so i can see the full day name in the widget   when the resulting string is long enough  the text collides with the centered weather icon  see image     img_20190424_093750  https   user images githubusercontent com 12466054 56641578 f50d3100 6675 11e9 9acc 737f361a1fa7 jpg   is it possible to adapt the icon position to move a bit to the right when this happens   thanks

android 10  app not capturing gps tracks while display is off   hi  it appears that opentracks is not capturing gps information while the app is in background or the screen is off  i expect this to be caused by android 10 only allowing access to location data while the app is actively being used  the permission menu only offers the options to disallow access  or allow access while app is being used   i'm not sure if there is a way around this by requesting an exception from the system

outsider griefing   as i have previously stated  i use this plugin on a creative plots server  some players on the server have the tp and gamemode commands  which allow for multiple ways to teleport to other players  unfortunately  this allows players to teleport to other players who are currently in the build battle game and grief them  there are multiple approaches to patch this  though   method 1 is the hard way  it would be for a region to deny everybody except the current builder   method 2 is the best way  it would allow for the server to execute a command when the build battle begins and ends  for example  in my case  i would have the server do  tptoggle  player  at the end of the game   method 3 is a decent way  it would be for me to simply remove the permission to use these commands from all of my players   if you have any other ideas for how i can get around this  please let me know

hangs for large repos   the generation of the change log needs a long time if there are lot of commits on the considered branch  during this time  bitbucket server does not respond    even for other users trying to access other repositories   the plugin shouldn't tear down the bitbucket server performance as massively as it does now   is it possible to introduce a limitiation in changelog entries  maybe a limitation in the number of commits which occur within the changelog   or a date limit  only use commits after        or another limitation      in this context it would be nice if the settings are available per repository  not only globally as it is now

syncany fails to do integrity check error recovery  we really need this     when you cut off  kill  9 java process power failure crash  a "sy up"  of a new large size directory while uploading chunks to dropbox  and restart you get an error   see reproduction and error details below    integrity checking and error recovery is way more important than getting a fancy nice 'simpleweb' working    to my opinion we need 'sy checkintegrity' to check files vs local cache vs remote data  and 'sy recover' to fix errors  the whole syncany architecture should get a 'succesfullexitflag' stored somewhere  in case 'sy up' 'sy down'  is executed it shoud check this flag  if this flag is not set  it should run a checkintegrity recover first  then it should remove the flag  execute the up down sync and the set the flag to true when exited    what is a workarround for this  beside removing  syncany directory and dropbox data and start over with sy init    reproduction 
option for disabling request canceling if non ioexception occurred in interceptor   based on this  issue  https   github com gildor kotlin coroutines retrofit issues 34   if we're throwing exceptions inside interceptor  they should inherit ioexception to be properly handled without crashing the app  but there's some situations in which you don't want to inherit ioexception  one of this cases  we are handling errors of api  not http errors  api returns some templated entities with status code which can be checked to detect some errors like invalid parameters that was passed   and one of error handling solutions is to create interceptor that checks all of requests' responses and throwing domain exceptions if status code indicates error  i suggest to add some parameter to okhttpclient builder that will allow us to disable canceling requests if some non ioexception was thrown inside interceptor

person notes vs  waypoints     coordinates entered into personal notes become waypoints    if a set of coordinates is entered into personal notes  they are picked up by waypoints and cannot be changed in any way  or deleted     to reproduce    steps to reproduce the behavior  1  go to 'description' tab of any geocache  scroll down to 'personal note'  2  enter a complete set of coordinates  any coordinates will do  i only use decimal minutes  and have not tested other coordinate formats  n 53 33 333' w 113 33 333'   n b  i cannot show degree symbol here   3  back out to the main dashboard  4  return to the cache page  5  go to waypoints tab and the coordinates will be listed as a waypoint with the name "personal note 1' 6  any attempt to edit this waypoint will fail     version of c geo used    2019 09 08    is the problem reproducible    yes  i find this issue to be a nuisance with no redeeming value  the best solution is to remove the link between 'personal note' and 'waypoint'  i use personal note to keep thoughts about the cache  waypoints are important for stages in multicaches and for final locations for mystery caches  since the personal note coordinates in waypoints cannot be edited or changed  they have no value

multiple recovery methods in same class results in arrayindexoutofboundsexception #2   given the following example   this is similar to  #145  https   github com spring projects spring retry issues 145   but the root cause is a little different  in this case  the method  compareparameters    tries to match parameters  but fails to account for subclasses of those parameters  specifically  the recovery method had specified a "list" type parameter  while the actual runtime parameter is a concrete class  like "arraylist"    compareparameters    considers this a mismatch  because it performs a rigid check  if  parametertypes i     argument getclass      as a minimum  rigid check should be replaced with "isassignablefrom  "  similar to "throwable" treatment  this should fix the exception   however  minimal fix might make parameter type comparison a little too lax  ideally  we need to implement "calculatedistance  " for parameter types as well

blood extractor in offhand deletes items   modpack  all the magic  all the mods  where  multiplayer server  if you place the blood extractor in your offhand in auto supply mode  it replaces the first item in the hotbar with an identical blood extractor  removing either one from their slot makes the other blood extractor disappear   from what i can tell it voids any item in the first slot of the hotbar  hopefully this can be addressed

after upgrading to brixton feign clients generate comma delimited string value for request parameters that are collections   we had implemented a system a year ago which leveraged spring data rest for backend services and feign client in the front end  we had a lot of success and have been working on upgrading to brixton  we have request mappings that look like the following     requestmapping value   " messages search findbytenantidandcategory"  method   requestmethod get  pagedresources message  findbytenantidandcategory  requestparam "tenantid"  string tenantid   requestparam "category"  integer category   requestparam value   "sort"  required   false  collection string  sort   requestparam "page"  int page     this would produce http requests that look like the following prior to the brixton release   get http   messages service messages search findbytenantidandcategory tenantid db1cd64a 56ae 4471 9cb0 e759a1aa7363 category 2 sort firstname sort lastname 2cdesc page 0 http 1 1   this follows a convention that we saw posted on stack overflow and have numerous tests for in our spring data rest repositories  http   stackoverflow com questions 33018127 spring data rest sort by multiple properties  in the prior release of spring cloud netflix this worked as we would expect  after upgrading to brixton sr1 the following http request is produced which is not supported by spring data rest   get http   messages service messages search findbytenantidandcategory tenantid db1cd64a 56ae 4471 9cb0 e759a1aa7363 category 2 sort firstname 2clastname 2cdesc page 0 http 1 1   as you can see this get request appears to be affected by the change of using the spring type conversion service which is included in the brixton release  this is a great enhancement but breaks for these cases because it converts the collection to a comma delimited string   at the moment i am struggling to find a workaround  right now this is blocking our ability to upgrade our system to the brixton release train

hacking physics still work with  hax in server motd   there is a bug that allows players to travel down water and lava as if hacks are still enabled  meaning the physics are quicker than default  we have tested on two different servers  one with  hax  and one with +hax  if a player has configured their client's advanced options like so  enable hacks  no speedhack type  adv then the player will travel down lava and water faster on a server where the  hax flag is enabled  note though  that this only works when a player pushes the escape key  if you look at the screenshot below  you can see that the server's motd contains the  hax flag  and the video better explains what i'm speaking about  you may have to watch it a couple of times  since its hard to notice unless you know what you're looking for   http   i imgur com arqfxjr png  http   youtu be phom3xkofje

clean up unavailable songs   a lot of people are sharing their libraries  yet don't leave the torrenttunes client running all day  meaning that a lot of music on torrenttunes is unavailable to the rest of us   in an attempt to clean house and make sure that   all music is highly available    i'm going to add an ip address column to the server song table  to be able to determine what ip address uploaded what song  i'll also add a timeouts column  so that if that song wasn't finished within 15 minutes  it will add to a timeouts counter that way  if an uploader isn't running their client  i can easily remove all their music from the server at once  as it stands right now  i have no way to remove unavailable music en masse   i want torrenttunes to   only hold available music    its frustrating to find a song only to figure out that _no one is actually seeding sharing_ it  by far  the vast majority of people who have shared their libraries aren't running clients  i guesstimate more than half of the songs currently shown on torrenttunes are unavailable    i will be   clearing out torrenttunes server   songs  so everyone will have to reshare your collections  i will create a special button to clear your local library database so that you can re share your songs   i'm still against a login system  because i want the service to be anonymous  but uploaders should know that i will remove your music if you aren't seeding it  and haven't contacted me about why its unavailable

componenterrorhandler disables errorpagehandler   may i'm wrong but if i understood it right the componenterrorhandler disables the errorpagehandler  for example  the componenterrorhandler is enabled and the user opens a not existing page  the user would expect to see a 404 page  e g  configured by the errorpagehandler  but instead s he sees the html rendered by the componenterrorhandler since it catches every exception  a resourcenotfoundexception  too  as far as i know there is no way provided to avoid this   am i right

 bug  operator rolling update is triggered when resource is not modified     describe the bug   it seems that if the operator thinks that the kafka resource has been changed it triggers a rolling update of the resource   as hinted in the documentation  "in most cases  the cluster operator only updates your kafka or zookeeper clusters in response to changes to the corresponding kafka resource  this enables you to plan when to apply changes to a kafka resource to minimize the impact on kafka client applications "   the problem i am having is that even if the resource does not change  the rolling update is triggered    if i am using kustomize and have my "kind  kafka" in the same kustomize "build" as another resource  if the other resource is updated  then the strimizi operator thinks it needs to perform a rolling update of kafka  even if kafka is not modified  looking at the yaml output of kustomize  i cannot even see a difference in the yaml   this is a big problem because i am using gitops to provision my environment and therefore i am getting a rolling update about every 5 10 minutes       to reproduce   steps to reproduce the behavior  1  put kafka in the same kustomize build as another resource 2  edit the other resource 2  kustomize build     kubectl apply  f   3  kafka is forced to rolling update     expected behavior   rolling update only happens if i specifically edit kafka    or at least give me the ability to turn off the rolling update functionality     environment  please complete the following information        strimzi version  0 16 2    installation method  yaml    kubernetes cluster  1 14    infrastructure  eks    yaml files and logs   the logs just keep saying

possible bug   alright  i'm not entirely 100  sure that this bug is yours  so sorry in advance if this is a wild goose chase   so here's the error report  http   pastebin com hlr0j5en  i'm sure you can see from the above that it was    shall we say less than explicit about what is to blame for the exception that was thrown  which has had me running around for the last two days pulling mods until it finally stopped happening  which lead me to matter overdrive   this particular crash occurred with a frequency between ten and thirty minutes after a player would log in  subsequent attempts to log in would either yield the error again or repeat the pattern  a short time of gameplay and then the crash again   more frustrating still  it's a client side crash  taking them out to the launcher but leaving the server running  and it does not seem to effect all players equally  some players wouldn't crash more than once or twice  others nearly constantly    after removing the matter overdrive mod the crashes stopped  and things ran smoothly for a test period of two hours  after which the mod was added back in and allowed to gen a new config file  just in case of a corrupted one   within 20 minutes another crash occurred   now  this is obviously not conclusive proof  but it is i feel suggestive  and unfortunately the biggest  and in fact only  lead we have  so i thought i'd post it here  and let you see if it rings any bells  i'm going to go turn android spawning off and see what happens next  i'll let you know if that fixes anything

 paperui  ui does not refresh channel types   my binding creates channel types during runtime  after initialize   finishes  but before thing status goes to online  based on the information it obtains from the remote device  which takes some time   it calls editthing and updatething to make the channel changes  this causes issues with paperui  on the first creation of a thing  binding builds channel types and channels in runtime as stated above  and ui shows the channels correctly as they appear  but it does not allow to add new items for the channels  when i click + to add an item to a channel  there is a js exception  because it can't find the channel type in  scope  i tried to put breakpoints on where channel types are populated and it never gets updated in runtime  only when thing configuration is changed  it is also possible to force channel type reading  when i go to a page that needs explicitly this information  so  if i just click on "items" menu and then go back to the thing channels  i will be able to create new items for the channels  because  scope will contain correct channel types  when i looked into paperui source code  the channel types are updated once in viewthingcontroller  channels are updated in refreshchannels function  if it is allowed to modify channel types in runtime  shouldn't refreshchannels also update channel types  to have both in sync 
paperui uses outdated js files from browser cache after an update   i made a fresh install of build 634  on windows 10  and installed only the yahoo binding   in the first test i did not create any items  instead i opened the thing configuration and selected the option "+create new item"   image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 616792 21061735 dfb8cc9c be4d 11e6 879b 75437c904401 png  when i press the "link" button i get an error message "error 405 method not allowed"  the log shows nothing    then i created manually a new item of type "number"  i entered a name  label and selected the type "number"   when i try to assign this item to the temperature channel i only get this selection    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 616792 21061828 521a3e2e be4e 11e6 9632 c455a0fb14b5 png  the entry marked in yellow seems to be my newly created item  but linking is not possible  also error 405    the i switched to "simple mode" and activated the "temperature" channel  this works fine and the automatically created item is linked

cancelled postprocessed images aren't cached   hi guys   first of all  great library  only problem i've had so far is with caching of post processed images   i'm following the documentation put up  and have looked around  but can't seem to figure out what's going wrong here   i have a fragmentstatepageradapter  with each fragment having a full sized  blurred image as its background  and i have a post processor that blurs the background image  and all of that is working fine  but when i scroll between the fragments back and forth  the blurred background image is reprocessed every time  which is really annoying  there's a section in the docs saying that post processed images can be cached  and i'm doing everything it's saying i should  but images are still not being caches   my post processor     i've also tried implementing my own cachekey before finding out about simplecachekey  but that didn't work either  any help would be appreciated   thanks

changing name of event crashes service   after changing the name of an event  the app crashed instantly  restarting the app works  but it keeps crashing if i try to re enable the service  the reason seems to be  that a script had used this event  but it cannot be found again  cause its name has changed  i fixed this by reconfiguring the specific script   however it does not seem userfriendly if the app keeps crashing after renaming something  it would be better if you use something like an id or change the name in each object using the renamed object 
mapview repetition bug   there's a bug with horizontal and vertical map repetition  where the map jumps back when scrolled to the edges of a virtual 3x3 map repetition grid   might be related to #843  to reproduce  scroll the map  e g  with zoom 2  past the current map in any direction to the next repetition map and further  as soon as you hit the edge of that one  in most cases it flips back to the center of that repetition map instead of seamlessly moving on to the next repetition  see image   this is most annoying with horizontal scrolling  but might also be confusing in the vertical direction  interestingly  if you're in an 'edge map' and are zooming  you get to the center map again  also the jump back might not happen when scrolling very slowly     osmdroid_map repetition bug  https   user images githubusercontent com 28442368 34607204 ea34bb00 f212 11e7 9a06 f282519c2cc9 png   ### version of osmdroid the issue relates to   6 0 0 snapshot
bagger does not correctly escape filenames with newline characters in the manifest   if you create a bag with a file that has a newline character in its filename  the manifest will not represent that characters  for example  "data icon r" is represented as "data icon" in the manifest  the bag cannot be validated because the file system does not contain a file at "data icon"   a further complication is that this bug can cause filename collisions in the manifest  "data icon"  "data icon n"  and "data icon r" are all represented in the manifest as "data icon"  bagit python had the same issue  it was fixed by using percent encoding for  r and  n  https   github com libraryofcongress bagit python issues 12

hash functions are not implemented correctly   according to the spec  e g  for md5  it says  "returns the md5 checksum  as a hex digit string  calculated on the utf 8 representation of the simple literal or lexical form of the xsd string"  but the code simply does text getbytes   which uses the platform encoding  so it is neither correct nor consistent across different platforms  it should do text getbytes "utf 8"  or better text getbytes standardcharsets utf_8

cache size info lost on refresh   three users reported this via support mail  version  2014 11 04   all users are pm   have a list of offline saved caches   refresh the list of caches   after refresh some caches are missing the size info in the list view as well as in the details  line is missing    doing another refresh either solves the problem or other random caches loose the size info  one user reported  that after a fresh reboot of the device  probably a fresh start of c geo would be enough  the problem disappears for some time to happen again after some hours  ##   with current master i can not reproduce this  i will test the market version later and report back 
degraded query performance in 2 3 1   hi   after migrating to neo4j version 2 3 1 from 2 2 4 for my nlp application i see that some queries now hang the system  before they took under a second to execute on the same hardware  i don't see any swapping going on  so memory is probably not an issue   moreover  when i terminate the java program that runs these queries i see from resource utilization that the db engine is still working  to resolve that i have to shut down everything completely  that may be a separate issue   below is one of the queries that the new version of neo4j stumbles on  match  d document document_id 5     s sentence    e_t1 entity ent_type 'term'      token    next     word 'of'     next        e_m1 entity ent_type 'money'      token    next    t_c2    next        e_m2 entity ent_type 'money'      token    next     word 'in'     next        e_t2 entity ent_type 'term'   where t_c2 word in  'and' 'on'  return id e_m1  id e_m2    any insight would be greatly appreciated  gene 
can't delete prices for unique items from id  only from handheld item     this is a bug we must fix before shipping the beta2 update  basically  when i sell a unique item  custom lore etc  i can delete the price only if i have that item in hand  there is no way to delete these items from command line  so the addition i have in mind is the ability to delete items from a list given by a command  i write the index of the item and it will be deleted

freefilesync fails to delete files in dokany mounted vault   ### description  freefilesync can't delete files  but it works from explorer cli  and yet the problem started appearing with a new cryptomator version  for regular user files  this just results in an incorrect syncing outcome  for the magic files  this results in deadlocks that can be  difficult  https   freefilesync org forum viewtopic php f 8 t 6568  to clean up   ### system setup    operating system and version  windows 10 pro with all updates installed   cryptomator version   1 4 15  can reproduce the problem   1 4 11  works fine   drive  dokany   dropbox  79 4 143´  though the problem reproduces even with dropbox turned off    freefilesync  10 15   it reproduces equally with  10 11   so the presence of the bug is solely determined by the cryptomator version that i'm using  see above   ### steps to reproduce and actual behavior  1  create vault  put a file inside  2  point  freefilesync  https   freefilesync org download php   ffs  to that vault on the left side  and an entirely empty directory  outside any vaults  on the right side  3  press "compare"  3 1  ffs creates  sync ffs_lock  lock file  3 2  ffs reads in all the files and displays them on the ui  3 3  ffs attempts to remove the lock file  but this does not happen  there is also no error message  perhaps because freefilesync just ignores this error  4  the diffs are now displayed   if  you now click "synchronize"  i suggest you don't and instead skip step 4 here   then ffs will attempt to lock the directory again  but it appears to be locked still  the lock file still exists from the comparing   so ffs will lock on a different file   del sync ffs_lock   to atomatically delete the original lock file  after a timeout of about a second  it realizes that the original isn't going to be deleted  so it attempts to remove  del sync ffs_lock  with a recursive call to the same function  but removing that isn't possible either  so it creates  del del sync ffs_lock  and so on  after a minute  you'll already have 60 files lying around  soon the file names become long enough to make deletion fail  another cryptomator dokany bug   so you'll never get rid of those files again  this arguably isn't the smartest behavior of ffs  but it only fails badly because of two combined cryptomator bugs  deletion fails from ffs  and even manual deletion fails for long file names   but   i digress  the main point is that the  sync ffs_lock  file wasn't deleted   in the first place  5  if you want to continue using ffs "normally"  you need to help it by deleting the lock file manually  for a further test  tell ffs to sync the file you created in step  1   from right to left  i e  to delete it in the vault  after doing that  you can safely hit "synchronize"  it will warn you that the recycling bin isn't available in the vault  which is expected  6  when the sync is done  ffs will neither have deleted its lock file  like above  nor the file you created in step  1    7  optional  for another iteration  delete lock file again  compare again  delete lock file again  sync again  this time  you will additionally see it fail to move the temp database file to main database file because it failed to delete the latter previously   in conclusion    whatever kinds of files ffs tries to delete    regular user files  the magic lock file or the magic database file     the deletion just silently fails   on cryptomator  1 4 15  with dokany   #### expected behavior  the files are deleted just like they were with cryptomator  1 4 11    #### reproducibility  always  no matter if dropbox is running or not  no matter the freefilesync version  on both my laptop and my desktop machine   ### additional information  freefilesync is open source  you can grab the code  here  https   freefilesync org download freefilesync_10 15_source zip   note in particular the file  freefilesync source base dir_lock cpp  and  zen file_access cpp  where the  removefileplain    helper calls through to  unlink     not sure from which header   besides the widespread error swallowing  this looks like quite a normal way to delete a file  and yet  rm  or  unlink  executed under mingw cannot reproduce the problem  and also  del  from the windows command line or windows explorer succeed in deleting files if their names are reasonably short

 cpp  ircollection leaks header if loading multiple files   when loading a file into ircollection  it allocates an ir and a header  the ir is added to a map  so the collection can hold messages from multiple files  but there is only one instance of header  the header is deallocated in the destructor  however  if another file is loaded  the first header object is simply replaced without being deallocated  causing a leak   sbe header must be the same for all messages in a schema  however  ircollection allows loading multiple schemas  and it is theoretically possible to have a different messageheader composite type in another schema   perhaps they have different integer size for block length   as it stands  the last one loaded would stay in the collection

spin rule runs multiple variable number of times for one instantiation of associated class   i'm using topbraid free edition to create owl ontologies with spin rules  i'm loading the ontology and spin rules into sesame openrdf workbench     i then explore the resulting bugsi atimestampbug_test1 individual  to find the spin rule has run several times and produced several timestamps  the number of timestamps varies from test to test  here's one example result     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 20132242 16771780 6791e282 4817 11e6 9b54 2436d2ed9f76 png   the bottom line is that the spin rule runs multiple times for the one instance  and the number of times varies when i re run this experiment   i believe and have had another stackoverlow user confirm that the spin rules for a class should only run once per instance of that class  at instantiation time    if this is correct  then this seems to be a bug which i'm duly reporting   thanks

c++ client leaks file descriptors on windows   hello  it looks like the non windows implementations of memorymappedfile  createnew and memorymappedfile  mapexisting close file decsriptors by creating onscopeexit objects immediately after a successful open   however these onscopeexit objects are missing from the windows implementations of memorymappedfile  createnew and memorymappedfile  mapexisting so the file descriptors are leaked  this means that a client will hold the files open throughout its lifetime  preventing them from being cleaned up   if you agree  do you think it makes sense to add them   thanks

"java lang outofmemoryerror  unable to create new native thread" using many nodes per host   while running benchmarks on ec2 it was noticed that having too many proactive nodes running tasks may cause  java lang outofmemoryerror  unable to create new native thread  https   plumbr eu outofmemoryerror unable to create new native thread  on nodes   each machine running proactive nodes had the following configuration     the issue is related to the number of threads which are created by nodes  it is important to notice that the exact same configuration as before using a sleep timeout of _25_ seconds for java tasks prevents the issue to occur    the previous observation let me think the issue could be related with _pings_ which are performed periodically  each 20 seconds   although the single jvm feature spawns only one jvm for multiple pa nodes  then one ping is done for each pa node running on the host  more exactly each _tasklauncher_ active object per node   below are some pointers to related classes     nodepingthread  https   github com ow2 proactive scheduling blob master scheduler scheduler server src main java org ow2 proactive scheduler core nodepingthread java#l25     schedulingservice#pingtasknode  https   github com ow2 proactive scheduling blob master scheduler scheduler server src main java org ow2 proactive scheduler core schedulingservice java#l788      tasklauncher#getprogress  https   github com ow2 proactive scheduling blob master scheduler scheduler node src main java org ow2 proactive scheduler task tasklauncher java#l369   regarding the item _tasklauncher#getprogress_  the method is defined with _ immediateservice_ which implies that a new thread will be created for each invokation  which may explain threads exhaustion since there is no upper bound for immediate services   i think it could be interesting to investigate deeper the issue  one possibility is to increase the ping period to see if the issue comes from that  if it is the case  a solution or even general improvement could be to see if the scheduler behaviour could be changed in order to send a single ping request to an host even if it contains several proactive nodes

ipv6 host names are not checked for brackets when using httprequest with servletcall    servletcall gethostdomain    simply returns the result of  getservername    from the  httpservletrequest  without surrounding it with brackets   unfortunately  in combination with the  httpclient  constructor  this results in cases where  hostref  contains a malformed url  since the  hostref  url is assembled by using  stringbuilder   why    with everything concatenated without escaping   this causes issues with jetty 9 servlets and  servletadapter   since  httpservletrequest getservername    there returns ipv6 addresses without any escaping   for example  when accessing    this can be fixed by changing either  httpclient  or  servletcall  to check for unbracketed ipv6 addresses and bracket them as necessary  i'm not sure which is the right way  the _right_ right way  of course  being using  java net uri  for assembling urls  and not that  stringbuilder  hack  but i assume you had reasons to do it this way   i'll make a pull request with  servletcall  changed

keyboard not dismissed automatically     description    when you input data into the edit text field and then you decide to go back to parent view  you click on back arrow inside the toolbar  top right corner   however  the child to parent redirection animation is faster then the hide keyboard animation  therefore you have this behavior    a href "https   imgflip com gif 26m21b"  img src "https   i imgflip com 26m21b gif" title "made at imgflip com"    a   as you can see even when the parent view is already displayed the keyboard is still visible for less than a second         steps to reproduce     open conversation view   tap search icon    tap the edit text field  if keyboard is not visible    click the back arrow to go back to the previous view    note    i have also observed this behavior in other views that have child parent redirection  so i think it would be nice to deal with this issue to have better animation and user experience  i have an idea how to fix this  so i would also like to claim this issue  will provide you with a pull request soon 
test fails if trying to stop container that's already been stopped     background     i'm working on building a setup in which i spin up a container for the app  wildfly docker  and another container for selenium  for graphene drone testing    to make things easier hostname wise  the selenium container is linked to the wildfly container   to make sure everything is ready for testing  i have an autostartcontainers set to start the selenium container   since the selenium container is linked to the wildfly docker container  both are started up     problem     the test runs  everything is happy   but  when trying to tear things down  i also have the clean option set   things blow up   what i'm thinking is happening is that the test tears down the container being used for testing  wildfly docker   but the autostart  or clean   is also trying to tear it down     here's the exception         fix     i've prepared a pr  coming in just a moment  that modifies the  dockercube 's  stop  and  destroy  methods to ignore  notfoundexception s   if such an exception is thrown  the container has stopped and is no longer accessible  so has effectively been destroyed   therefore  it's not really an error and the rest of the teardown process can continue   if you have another suggestion idea on how to fix this  i'd love to chat and work on another idea

please deprecate scanfilters in the rxbleclient scanbledevices scansettings scansettings  scanfilter    scanfilters  method   apparently   scanfilters  doesn't work on some devices  for example  filtering by service uuid doesn't work on samsung galaxy s6  as documented by https   stackoverflow com questions 34065210 android ble device scan with filter is not working   and i confirmed this issue myself today  after spending 2+ hours troubleshooting   the workaround is to remove all  scanfilters  and filter results "manually"   rxandroidble shouldn't expose broken os functionality  when a workaround is so apparent  please remove  scanfilters  altogether  and let developers filter results with an rx   filter  operator   which is going to work 100    thanks

database migrations may not have run before jdbctemplate is used   using spring boot 2 0 2 release i set up a simple project that uses flyway for migrations and jdbc template for accessing the db  i expect all flyway migrations to finish running _before_ i can use the datasource  however  i noticed that postconstruct runs before flyway migrations  that means i access the _old_ version of the schema  causing application failures   as mentioned  here  https   github com spring projects spring boot issues 8649   one may annotate the component that uses jdbctemplate with    dependson  "flyway"  "flywayinitializer"     but this is cumbersome and error prone   it is easy to forget to do so  and i don't see a reason this shouldn't be the default behaviour   the attached project is a minimal spring boot application with a single component that uses the database in its postconstruct method  the output shows that postconstruct is called _before_ flyway runs    demo 4 zip  https   github com spring projects spring boot files 1998477 demo 4 zip

smeltery output exceeds input when daisy chaining casting tables and basins     2017 08 29_15 45 58  https   user images githubusercontent com 31381047 29843340 48ff4e04 8cd1 11e7 88eb 406d031ee3b6 png   when daisy chaining casting tables  a player obtains more material than input into the smelter originally  in the example above  1 ingot will output 6 ingots   what appears to be happening is when the ingot is pulled out of the casting table by the hopper  it updates the drain  which is powered by the redstone block  this checks the table for the amount of material available  and begins casting it  since the ingot has already been pulled from the table  but the casting begins before the value has been updated  it duplicates the ingot   when done with basins  the behavior is a little different  instead of casting an entire block  the basin only fills partially  with 1 ingot's worth of material  when using an ingot cast in one table  and a nugget cast below  a player will receive an extra nugget   i believe the issue should be able to be fixed without affecting the way the drains update  which has been useful for automating the smelter using vanilla mechanics   mc version  1 11 2 forge version  13 20 1 2454  edit  confirmed the behavior still occurs in mc  1 12 1 forge  14 22 0 2464

client side load balancing   we’re using okhttp for server to server connections on high latency http 2 connections  i’d like some load balancing features        multiple http 2 connections to the same hostname + ip address    we currently have code that aggressively tries to deduplicate connections to the same destination  but our destinations are virtual server side load balancers that front application servers  we want to cycle out these application servers without clients having to wait for tls handshakes        preallocated connections    seeding the connection pool before we need it  so when we do we don’t have to pay for a tls handshake        client side connection ttls    long lived connections can hide problems  by forcing connections to be recreated at a regular interval  say  1 hour  we can detect performance problems  thundering herds  etc   before they bite 
adding a bugtracker area in the "execution report by tag" page   hello    it would be interesting having a "bugtracker report" area zone in the "execution report by tag" page  the area would contains the following elements       buglist with a link of the concerned bug detail page  listing the different bugs opened     the repetition of a bug  permit priorisation of a redundant detected bug     testcase execution link  cf mock upl  or a testcasecript link  the link would be the first execution testcase affected by the bug     the number of ko fa and the total of bug opened    so we can calculate the  bug coverage ratio     buglist  https   user images githubusercontent com 29098010 32319956 7a87d41e bfbc 11e7 9bf9 c4a5998a295b jpg 
honoclientimpl may reach state where getorcreatesender   fails each time   we noticed that at one point our hono rest adapter instance began answering each telemetry request with a 503 response  a look in the logs revealed the following    the last message is repeated with each new telemetry request   it looks like the last invocation of _honoclientimpl getorcreatesender  _ where a new sender was about to be created  "creating new message sender for telemetry default_tenant"  did not finish  that means each following invocation fails  "already trying to create a message sender"     maybe there should be a timeout associated with the sender creation attempt 
metrics "short circuit read" and "cache hit rate" for alluxio local does not update      alluxio version    alluxio 2 0    describe the bug   metrics like short circuit read and cache hit rate for alluxio local does not update or more precisely it always gives zero on running    alluxio fsadmin report metrics    so even if it's caching or not i don't know because it's updating other metrics like   under filesystem read  and  cache hit rate for alluxio remote    but my spark ui shows process_level and node_level of data locality   note    flag  alluxio user metrics collection enabled true  is already there in alluxio site conf    to reproduce       expected behavior   if my spark ui shows the data locality level at process local and node local then alluxio metric must show some short circuit read overall      additional context   to make sure of data locality i'm running my setup with a single worker node and spark  and alluxio worker both running on that same node   i also needed one clarification     spark read parquet "alluxio    path to parquet file"   i think by the time spark does this transformation  it gathers node information where it's going to deploy executors according to data locality  is it so   if not then when and how spark get to know the partition location on worker nodes

the settings index mapping settings from the index template are not always being applied on index creation   i am currently running the elk stack ver 6 2 2 with x pack on centos 7 x and i have been

mockito can't spy on object loaded in parent classloader   i have encountered issue with mockito  i have tested this on 1 10 14  and usage of different classloaders   running tests in sbt 0 13   i have got empty class _testclass_ and following test     looks like there is class loader issue   in sbt  the default classloader is the one for the sbt launcher  but you are "run" in a sub classloader   following calls give different result  _thread currentthread   getcontextclassloader   getclass   _ and _testclass class getclassloader   getclass   _  the second one is the parent of the first one   of course there is no issue running this piece of code in ide  but in my opinion this is mockito's problem  something which could be improved    is it possible to have this fixed in mockito  i would say so because changing current classloader to the one used to load the class solves the issue

high cpu usage when uploading file with okhttp   hi  i am using okhttp to upload a file to a server  actually presigned url of aws s3   my server  the one which uses okhttp and does the upload  is also hosted on aws and is deployed within a docker  i noticed that it takes about 8 seconds to upload a 30mb file  where if i just use a curl command that does the same thing  also inside the docker  it takes 1 5 seconds  after some digging i noticed that when okhttp is working the cpu is reaching 100   where with curl it is not really affected  i also tested using a much stronger ec2 instance  40vcpu   and still took 8 seconds and 100  cpu of the docker  when i run my jar outside of the docker it actually worked in appropriate time  2  seconds   but i still noticed a significant cpu spike during the upload  eventually i changed to a different http library   apache httpclient  https   hc apache org httpcomponents client 4 5 x httpclient apidocs index html   and it is working just like the curl command  1 5 seonds and not cpu spikes   ### code snippet of okhttp usage of uploading    if you need more details i will gladly add whatever is needed

mavenversionrange includes is buggy   according to the  maven specs  http   maven apache org enforcer enforcer rules versionranges html  the maven version range " 1 0 1  " means v    1 0 1  however  feeding this range and "1 0 1" to  mavenversionrange includes  returns  false     the "missing" upper limit is converted to 0 0 0  this is wrong  because  mavenversion compare   used in  mavenversionrange includes   quite correctly does not consider "1 0 1" to be smaller than "0 0 0"  so "0 0 0" may not be used as replacement for the missing upper bound  or special handling must be implemented

unknown and random device types   i finally got around to chasing down why i get a random device being discovered each time the stack starts for my hue  my hue bulbs show an endpoint 242   it's always been there  and it's a little frustrating in that every time the stack starts it gives this endpoint a different device type   i want to stop this      there are really two issues here   firstly  the random selection of device type  this is just plane bad news   in the case of the hue  where the device isn't known anyway  it doesn't matter  however it means even if the device is known  if it somehow happens to come up with the same score when the factory is evaluating a match  then next time it might evaluate to a different device if it matches two devices with the same score   in my case  the reason for the randomness is that this device doesn't come up with any score from the factor 'hasmatch'  so  the first class in the factory is the winner and the order isn't defined  so we end up with a random selection each time   this issue is easily solved by using a map that has a defined order   i've made this modification and will generate a pr soon   the other issue is that returning any device type when the score is 0 is wrong   it hasn't matched any clusters  so we can't really say that this is the device  well  not one that we know    so  to resolve this i propose to return null from getbestdeviceproxyfactory which stops the device being constructed    pr to follow 
quick battery drain after hitting "refresh"   multiple of my main folders don't show any subfolders when viewed via the android app   so i then hit "refresh" in the file list  it never seems to complete and you just get the progress circle going on forever  afterwards  i usually go back about my business  however  after hitting refresh  it then causes a ton of wakelocks  and quickly drains the battery   if i do that  i have to force close the app  and the issue resolves  interestingly  if you restart the app but don't try to refresh anything  the instant upload feature works fine and doesn't cause this issue

collector tasks queue after stopping   hello   after stopping of the collector i got full log of such messages  and stopping takes very long time  hours      as i get collector's flow  allalready queued tasks must be finished before the instance has stopped  so from the moment of receiving of stopping command the app doesn't plan new tasks but execute all already planned   also after stop command  receiving  the app clears all connections pool and doesn't allow to open new connections  so all queued tasks left can't be finished normally  and are killed by timeout  it means that crawler with large queue doesn't clear tasks queue normally  and shutdowns extremely slow    may we discuss this possible issue

postings highlighter wrong highlighting   as reported as a comment in #4042  the postings highlighter has a weird behaviour  it seems like it remembers the offsets of the previously highlighted documents  well  what happens is that it actually highlights the right text against the wrong offsets  because of most likely the silliest mistake one can make working with lucene  that is using doc ids that are relative to the segment they belong as they were unique instead of the doc ids that contain the segment offset too  surprising that this wasn't raised by our tests though  as we have a pretty good coverage for the postings highlighter  will improve that too

jgitenvironmentrepository shouldpull   isclean   check hides dirty local repo bug   running config server version 1 0 4 release  but it appears this applies to most  if not all  versions   we've been dealing with an issue with config server returning environment data that does not reflect what is actually in git  we went through many theories on why or how config server was going 'stale'   we finally figured out that one of our chef jobs was deleting files and folders on the servers with the same name as each microservice as part of a cleanup each time chef runs  this  of course  is a problem for config server because the files in its repo match the app name  many files within the local git repo used by config server were getting deleted  which causes the repo to become 'dirty'  the current impl of the jgitenvironmentrepository shouldpull   method returns false whenever the local repo is not clean     is there a good use case for this local repo to ever be dirty  shouldn't config server just accept whatever comes from the remote  if there is one   if there is a good use case for this that i am simply not aware of or not thinking of  feel free to close this issue   we have changed our chef jobs to be less aggressive and more specific in their cleanup  we will also be looking at adding in an extra health check for config server to check for isclean   hopefully this helps someone down the road

android examples fail to build with minify enabled   i ran into an issue with minify when testing out release builds of my project  so i built the android examples normally  which works  but when i change     same issue with my own project  but with a few more unresolved classes   note it's the  warning 21 unresolved references     that causes the build failure    i'm  pretty sure  i can just ignore these  is there any formal direction on the preferred way to resolve this issue  i am not sure why there is a discrepancy between google's  minify  and  proguard   it would probably be good to have the examples work with  minify  now that it's the suggested option especially if you rely on multidex  which is the case for many android apps now

some users are unable to make towns    hello   this has been an ongoing issue for me   for a few months now  recently i've really been trying to get it sorted though as it is having an impact on my new players   i was originally using sqlite for my data storage  and noticed every time someone tried to make a town it would spam the console with database locks issues  the town would be created but under the name server admins  and the resident wouldn't own the town  the resident would get a message stating the plot they were in was already claimed    t map shows no areas nearby claimed at all   i asked on irc and afterwind told me it was a tps related issue  however  i logged the tps for a while and it stayed at a flat 20  until someone did a town command where the db would lock and the tps would fall to around 12 for a few minutes  then return to normal   after more discussion on irc  i was told that switching to mysql would solve the issue  i attempted to convert my database but couldn't get it working  not very good with db stuff   so ended up just creating an entirely new mysql and recreating towns   this didn't fix my issue at all   newbies who try and make town still often get the same issue  however  there's nothing in the console about a database lock  and the tps is totally unaffected  been trying to ask on irc for a few days but haven't got a reply   tl dr  users can't make towns sometimes  using mysql  tps is fine http   ctrlv in 622153   note i deleted most of the server admins towns just left that as an example

postgresql active schema should modify search_path   when opening a sql editor in order to get content assist i need to activate one of the schemas in the database  but when i try to run a query created using content assist  it will fail because my search_path by default points to public only  this may cause the odd situation that my content assist uses one schema and my queries run on a different one  i believe that the active schema and the search_path of the sql editor should be connected   when activating a schema please change the search_path to active_schema public  or at least when opening a new sql editor  by default set its search_path to active_schema public

 ctrl+c  often fails silently when editing during rls builds    ctrl+c has stopped working reliably in the last few weeks  this is very annoying  as  ctrl+c  +  ctrl+v  sometimes pastes old clipboard content   attempting to  ctrl+c  +  ctrl+v  multiple times eventually achieves the result   i most cases i can observe rls doing work in the background when this happens  which is "very often"

driver break locations can become fixed at vehicle start location   you're in luck with repeatability  i pulled some unusual data and managed to exasperate the problem  which potentially says something about the problem   when the distance from the warehouse to the majority of the delivery locations is large  and therefore more expensive   i wonder if there is some conflict on the algorithm override  which balances the high cost of not having a lunch break  that then makes the lunch break become associated with location number of the vehicle   essentially the problem is sporadic  whereby a lunch break loses its variable location status and defaults back to the driver start location  attached is a distance matrix  km   time matrix  mins    they are of the format  from  to  value    a csv i created to show the arrival and departure times of my solution  and the code setup of the override  which i believe to still be the same as you wrote in the example in every way  just horribly formatted in a  txt   you can see that the long service time for the lunch means that 3 jobs are kicked to unassigned   https   drive google com folderview id 0b 8kpqeqjb9ztzzjndznctz1ne0 usp sharing  edit  note you also don't have to be so strict on the lunch break times for this to happen  i was testing whether the issue arises because the window for the lunch break was larger than the duration of the break  it makes no difference as far as i can see
