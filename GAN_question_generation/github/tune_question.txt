Does this crash go away if you use V13?  I think the issue is that you don't have any packs installed with components, so it's crashing as there's nothing to render.
What exact items are you putting in the kits? /ci didn't clear armor in previous versions of Minecraft, so we decided to keep that behavior.
Can you somehow figure out which manifest is troublesome and paste it here? Actually, it's just the Require-Bundle header that is interesting for me.  Sorry for the inconvenience. 
Could u send me the log of this happening? I mean u said the client.prefs are missing anyway... So the prompt is simply wrong... I would assume it is some permission error that the client can not read or write the none existing client.prefs file and instead of showing that error it shows this prompt
Did the login dialog go away? 
Can you please report the first 4 lines of your `sample.fastq`?
Could you please write the suggested java code, so it is more clear?
Can you provide me your code?
Could you maybe check the Javascript console (Shift+Ctrl+j) for errors and post them here? I'll install Chromium ASAP, too. 
What do you get if you use the preview?  Note: with enough moving around I was able to get Viewer to interfere only if it's in the lower left and work fine if it's in the upper right. 
What version of Buildcraft? What version of Minecraft? Are you running Optifine? 
Could you upload an example project reproducing the crash?
Could you please provide the following information:  - What sql2o version do you use? - What database and jdbc driver do you use?   Regards Lars Aaberg
Can you upload a small reproducer app?  Our tests work and your failure may be because we've overlooked something your application has or uses.   Thanks. 
Which ones specifically do not work?
Does it happen every time for you? 
Can you cat ~/.bazelrc ? What's your installation directory? 
Can you please re-test with 0.7.4-SNAPSHOT? 
Would you mind to reproduce it in a unit test? 
How was the sensor registered? via lsm_register, using a metadata file? 
Could you provide more details? For example, your WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter config, your properties(except sensitive data). And if you can provide a sample project, that will be better. 
Could you please get this fixed ASAP?  Thanks, Techcable 
Did pull request #26 fix this?  Note that if you add info like "Fixes #24" in the pull request description, then the issue is closed automatically when the pull request is closed. 
Could you give more information? I assume you're referring to the tooltip not showing up?  Can you post your client log? Do you have any other mods installed? Does it happen when only AppleCore is installed? 
Could you send a pull request to that effect?
can you give a bit more detail please? What changes do you make? When you say "console logging" do you mean starting Payara Server in verbose mode?
Could you send memory dump after call of "Orient.instance().shutdown(); ?

What is your in-game name please (with exact spelling and punctuation)? 
Could you please give us some sample code? 
Which version of Flowable are you using? How are you running this query? With a Spring Boot application or something else?

did you update your build.xml?  ``` ~/android-sdks/tools/android update project --path . --target android-18 --subprojects ``` 
Can we just restrict our application to portrait mode for now? This will happen in almost every screen (and not just hotels)
What do you mean with this? 7. Also don't get this one, are you talking about the message being configurable? I already added that in the premium version. 8. Yes, this will be added in premium. Not sure if free will get it as well. 9. Don't work how? Seem fine on my tests. 
When did this occur?
Does this happen without addons?
Could you please try to be a bit more specific about what's the issue you're facing ? The errors above seem normal... Do they constantly repeat ? Is your Jedis client become nonoperational ? 
Can you please share more than just a stack trace? If possible, a project that recreates the problem?

Can you confirm that? That might, at least, be a temporary solution while someone looks at this.  Thank you!
Do you have an example where this problem occurs, preferable as GraphHopper Maps link? 
Can you provide a test case to reproduce the issue? Spinning up a massive amount of messages does not help to reliably diagnose the issue. [`PubSubCommandHandlerUnitTests`](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/blob/0e0d62ada7cfdcd981e8a366973b896a12c3571c/src/test/java/io/lettuce/core/pubsub/PubSubCommandHandlerUnitTests.java#L57) is a good starting point for isolated Pub/Sub testing.
Can you try setting both your **mode** and **endpoint** configurations to live values?   I found a similar issue here and changing both of those configuration values was the suggestion https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Java-SDK/issues/138. 
Which action triggered the error please? I'm asking as everything works for me and I do not have other reports about the problem from other users.

What is the error message when it crashes? 
Could you send the Board.yml file? 
What mod and minecraft version are you using?
do you mean in the source code of the app?
Do you have a stack trace? 
How consistently does this occur?  Is it only Curios crashing or is it the same behavior as before where the addons may crash as well?  Does it not happen if it's only Curios and its addons? Does it not happen if it's only the other mods and no Curios?
Can you elaborate on what is causing the issue? It is really weird. 
While this is indeed an issue on the RStudio side, would you consider re-working your package here?
do annotations work for other SCMs or just AccuRev ?
What was the target sdk of your emulator?
Do we still have an issue here ? 
Can you provide us with some reports so we can visually see the issue and also see if the theme actually uses white as the primary color? Thanks would help us a lot. Thanks in advance.

Can you even reproduce this? 
Can you please post a screenshot / screenrecord? 
Would you mind this being included in FoamFix?
Would that be possible for you to share a unit test exposing this incorrect behaviour? Thanks.
Do you add an user in openScale? Is this crash repeatable? Does it also crash when your Amazfit Notfiy is not running?
Do you know which code triggers this?
Can you please try today's snapshot to see if that fixes the current problem? (and probably also indirectly #152 &mdash; if that doesn't, then we'd still like to see a reproducer for 152) 
Does the result build?
Should this be targeting an RC2 as RC1 is already released? 
Can you provide a sample to reproduce the issue?
Do you some particular project in mind that we can experiment with? 
Maybe it has something to do with when it breaks out of the loop from the return statement? Not sure, I tried to help though haha!
could you provide your implementation of uint32? I will make test
Can you give us a concrete example please? Everytime makes no sense. This should only happen in rare occasions.
Can you provide a link to a GitHub repo that reproduces the problem?
Should I add this is a bug / problem as well? 
What is the error that you are getting?
Could you let me know the build version and the environment? 
Could you check your network?  Regard, 
Can you provide some steps to reproduce the "not enough cards" not showing an error? 
Did you have a security manager active?
Does it create the `response.json` file? The `inCaptureOrSimulationMode` checks for the existence of the file to determine what mode to use. 
Could you please try the updated version here? https://builds.jabref.org/fixCustomExportFileType/ The current version contains the commit id  1a0cde3 in the version number
What arguments are you using with the Launcher for building Spoon model?  
Maybe there are ways to set up the security manager so it allows this kind of class to be unsigned? Or maybe you need to carefully break up your application so the `@Configuration` files are not signed. 
Does that change when you restart the phone / force kill delta?
What would you expect in this case? A `percolate` query is used to matched stored percolator queries and not meant to be used inside a percolator query.
Why  not just a parameter called topicAttributeName that is an rstring containing the name of the attribute? 
Which package name have you used to produce this bug? 
What are the unresolved references?
Do you have a good source of info on exactly _what_ the fonts, font sizes and colors should be? 
Maybe we could use something like https://github.com/ThomasKrieger/concurrent-junit to reproduce the error in a test? WDYT? 
Shall we remove it (in order to simplify both the code and the UI) ? 
Which version of SBA are you using?
Do we have examples?  Because on my side, I tend to have this one:  > Error: Could not find or load main class org.gradle.wrapper.GradleWrapperMain  Which is more Gradle related than Ehcache 
why not simply remove the toString() mapping from UnDefType? 
Which version of Bazel are you using? Can we get a full repro (which build file and a bazel command to run)?
Will that be fixed so I can run gatk-launch with spark jobs? 
Does it happen in latest build? Looks like all fine, except list height was only one row, so only one row was visible on screen. Should be fixed already. 
Can you also share the explanation of a document that gets ranked higher even though it should be worse? 
Could you check if the file is correctly uploaded? Without it, it will be hard to reproduce the error.  @JabRef/developers Since this it about importers, it sounds very much like a task for our students. 
Maybe a config option to disable JEI hotkeys in the creative menu? 
Do I understand this right that you are currently having fw version 4.16.3.7 and want to downgrade to 4.5.12.10? Or did you actually attempt to upgrade or downgrade and it didn't work? Do you have any error message or log? 
What version of spring are you using?   What version of spring-osgi are you using?
Does this happen for other FE commands? Its very likely an issue with perm reg - will fix tomorrow. 
Did you disable the chunkloading in the config? 
Do you have any logs from beyond the crash?  An SSL error should not produce a crash.  Are you inspecting the traffic across the wire, and/or do other CPU architectures work ok? 
Would you mind if I close this a duplicate of #502 ? We can fix it, just didn't get proper attention yet.
When you say play/pause button, you mean the audioplayer view, right? (There is also the widget, notifications, lock screen...) 
Can you try to enable new image loader in settings ("Feature flags" section) and see if it still happening?
Shall we close it? 
Does it happen when you do something specific? Are you using the online replay vault a lot?
Can you grab more context? That looks like "normal" messages from the media player framework when it encounters a bad frame, which happens all the time with OTA content. 
What's wrong with the trapdoors?
What makes you think it's also a bug in OTP? 
Maybe we can disable auto-build when the interface is missing?
Do you have a picture of your inventory size in normal and large mode for reference?
What version of BattleArena are you running?  Players should be respawning back where they are joined.  
When you clone the project, did you open the project configuration wizard and set it to maven?  We built Codenvy and Che with maven multi modules, so this is something that is tested and used often. 
Do you also have Iron Chests installed by any chance?
Where do you see evidence of parallel test execution? 
Do those two devices have something in common that might differ from a standard Android system? Are you using a custom rom, perhaps? 
When the release would be available ?
Could the command be parameterized so it take the file name? We used to have that in the commands macro? cc @RomanNikitenko and @azatsarynnyy 
Couldn't you just use regular string interpolation here?  i.e. ``` const pronoun = "He/She" Given(`${pronoun} have/has {int} child(ren)`, (childCount) => {   // Code that does not require the "pronoun" parameter at all }); ```
does it happen without any mods that affect or modify the sound system?
Does this happen regardless of how many items are in the list?
Maybe we should install https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rng-tools to increase the entropy? 
What should it be doing?  
Can you confirm this with the default resource pack? 
Can you please use the issue template? There are #339 and #1321, so I'm wondering if this persists in the current version.

Do you mind checking if it is still happening for you?  Did you have any modules enabled? It looks like you did from the UI in that screenshot.
What did you do prior to crash? 
Could you show benchmarking code, please? 
Can you login using the app? I think the servers are just down again: http://cmmcd.com/PokemonGo/ 
can you describe the issue in more details please? 
Can you provide a small reproducer of your case as a test case for the client ? 
Can you provide a server launch log (if multiplayer) or client startup log (if single player)?
How are you editing the inventory? Can't reproduce this using /npc inventory
How about store your log in information data as Android preference and use it every time when it needs to log in? Surely, you need to input data again when it is removed. 
Maybe add max length for redis plugin about peer?
Can you attach your entity/embedded classes?  I'm not sure I can recreate your issue with just these details. 
Can you double check the version you are using?  cc/ @schmidt-sebastian

Would it be difficult to publish a new point release with this in? Thank you very much! 
Maybe a rewrite of command system needed in the future? 
Shouldn't this be an epic?

Do you have the entire server log? 
Can you post your mapping? Showing nested type definitions and all. 
Did you grant c:geo the permission to access your storage?
How did you do it?
How did you make the change? Did you make sure to change the correct config and restart the server instance following the change?
how do those look with this shader?
What do you think? 
How are LUGARES-contador and LUGARES declared? I really doubt that there is a bug in sprintf, it's more likely a bug in your own code. 
Can you please post which version of deegree you are using for generating the SQL DDL and deegree FeatureStore configuration files?  And please post for which version of deegree you would like to have the bug fix. 
What's the status now? Is the index ready on all the nodes? If not, could you rebuild it on the node where wasn't built?, 
Do you have time to submit a PR to fix this issue by chance? 
Cannot recreate - can this be closed ? 
What did you try?
Can't reproduce it myself, you found a good way to? My setup: https://i.imgur.com/nTMyjtL.png
Do you have an idea how I would filter the output to just the Nextcloud app?  Otherwise I'm looking at reinstalling my phone later this week anyway, and hopefully be able to provide more readable logs after that.
could you elaborate?
What bow, what does it actually add, and were they didabled for the pack/gated?  Also, vanilla mc makes certain enchants naturally incompatible, so knowing what was already on the bow/what was added is important here.
Where do you get this error? If you can't get the logs, can you show a screenshot of the error?
What device / emulator and Android version does this happen on? Also, can you repro with the latest version of Fresco?  CC @lambdapioneer for native magic.
Which client? 
Do you have latest Version?  
Can you show me showImagePicker result ?  That can appears if you take a picture while the dev menu is still opened.  in **RN 0.18.0** you don't need to override ReactActivity.onCreate. That's maybe an issue with your implementation 
What exactly goes wrong when it's placing blocks? Could it be a firewall and/or network throttler slowing down the network traffic?
Do you get any error messages? In the gui? In the server log? In what way does it not work?
Can you provide a test? 
Can you provide me with a crash report?

Would you submit a pull request to fix this?  cc @candyleer 
Can you check this again against master?
How do you remove the dank null from the docking station from your offhand? That doesn't make sense to me. I currently have a dank null in the docking station that cannot be removed.....I've tried everything.
How do you know it's NPE?  We can't do much without a stacktrace.
How does it know about the type later if the entries are not in the map?  I went through this code quite a few times when working on the Rio integration and didn't see any way around it at that point in time. 
can you please share which DL4J version you're using?
could you try with 1.1 RC and various browsers ?
Does it happen in 1.11?
does the issue happen without authme installed?
Will FSB miss any vulnerabilities? It does not affect the stack state this is less critical. 
How should the workflow be? Attempt to fork or no operation if it exists, then create a new branch (i.e. `stringlate-####` with a random number), and commit there?
Would you like to show me the metadata configuration that you have defined in the AndroidManifest?  
Can you please provide a specific example to test this?
Would a config option to not register the fluid blocks be okay? It would be disabled by default but pack makers such as yourself could have it enabled, so that no-one who plays the pack ever adds any of the fluid blocks to their game.
Can you make your problem small so that you still have this error and send it to me? Otherwise it will be hard to reproduce. 
Can you export the aquarium?
Which Minecraft version do you use? (server and client) 2. Do you run CraftBukkit or Spigot? 3. Which version of iDisguise do you use? 4. Do you use any of the following: BungeeCord, ProtocolLib, ViaVersion, LibsDisguises (anything similar)

What about on Windows?
Do you want to have it match that instead?
Can you provide a [complete, minimal, verifiable sample](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) that reproduces the problem? It should be available as a GitHub (or similar) project or attached to this issue as a zip file.
Can you try with just our mod and bookshelf?  
Could you check ? 
Would you be able to confirm this for me? 
Do you know what the token response contained? I'll soften the error to an AuthorizationException regardless, but it would be useful to know what the JSON content of the response was that tripped up the library. Looking at the code, it's possible the response was missing a `token_type` field.
Could you put it here? Thanks! 
How are you starting up che? If you are using docker then you can set `-e CHE_WORKSPACE_VOLUME=/example/local/host/path:/home/user` using the cli.
What's the actual problem that you get? Can you attach a stack trace?
Could you try to find out which one it is? 
What version are you running? 
What JRE/JDK Version do you use? 
Do you use HockeySDK 3.5? If yes, which string is hardcoded? 
Could you try on some other examples?
Did you consider backporting this to `2.1.x`? From the description, it sounds more like a bug than an enhancement to me.
What browser do you use and do you have any screenshots? 
Which version of Broadleaf are you building against? 
Which build are you looking at? 
Could you try changing that and see if it's working now for you?  Thanks. 
Can you check the version on the command prompt? Just run `ballerina version` and see.. The error message indicates that you are trying to run a program compiled using a different Ballerina version than the one you are trying to run it with.. 
Do the clients have any information (crashes, errors or other problems) in their logs? 
What's the output from `ls -ln`?
will this also affect 2.0 branch or 1.8 branch too?

do they start to decay imidiately after growing?
Could you please post some of your test data (index mapping and couple of documents) so we can reproduce the issue?
What version are you using? Please try latest if you are not already. This was an issue back in 0.1.0b 
Can you export with smaller rates using other types fluid transfer pipes?
Can you provide a new stacktrace?  Also I can't really test this because I'd need two accounts or do I? How do you reproduce this?
How do you download the source code? With a git clone or directly the zip archive? I suppose the second one. I've fixed the issue with #92. Could you test it?
Can you be more specific about what the problem is?  Or perhaps attach a full OpenAPI3 spec as a reproducer?
Which version are you using? 
Maybe we have a `toString` that fails? and that the value put as argument was slightly different than the one we just saw?
Maybe each fetcher should be tagged what modes it supports? 
Will you be able to compile Kiss from your side of the ocean to ensure the bug is fixed ? 
What versions are you using?
Where am i getting wrong? Please guide.
Can you please check the registry entries [as described by Cycor in this comment](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/210#issuecomment-262034669)?
Does the API throw an exception, and if so, can you show me the stack trace?  Gideon
Do you have them in sync? 
Can I get a screenshot? Seems like some other mod is probably manually drawing the overlapping text.  AppleCore uses the [relevant Forge event and simply adds a string to the list](https://github.com/squeek502/AppleCore/blob/1.7.10/java/squeek/applecore/client/DebugInfoHandler.java#L41). 
What version of REST Docs are you using?
Can you share a sample project file so that we were able to report this bug to the library authors?
Can you try and increase detection_millis in the config and tell me on which value the flagging of screenshots / resourcepack changes ends?
Do you fill your adapter with items after these strings? Could you please provide the code of your adapter (not wrapper one)? 
What version are you using? 
Maybe attach a sample app? Creating views like this is unusual, but probably fine. Usually the behavior you're describing comes from view re-use.
Do you need a new version? We can release one, if needed at the beginning of next week. 
Don't you think it would be better to have it as an exception? 
Could you point out where the changes have to be made?
Could you please try if you can reproduce the crash with `show_column_numbers = False`?
Do you calling the `cancelDrag()` method after calling the `release()` method?   https://github.com/h6ah4i/android-advancedrecyclerview/blob/0.8.5/library/src/main/java/com/h6ah4i/android/widget/advrecyclerview/draggable/RecyclerViewDragDropManager.java#L746  It seems that NPE can be occurred by the following conditions; - after the `release()` method has been called - before calling the `attachRecyclerView()` method 
Would you be able to post actual screenshots (Press Volume Down + Power button) that illustrate the problem? I see no resolution issues in the images you posted. 
Could you define `TRAVIS_TAG` as version name and `TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER` as version code? Or please tell me F-Droid build environment variables?
Where exactly does that happen? Can you share the steps to reproduce this? 
Could you try it on a fresh world and see if the same thing happens?
Where do you get End Asteroids?  Because I want them badly. 
Can I have a screenshot of those?
Will you quit opening issues instead of closing them? Damnit ;) OK I'll take that one, it does seem a little scary. 
Does this happen if you run a pack with just Immersive Engineering, Betweenlands, and JEI? My guess is its caused by the Forge universal bucket, a Forge feature that is disabled by default but some mods (such as Tinkers Construct and Immersive Engineering) enable.
Doing it without block updates, you mean like sending a custom network packet?   Or using the "setField" system? 
Does it happen in a single thread environment? I used to have one similar to that one, it was because I was holding a $() in a static variable and several threads were using it
Can you take a crack at that one? You fixed this one time before didn't you? 
What do you think?  Best regards, Tommi 
What's the error?  It would be great if you could give us the whole Minecraft Forge log. 
What's your permission plugin?
Can you sample a stacktrace of the service while it's being slow? I wonder if OkHttp is negotiating HTTP/2 which could explain dramatically different performance vs. other clients.  Tracing information is available either with a profiler, or just with calling jstack while OkHttp is spinning.

Can you be more specific? Copy on the same instance? Copy from pipeline list, or into another pipeline. 
Do you have a full stacktrace of the error?

Do you have more logs? 
Could you verify whether your issue still persists in this version? Thanks.
Can you elaborate a bit more, what does happen in this case? In the example, it looks like the value1 reference (or value) is reassigned to value1+value2. That does not modify any internal object, or am I overlooking something?

Do you have the full output to share? 
Could you check this?
do you? 
Did you provide https in url and port in separate field? In my experience if I provide non-empty port (in my case I tried putting 443 there) it won't connect, but leaving port empty works just fine. I'm using similar setup to you - ssl from LE and nginx as reverse proxy.

Can you try adding `F.initSymbols()` after setting the Config flags?  If that doesn't work can you try setting `Config.JAS_NO_THREADS = true;`

why not let scheduler and tmaster talk directly rather than use packing plan in statemgr in between as communication signal ? in 3a, the executor, besides stmgr, watches the statemgr, which doubles the connection count on zookeeper for each container ?
Can you provide an example that fails?

Why.. would you need that? That'd mean that you _have_ to input every dimension into that. That'd make things more difficult and really annoying. So no, sorry, I'm not going to do that. 
How many icons you have, on which device?  I was able to fit 8 items / tabs without any clipping on a Nexus S portrait screen, so I'm not sure how to replicate your problem.
Could you share a screenshot?  I don't understand why Android Studio would reject a pom which has dependencies in it? 
What do you think?
Does something similar happen to things like grass or poppies? 
Does the package.json file you're analyzing not have a version number? 
Does this affect v1.18?
Would you like to make a pull request for this ? Or do you prefer that I make the change ?   
Maybe the same as my observation? #431
Could you investigate the cause? here is the method for debug https://github.com/redisson/redisson/blob/f7b3fbc64a422e625f974b23f1d5dfc73542ad1e/redisson/src/main/java/org/redisson/connection/MasterSlaveConnectionManager.java#L248 
Does the problem still exist? Why is this issue closed? @AndiSlash0723 
What was the exception thrown? Seems like the stacktrace isn't complete. I couldn't reproduce this even with the steps you said.
Do other custom models on your same service work correctly? I'd maybe try creating a new custom model, add a word or two, train it, and then test that one. It could be an issue with your specific Watson service as well maybe?
Could you elaborate a little on what you mean by "intersecting but not overlapping" and/or attach a .world file demonstrating the problem?
Can you provide us additional infos via logcat? Or what is happening? https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/README.md#getting-debug-info-via-logcat
What exactly is broken now? Read this: http://www.xdsd.org/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html#toc_1  Maybe you meant that "you don't understand how to add a new PlantUML diagram to the project". If so, please correct your ticket description and its title 
What is your OS?
What is your DBeaver version? I believe this bug was fixed in 5.0.1 or 5.0.2.
What is the message you get ingame? 
did this only occur when typing fast?
Can you provide a simple example with a few rows/columns and a step-by-step to make sure that we can reproduce the behavior that you're seeing? 
Can you give us a bit more information on how you set up the server when it doesn't work? 
Did you try to debug as well? Do you somewhere call `holder.getAdapterPosition()` ?
Where do you find the offset?
Where in the app do you have this behaviour?
What is the docx file supposed to be?

Did you end up with two accounts in the list with same private key? 
Does it work if you open it from mobile browser?
Could you provide a minimal example ? I dont see very clearly what "the step doesnt even pause the model to make a choice" means. Which model isn't paused ? The comodel ? The micro-model ? Which model is the one trying to interaction with the user ?  
Can you do a git bisect and see if it's from a recent change? 
Where do they respawn exactly? What's likely happening is that another plugin is controlling the respawn location (BentoBox can be overruled) so the respawn location will likely give a hint as to which plugin is doing it.
Can you confirm if that's the case?  Unfortunately, if so, there's not much we can do about it. Luckily, however, the vast majority of images people are likely to add are going to be rectangular (at least, from a camera/gallery) 
Couldn't you also just add a command that takes the item that you're holding in your hand? 
Did you called rollback in your code at some point? If not, could you provide test case to reproduce problem? 
Can you also check and see if a failing junit step does cause Jenkins to send a failure status to GitLab? And can you check that with and without the `echo` step you're using now?
Does it correspond to the setting now? 
Maybe we should?  In the meantime a `POST /index/_flush?force` will, I think, clean things up.
Could you try setting the property anyway and see if it does something for you?
What happens if you apply the suggested change?
Do you have a minimal example that I can use to reproduce this? 
What error is being reported? What's theme are you using?
Do you mean that it restarts immediately after finishing? 
What exactly is the problem?
Can you send in a app log to me?  Trying to go off just the server output doesn't help much.  I imagine it is something specific to the DSub/Madsonic interaction which is causing the issue, since with stock Subsonic this has never happened to me. 
Which version of dCache generated this stack-trace?
Can you check in the installation directory, under the lib folder, which version of norconex-commons-lang you have? (should be in the jar file name).  If other than 1.3.2, maybe you can try again by replacing it with 1.3.2 (http://www.norconex.com/product/commons-lang/download.html). 
Which language are you trying to switch to and which version are you using?

Does it happen the same way every time?  @immortius might be able to diagnose that stacktrace better, looks almost like the entity system and GUI are getting into a fight somehow.  Also: Neat, I was about to ask for build info but I realized we've got that in the log statements now, woo!

Could you turn on TRACE level debugging for the TA CMI binding, like:  ``` xml <logger name="org.openhab.binding.tacmi" level="TRACE"/> ```  in your logback.xml file?

Could you give more information on the configuration of the framework for context?
Does the same problem occur with JDK13 builds?
Do you also get the same error after refreshing the entire workspace? There should be a stack trace in the Eclipse error log. Please provide it so that I can give you more hints. Anyhow, the exception is ugly and we should do a nice error handling! 
However that second thing sounds suspicious... what exactly do you mean by making videos and gifs skip? 
What is your keyboard layout? English? 
does this work with regular hoppers instead of the vacuum? oh wait, i know why this happens, vacuums are inputting on the clientside and TD doesn't handle that well
can you show how you use the fixed timestep? Apart from that, the only difference i can think of is float point rounding modes and the fact that on the desktop you use a different FPU than on Android.

What's the error message from the linker?  Wild guess: configure autoconf to generate a PIC static library (IIRC, pass -fPIC to the compiler); non-PIC code cannot be linked into dynamic libraries. 
Why are there no class? Are some Java files compiled or none?  This behavior is as design. This is to avoid creating jobs that run Sonar analysis and forgetting about the compilation. It is a safe guard to make sure the plugin is not giving an A+ placebo result. 
does it still get stuck on the second try? 
How did you found that it changed? Is it visible in xml? 
What are you trying to do? 
Did you log back in after the crash and play again? I'm not quite sure what's causing this (if it's a one time thing or not...). Could you try that? If you crash again post the new log here (please use a paste site, don't give me a download). That would be very helpful. 
Shouldn't the connections objects know the state the authorization systems are in to wait/refresh until they can get the credentials for the request?  Example of how this was done, https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-explorer-android/blob/master/onedriveaccess/src/main/java/com/microsoft/onedriveaccess/InterceptorFactory.java

What conditions trigger this ? Why is it that others don't seem to have this problem ?
Can you provide the entire JSON payload you send, please?   Thanks 
What's the status on this? What needs to be done? I think that this is a really nice (and long overdue) addition to the LocalExecutor.  What about adding an extra argument to the execute methods of `LocalExecutor` instead of having a new `DistributedLocalExecutor`?

What is the output of `dpkg --print-architecture`?
Does the LogService support string interpolation as slf4j does? (Maybe @ctrueden knows?) I'm asking because slf4j has this very nice optional string interpolation which only gets executed in case you are actually using this log level, which is very useful for debug and trace logging.
Can you please include the stack of the error?  Our testing disables SSL validation in many of our environments, so we believe that it works as it always has.

Can you try the latest code and let me know the result? 
Can you expand your question with more details (add any screenshot if possible)?

Can you share with us a sample project with the issue? 
What is the status of this issue? 
Maybe you can change your approach, why do you need to modify a component during the same frame it got added to the entity? Maybe you should be doing that in a system that processes entities with such component, you will only get the update for that entity once it has the component. 
Can you provide a [complete, minimal, verifiable sample](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) that reproduces the problem? It should be available as a GitHub (or similar) project or attached to this issue as a zip file.

what is the value? do you use mixed xtend lib versions?
When did this start happening? Was this happening before? I had recently added a new module to the project that contains a floating action button so I wonder if that is not getting uploaded to maven along with everything else. Ill look into it. 
Which DITA-OT version and platform (Windows or *NIX)? 
Why is this bug closed without any resolution? At the moment, this bug is the reason I don't switch to Buildship 3.x, because it is just so annoying to see every search result twice (once in the correct project and once in the root project).
Could you describe what is the error you have ?
What version of the mod are you using? We fixed an infinite exploit in version 4 of the mod.  
Does this happen to you when you restart git-as-svn via systemd (or whatever init system you use)?

Does that look better? 
Can share the device details? and have you tried on some other device of API 17?
Does this happens with the quarry too? 
Could you please include some logs from the Graylog server when the issue appears? That may help us to better understand the reason for it.

Did you try building another project with bazel (for example the `bazel` repo)?  If you can build the `bazel` repo without a problem, I'd recommend you open an issue against [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues).
Why create a new issue when it is perfectly clear on the existing 1.8.3 PR (#503) that this is an issue that is being worked on? If you are using those builds you should at least be aware of the conversation surrounding them.  
Can you add a screenshot of this, and try without Optifine as well? Also, what version is this? 
Can you reproduce this error without Sponge?
May I ask you to provide more information?  1) The full stack trace: If not shown in the dialog it should be in the Eclipse log file 2) A list of all plugins (Help -> About Eclipse -> Installation Details -> Configuration -> Section "Plug-in Registry")

What's on the episodes->new tab?
Which version of the app and Android do you use? Can you attach a problematic exported note to this issue? 
Can you provide more context?  In regards to the first code block are you duplicating or copying the message buffer?  If there is an underlying reference counted object contained in `msg` (i.e. `ByteBuf`) you will need to `duplicate` or `copy` each time you intend to send the message again. 
what is the negative consequence of this? Otherwise this should be moved to our feature backlog.

Can you explain it better? 
Can you provide simple example?   (please use C# issue tracker https://github.com/consulo/consulo-csharp) 
Would you like to raise this issue over there as well?  Regarding Testcontainers, I think it's an unusual case to have your containers in CI running with a different log driver, but still it would be nice to support it.

When can we get this fixed?
Did you delete the world and let a new one generate? Happens if you dont do that after setting up that way for some reason.
Would you have a code example?  Also a few common problems to diagnose/workaround: - are you values immutable? - is key hashing consistent?  - try to disable cache (`DBMaker.cacheDisable()`) and do not enable async writer.  - possibly transaction problem? commit have to be called to persist updates, or disable transactions.

What is your usecase of BibTeXML?  I feel that the author field of BibTeXML is underspecified. Maybe the ideas of docbook (http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/author.html) or biblatex, which [(as default) distinguishes between](http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/macros/latex/exptl/biblatex/RELEASE) `prefix,family,suffix,given`. - If xml elements such as `given-name` were used, one could improve XSLT scripts to provide different output formats.

Maybe you can tell me how to get the error in the same manner as you do? If the error thrown is the same in my case, then the behavior should be the same for both of us. But maybe the way you are getting the error is important for this particular issue.
Did you update to the latest version 3.0.3 released today? That one should fix the subfolder issue we experienced.

Could you post your code here? 
What kind of popup window it is? Or is it another app? 
Do you use Guava? In general our Java 6 compatibility relies on the presence of Guava, in this case `Lists.newArrayList()` would be used instead of diamond constructor. I just worry that there are couple of other places where this might strike-back, and using Guava all will be easier on Java 6 
Can you confirm that behavior?
should this be a bug still? 
Could you share your code with Lock object usage?
Did you have time to try again?

Could you give a few steps to reproduce the issue?  For instance, where is the root of your project, path of the file that is causing the hang, etc. 
Can you send a screenshot? The code is supposed to move the button when there is already other buttons, but other mods might add the button after BetterFps.  Also, which mod is overlapping the button?
Can you please add the logfile (remove any sensitive file paths first)? 
May I work on this?
Which version of WebLaF did you use to run your application with internal frame?  There were quite a few issues with internal frames including resize issue which have been addressed in `styling` branch not long ago.

Issue #135 is about this same issue but for the default package.
Do you see it failing all the time or occasionally?
Maybe report this to MultiHotbar as well? Try to see if we can get some kind of mod compat going. Adding support for carry on would be way easier on their side than on ours.
Can you paste your sample code in the github issue as well?
how about 7 - 10? 
Can you reproduce this on any emulators, and if so, what are the exact settings?
Could you let me check out the font you created and give me a sequence of keystrokes that reproduces the issue? That will definitely help me track it down.
Should I roll-up the next release ?
Does this occur on more than one device? Because this happens when I build a new version and push it to the emulator. 
What I don't understand is why, if dopplegangers are the problem, I didn't see this same behavior with the Homologene and Panther data?

Can you recreate locally? 
Does that make sense? 
How is that related to Schematica? Appears to be a vanilla (maybe Forge) bug.
Maybe that's the cause? 
What are you seeing?  They still show up for me and work fine.  Sounds suspiciously like the `.newproject` bundles aren't being loaded, which usually indicates a problem with dependencies. Assuming this is in your local IDE, try using the _Validate Plug-ins_ from the launch configuration. 
Can you do that?  If not, we can go with fix (1).

Could you restart the computer that runs your server, and let us know if that fixes the issue?  (In addition, if you aren't using XMPP, delete `EssentialsXXMPP-2.15.0.1.jar`.)
Would you please let me know how frequent this crash is?  
What version do you use? It was already resolved from #462, and released (2.3.0). Please note that latest release is 2.4.2.  Friendly reminder : If you think this issue is not valid anymore, please close it. :)

When you say "it fails because it can't read the following JAR files:" exactly what message did you see? Was there a stack trace on the console?
What do you mean, "the latter two diagrams became unreadable"? Was there an error in the error log? The intention is for the user to be able to name the diagrams whatever they prefer. 
Do you know what the content of this attachment is?  \\\\ edit  Oh, looks like it's the actual message body? Seems the list there relies on the content-type of a message defaulting to text/plain. I *thought* we handled that correctly. Will track, thanks for the bug report so far!
Does this issue only happen with my fork? 2. Does this only occur on 1.13 or is it on all versions?  I'll have to look deeper on what actually causing these violations. Thanks for the report.
Can you upload one of your latest log files to see what version you are actually using? (Also to see if there is an update to optifine that might help with this).  Missing particles is definately not caused by optifine, however it's quite a minor bug so I'm unlikely to fix it anytime soon.
What specific materials are you trying to register?
does it need to be fixed upstream (needs a bug report) or can it be done independently in jdt.ls?
Can you provide a screenshot to illustrate the problem and ensure it is not a bug / issue with optifine/other mods? 
Does the substitution of _query_ with _post_filter_ produces the expected result? (It works for me. Tested through http API of Elasticsearch.) 
Did you try to reproduce only with this device? Did you try with the emulator?  thanks!  Arnaud.

Did you build that with maven? And do the jar releases work for you? 
Do you also use the latest android version?  An upgrade to NC13 should not affect auto upload.
What is the default Sans-Serif font on your distro?  You might try setting a different font.  
Do you use distributed, embedded or single server database? 2.  Did you perform a backup - restore the database ? 3.  Did you perform the shutdown of a database during database load? 3. Do you use Java or third-party drivers?     
Can you please double check? I've also updated [the release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.1-Release-Notes#maven-plugin) to mention the new `repackage` execution id.
Does this also apply for headings (Panel captions, Footer,etc.)? Or does that only affect the "editor" page?

What device? Is this the emulator? You are most likely disposing something that's already disposed. Please try to condense your issue to an ApplicationListener that let's us reproduce the issue. 
Could this be as android is cancelling long running background jobs if the device is idle?
Do you know a way to test for such errors? I would want to prevent such bugs in the future. 
Did the map reset? Can't get, what yo mean.. If it reseted, that means, it did not save.
Could you test Android 7? You could also test version 1.3.0 of this plugin which does not include a certain fix. I have to check this myself but my build environment is currently broken. Please report your findings, I will check this soon.

Can you provide the content of this file? If you delete it, the project properties page should be shown again (of course, all the settings are lost). The plugin should definitively handle this situation more gracefully... 
Can you grep logs where this peer is connecting and check what does it post in STATUS/HELLO message? 
Can you give me exception from log? Or report exception via UI   Thanks
Do you have animations disabled?
What MTS version was this in?
Do you need to just build jars or you want to execute JanusGraph tests? If you need jars use the next command: `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`. It doesn't resolve the issue but may help you build jars if you need them 
What use-case is this that you are having this issue on?  Like what configuration?
Could you debug this? 
Can you try it with this build please: https://jenkins.ironhide.de/job/OpenModularTurrets/229/ ? 
when you're getting 0 quantity +-0, what config are you using?
What is the precise meaning of bar here? Generally a bar is a measure, and barlines separate measures. Could you give an example?  Re-reading your issue, perhaps you are referring to a beam? If so, for a beam, only the side stems are mandatory. The other ones must be connected manually.
What kind of dump are you talking about, daily or current or full? 
What do you mean with the old hash? The original hash that was when the PR was opened? It should point to the latest hash of the target branch of the PR. 
Maybe an issue with multicatch statements? 
Does the old custom one you used with 3.7 cause these glitches as well? Or just the built in one in Glide?   Looks like #2345
Does the context exist?
Do you have any further insight as to what may be causing `target` to contain one or more null elements in the first place?
What do you think @supertick? 
May I ask **how** it is shown or indicated to the users?  **On AIMSICD-Persistancy:** AIMSICD seems to just quit when clearing all opened Apps, even if the persistance-service is enabled. Would be cool if AIMSICD could really hook as deep as possible. 
Could you provide an executable test case please? 
Does -Dquarkus.http.host=127.0.0.1 help at all?
Do you have a crashlog?  
Can you try to run your server without DynmapForge to test if something similar occurs? 
Could you add a full stack trace? An executable demo project (like [these](https://github.com/harawata/mybatis-issues)) is even better. ;) And please use three ticks `` ` `` for code blocks. See the [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for syntax highlighting, etc.. 
Did any message show up when you used plot auto? 
Can you start your app with "--debug=true" (or put it in application.properties), and paste in the autoconfig report? 
What's the sign type? i.e. from which plugin?
Can you give a try using the following option (before creating the reasoner)  ? `OpenlletOptions.RETURN_NON_PRIMITIVE_EQUIVALENT_PROPERTIES = false;`  This may be related to a recent change (or not). In both cases, to debug this I will need an ontology that produce enable the exception.
Can you reach Requestb.in with curl from that server?
Does it crash immediately after opening the app?
What do you mean by that? Does the code not compile? I would also like to know which example code you're referring to :)

Could you provide a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the issue?
Which library version are you using? I can't reproduce the issue on Nexus 5X (@ Android N, material-intro 1.5) 
Can you please post your `debug.log`? [MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge#6148](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/6148) is probably unrelated as it is for 1.13+ and this is on 1.12.2.

Can you take a look at the Graylog server logs and check if there is more information about the error, including a stack trace? 
Maybe an inventory management mod that allows you to dump your inventory that you might have used?  Block Entity NBT: {previousInput:0,x:641,y:67,z:-267,Items:[{Slot:0b,id:"minecraft:yellow_flower",Count:2b,Damage:0s}],id:"bloodmagic:teleposer"}
Could you please open a separate issue for this problem?  Thanks!
Which application did you uninstall and how?

can you provide a reproducer?
What mod and minecraft version are you using?

Do you think while smelting iron and crafting you may have done this?  When the player RNG is cracked, clientcommands is supposed to take into account item throws (for your convenience). I guess if you throw an item out this way it doesn't detect that for some reason.
Can we easily reproduce it with a large JSP? If you can share some code, that would be great. 
Can you please provide the mapping for `news-20180614` and `news_current`? It might be a bug in the mapping analysis or in the error message itself.
do you know of any way to reproduce this?
How long have you waited until to killed the maven call ?  You can try to tune the `<kill>` parameter in the `<run><wait>` configuration, to tell the docker daemon to be more aggresive. See https://dmp.fabric8.io/#start-wait for details (actually `<kill>` is used for stopping containers). 
Do you mean that it is more important to assign jobs rather than breaks? 
Could you share code sample to reproduce this?
Did you try you pausing all GIF's on scroll and resuming them on finish? just a thought 
Do you want to contribute this change? It should be a one-liner (see the property in pom.xml)

Can you tell us the content of your `~/.Phoenicis/javafx.properties` file?
Can you please give a small, reproducible example?
Did you use (one of the) latest FE versions from jenkins? (or at least latest from curse?) It probably crashes because of the fake-player but I think I fixed that - will check again...

May I ask why you removed the "fade" class? Is it unnecessary or wrong?  ``` java String styleClasses = "modal" + " fade"; ``` 
Can you say what device you're using and what operating system version you're running? What other live channel apps do you have? I've run into some live channel issues as well that I've run into occasionally. I think it could be due to the platform itself. 
Why `BlockPortal_01` is a subclass of `BlockPortal` not `Block`? On the mixin wiki it says they should have the same superclass...

Could you give the PR a try? https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/pull/938
Can you send the log and GAP jar files? I happen to be the one who made the CF34 and I want to see why that one in particular seems to be causing more problems. Highly suspect it's a missing file in the pack. 
What version are you using? I have tested with latest build and it works for me. Keep in mind that plots are a 3D shape not only a plane, if you have it as a plane it might be tricky to be inside of it. 
Can you provide some videos? And if you are an OP, then please do /sf debug_fish and show us the output of that.

Did we add the device credentials in 3.2.1 or will they ship with 3.3.?  @yanggis did you report it on the device? (Since then the error will get reported to the developer console :)
Did you mean, if you can guess a sessionid or manipulate your sessionid to be the same as another users sessionid you will hijack the users sessions?
Can you send the full stack trace? 
Could you paste exact commands you used?

Does this page cover that: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/plugins/setup-che-workspace/index.html  Or am I missing something?
When SNR exceeds 30, do you ever see a value that drops below 15?  I really don't want to get into arbitrary scales based on the values devices spit out because it's messy to manage and likely not correct anyway. 
Do you confirm this is still an issue ?
Which actions exactly did you take? This message is pretty new and supposed to be ignored by the app if you yourself did the change. It looks like there is (at least) one schema change where this dialog is not suppressed
Should we rather remove it from the project? Or do you think it is promising and should be improved further? 
How critical is this for you? I will likely create a hot fix for it just wondering how fast it needs to go out.

Can you please explain me better what do you want to get? 
Which version are you running? As it should have been fixed in version 1.1.4d for Minecraft 1.6.4 or 1.1.10 for Minecraft 1.7.2.  I guess you're running the DW20 pack? That has that bug still, as it's running 1.1.4c. 
Do you also have that problem with the language or only the "Arabic prayer times" option?

What version are you using? 
Should I instead update the dialog title when there is an attached image?

Could you export the blueprint and send it to me?  If it puts it in the inventory, it means the blueprint is corrupt and/or otherwise invalid.

Can you replicate this without separate plugins, and only using in-game commands (like `/npc create Test`)?
Can you please give a test case to reproduce the failure ?  About the inheritance issue, you're right. We must change the way we validate type to take into account: 1. type inheritance 2. native type auto boxing 
Does it work with chunk loading from mods other than FTB Utilities? E.g. ChickenChunks, Persistent Bits, Weirding Gadget? I've heard plenty of (admittedly anecdotal) evidence suggesting that chunk loading mods vary in reliability.

What about:  ``` java int navBarIdentifier = res.getIdentifier("navigation_bar_height",                 "dimen", "android"); int navBarHeight = navBarIdentifier > 0? res.getDimensionPixelSize(navBarIdentifier) : 0; ```  Can you test what is the navBarHeight after running that code?

Can I?
How is your application supposed to run without devtools then? If it is being initialized on startup and it breaks that way, it should break if you stop the app and start it again (without Devtools). Can you give us a bit more details?  
What makes you think it's grabbing Javadoc? It's not. That line is initializing a `TypeMirror` for `java.util.Collection`. Unless that XMLBeans plugin messes with that, I fail to see the link. Can I reproduce that myself? 
Do you mean the rolling machine?
May I ask the steps to reproduce in the app?  Also, I ran into a problem with the http://wisdom.gdgroups.org/ URL (see http://imgur.com/CxyGhXX) Is that definitely the URL to use?

Do you perhaps have an `/npc path` mark defined? 
What kind of deployment are you using? We will need more information to reproduce.  When I run Alluxio locally and navigate to+from the master and worker UI, I am having no issues.
Do you happen to have a log or steps to reproduce (maybe with the contents of the Black Market)? That would make it far easier to track down.

Can you maybe somehow send us the APK? 
Could you please provide me some more information? What kind of column is `field` (you can provide me the output of `SHOW CREATE TABLE table` if you want) ? Do you have any data in it? Is the table empty?

Can you provide the full thread dump that involves netty threads or showing Lettuce frames?
Do you have a test case or some code that I can see to reproduce your issue?

Can you paste the discovery document fragment for the method in question?

Can I provide screenshots of the "log" section and the logcat file scrubbed by other app? 
What Cuke4duke and Cucumber versions are you using?  BTW, @Before("@mytag") is the way to use it, @Before("mytag") - without the @ should ideally not be run ever. Once this bug is fixed that is.

Maybe we should add a very small "legend" to the left side of the screen with some short explanations to those? 
Could you provide crash message from logcat ? 
Could you add a screenshot? FloatingActionButton doesn't use borderless ripples and RippleDrawable is more or less a copy/paste from the official sources. 
Do you have GlideModule? Can you please include a Glide load line you're using? (If you can narrow down which one is crashing)
Could you clarify this experience of today? My connectivity is bad right now, but what could be happening is that indexing is failing for some reason. This would mean that the entries are there, but don't appear in the search results (which is at least better than being lost altogether). 
Could it be do determine who the starting player is? The first player in the first duel should be the second player in the second. So on the third it should be the first player again?  edit: Meaning the player who decides whether to play or draw.

What are `k` and `first` in your example?  I think the problem is probably related to my fix to this: https://github.com/RPTools/maptool/issues/612#issuecomment-531581513  There got to be a way to keep the parenthesis intact.
Could you elaborate on them "not working"?
Does it even support this?  Is that why it is stack overflowing because it is trying to generate it?
Can you describe: the environment, integration, etc ?
Does this problem still persist? 
Did you also `flip` something? The crashlog seems to suggest so.  (Note that you can start ID in safe-mode (config file) to recover your world)
Could you please provide a complete code example? Next, does the problem also occur when using a single session?
Can't you just cut back the statements and the data to the bare minimum that is causing the error and anonymize the data to ensure no proprietary info is leaked?  Private support channels are available to Flyway Pro and Enterprise customers if you prefer to go down that option.

What Derby version do you have? And specific options? 
What is the option selected, _Spectra of Non-Validated PSMs_?  Best regards,  Marc

Do we have the issue with the current release?
Does this occur on the pre-existing world? Or does this also occur on the new world? EDIT: Ah, it seems like I made a dumb mistakes related with server.
Do you get a stack trace or do you happen to have a debug log?  If you don't then I will test it myself and try to get stack trace in the IDE.   I wonder, why would # cause a crash, perhaps it's being interpreted as an anchor.  
What server and server version are you running?
Could you report this upstream using [this tool](https://www.mapbox.com/directions-feedback/mapbox/#15/-122.4365/37.7794) so we can get the proper eyes on it and get it fixed?
Did you try using the nightly build?  A java memory setting was increased in 1.6.1, but it turned out to be too much for some computers.  It was lowered recently, but not back to the too-low setting of 1.6.0. 
Do you see the memory leak even after `imaAdsLoader.release()` has been called? (Are you sure `onDestroy` is getting called?)
Can you possibly provide an example message you verified reproduces the null pointer? I would like to test with the upcoming 6.0.0 as well.

Can we maybe hack this by making it use a different, virtual thread id? like threadid:123456789_Sereri or something?  e:/ nvm it's integer. Welp  Also Google released some new SQLite mapping libary called [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html). This might be worth taking a look at maybe.

How often does this happen?  Can you reproduce it?  Can you watch the value of deadline and the returned value from subWithInfinity when the problem happens?
Which block was that? @CovertJaguar Having a hard time understanding what exactly went wrong there. The code that is referenced just copies the colormultiplier from another blockstate. It does not call any function from world nor does it do anything in regards to particles.

Who knows?
Could you explain the problem more deeply?
Can you elaborate on this?
Does it happen always or only if you rotate the device while a notification is visible? I was able to reproduce this on a Note 3, but only when rotating. In my test, both sides were cut off. Is it like that on your device as well (if you compare the edges to the screenshots in the Play store)? 
Did you try to reset your preferences? 
Could you export the blueprint and send it to me?  If it puts it in the inventory, it means the blueprint is corrupt and/or otherwise invalid.

Do Posts, Stairs, and Slabs not have this issue? They do things slightly differently.  The Walls do things the same way as the Cubes (ie Block of Steel). Do they also have the issue?

Do you have the specific error sent by the OnePlus devices?   That may help us dig into this further. Thanks! 
What phones do you use? 32Bit or 64Bit CPU? The current version is the first with a 64Bit compile (AArch64 instead of ARM). Probably related: https://forum.syncthing.net/t/update-to-version-19-looses-connection-and-breaks-sync/9057
Does that mean you're using ViaVersion or ProtocolSupport?
Which version of the SDK is this? 
Maybe a separate link table with sanitized names as primary key and the actual names as foreign key would be a better option?

Did you mark your fragments as Laziable?
Does the password containing "§" work with other IMAP/SMTP clients? Maybe it's a server issue.  If you're sure it's an issue with K-9 Mail please let us know what authentication mechanism you are using. It would also be helpful to know what software the mail servers are running. 
Can you post an example (Es mapping and Hive table)? 
Could be due to card reuse - changing the text in an existing card?

Could you install https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xh.nativelibsmonitor.app and lookup the demo and post the info there?
Do you know how many CPUs are available on the target device?  In the Android library, the ExecutorService uses a fixed thread pool, details [here](https://github.com/web3j/web3j/blob/android/src/main/java/org/web3j/utils/Async.java#L17).  You can also  override the ExecutorService used in a number of the Async calls via [JsonRpc2_0Web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j/blob/android/src/main/java/org/web3j/protocol/core/JsonRpc2_0Web3j.java#L87)

How does it crash - the whole process dies or just current active operation is interrupted?
Can you share a screenshot of your setup? (A video demonstrating the issue would even be better if possible)  I assume you meant an exporter on the bottom of the apiary, the importer obviously won't do anything.

does this always occur, or only after doing a specific thing or asfter a specific amount of time? I am assuming it persists after restarts. Did you by chance use the /reload command?

Do you have a stack trace? Is it one of these cases where it calls a potentially blocking POSIX call that, in practice, will never block with the way the sockets are configured? 
Does this happen only with `std::function` and `FunctionPointer`?
Can you try spelling out the full path to gcc (not using `~`)?  See the error:  ``` external/bazel_tools/tools/cpp/~/jbang/gcc-4.8.5/bin/gcc: No such file or directory ``` 
What is the issue here?
What type of gate did you build and what do you have the transient damage in the config set to?
Can you say C# plugin version? Looks like i already fixed it 
Maybe you tried before the snapshots were uploaded?
What do you think?
Can you check it? 
Do you use any task killer or battery saver apps? Any root scripts to shutdown the device? 
Do you have a pending pull-request for this? Or should I look into it?
Could you try with the latest release? I changed to the newer JEI methods that pass the mouseX, mouseY 
Could you please run the `GlobalKeyboardExample` and type a few characters inlcuding the mentioned ones? Please do paste the standard output here. Also, if possible, please paste your `GlobalKeyListener` snippet here. 
Does this happen when running Spigot or Paper?
Can you change your Manifold version from `RELEASE` to `0.53-alpha` or later?  Thanks.
