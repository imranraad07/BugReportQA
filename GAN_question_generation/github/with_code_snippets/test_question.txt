Does it work if you search for oll instead of roll?

Which version exactly of the plugin? Just curious since I have a beta build out there and I'm not sure if that's what you're using or not. 
Can you try to find the reason? Similar file type? Slow internet? Wlan? Mobile? 
Does it have no available resources or something?  Ah interesting, the scalar value is only optional: https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/include/mesos/mesos.proto#L572.

Can you tell me when you got an issue, during entity class name or entity field renaming? 
what does it mean to insert a null value in list, when having a linked class? i think it is invalid. however, you should be able to use ifnull() function (http://orientdb.com/docs/last/SQL-Functions.html#ifnull) to replace null values with #-1:-1 if you really need to handle this situation

What do you think @misaochan ?
Does the file lib/btrace/btracec have the execute permission?  What if you manually run the command 'btracec Allines.java'?

What's the release train?  Also, the Rate Limit Version `2.3.x` is not compatible with Spring Boot `2.1.x`, if you can't upgrade it to `2.2.x` it's better if you rollback it to the version `2.2.x`.
Could you try ?

How about the other NC ores?
Does it also happen if you type a bit slower?
Which version? I've been using the delete data + meta data feature a lot over the last week on the master branch without problems, so it might be nice to add a link  to the dataset causing this issue. 
Does it really matter? The increase is pretty much uniform across all countries, so we could just count it as global inflation. Market prices/cost of reduction etc. are increasing as well, so with some proper balancing it should all mostly cancel out. 
Could you explain the steps you took?  Thanks. 
Do you use the Eclipse plugin or the maven plugin?  Thanks for your help 
What is your GOPATH set to?  
How about merging engine-tests back into engine? I remember that one of the reasons for the separation was that eclipse didn't deal with it properly, but I think this issue is fixed now.  I think that the junit failures in NameGenerator and Pathfinding are different and probably caused by #1169 . 
Does the correct value show when you run `/lp user <user> info`, under 'current prefix'?  Temporary permissions are handled in exactly the same way as permanent prefixes in the meta system, so this is most likely an issue with Essentials or the way you have LP setup.
Do you have any addons installed? If so, what versions?
What version of the are you using?  
What happens if it unique for a few but not others?  If you want it to be unique for the full array consider indexing the array as a string.

Can you find it? 
Did you set `oracle.sqlplus` to `true` as stated in the [docs](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/database/oracle#sqlplus-commands)?
Do you have a source file you can share that reproduces this issue? I expect that just adding those two imports by themselves to a file will not trigger the problem.
Does the (real) test actually need to execute the real code of some methods, while others are mocked? 2) null is the default result for any method returning a reference type, so recording "result = null" for them is redundant. Or is there something I missed? 
Could you maybe dig into the issue on your device? 
How do you trigger save-actions? - Frame deactivation (window loses focus) - Shortcut - ...

Would you mind installing and testing it from the build available from GitHub (see "Download" on the todo.txt-touch page)? It would be easier to explicitly state compatibility based on input from testers with small screen devices. (I have had a quick test on an X10 Mini, but nothing thorough.) 
Did you name this provider `TemporaryConfigSourceProvider`? Because the exception seems to be about a class that already exists in Quarkus: [TemporaryConfigSourceProvider.java](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/core/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/runtime/configuration/TemporaryConfigSourceProvider.java)

Maybe someone else has more success with this?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6131769/is-there-a-way-to-have-an-android-process-produce-a-heap-dump-on-an-outofmemorye http://bigflake.com/HeapDump.java.txt

Could you first provide me with some information on what version of NPCLib you're using? And how you are shading the JAR?
Could you describe the problem a bit more? I think I did this in the web client. I think the trick was create an object in the json array in GHRequest. I think it should look something like this pt : { parameter : abc}. Or maybe we are talking about something different?

What JDK are you using? And can you please post full stacktrace.  Btw, package ru.ydn.wicket.wicketorientdb.orientdb contains testcases for OrientDB themself. So if something failed - it failed in OrientDB. But before posting issue to OrientDB - let's try to figure out what's going on... 
What database?

Did you enable `customFormatting` as told in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration/blob/1.10.2/CHANGELOG.md#210)?   The reason is that the way I made the creation of the chat message breaks the link handlers and `customFormatting` is handling them differently and doesn't break it.

Can you check without any other mods installed?
How did you install it? Just retested with Marketplace and Eclipse 4.7 drag-n-drop method - works perfect. Note: you need to have the most recent version of DBeaver plugin to install Office extension.

Should we, either forcing or not, in the case of a non existing Parent AIP (either because it was blank or it doesn't exist) use the one provided in the Job creation form?  If the answer is yes, set me as the assignee. Otherwise, this is not a bug but instead the expected behaviour.

Do you use a third-party reporter, parse a some servlet output or read out a `MetricsRegistry` manually? I think the best way is write some decorator where you can perform a conversion to the CloudWatch format. For instance, `GraphiteReporter` converts measurements to 2 digits after the point.  See [here](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/blob/3.2-development/metrics-graphite/src/main/java/com/codahale/metrics/graphite/GraphiteReporter.java#L349).

Do we happen to know if the example in the docs still works? I.e., do we know this is specific to StaticMapExclusionFilterFactory? 
DO you have the issue with your dark theme branch or with the develop one ? 
Should we have a reattach operation of sort?  Also, you should have a `@Transactional` here https://github.com/manoelcampos/hibernate-concurrency/blob/master/2-database-concurrency-panache/src/main/java/com/manoelcampos/server/rest/ClienteResource.java#L37 to ensure that a flush and an actual update of the database happen. But that change won't fix your optimistic locking.

Maybe /authme email show <playername>? Idk if we implemented such command.
Does this still happen if you build the same setup rotated 90 degrees? What if you move the engine elsewhere adjacent to it?  I'm guessing this could be caused by saving a pipe that has received fluid but hasn't saved the change.

Did you use the backup.sh? Do you have installed linux containers? In this way you'd have no lock on

Can you test on build 106? I don't personally have a mac but I can't find the source of the bug so I doubt it has been fixed.

Another easy workaround is to skip tests by adding `-DskipTests` to the build command in [this line](https://github.com/dice-group/Palmetto/blob/master/webApp/Dockerfile#L15)  (the web app project does not have any test cases so it will not influence the quality of the build)

Can you test this fix and possibly submit a PR?
Could you share your PeptideShaker log file with us? This should tell us more about why the error occurs. You'll find the file via the PeptideShaker Welcome dialog > Settings & Help > Help > Bug Report.  Best regards, Harald
How much RAM have you allocated for a workspace?
which version of hawtio/fabric? This is remote connection right? Been doing lots of remote connection testing lately (to get around the OpenShift connect-to-new-container issues) and its all been OK so far.   Does this only show in Firefox I wonder? 
Could you please run the following URL in your browser:  <jenkins_server_url>/api/json?tree=nodeName,nodeDescription,primaryView%5Bname,url%5D,views%5Bname,url,views%5Bname,url%5D%5D  And tell me what you get?  Regards,  David 
Could you share what you have in `elasticsearch.yml` (please replace any secret by `XXXXX`)? Also is that a fresh new installation? How did you create the repository?
Can you make more clear steps to reproduce? Specifically, does this work without the acceleration wand? As you said, there are stack size checks so output greater than 16 should not be a problem.
Would that be ok?
Did you end up running into that as well?
Do they appear in the the upload queue at all?
Does this not occur in 2.0.3? 
Could you try to test with an older version of here? http://builds.jabref.org/fixfetcherisbn/ I am unsure whether it is caused by a certficiation issue (the code signing expired) or if its caused by a commit 
Do you see any exceptions in the logs? 
Could you include the stack trace for the exception? Otherwise it is difficult to see where the problem occurs. 
Do you want to work this or shall we leave it to someone else to fix? 
When you remove ProtocolSupport, the players are visible again both in the menu and in the monitoring, will you fix it, or is there a configuration?
Do you get any error message?
Can you provide your seed and your settings? (Changelog works too).
Can you please provide more details?
When the progress bar is going to be done? 
Can you share the feed link please ? 
Do you have some example that I can test it on?
does not reproduce with any of the Widevine protected content provided by default in the demo app)? Please try in particular all streams under "Widevine DASH Policy Tests" to see if any/all of those reproduce the problem. Thanks.
What does `Role` look like? is it an enum? 
Which plugin and version is this?
Can you attach your client log?  Also, is this modpack available online somewhere?
What do you mean by 'option'? 
Which version of the app are you using?
can you check if this has been fixed in the 0.7.1 release?
Does this work? 
Can you please provide a little more context for the problem? I assume you're referring to the use of `exclude` when configuring dependency management. Something like this, for example:  ```groovy dependencyManagement {     dependencies {         dependency('org.springframework:spring-core:4.0.3.RELEASE') {             exclude 'commons-logging'         }     } } ```
How many other players were in this game? It seems odd to me that just the original spell would fizzle if all the other copies succeeded. 
Could you please put some pictures of this disorder instead?
Can you share a screenshot?
Did he get the following message?  "You are not allowed to teleport to the location of DragonKnights's spawn"  Did he have ENTER permission for DragonKnights's town? 
Can you please test it with development to be sure that you're able to replicate it there? 
How could an itinerary have no legs? 
Did you change the font size in Appearance?
May I work on this?
Why should b cast to long? Since it is signed, it still shouldn't work.  Using the following program, `EX` is 0x8000 with `((long) (b << 16) / a)` **and** with `((b << 16) / a)`. However, if I cast `b` to a char (which is unsigned), `EX` is now 0x0000.  ``` dasm set A, 15 div A, 2 ``` 
Does it happen with all machines or just one type specifically?   I'm fairly sure Mek's pipes won't even let an item in if it has no destination, so it sounds as though a machine is letting something succeed on simulate but fail when done for real.
Could you provide a simple project that reproduces the problem? (because I can't with mine.)
Can you delete `/home/jenkins/tools/org.jenkinsci.plugins.DependencyCheck.tools.DependencyCheckInstallation/dep-check-5.1.1/data/jsrepository.json` and try re-running dependency-check? It appears that the file is corrupted on your system.
Could you please check your graylog2-server logs for the corresponding error message? 
Does inserting (drag&drop) rests work in other scores?
Would you like to merge to main branch? If the device type is unknown then we could add unknown device type to the list instead of null.  Br, Tommi 
Can you share code or tell me exactly how the image is created that you're trying to save so I can reproduce and debug? 
What did you do when the error happened? 
Do you recall why @ola-rozenfeld? 
Which part doesn't look right to you? 
What are you guys talking about? 
when was this error thrown? program start, first use of shortcut, every shortcut?  did you get the other error directly after this one? 
What steps are needed to reproduce this issue? 
Can you try this again with the master branch please?
Does that mean the plugin can trigger TC when you fill in the proxy information in the plugin?  If you logon the the server running Bitbucket Server (perhaps SSH) and issue a `curl` command from there. Does that work?
How recently was this? Are you still seeing the error? On Tuesday we realized we'd accidentally re-activated the geoip code, and promptly removed it. Entirely my fault, but fortunately a problem on the server side that could be quickly fixed. Everything should have been working since Tuesday.
Could you post your full log? I would like to know exactly when this exception was thrown. 
Can you show me showImagePicker result ?  That can appears if you take a picture while the dev menu is still opened.  in **RN 0.18.0** you don't need to override ReactActivity.onCreate. That's maybe an issue with your implementation 
How can we reproduce this issue?
What item did you have in the user, and what entities were nearby? im trying to replicate this and not seeing any crashes.  Regardless, i can put in some safety checks/catches to hopefully avoid this.  Possibly related to old https://github.com/PrinceOfAmber/Cyclic/issues/271
Why did you do that?
What is "the version of Java Backend before yesterday"? Please be specific. 
Could you please provide a dump of your user collection in mongodb after you logged in with a user? This should not break, Graylog never automatically deletes any user accounts. 
Would you be so kind as to share with us the contents of the `dashboards` collection in the Graylog setup where you found the problem? Without more details is hard to tell what went wrong.  Thank you!
Can you describe the column of blocks under you when you spawn in? If they are possibly damaging or air blocks, EssentialsX will try to make you fly. 
Can you measure the exact time this happens? Recording the sound from another phone might do. 
Can you submit a PR for this?  Thanks
What happens if you modify JSP file or cleanup the work directory (directory with translated JSPs)?  
Can you show this configuration?
Could you try remove the `google-cloud` dependency and run this again?  /cc @bogdandrutu 
May I suggest backing up Lawnchair settings and reinstall it?
How to reproduce this?
How do you want me to proceed? Do you want one big Pull Request? Multiple small ones? As you can see, I've already changed 56 files.  I've also added locally a small project with some samples, build from resources found on internet, to test my modifications. Do you want me to push this too?
Maybe due to "aggregate-chunkticks" on MCPC+ ?  Seeing the same sort of thing, tuned that setting back to 1 (vanilla) to see if that fixes anything. 
Maybe @odsod could clarify what happened?
what BC/MC version are you using, can you provide screenshots or a video/gif of what heapens?
Could you explain this more clearly? I'm not understanding the issue so I can't repeat it. 
When you say that it doesn't work, could you explain the result you wanted and what you got instead? Also, could you [try the code with the latest master](https://jitpack.io/#TheElectronWill/Night-Config/master-SNAPSHOT) commit? Some bugs have been fixed since 3.2.0. [This one](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/Night-Config/issues/42), in particular, might be related to your problem.
Can we close this? 
Can you be more specific?  That is not the source code for a valid `.java` file.
Can you try version 3.4.1 and let me know if that fixes the issue for you?
Do you have a pull request with a test for this? many thanks 
Would it be easy to get a simple repro to guard against regression? If not, I can try to cook one up.  Either way I can then fix this for 2.8(.5) 
What do you exactly tap? The application name? or its icon? 
Can you `describe extended` the view table?
When does the error occur exactly? 
How they can do ? Tems pocket may be an inspiring product for this project. 
Can you test? 
Do you think it's possible an exception was thrown and caught in a way that `onComplete()` was called without calling `onNext()` on the server?
Did you try the most recent development build? Is is reproducible there?  Could you provide an example bib file, along with your preferences? 
What modpack was this? 
Do you mean the new owncloud-1.9 version? Or the beta version? 
Can you try @redmitry's suggestion of doing `final JsonValue arr = parser.getArray();` instead of `final JsonValue arr = parser.getValue();` in your custom deserializer and see if that works?  Also, did this ever work as intended prior to Yasson 1.0.4?
Can you please add a `.get()` after the reply() method and check which exception it throws? Something like this: ```java try {   msg.reply("Test").get(); } catch (Exception e) {   e.printStackTrace(); } ```
Does the car get hot and smoke too?
Could you try with this custom version? 
What database? 
Did the pre-release version help? 
Could you try creating directory `/opt/orientdb/backup/databases/` before starting? 
What mod version? 
Does it still happen after server restart ?
Can you say about your security settings, account _SYSTEM works with SYS password ? Maybe something wrong with it, and I loose auth information somewhere. 
How does the `default_response` element look like?   I want to create proper tests for the merge keys, this would be valuable test data.
Can you give me a more detailed reproduction scenario so when I have time to look at this I can go right to the problem? 
What is the column type? 
Which app version is the stacktrace from? (The line numbers don't seem to match exactly with current master version.)   
What version of the plugin are you using? You can find out the plugin version by going to the header menu (File, Edit, etc), Arma Plugin->About. Thanks for the error report. 
What kind of conflicts? Please, provide error stack trace 
Does this happen always or only in some results presentations/modes? Could you post a screenshot?
Do you agree?  Kind regards Mahmoud 
Could you report it to the TC issue tracker as well?
Would you mind to submit such a demo, too? That'd help us a lot (and provide an implicit test for each version of BootsFaces to come).  BTW, we've already merged the PR. Thanks!  Best regards, Stephan
Can you sow us the code of the inboundPacketHandler ? 
Can you reproduce it without LP installed?
Do you get the same error in the same entry everytime, and does it happen if you change thread count to 1?
Could you please send a PR for your solution?  BTW, I suggest a minor modification: could you please move that line to `line 164` instead of `line 166`, so we can keep the fields initializers in the same order with their declaration.
How did you get this sideways thing? With what kind of trees and is it a vanilla tree you can create by growing?  I need to recreate this, and know how to do so :D
Does this happen even with uncompressed tif files or only with JPEG compressed tif files? 
Can you try with latest build please?

Why would it be an issue for us?
Did you specify the config key for the bolt? ```       - name: "withConfigKey"         args:           - "warc" ```
Did 4.2.0.24 work for you?
What do you mean you didnt find it in the source?
Can you try with VS Code?
Should anyone know what is the problem? thank you very much. >  > — > Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/OpenTripPlanner-for-Android/issues/22 > . 
Can you please post the output of the skin debug (set debug to true in the settings)? 
Can you give some more description of what is going on? I will try to replicate the error... What kind of "weird" playback do you mean? 
Can someone over here reproduce? 
Did you check if two Travis builds were triggered? This could also happen if you have two different modules that run Gnag. Maybe we should think about how to handle that case, unsure. 
What do you mean exactly? What happens if you try to create an operator from itemlistcount?
What is the content of "shared/importer-config.xml"?  The file name suggests an `<importer>` section. If so, that means you probably have 2 `<importer>` section so the second one is ignored (the one with DebugTagger in it).  Please confirm. 
Can you provide me the exact steps that will lead to the FC? And can you explain me, what you mean with "It also FC when using the widget linked to file" ? Thanks a lot! 
Can you try using 2 cores for your emulator and see if the crash persists?   Thanks! 
Does this even occur if you connect to your spigot server directly? 
Can I get the platform information for the host experiencing issues?  Sounds like it is probably a bug in one of the native handlers.
Do you have any other mods installed, particularly ones which change rendering? If this is a published modpack could you post a link to it.
When this happens, does this consume the normal amount of LP, or double?
Why do you want to drop table?  Shouldn't you simply delete the records? 
Could you also show the `return *` without aggregation? 
Should this run off the diesel cell? Or do we need to add a diesel liquid for this, im not sure how its supposed to work. 
Did you try executing the flter by itself, without going through the alias? 
Do you have any error in the console log?
What do you think?  P.S. ScheduledActions always have an end date 
How they can do ? Tems pocket may be an inspiring product for this project. 
Did you set the locale of your runtime or the locale of the Paper UI (in Preferences menu)?
What text editor are you using in the terminal?
Did you update to the latest firmware? (You probably shouldn't do that...) I've heard of a TON of people who have this working on a6300 (on just my Youtube channel alone). So it must be something with your specific camera... 
What CBL version are you using? 
Can you please perform threads stack dump when this happens and post the result? 
what if you speed it up, using the settings...same difference? 
Can you provide us with a stacktrace, please?
What is your project configuration?  (We look for haxelibs differently depending upon your compile settings.)   We've actually got code in there to find your haxelibs and put  them in the project for you.  It has a few issues, mostly with being overly aggressive.
What version of the plugin are you using?  
Can you please provide a sample project or test that illustrates the problem you're seeing? 
Do you mind to test the latest SNAPSHOT ?  Issue is closed, reopen if problem persists please. 
Does the extension get deleted?
can't reproduce - maybe it's been fixed since 1.0.0? 
What do you mean by "getSSIV().resetScaleAndCenter() not called"? `oldh != 0 && oldw != 0` always be `false`?
Do you have a workaround deal with the Google Keyboard?  BTW, you can tap to blank area of the tag group to "submit" a new tag, and you can double-click the "Normal" state tag to delete it. 
Does the same thing happen in the vanilla spectator mode?
Do you know why it is not unique in your instance?
Can we look at other apps how they do it? 
Does anyone know any other LOS-enabled boards besides BFPO which have slopes on them?  
Could you obtain a log of that?
Can you also provide the full stack trace? Thanks! 
Do you have an example? 
Can you try `test/test_pwd@server1.com:1521/service1` (without the starting // in server addressing) meanwhile?  
Maybe we can have all the variations? :)
What is the code and what is the symptom? 
What permission plugin are you using ?
Do you actually want to scroll with the popup open?
what's the progress on this? The deadline for releasing this version is today.

Does it work, if you try it through the REST API? 
What am I looking at here? 
Which version of Graylog2 are you running? Are you using the off-heap message cache? 
Can you look for errors in browser dev console? Also, it'd be interesting to look at keycloak container logs:  ``` docker ps docker logs -f $keycloak_id ```
Could you make a separate issue for the second problem? 
What version of RStudio are you trying to install and what is the error you are seeing? Does this happen on the latest [RStudio preview](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)?
How did you configure che.properties? 
What version of the SDK are you using? 
What should be cgeo behaviour in this case? 
Maybe @AndyScherzinger (our design dev :) ) has an idea? 
Can you provide the syntax that you used to set the CHE_VERSION, and any other environment variables before calling the Docker container?  My first guess is that perhaps some folder on your host system that should be RW is not currently RW. I do not believe we have done much testing on coreos. 
What permissions plugin? Do you have Vault installed? 
What is the resolution of that phone? is it mdpi?. 
Could you please tell us how you tried to create it? A page screenshot when you would be ready to click "Save" it's probably the best way for me to see how you did it.  Thank you! 
Can you please post a screenshot of the dial action? 
Do you have any custom components that you're injecting into `ExoPlayer`, or are you using only components provided by the library?
Did you revert that entire commit, or just inDither? ANTI_ALIAS should also be totally unnecessary, I can't imagine that would have an affect... 
Do you use the scada version on the [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/scadalts/scadalts)?
What about [creating a gist](https://gist.github.com/)? You can [push and pull gists](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5299526/github-commiting-push-gist), so it seems like it should work.... 
Can you please post some code snippets of your plugin, where you call the SilkSpawners API? I'm missing a reproducible example.  Duplicate of #87 
Can you elaborate what happens exactly? Liteloader is not detected on a server that happens to handle your registration and uses AACAdditionPro?
Can you give more exact steps on how to replicate this? How exactly is the player's file corrupted, and what actions did you take in what order in order to have this occur. Please try to test it again and provide screenshots.
Did you use the lastest snapshot in the GitHub releases?
Can you try again, and let me know if this is still an issue?
How do you reproduce it?
What version? 
Could you post the actual logcat? The syncthing output should be in there.   Finding the right line really isn't the problem :P  
Do you know what version of our plugin you are using? If it is older than 2.6.2, you'll need to update. If not, I'll need some more information to be able to reproduce this problem.
What point to blacklist google and then open it?
Can you try to execute this commands and paste the output here?  ``` adb tcpip 5555 adb connect 192.168.2.131 ```  Replace 192.168.2.131 with the IP assigned to your device.  Thanks! 
Did you open the live map also before step 1, is c:geo running and GPS active between step 1 and 2, is the "follow" option on the map shown as active once you open it, Does only the map remain on the old position or your position marker as well? 
How can a fragment's activity be null? o_O 
could your bag be full? 
How did you start Che? I mean your start syntax.
Did you configure Workbench to work with TeamViewer? 
Can you give me some examples regarding JSON?
Could you test if this fixes the icon size for you?  I only changed the icon that is used for the debug version (it is black then): https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks/tree/icon
Do you know if this occurs for all view previews? 
What Android device and OS version are you using? 
Can you upload the `.mixin.output` and `CLASSLOADER_TEMP` folders zipped up when you run the server with `-Dmixin.debug.export=true -Dlegacy.debugClassLoading=true -Dlegacy.debugClaassLoadingSave=true`? I have a feeling that somehow the injection points that I've written are no longer applying at the right places in some circumstances since moving away from an `@Overwrite`.
Could you be more specific about the issue? 
Could you try rebuilding the semantic index please? This can be done using the `rebuildBranchTransitiveClosure` function under the Concepts area of Swagger. (This will move to the new Admin area of Swagger in v3.x)  
Can you come to #vazkii on irc.esper.net? Someone else is having that same issue, I could use some more info on it. 
Could you please write down all your configuration steps which lead to a guaranteed reproduction of this issue and post here? 
What version of the mod are you using?
Could you try with read type `NO_CACHE` and see if you get the same behavior?
Could you please to try again? CHeers 
Do you have any more logs around when it happened or what action was performed that caused this? 
What version of Quelea are you using? Could you attach the .zip to this issue? (so that developers can sort things out)
Where can I get a copy of this Vanilla Nightly?
Does it work now? 
Does the architect table have any box configured in the first case? What is inside the box? What is inside any chests in the box?  The chests aren't placed as it fails to map items with that build. 
Can you send your config? Make sure to hide your token.
Can you use your IDE to see which jar is providing it?  <img width="671" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/231923/64460535-81cefd80-d0f2-11e9-960f-a0be281a9e14.png">  See above it is not in the core okhttp jar.
Can you upload one of your latest log files to see what version you are actually using? (Also to see if there is an update to optifine that might help with this).  Missing particles is definately not caused by optifine, however it's quite a minor bug so I'm unlikely to fix it anytime soon.
Do you have a stack trace? 
How are you running your application and what servlet container are you using? Perhaps you can provide a small project that reproduces the problem? 
When did you have this bug? Or how can I reproduce it
What? It is very simple: we need to check how to extract the git config **using jgit** during widget operation runtime.
Do you have a Docker registry running in a Docker VM?  Also, do you restart a workspace from the User Dashboard or the IDE? 
What version are you running? 
Do you have tried to change the parameters below ? Does the pagination works on some page and stop working after ?
Did this work in the past? I don't think that the REST interface is working on port 80 (certainly it doesn't on my system as I have a webserver running). All OH web interfaces should use 8080 (or whatever is defined in the startup batch file).    
When non-null was it still "unknown"?  If I recall correctly there was some post-processing of the individual fields to create a display string.   I did intentionally leave some `null` results in the new format, although my reasoning was more laziness than whether I wanted to have the null have meaning.
Should we simply fix it in the binding anyhow?
Can you hook up a test case for it?
Could you try to reproduce the issue with this version? https://ci.chaosfield.at/job/ActuallyAdditions/job/ActuallyAdditions-unstable/139/artifact/build/libs/ActuallyAdditions-1.10.2-r64-139.jar 
Why would we be trying to close a cursor from multiple places concurrently?
What version of Blender are you using? Have you tried a more up-to-date version if you're running 2.70? Also, can you type java into your command line to use it, or does it return an error? 
How can this be solved? Showing images separately from text might not be a good idea as it would lose context. As can be demonstrated by the post in question itself.
Shouldn't all options be sorted in alphabetical order ? It makes it easier to search a specific one, specially when there is dozens options.
did you check `sslHandler.handshakeFuture()` ?
Can you find the change in the commit history? Who did it? :) 
Does this happen for specific images? Do you have a sample image where this can be reproduced with in one of our sample apps (e.g. the URI app)? For what image format is this happening?
Can you check the stored value that comes back when the integrations is loaded?  I think it sometimes comes back as an encoded value.
How many drones do you have? Keep in mind that a Charging Station only allows one Drone to be charging on it at a time. So if all Charging Stations are occupied, the drone will not charge, ultimately will fall down. Might that be it? 
Do you mind sharing your downloader code if you are using a custom downloader?
Which device is this? Are you running a custom ROM or stock?
Can you please add the complete stack trace from the server's startup?
Should we just write the serialization methods on it instead and do the serialization manually?  This way we don't have to make it mutable to set the id and type later.  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serial-arch.html#4539 
can u pls share the dependency version ur using ?
Where are we at with this? 
Can you say  C# plugin version?  ![](http://klikr.org/5a49acf26583d44e3983581812c7.png)  I think you need only call About -> Check for updates 
where?
What device are you on? 
Could you try it in your database? If it won't return any procedures - please try to execute just `sp_stored_procedures` (returns all procedures in database) 
Maybe you don't have permissions to see package bodies? 
Did you ever toggle root for syncthing? 
Could you provide a (preferably as small as possible) sketch that reproduces the problem, and/or specific links to the libraries needed?  I suspect this is caused by LTO somehow messing up, or perhaps some problem in the sketch that wasn't exposed with an earlier compiler and/or without LTO. 
How does it work with the immediate processing mode?
What database? 
Do you have any additional information like your OS, suspicious error log entries and the like? 
Could you let me know if you are using the most recent version of Minecraft Forge and what versions of the Flan's Mod content packs you are using? 
Can you try to update the SDK to  **9.0.3 ** and tell us if this solved your issue?
Could you share your search definition (at least the my_predicate field), I assume it's of type predicate?
Could you perhaps rerun this test and add `System.gc();` just before reading the free memory?!? I wonder whether the memory consumption really increases or not. Note sure what we can do about this. The code is straight forward:  https://github.com/togglz/togglz/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/togglz/core/activation/ScriptEngineActivationStrategy.java#L49-67 
What if you provide the complete path, not a relative path?
Can you provide a sequence of operations that causes this bug? 
Could you perhaps create a breaking test? 
What code are you using? What are the sound files encoded with? 
Can't you just copy the ORID?
How does that sound? 
can i make a PR? 
Do you have a log of the crash so i can look into it? Either what shows up in your MC launcher, or in logs/latest.log
What kind of laptop do you have? (so that we could try and reproduce the issue in-house) 2. Does switching to software rendering make a difference? https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017886674-Troubleshooting-RStudio-Rendering-Errors
Could you post the crash report please?
What would be the bug?
Do you have EnderIO and/or RefinedStorage stuff in the same chunk (check with F3+G) as the storage crates in question? If so, try placing one in a chunk without either mod's blocks being present and look if it's still happening :) 
Does it work now? IE after the update? I can't reproduce it.
Do you know what has happened prior to this crash?  Did you connect with `shouldAutoConnect()` returning true?
Where/what is a ReflectProxy?  I see:      import org.powerbot.bot.ReflectProxy;  In BasicObject.java but I can't actually find that class in powerbot/src/main/java/org/powerbot/bot/  
Can you provide more information about the data, code snippets of calling smile, stack trace, etc? Thanks.
Would it be possible retrieve the supersized ini file, zip it up and send it to me? I am really curious to analyze it and figure out how to prevent this from happening to other folks. If it zips small enough, you can send it to draquemail@gmail.com, and if not, maybe sharing via google or something?
What's the best way on Windows to check for the maximum path length? Is there anything more reasonable than creating a temporary file with a long path and seeing if it succeeds?

Can you describe that here so that I can fix this bug?
Can you paste your larger data set so we can use it for testing?  Thanks.
Could you please elaborate on the scenario? Are you reading Cloud Debugger generated logpoints using AppEngine logging API?  Cloud Debugger uses `logp()` function internally, so the output is not as flexible as we would like it to be. The relevant source code is here: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-debug-java/blob/master/src/agent/jvm_dynamic_logger.cc#L89. 
Do you have a crash log? So I just have to make a buddy attack one of my spiders?
What do you mean under "fix mistake in post"?
How did you set up the database? If there is only a `citydb` but no `citydb_pkg` schema, you did something wrong. Have you followed these [steps](https://3dcitydb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/db-setup-postgis.html)? Which Postgres/PostGIS version are you using?
Could you test again with lettuce `4.2.1-SNAPSHOT`?  The underlying reason is that commands get dispatched sometimes in the wrong order or may get lost while a connection is getting disconnected. `4.2.1-SNAPSHOT` contains a fix for the issue. 
Do you know the reason for this already? 
Could you provide a link to it? 
Do you get an alert saying 'Incompatible ...' when you start XPrivacy? 
Do you have the execution, or the pipeline?  I update TextHolder to cause OutOfMemoryError and pipeline failed properly with in the TextHolder with:  Cause:  Component execution failed. Root cause:  OutOfMemoryError : Java heap space  However I can imagine this can be different if the exception happen outside the component.  
Do I get it right that the total field limit setting doesn't get applied, but that other settings DO get applied? I'm also wondering whether you have several templates that match your index names, or only the `logstash` one?
However, we shouldn't be failing, so what are our options? Do we provide an option to validate or disable that check? 
Did you really test this with version 1.0.8 ? I can't reproduce this there. 
How did you discover the restrictions were gone? Did you reboot? 
Can you pull the latest release an try this case? 
Does this compile without errors?  ``` ceylon Boolean b; for (block in findChildrenOfType(foo, bar)) {     b = true;     break; } print(b); // should be error: not definitely specified ``` 
Where are you calling `InitializeApp()` and is it possible you're trying to use `FirebaseAnalytics` before that happens?
Could you provide a minimal example for us to reproduce this issue? Also the datatable is an experimental component and should have gone through some changes in the [current 0.8.2 Snapshot](https://github.com/TheCoder4eu/BootsFaces-OSP/issues/151), did you try that one yet? 
Did you change the handler? Anyway, please try https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/pcap4j/pcap4j-distribution/1.4.1-SNAPSHOT/pcap4j-distribution-1.4.1-20150422.050608-3-bin.zip. This is with a fix to catch exceptions thrown by callback before the handler and write error logs. I expect you will see error logs describing exceptions instead of "JNA: error handling callback exception, continuing". 
Can you replicate this without separate plugins, and only using in-game commands (like `/npc create Test`)?
What are the exact preferences you have checked? How about the name of the scraper used? 
Why would you set enable-op to false if you want the op-system to be enabled? 
Which version of mockito do you use? 
Would you mind trying that with Spring Boot 1.1.6.RELEASE, please? 
Maybe a bug, can you attach you `yarn-site.xml` for further analyze?  And meanwhile, you can define `hibench.masters.hostnames   hostname1 hostname2 hostname3 ...` and `hibench.slaves.hostnames   hostname1 hostname2 hostname3 ...` to bypass the probe of  master & workers list. 
Could you perhaps update your java and try again? Maybe even try running the command in a docker container or cloud environment?

Shall we document a function name and parameters here in case someone wants to claim it?
Did you clear it multiple times? I had this issue too, but on time wipe doesn't help for me. Also, only clear dalvik, not normal cache.. Though it wonders me that you have the issue on 5.0.X... 
Could I ask what other plugins you have installed?
Could you try `mvn clean install -U`? 
Does it still happen after 50658faa8f4bf19a? What is loadChunkOnProvideRequest set to? 
Does it still work if you omit the `setString`?
Might be only occurring when using Docker...?

Do you received some feedback? An error message / notification, or just nothing?  Thanks in advance- 
Do we have some specific IPs in the repository? 
Can you please provide the code to reproduce the problem?

What version of Android were you running? 
What do you mean by "execution" ?
what is slang.test-cp? 
Could you provide more details about what steps you are taking, what errors you are getting, etc? Thanks 
Do you use annotation processing inside Eclipse or just use sources generated by Gradle? Can you, please, send you Gradle configuration to try to reproduce with both Gradle and Eclipse 
Should we also resize text in labels? 
Does the current release (v1.17) work properly in your real device then? I can't reproduce the bug on emulator, but I don't have a real device with api 23 to test with.  
Could you perhaps export your perms, delete the h2 and reimport please? 
Can you grab a stack trace or use a profiler to help determine where the time is being spent? If it's several minutes, even jstack should catch it. 
Can you reproduce this issue on multiple different version of D4J?
Can you execute `/qs paste` again after you execute `/qs reload`, so i can see details of loading shops? Also please upload your `shops.db` file.
Can you try this? https://jenkins.ironhide.de/job/OMLib%201.11.2/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/libs/omlib-1.11.2-3.0.0-87.jar
Can you tell me how you test float / double overflow? 
What version of MyWarp are you using? The permissions above should be correct, but only for MyWarp3. 
Does that also need to be fixed? Also, shouldn't price decrease for cum-stained clothing?
What I'm wondering, does posting a note fail too @cweiske ? Or does commentpara.de not support that on its micropub endpoint ?
Would you be able to test the latest build form here: http://ci.tterrag.com/job/EnderIO/ and confirm the issue is resolved? 
Could you check with the develop build?

What is your OS/window manager?
what specifically were you putting down to attempt this? (please use the `code ` ` ` tag`) 
What would it mean to "step into" a subgraph while it is being executed? At that point, aren't we already "inside" the subgraph?
why are we not consuming the token there? 
Can you provide some code so I can reproduce this bug?   An image would be also great!
Why do we get all the internal objects as well? Probably because some other service needs them (otherwise it wouldn't be implemented?)? 
What do you mean by "invited"? 
When is the message shown? I expect when you click notification to see detail. Seems I have to login with higher permissions.  github.com notification API do not provide detail view URL unfortunately, so I have to do subsequent call for details and it requires higher permissions for private repository probably.
