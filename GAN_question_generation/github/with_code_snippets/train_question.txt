Can you please add some more details to the issue - `raml` part and Maven configuration so I can easily reproduce it?  Thanks.
Can you help me on that? 
Do older versions of Forge for 1.10.2 still work? If so, then there really must have been some internal changes. 
Can you post an example directory structure where it does make problem? I do not fully get the problem and what you expect.
Could you try seeing the javascript console to see why its not loading the UI?
Could you try reproducing this without any other mods installed? And if you can still reproduce it, please give me a detailed step-by-step guide of what you did.
Can you build the project and try it?  I was in a rush and did not have time to create a unit test yet. Can you provide one (or some code snippets that help me reproduce the original problem)? You can just paste some of the code you used to test in a comment here - would be very helpful!
Should we close the issue?
Does the HTML include forms?
Did you perhaps use NEI in any way? 
Do you use single or multi user Che?

Does this not work in 1.9.4.1? Also, sorry for the delayed response on this. 
What is the easiest way for me to replicate the issue so I can test the code change?

Could you post the code you use to create the `DataRegistration` object? This happened for me at first, but it was just caused by a problem with my test plugin while creating the `DataRegistration`.
Could you elaborate more? Does it happen on converted project? What type of entities and what additional components they have? Looks like grouping sprites works fine on 0.3.1-SNAPSHOT. 
Can you share the heap dump? 
Which JDK did you use for compilation?
Do I need iOS device to see what's going on there ?
Could the other machines be having the same problem? 
Why? I see no reason to do this. Track should be more accessible, not less. 
What should Clover do? 
What would the expected behaviour be?
Which version of the server are you using? 
Should we move the extension for the FeatureIDE perspective into the fm.ui plugin as well? 
What locale (exact value) did you specify in your config.yml?
Why are you using such a convoluted approach? You could just easily use `fromCallable` to compute a result on demand for incoming subscribers?  ``` java Observable<Integer> publishAndWaitForReply(Task task) {    return Observable.fromCallable(() -> process(task)); } ``` 
Did you try to copy the files using another webdav client like Cyberduck?  Nevertheless will try to reproduce this locally and see what I can find.

Can you check what contents 'slidinguppanel' have? This doesn't seem to be an Android Studio issue, so I presume that narrows down the issue a tad.
can you tell me something about what you were doing? 
What about NES values? Are the colours correct?
Could you try replicating this with either PEX 1.23.4 or LuckPerms? We can't guarantee consistent behaviour on the PEX version you're using.  In addition, does this occur on [release builds](https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX) on 1.13.2?  ---  #2166 may affect this, but it seems unlikely.
Could you please also have a look in the client log files if there are more error messages? The above is just a "lost connection" and not really helpful for finding the cause... 
Can you please revisit it and update your fork? 
Maybe you accidentally set your name to "Gumball " or " Gumball" ?

Did you do a hard reboot or soft reboot?
Could you share your Redisson configuration?
Do you have an example where this is not happening? 
Can you please share a minimal example that reproduces the failure? Looking at the auto-configuration and your description, I cannot see why there's no bean of type `ConsumerFactory<Object, Object>`. It should have been created by `KafkaAutoConfiguration`:  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/2c9cf6511efd8453b39e1c31d66996e8da9b1e33/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/kafka/KafkaAutoConfiguration.java#L82-L86

Do you actually "see" the volume raise or is this just a feeling? Are you pressing the (software) play button or do you use any hardware buttons (which might get confused with a volume increase button)? 
Could you send me the logs, so I can check? (We need to update our Issue-Template, because logs are much more intresting and informative then crash reports...) 
Do you have example files so I can try to replicate the error? 
Could you try to set driver parameter 'Omit single catalog' on? And reconnect. Is is on driver editor dialog, which is accessible from connection properties page. I'll fix default configuration if it will help. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398845/44024966-6f51e114-9ef7-11e8-8499-09306c2d9eba.png) 
What's your expected outcome for this change? If it's about the order of insertion, that order has to be maintained because of the foreign key relationships between your entities.
What do you think?

Do you have more information on this? What type of character, what level, job? Or do you mean the levelup effect itself not damaging monsters? 
Can you please share some informations how you set up the testfragment and which content model you are using?  It would be also great if you can share a content package with your example content. Thanks!

Can you tell add here what version of the SDK you are using? 
Can you confirm you're using 0.7.4-SNAPSHOT? What happens if you remove the "@Suspendable" annotation from your lambda? I'll be hearing from the Kotlin team, apart from that I think adding a Kotlin annotation and recognizing it it in the `SuspendableClassifier` is the way. 
Does this need to be fixed post-1.7.10? I never checked.
Can you please work on the code I provided here and make it reproducible? If you can share your code privately that is also okay with me. Somehow, I need to reproduce it.  Please provide your environment details also - like OS, JVM version etc.
Does gradle any additional checks, that are not mentioned in your error line?

can you do it? i, interested in seeing one
Can you please bisect this and find the breaking commit?
Can you link to this specific section of the FAQ? 
What's the bug? How can I reproduce it?
Could you please give it a try and report back if you still encounter problems?
Could you show me the code you're using?
Could you tell us more details about this? 
Could you also report this to the CT issue tracker? Any breakage with only changes on CT's side seems like an issue on their end. In any case, they should not be making API-breaking changes without changing the major release version.
How difficult would it be to support multiple uses? Apart from this particular issue there's little I can think of in any of the parsers that is stateful and/or needs to be reinitialized.   Advantage of reusing a parser is that you get to retain any custom parser configuration. 
Which version of Minecraft is this for (and what refined storage version)? I'd guess they've changed their API.
How important is it for you (how long can it wait)? I am asking because I would like to put it somewhere within our scrum process. 
Could you give this version a try? Backup your database beforehand, just in case. ;-) [AdvancedAchievements-4.2.zip](https://github.com/PyvesB/AdvancedAchievements/files/828820/AdvancedAchievements-4.2.zip) 
When did it crash? Startup or reload?
Can we add a redirect from zipkin to zipkin/ (or even better support both in the code)?  It's very annoying that /zipkin returns a 404
Maybe we should move the plugin code into an entirely different project? 
Would it be possible to post a **deodexed** SystemUI?  `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.android.settings.dashboard.DashboardSummary#rebuildUI(android.content.Context)#exact` `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.android.settings.Utils` 
Can you try this without MCPC? 
What's your permission plugin?

Could you please post a copy of your plugin-settings.xml?   I presume the page will have given you an error too, or did this happen when web editing at webhook (which happens via Ajax). 
What errors does it output?  Program arguments is inherited from standard CLion run configuration, of course here it makes no sense. You need _either_ OpenOCD parameters with script or script itself, not both.  Please ensure that you have `arm-none-eabi-gdb` set as GDB executable and set path to OpenOCD.
How can a fragment's activity be null? o_O 
Maybe you can send me the code of your app as a minimal working example? I never encountered a similar issue and without any code being available it is very hard to reason what is going on there.   By the way, the 1.0.0 branch is still under heavy development and cannot be considered stable yet.
Can you explain what you mean by "older" devices? 
Why is that not included in Forge, and where can I get it? Anyway, on to the question at hand. Oops! What mod combo are you using for this? Or is it just pure vanilla and EnviroMine? 
What exactly card was used to search? 
Can you verify it? 
Who are you, @saalmaan ? 
Which model file are you using? Are you running the bayou.core implementation?
What is "TaskQueue.access$502"? I think the legitimacy of this race rests on that and the thread safety of ThreadPoolExecutor (and I assume it is, since it's in Java's concurrency package). 
May we ask you for a PR with this tests? Thanks! 
How many apps do you have?  Please attach logcat and files found in `/sdcard/andlytics/debug`. 
Why? 
Did you forget to close a response body? 01-17 11:02:38.214 19466-19577/com.package.xx W/OkHttpClient: A connection to  http://host.domain.de/ was leaked. Did you forget to close a response body? ```
when exactly are you trying to crew? Even though it's instant you can't crew while declaring attackers or blockers. If you're trying to crew during the Beginning of Combat step, or after attackers have been declared but before blockers are declared and it's not working that's an actual problem.
Should I really ask a third-party developer to add appliaction for FOSS project or is NC team capable to fix the code at least after a year ?!
Why do people keep reporting crashes but not providing the file literally made for reporting crashes?
How to reproduce this bug?
Which tab were you using when you came across this bug? Library tab, Starred Tab or Activities tab? Please provide more detailed info in order that I can reproduce this bug. Thanks. 
Can you reproduce the same issue using the latest Che release?
Does it happen all the time? Something seem to trigger it? 
Can you try downloading https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=net/java/dev/jna/jna-platform/4.5.2/jna-platform-4.5.2.jar and https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=net/java/dev/jna/jna/4.5.2/jna-4.5.2.jar, adding these 2 jar files to Flyway's drivers directory and then try to connect again to see if this fixes the issue?
What's your database? 
What are you doing that you need an array?  Why would you pass a shorter array to this method?  You don't need to answer, I just like to understand when people use Paguro in ways I never thought to.
Does it definitely reproduce reliably on Galaxy Note 4? Is it 100% reproducible for you? Could you provide a bug report taken from that device, since that'll be most similar to the device I'm trying with. Thanks! 
Can you please provide your mod list and the console output or the log in the Minecraft loading phase? 
Can you upload the log file from %appdata%\.minecraft\logs? (it'll be `latest.log` if you haven't started the game since then, otherwise it'll be one of the compressed log files)
What do you mean by non-default log file?
Do you have a full stack trace or could you send us database and test case to reproduce the issue?
Can you post your full `glowroot.log` file?  Maybe I will see a clue in there.  Thanks.
Could you tell me which one?
Could you give it a try with a version available here http://builds.jabref.org/shutdown-duplicates/ and check that the problem is also gone on your system?
Which map are you using? 
Do you happen to know if the chunk was loaded, or if the chunk had to be loaded? EDIT: Secondary question - what dimension was your base?  Was it a GC dimension?
Did you reboot after enabling? 
Can you provide the environment information, including which version of Windows you're using? Thanks!  ### System details      RStudio Edition : <!-- Desktop or Server -->     RStudio Version :      OS Version      :      R Version       : 
What does the Toast say? Deleting images from a removable sd card doesn't work right now.
What database? Is this behavior the same for all SQL queries or you can edit some results and can't edit others? Can you edit cell values in table data editor? 
Do you have the full log for that deadlock? It seems to be cut off, as it's only showing computercraft threads.  The concurrent modification exception can probably be worked around by turning off concurrent world ticking, I've still not figured out what's causing it - see issue #58. 
What do you think?
Can you tell me which dynmap you used (link to download)?  As for the permission `dynmap.*=false` there doesn't seem to be anything wrong. Did you perhaps forget to reload permissions after changing them in the files? Better use commands: `/p global deny dynmap.*`. 
Where to get the files?
What are the settings for Link Map for Jekyll .md to .html? Maybe there is an error in the expressions which are causing this.  I think the link processing gets confused by the path.  
Can you add some logs and how to replicate?
Could you provide an example with the exact content and edits you've done? That'll help us fix it!
Could you please try resetting your preferences? 
What was the exact situation? What value did you define for creatures to sacrifice?  What creatures were on the battlefield?
Do you have any player that is able to do that?  Currently we are not sure why these files are not playable, so maybe it will be easier if you just rename those files. In my opinion a file with a colon in the filename is not really a good idea.  
Can you clarify the impact of this?  I'm asking because I'm dealing with other bugs and it would be good to know if this was interfering.  Thanks!
Can you upload your full gradle log file, as there might be more information in there? (run with --debug but pipe the output to a log file with a command like `gradle setupCiWorkspace build --debug > log.txt`)
Do you think this qualifies or is it just poor performance that wouldn't impact game functionality (or API) to fix at some point?  Pinging @immortius and @flo 
Would that improve your situation? 
Do the clients have any information (crashes, errors or other problems) in their logs? 
Does your terminal/console contain any stacktrace/error? If yes can you please post it for us? :)
Can you try grab verbose recordings? That would at least confirm that it's a caching issue in LP and not something unrelated (in your plugin for example)
Should we try to apply it anyway? 
Could you please let me know: - Which shows are affected?  - Which quality are you trying to download?  - Do you experience an app crash?  - Do you see a download notification after clicking the download icon?
Maybe we allow the user to provide a name to the conditional flow step itself, too? So we have a combination of conditional flow step name and condition name.  `MyConditionalFlows -> My1stCondition -> When ${body.task} contains 'foo'`
Do you use EnderIO ME conduits by any chance? 
Does it show the device name (Family Room TV, or whatever)? Or is it just that absolutely nothing happens when you press the Chromecast button?
Did you test the stuff on different hosts? One with such a "interface0" and the other without?  
maybe  parent=null related? 
Could you create a test which proves the bug? 
Don't you mean to say `@TypeHint(String.class)`? 
What do you think ? 
What do you guys think about this approach? It would separate messages from different contacts and make search within one "thread" easier.
Do you have this issue with all fonts or only with this specific one? It maybe an issue with font rendering I guess.
What is your `resourceBase` for the alternate DefaultServlet? Did you specify a value for `pathInfoOnly` setting on this alternate DefaultServlet?
Can you be more specific? 
Did you receive any update from your client? Also, could you confirm that the video and audio are intentionally DRM protected in the provided sample, and that it's just the text stream that's not protected?
Do only the gold and iron blocks that don't work? Or do other blocks also not work?
Can you open up our app and go into "Notifications" do you see a snackbar on the bottom showing an error?
Could you check with the webclient if the message should have sound ? Do you know which rules triggered it ? COuld you send a bug report ? 
Why tests didn't fail for this? I would like to see tests in bugs like this that with fix a unit test would also be added so we don't make same mistake twice. 
Maybe you need to enable this lombok.noArgsConstructor.extraPrivate property? Or maybe you should ensure that your IDE is compiling Java classes with parameter names symbols?  We should make sure we’ve got this covered in the 2.1 migration guide. 
Did you already run the command in the Desktop Environment?
which would be needed to reproduce it potentially?
How many memory/file descriptor have you configured? 
Don't know how to fix this problem though, it's annoying...  For the empty list of actions are there any differences between the two files?
Could you produce a heap dump, and find out which objects are failing to clear their threadlocals?
Can you please apply the suggestion above on your current version and let us know how it goes? (Also, `@Autowired` on constructor parameter is not a thing).
However, I did build against API 17 instead of API 15, so perhaps that fixed it? I'll be pushing that change shortly anyways. 
can you post the xposed log?
Which Hive version is this? Hive had some parquet timestamp compatibility issues before 1.2: [HIVE-9482](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9482).

Can we see the server logs anywhere?

Did it actually return 1501254026000 for the timestamp, or did you make it up for this example? If that is what it actually returned, then there is another bug. 1501254026000 is 11/06/49542 @ 7:13am (UTC). If you drop the trailing zeros you get 1501254026 which is 07/28/2017 @ 3:00pm (UTC) 
Did you recreated store from scratch with the newest snapshot? I do not provide backward compatibility of any sort yet. 
Can you explain why this is a problem for your code?
Can you attach the yaml or json for one of the configmaps containing one of these plans? I can see if I can reproduce quickly with that.  The second error is just broken error handling which is an easy fix.

What's the root cause for the browser restarting, though? Does it affect anything else?

Does this reliably reproduce? Otherwise I think we will chalk this up to a JVM bug, this is an older version of JDK 8 after all.

Maybe because your is supposed to be you're?  Just kidding, that seems weird though. 
Maybe @mdaliejaz knows? 
Do you mind attaching a `/discord debug`?

Do you happen to have a test case demonstrating the problem?

Can you do `bsb level (your name)` in console with the old build and new build and then paste them so I can see them? By comparing the reports I’ll be able to see exactly where the differences are.

WhatsApp or telegram?
when you build the project from maven and run from command line? 
Do you have any **generics** in the declarations of any of these classes on some method parameter? From the exception, it looks so? Maybe in `LoginService`?  Would you be so kind to put the breakpoint in `jodd.util.ClassUtil.getRawType:966` and let me know the value of `genericComponentType`?

Does anyone have such a cache? Otherwise I will ask a friend of mine.

How did you change the package name?  Is your package name in that stack trace? I see nothing that seems relevant there....
Can you make a picture? 
Do you want me to provide the fix for this issue?  Out of curiosity, I used [search.maven.org](https://search.maven.org), to see which old versions of `spotless-ext-eclipse-jdt` are available. `4.6.2` and `4.7.3` didn't and don't show up. Can you recommend another tool to search Maven Central?
what's the drawback?
How did you measure the height of the Phorusrhacos and the Kelenken without them taking off to eat some prey? 
Do you remember how we solved this? Unfortunately we do not have much control over how Android builds the settings UI. Do you think there are other options how we can select that item? I also wonder why we do onData(anything()) here. Did we try onData(withText(..)) and does this try to scroll?
Can you provide more information?  All I got from that was that your server crashed (due to a reason which you haven't told me) and that pets weren't saved, without providing any extra information as to why this might have occurred. I'm not psychic and can't read minds ;). 
What version of the mod?
Does the other tile get updated (update expanded when toggle from collapsed and vice-versa)?

Does anyone know what this comment refers to: https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/blob/master/app/src/main/java/fr/free/nrw/commons/upload/UploadService.java#L133 ?  I've repro'd the bug and I'm trying to track down whether it's a permissions issue or whether the temporary files don't exist anymore.  Is there a way to delete a failed upload to retry later for the user?
Should it use the same button that we start the alarm with? If not, how?
Can you give more information how it can even happen that the intent is null? The receiver should just listen for PACKAGE_\* intents, and a null obviously can't have any action.

What do you mean by "the hour in the notifications panel"? If it's a notification sent by Alarmio, clicking on it should always open Alarmio so that's probably a bug. If not, idk what you're asking for, you'll need to provide a more detailed explanation (sorry). 2. Yep, that's a bug.
Could you provide a PR with that fix?
Can you post the full log please? Also, use something like [gist](http://gist.github.com) or [pastebin](http://pastebin.com), don't put the whole thing here. Thanks. 
Maybe we should not publish the library if the category is wrong?  BTW, even doing so, a library can always switch valid category between releases, so we can always end with different versions of the same library belonging to different categories. And IMHO it seems wrong to deny this possibility... 
Could you give us more information about your environment?
Could you submit a pull request to fix it?
Can you share a test case?  Thanks! 
Can you please check?
Maybe the echo timed out as the call took too long?

Can you see if this still occurs in 4.0.3? I think it might have been caused by them trying to take damage, and being thrown out through walls, that should now be dealt with.  I also fixed the issue with not being able to link to controllers from inside the lift itself.

Do you think our treatment here is sufficient, or is it worth tweaking?

How does it behave with http ? 
Can you please provide a minimal project setup that would lead us to get simmilar result?
Could you reduce this to a simpler JUnit test?  Something like: ``` 	public void testOneIdentityOrderless() { 		// github issue 89 		check("SetAttributes(f, {Orderless, OneIdentity})", ""); 		check("f(p, q) /. {f(x_,y_) :> {x,y}}", "{p,q}"); ... 		check("", ""); 	} ```

Does debugging only robot code works?  
Can you please share your content so that we can test locally? You can send it via email to dev.exoplayer@gmail.com with subject "Issue #6739". Also, is this happening on a specific device?
When you do the reset, you are teleported to your old island, correct? 4. What does the spamming error say? I cannot read it because the resolution is too low. 5. If you do /island after you fall, do you end up on your new island? 
Could you check which services device has? I guess the filter doesn't work only in case when there is no CastService. You can use this method: `device.getConnectedServiceNames()` 
Does it clarify?

What exactly is the problem ? 
Does this error happens more time for you?
Can you verify if still unresolved for the latest version? In that case, we would be glad to merge a test for it. Thanks!
Could you test with the latest SpongeForge? It would require upgrading the Forge dependency, and I'm not sure whether your mods are dependent on the forge version specifically.
Could you give an example, please?
Did you open a bug report on this? I commented on this one: https://javafx-jira.kenai.com/browse/RT-39562 
Maybe you are in this case? http://activemq.apache.org/slow-consumer-handling.html Denis    ![screenshot from 2018-09-27 20-15-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15241034/46181158-249bbc80-c292-11e8-9516-0c6acf20685e.png)

Would request you to test and let me know if it resolves the problem and is there something else I could help you with?
Can you provide a specific set of steps to reproduce this issue?

What game mode and difficulty where you in with the  issue of the Ichthyosaurus?  2. I think the whole herbivores eat Lily pads thing depends on what herbivore it is. I'm sure that the Henodus is way to small and "aquatic" to just go and pull down a nearly 1 meter long lily pad...

Why did you choose a rule over a constructor? Or, what are you trying to achieve? 
What exactly do commands say, when you write them?
Can you see if that dev build fixes the error?
Did you try to restart orbot? Seems it has some troubles sometimes, though latest version has some great improvements on this side.  Would be great if you could provide iptables configuration when you get the problem (needed output are on the website).  Cheers,  C. 
Does that also need to be fixed? Also, shouldn't price decrease for cum-stained clothing?
Did you try other input files - especially those that had problems due to "wrong" note head sizes?
Does anyone know how to remove it or in some config put by default that no confirmation is needed? https://imgur.com/a/DSomA
What are you using for a permission system?  It could be an issue with that or which world it was applied to.  If you are using LuckPerms, it would be something like this:  **/lp group default permission set bskyblock.island false server=bskyblock world=bskyblock** 
Didn't we see this deadlock before? I think it was recognized and filed as an Glassfish issue 
Can you get me any other info?  like an error on console or anything?  I've been trying to make this problem happen but can't.   
What does:   `MAVEN_OPTS="-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=EN" mvn -v`  report? 
Did you reassign the side config for the esd? And the dublication is intended for now.

Can you share more details? 
What do you think? How should we solve this?  Thanks _Aleksandra_  
What version of the mod, minecraft, libvulpes are you using?   
Can you try one of them and tell me if issue persists?
How does that sound? 
Can you upload the worldgen configs?

Can you post the `settings.cfg` inside your world folder on pastebin? 
would it not be sufficient to just offer right click on the process and allow remote debug to setup ?  
Does the issue occur with other themes? What about light themes? * Does the issue still occur if you switch the RStudio theme from Modern to Classic or Sky? (This can be changed using the top drop down box of the Appearance tab in Preferences)
Can you explain in more detail, what failure happens? Does your browser open to present the login page of oc.de?  What Android version are you using (system information could be indeed helpful here).
can you select a trader and use the /trader command?   then tell me what info you got for the wallet type  
What android version? 
what opengrok version is this reported against? (in 0.11 this is ok, if the browser properly shows css ... I tried latest FF and it works) (in 0.12 it is the same, so this looks like css problem ...) what browser was used? can you try latest FF/Chrome/Opera ? 
Does it still happen?  If not then I wonder if for some reason when the game launches on your OS and any key is depressed it also ends up counting as the one weapon key. You could probably add a little logging somewhere reporting on what keys are pressed and confirm it that way 
May that be the nature of your worrying?
Can you please submit screenshots to investigate your issue? Please find instructions here on [How to report a bug](https://github.com/VREMSoftwareDevelopment/WiFiAnalyzer/wiki/Feedback#how-to-report-a-bug). 
What version are you using? Are you certain it belongs to LSML? 
Can you try to do a loop to measure the mean exec time of ls? Bazel taking a long time is not suprising but the exec should be pretty fast. 
Can you reproduce the issue? also upload console and debug log 
Do you get an error message in the console? Do you see a message such as "Examples have been updated"?  I can't reproduce this on my phone - examples download fine for me. This is very strange because I didn't change anything about the examples in the latest release.
Can you provide a sample that illustrates the behaviour you have described?
Could you deliver more informations about how you uploaded the file ? 
Which version of Sleuth are you using?
could you please provide a unit test (in a pull request)? that will help a lot.

Can you install the latest from master and just give it another try for me? 
Do you have the crashlog itself? If it points to there (i.e. is a NPE) then I would agree with it.
Can you replicate at will? 
Could you also link the full log (or at least the 100 first lines) and the yaml files used please ? Thanks! 
Can you create us a test account and send the credentials to android at nextcloud dot com with a reference to this issue?

Can you please explain and provide an example file that is not working (I assume this is something within the SVG)?
Can you explain why it choked? 
Does it ever work?  FYI, I'll be releasing a newer version soon which will run each instance of JBrowserDriver in a separate process to limit the impact of these types of crashes. 
What version are you using?? 
Do you understand why this happens? Obviously that's a bug. 
Can you share API level @madhurgupta10 ? 
Did you run the test from mvn before executing it from Eclipse? (H2 driver must be available)

Can we make this into `1.2.0.RELEASE` given we just released RC now?
Can you give the latest beta a try? http://tinyw.in/bl I don't know how to solve this problem, so I just decided to make a 64-bit build of Boardwalk to see if that helps. 
What's your Android version?  I can reproduce it on Android 4.4.4.
Can you check if the problem persists with the current snapshots (2.1.5 or 2.2.0) ?
What do you think about it?
Do you also have the connection issue with v1.2.7 without having the argument set?
Maybe try again or clear the app data? It's probably some left over state or something.
Could that be related to record having same UUID in the XML or in the UUID column of metadata table in the database (both should be the same) ? 
Can you please send me ``/etc/dhcpd-eth0.conf``?
Maybe this is limited to saved caches only ? 
Does your http_proxy listen on `0.0.0.0` rather than `localhost` ?

Why do you need to solve this problem?
What versions of each relevant mod do you have? Please share your HeatRegistry.json file in a pastebin.
Might this be remainder of a previous installation? 
does it? Initially thought it was ok but yes, if the class is at the end it will overwrite the value . Currently this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9594042/52340501-ccc34e00-2a07-11e9-868e-13391f81a9e1.png) but should be this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9594042/52340541-e49ad200-2a07-11e9-8fff-850d3e58aec3.png)  I think 
Should we use an `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for the interceptors attribute of `CoapEndpoint`?  
Can you elaborate on the queue growing forever?  @smaldini the failing subscriber does cancel, `bad.isDisposed()` returns true. Adding an error handler, `good` receives the whole sequence. I don't think this is a bug. Do you think otherwise (and if so, any way we can improve)?
Can you check this?  
Can you measure the exact time this happens? Recording the sound from another phone might do. 
Did I get your question right?  JabRef should not be doing something like this. We need a step to uniquify the group names before they are converted. What do you think @tobiasdiez ? Or this this already done? I am a little bit uncertain if I have understood the question correctly. 
Does your template have mappings for the index? 
Which maven version do you use? I have 3.5.0 locally.

Can you please also attach the logs for this? If you are not sure where to get them let me know. I suspect something might be up with delve not the plugin but lets see. Thanks.  
What do the others think?
Can you please follow the issue template and provide you redisson configuration?

Why are you closing issues that are present and not yet fixed? Shouldn't they be kept open while you're working on them? 
When you fork a JVM, did you also measure the total memory footprint by both those JVMs? From my observations, it was better not to fork one as mentioned in https://github.com/openhab/static-code-analysis/issues/15#issuecomment-286754237: "the memory consumption IS less because there isn't a second JVM anymore"

Can you clone my fork, build, install and let me know if it fixes it?  > `git clone -b 2.0 https://github.com/tresf/qz-print`  These changes won't be merged until #180 (Apple USB) is addressed as well.  -Tres 
What do you mean?  My earlier post was a way to get a reference to a node by traversing the UI tree directly. It's low-level and breaks abstraction (i.e. it's fragile), but it sidesteps the problem of having to assign and maintain a dynamic id. 
Can you expand what connection properties you are referring to? I suppose you are aware of [`management.port`](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-change-the-http-port-or-address-of-the-actuator-endpoints)?

Does this occur only once, or does the error repeat over and over? 
Can you try with just a single tank block? (Also, can you try with a gate with at least one trigger parameter and add a fluid filter to the first parameter slot?)  Note that neither case are grounds to disregard this issue.

Does it happen with the previous version (1.8.0)?
What kind of hardware are you running on? I've seen situations where the heartbeat was not sent in time because of limited system resources (on a pi). It is possible to change the timeout values, but I have to dig a little to find the correct settings. I'll get back to you on that. 
When is this going to be fixed? It causes errors with other plugins with they check for online players. 
could you give some more discription of how you found the bug and/or how to trigger it? also if the problem persists in vanilla? 
What version of battlearena do you have? 
Maybe there is still something not fixed by https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/b8e2d49b77b153a6cc56080f7927b9d1a50fdf4f? 
Would you mind taking a look?

Can you work on a fix with test?
could you elaborate on this idiom?  and your respect would rather deepen then depend? sorry, not blaming just not beeing able to follow.
Can you check if the changes were written to the file system? It might very well be the case that this is only a UI problem and the star does not disappear although the changes were written to disk.
How does it compile with only `import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;` and `assertTrue(!img.getFilename().isEmpty());`?
Might I ask what version of nuprocess you upgraded to? Latest?
what is it supposed to do? I mean I know in a broad sense it's supposed to compile code first, then run it... but I'm guessing it's a simpler version of the `compile-js` command, or is it? What sources should it compile? where to look for them? etc 
What do you think @misaochan , is this possible?  Other than #1060 the reason can be a mistake made when merging or rebasing, or solving a leak.

Does this succeed without the KryoSerializer configured in `spark.serializer`? I see that your classes implement Serializable, but are not case classes nor are Bean compliant with setters and getters. If you convert them to either Scala Case Classes or Java Bean styled objects does this work?

How oxauth should decide whether to return 400 (bad request) or 200 with isActive=false if such token is not there anymore ? Since token is not there oxauth returns 400 and it is acceptable. This is known problem and we don't have ideal solution for it right now.
What kind of objects can I put into the extras of an activity? I feel safe with primitive types, thats why I used the ordinal value of the new enum type. But at that place (and another one) I forgot adding the "ordinal()" call, so the enum was placed directly in the extras. 
May I close?
How does the alert on the monitor of "Transaction Ids don't match" lead to this being the problem?

Can you please provide us with application "About" screenshot (app version number and OS version number)?

How would you choose to implement it?  Keep in mind most players use a keyboard.

What looks wrong? 
What is the problem of having different transaction types? For example, it is possible to have a snapshot transaction nested in an optimistic transaction.

Could you attach affected GIF and/or code which reproduces this issue?

Could we have maybe a second function which is removeAllMatchingAttributes?
Can you run it multiple times ?   If it only happens sometimes, then we know it's a threading issue.   I'll need to put all the UI building tasks on Swing's EDT to avoid that.  For now it sounds like a threading issue.

Could you please share the problematic file, so we can see why `Mp3Extractor` thinks that it's an MP3 file?
Maybe some checksums for cache entries?  We do have that, but it looks like that this is not the problem here. Would have a reproducer for me to take a look at?

Did you fetch the latest snapshot? (`mvn clean install -U`)  setting this in my `application.yml` works for me.   ``` yml zuul:    sensitiveHeaders: ```  So no header is filtered.  If you specify `Authorization` it won't work, cause it will get filtered. 
Do you have an idea on how to fix this already? :)
Could you post your config? ;) Thanks

Did the spell itself work normally?

Could you try to enable/disable Sonic? (Settings, bottom) If that doesn't help, you could try the OGG or even the OPUS feed. While MP3 is, in general, better supported by Android, it is worth a try.

What build of Java do you have?  It looks like, for this one test, your server address (besides invalidhost.not.here) is set somehow null. Can you please verify that is not the case (i.e. debug the specific test and see what the url you pass to getConnection is).

Would it be possible to copy the index into a node with 1.7.2 and try the query there, to see if the problem still exists? 
Did you send a crash report? Don't see anything in the Developer Console, yet. Those crash reports make it a lot easier to find out what happened 
Does this look good?   https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3069373/56682478-3a1e7b00-66e9-11e9-8fcd-8ed1af41f631.png

Could you please re-check the behavior with the most recent development version available here: http://builds.jabref.org/master/ and report what you find?  Since the release of 4.0 there have been changes in the key generation, which might also have affected this.
When you go from cache detail to logging view or when you actually post log? 
shouldn't they all be escaped? `--collection "/db/xmark/"`

What options are you setting? Don't think that problem in them, but still.

Do we want to try and make it possible to display large files, or do we want to fix this in a more indirect manner by not displaying large files on the main screen to begin with?  
Do you have tried to uninstall completely the app and then reinstall it? It seems to be a problem of updating the early releases instead of uninstall and install the new one. I've experiment the same issues after doing this... 
How about move this into 2.5.0?
Can you check JENKINS_HOME/plugins to confirm requested plugins (and dependencies) get downloaded ? I'm surprised the log don't tell anything about plugin installation (which is the most probable cause for restart)

Do you still have the error?

Can  you debug ? 
Did you investigate a bit how Cordova could be used together with OpenJDK?  Does it work out of the box or does `cordova-android` have to change anything?
Do we really need to implement this workaround or let's wait for bug fix? Because it may hide other possible bugs.

Could you add doc.reload() before asserts ? 
Which Android version are you running? Sounds to me like you might have run as `root` once? 
What version is this and what else do you have installed?  This works fine for me. If you are using cauldron that might be messing with the ownership detecton I would guess. 
What type of job? Please provide steps to reproduce.  If it's a paste job I think it's okay that a dispenser is required to be defined. 
Did you actually restart the server, after you changed the settings?
Do you know why there are multiple ways of adding data? Is the method with an update context meant to belay some sort of bulk-action for performance, or is it for transaction isolation?
Does someone ( @gama-platform/committers / @gama-platform/core ) know how to definitely get rid of those phantom folders in the repository ? Thanks in advance for any tip …  
Did you send it from a bq device? 
Could you paste a plugin list from `/plugins`?  I can't see any reason for EssentialsX being the cause if the user has `essentials.keepxp`, so it seems likely that there is a plugin with a higher priority overriding this behaviour.
Can you provide more detail?  Thank you
What's your game doing trying to find tooltip info when it loads up?  Either way, one of your packs is missing components on a crate.  Can you remove them one by one until the startup crash doesn't occur?
How did you trigger that exception? In any case, we should skip over any illegal properties and ignore their values. Could you send a pull request that does that? Thanks!

what user interface does this apply to? I assume data explorer 1.0?
Does it still work on the latest F-Droid build? (I have no Play Services on my phone anymore, so can't check)
Would you like to fix some of them via a PR? Most textual errors can be easily located and resolved.  The AI assist doesn't recognize scripted fleets of the campaign. I'll look into that myself and the research before level 3. 
Maybe we could have some forms of filter / map / reduce with a target collection element, like in Groovy? Otherwise the trick is indeed either default collections or reflection wizardry. 
Doesn't the installer perform an uninstall first? What component needs uninstalling to workaround the error?
Could you post ANR trace? It looks like that: `https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader/issues/848#issue-52219935` 
Can you share your code? Does it also work for iOS?  Thanks!
What language is your game set to?
Can you give some steps to reproduce?
What would you consider to be the correct behavior in such a situation? You have two IP adresses on two different NIC's, would you want UMS to pick one of them or to actually respond to both? It could complicate things a bit, since it would mean that UMS would "own" multiple IP adresses. 
can you provide your factory.json or workspace.json?
Do you get an exception stack trace?
Maybe the panel wasn't in focus? 
Could you show what you have in `System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")`? Also please give us details about maven/os (`mvn --version`) 
Could you please check?
What version are you on?

Do you wanna go for it @yloiseau? 
Maybe you just lack RAM?
Does this happen with 1.4.0?
What do you think about adding a global flag to `NamedArray` and maybe renaming the class   something semantically similar to `MatlabVariable`? It'd represent an array with a name and global flag that sits at the root level. This would match MATLAB semantics much better. 
What should the Jetty customizer do? The tomcat and undertow access log customizers in `ServletManagementChildContextConfiguration ` are used for customizing the prefix. I couldn't find anything that could customize that for jetty. Even `ServerProperties.Jetty.AccessLog` does not have a `prefix` property while the other two do.
What are those carroty things and how do they get there? 
Should it be [this one](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.7.10/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/event/entity/living/LivingHurtEvent.java) or [that one](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.7.10/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/event/entity/living/LivingAttackEvent.java)?

Does it work with chunk loading from mods other than FTB Utilities? E.g. ChickenChunks, Persistent Bits, Weirding Gadget? I've heard plenty of (admittedly anecdotal) evidence suggesting that chunk loading mods vary in reliability.
Shouldn't options should be permitted, and then rendered? 
How are you adding the server multiple times? I regularly add my znc bouncer several (4...5) times. The only requirement is they are unique in display name.

Do you have any other idea how this could be fixed? 
How often does this happen for you? Every time?

Do you have more details? I can't reproduce this.
How to repro though? I built `//scripts:bash_completion`, sourced the result, but `complete -o nospace -o default -F _bazel__complete` fails: `complete` requires one more argument, the name of the command it activates on (e.g. `bazel`).

Could you both try with another custom generator and see if you get the same thing ? I really can't think of anything I could do that would cause that. It actually sounds a bit like a client bug. 
Could you provide more info? Thanks.

Can you try in 0.62.0-alpha and see if it still happens? 
Do you think it's because your machine is too busy to respond? Kubernetes should be up, and we're only selecting pods that are `ready`. We could start the scheduler later if needed. I don't really want to silence the error logging until we know there is no bigger issue here.
How big is your project?  CH had some problems with large projects (182 modules took a week to initialize).  Those are fixed now.  However, I can't comment wrt v14, since I haven't tried it 
Which function are you calling? 
Did you add the suggested include in `arduino\portable\sketchbook\libraries\MPU6050\MPU6050.cpp\MPU6050.cpp`? Probably the library has only been tested on AVR and doesn't include that file.

Which version of Mobile SDK are you using? Could you try the latest from our `dev` branch?
Do we have a cleanup hook for this test suite? I believe the general approach is to kill the CoreSimulatorService with `launchctl kill SIGKILL` of the appropriate service ID  E.g. `launchctl kill SIGKILL user/12345/com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService` 
Does that make the behavior go away for you?  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/470418/33908347-f80b4f70-df3c-11e7-860d-dad042a8bf7b.png)

What behavior would you like to see?  Or, if I'm misunderstanding, you can help me understand more completely by providing a complete working piece of code or a failing test.
Does this happen on all devices running 5.1, or a particular model?  What I suspect is BoringSSL is calling `abort()` because `getrandom()` isn't available, which means we may need to submit a patch upstream to make newer BoringSSL deal with older Android.
Did you maybe configure a custom data storage?  Though in any case this isn’t a LP issue as the data storage server returned the 404. If it persists I’d recommend making an issue on lucko/LuckPermsWeb.

would that be okay? there is also a great deal of code duplication there so maybe that could be cleaned up as well. 
Can you provide more details, like app version or logcat output? I just tried to mark as read by clicking an item in the notification list, which worked fine. This is on 4.3.1.
Why? https://oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:5b403cd0-e732-4ad7-acb2-30242c96742c  Because it does not have geo coordinates. The person who added it probably did not use the location lookup. In this case, no geo coordinates are added (because we don't know them).

Maybe you have an idea?  Lint would work.
Can you reproduce the error?
Can you try reproducing it in console? (and share your sample graph here)

Did you restart Jenkins? I've seen it start working magically after that. 
Do you use the latest version of JobsReborn?
Do you reload with /reload then or how do you reload the config?

can you explain? 
Do you have the full script easily available?  I'd like to use it to try to reproduce this issue locally.  Thanks in advance.

What exactly doesn't work anymore?
Does this happen when your retry it? Judging from code it should make no difference if the file has a sync conflict. I fear it is just a single runtime problem…
What's in 'build\spotless-diagnose-java'?
Does it only apply to the above id, or to every ID / query you try?   I tried it and it worked for me. Moreover, we have automatic tests in place which also pass. Thus I guess there is a problem with your connection or something like that.

What version of gradle, android gradle plugin are you using?
Maybe Facebook's touchable registration is somehow interfering with FlatList's gesture handling?

Can we get the full log?
Who can test this? Did a customer test the build already?
Can you provide device logs for this issue ?
Would you like to create a PR? The commit message should be something like `Fix @IgnoreIf and @Requires erroneously enabling tests` 
Why did you do that?

Do you have any hint how this problem could be solved? Or has it accidentally been solved in the last weeks? ;) 
Does `console.log` work for Cordova apps? 
What is the crash?
could you export a csv dump, so that I can import it? If you are in the week view, you see the weeks not the days. Measurements in one week are then displayed as averages. If you click the average measurement you will get the last measurement in this average measurement. 
Could you link or attach a zip that this occurs with?
What card required you or the other player to discard a card as a cost?  There are quite a few interactions here to account for.
Do you know F-Droid run frequency ? once per day/week? (I don't see the update on the store)
Does that make sense?  Obviously I can understand the argument for conservatively invalidating at every opportunity - does anyone care to weigh in on which option they prefer here? 
Could you please add this?
Did you try to run your tests without it? Would be nice to have a feedback if the rest of the framework is still working.  Realistically this issue might be open for a while ... :/

Should this be optional (for cases where the plugin is being used to inject metadata into each jar file ) ? 
What's the rationale?
Does the error pop up immediately or after trying to open the file? Does this happen for every APK file you try to open? It might be something with the FileProvider and fetching the correct URI + Intent... I can investigate.

Why is `_State` not serialized along with `streamsx.ec`? I assume it's because the user code makes no explicit reference to `streamsx.ec._State`?
Why are you putting the jar file in .minecraft/logs? It should be in the mods folder. The above log also suggests that the mod isn't installed properly, and thus isn't being loaded by Forge.
does it actually only output the removed item or is it only JEI thats showing it like that?
What version of AntennaPod are you currently using?  What version of Android?  Do you have "Persistent Playback Controls" enabled in AntennaPod settings?  This isn't by design. We attempt to keep AntennaPod running, but the system can also shut us down if we're not doing anything. 
Could you please elaborate on the problem and what behavior you would expect?  Thank you!

Do you know of a way to reproduce this? Which is the current chart when this happens? Is the chart already filled with data or not?  I think the bug is in MPAndroidChart, but I need some info how it actually occurs. 
Can you share the project file and the log after double-clicking? The log file `ganttproject.log` should sit in your home folder.
Can you verify that you have implemented the delegate methods within your App Delegate correctly? If not XCode should provide you warning markers. 
Can you please attach your xsd?
Why should it disapper? It shows last Bolus. SMBs are part of oRef1 and shouldn't be displayed here... I have sometimes last bolus there for 6 hours (since the last bolus)...

Could you please run a "lsof" (list open files) or similar that shows what files are open?   Thanks!
What mod is the axe from? What launcher are you using?
Do you also have the latest changes for the simulation and solver bundles? I can't replicate this issue on my workspace and sounds similar to what it would happen if the frontend was run without those changes in other bundles.  
What are your finding on the same?
Can you retry with the latest version? added test case for that https://github.com/requery/requery/commit/13045e567331c8f74d5d1c03f2896314a07a529f

Do you have any instructions for how you test this?
Do you encounter any issues with your `RDD`s? Do you actually find the `RDD` being evaluated twice? `rdd.take(1)` should trigger minimal evaluation of the `RDD` content which should be reused.   Just to keep things clean, I've removed the `take(1)` for now. 
Do you use a self signed cert?
Does 2.5.1 still produce this error?
Which mods do you have? Do you mind getting a logcat or a Bugreport (Developer Options->Take Bug Report) and posting a URL to it here?

Maybe the team remove it intentionally ?
What do you mean by support?
Could you attach the detail of the error?
Can you send a logcat?
What about when you load the drops up? So /odr
How to reproduce?

Does it have to do with (maybe) deleting a mod from the list and then toggling a mod on or off? 
Did you define or redefine anonymous (inner) class com.example.Test$1 ? It can be caused by race condition when the new class is not present on extraClasspath=C:/out
Could you try reproducing this with just ID+IT (and dependencies) installed?
Could you enable logging and attach the logs to this issue? Another thing.. complete() or completeAsync() is called on a LockToken which is obtained by Message.getLockToken(). You seem to be getting from UUID.fromString(). Is that really LockToken?
What version of plugin do you use?
Can you try with `${argLine} `? We can change it to that. 
Doesn't it has a side effect? The inlining probably fails because instance creation is considered as such. Also for #451  
Do you have issues? 
how do you play more than one card at a time?
Could you leave some free threads, either by increasing parallelism to more than 64 or using less than 64 max concurrent sessions?

Can you post the steps to reproduce this scenario?
Do you see it in proxy events?

Can you give me some details? 1. Are you trying to run the example in the same plugin? 2. Have you followed all the steps given in README to use it in project?
Could you please post the symbolicated crash log for both errors? It would help me understand what the issue is.  If it's really expected to crash on the obj-c side, I would suggest that we throw a proper Java exception before that happens. Makes it easier to understand what the user has to do. 
Can you check if adding those lines to the file might solve the problem? I don't have that NDK version ready at the moment - but otherwise I'll have a look on Monday :)
Can you try this way  https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/docker-multi-user.html#run-syntax ? Please make sure you are able to ping EXTERNAL_IP from remote computer

Can this be related to the changes made for EARL reporting? 
Can you confirm?
Maybe related to #886? Do you have a db backup? If so, any entries with lastLogin = 0 in there for (somewhat) regular players? 
Can you please check the performances with version 0.41 and tell me if it's fixed ?
What is the expected behaviour? I think it should throw an error? 
Shouldn't a quorum of (layout.getLayoutServers().size() / 2) + 1) be sufficient ?
How did you find it? Should be fixed by #474 
Can you provide a sample project that reproduces that? 
Can you provide more of the console output? 
Would you like to investigate if you could find a solution for the problem?

can you provide a reproducer? your exception lets me that the client expects a multi-bulk message while it got a bulk, i need some context to understand what is happening 
Do you get the same error? Does this also happen with  2.3.4? The logs shared just show that okhttp was not able to read all of the stream because the device ran out of memory. This could happen for so many reason. Other apps using resources, memory leaks etc.  
What is going on?
Does it happens all the time or intermittently? 
Would you be able to provide the log with the errors?
How did this happen? When it started there was nothing there? 
Do you still require help on this issue? 
Can you please confirm the version you're using?

What were you doing before the crash?
Do we know what version of code was running on the buggy? 
Does the crash happen as soon as you enter the world? Did you have gauntlet in your hand? After the game crashes, can you enter the world?

Can you clarify on this? Are you opening the link in Android or iOS? 
How is this supposed to relate to MetalChests? Have you tried just deleting the `config` directory and launching w/ only CustomMainMenu & MC + any deps?
How are you restarting the server? Citizens may not be saving if you are just quitting it without using 'stop'. To change that you can up the frequency of the saving task in the settings. 
Do you use Koler as your default dialer or does this bug happens when you use your built in ongiong call screen?
What version of the IDEA Camel plugin are you using?
Why are you using `-jar target\glowroot-agent-0.10.4.jar`? Thanks.
Could you give us more information about your application (client and server) and a stacktrace of the exception? 
What exactly did you do, is your server in offline mode? Apparently that may be not an OMT bug since it crashes when you open the GUI and the inventory seems to be not synced to the server.

Would it be possible to open a support ticket so you can provide some logs and such?
May you please try to disable GKM proxy in Settings -> Connectors -> GeoKrety?
What are you doing to reproduce the behavior?
How often is this happening? I've tried 20 different links and they've all worked fine using latest build on my phone.  That error string is only used in 1 spot, so its easy to see where to begin troubleshooting, but as I can't reproduce it, there is nothing to troubleshoot. :-/ 
What version in use? 
Could you provide the string that's not shown correctly? 
What is your OS?
What am I missing?
Could you provide an example that leads to this behaviour? I was not able to reproduce this issue. I used a very similar setup and checked single and double qoutes.

Can you please try using an entity name without an underscore in it?  I wasn't able to reproduce the error locally. What version of Structr are you using? Can you post a screen shot of the problem / error? 
Do you think you can verify? You'll need to add Sonatype as your builds pluginRepository, see here:  https://github.com/alexec/search-in-a-box/blob/master/pom.xml 
Can you try build in browser (not Chrome)? I guess it is a duplicate of #7078 and #5800
Did you try 3.2? This _should_ be fixed there. If not, can you please provide the exception message? 
Why will not specify the additional classpath to basexclient.bat?  Do you think there is a problem with the way to enable the Japanese tokenizer? 
Would you mind to PR the fix to this?  Thanks again! 
Can you investigate as to why it's not reproducible in the demo app?  There must be something in your app.
What do you mean? If false is to be default value then is should be shown, no?

Could you provide a PR with that fix?
Did you use the Feathers SDK Manager? 
Could you clarify a bit - what is actually wrong in 4.3+ version? It doesn't work at all or some completion feature was broken? And please attach debug logs, it greatly helps to discover the original problem (https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Log-files)
Which version of Zest add-on are you using? [1]  [1] https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpUiDialogsManageaddons 
Can you test with this fix ? GitHub does not let me send the compiled jar here. If you can't build it I'll try to send it to you in another way.  Cheers
Maybe we could use something like https://github.com/ThomasKrieger/concurrent-junit to reproduce the error in a test? WDYT? 
What is happening exactly, just showing as a plain ink sack?
Can you please provide a sample of launch configuration? I will check if it can be supported. 
Could you please provide more information? What do you mean by this? 
Can you please provide exact IP-addresses?  Also please provide full output of following commands:  `ifconfig -a` `subutai management_network detect`  Slow answer from DHCP-server could be a reason of changes in network. Please try to restart your router and check again.  
Did you change the config after making the tool?
What is wrong?
What did you change the next spell key to? The crash report doesn't look the same as in #45, but I could be wrong.
Does resize() or push_back() works? 
Could you please specify which version of JEI you're running?
Can it be the network issue? Using the same machine, are you able to sign-in Azure Portal via an external browser? 
Could you start the application in cmd.exe to trigger the crash and see if it outputs a Java stacktrace? 
Can you try updating to 7.99.17? (https://mod-buildcraft.com/pages/download.html) I think this might have been fixed since 7.99.15.
What Sponge version do you run? Maybe it helps to upgrade or downgrade. And please post the complete error.
Does that happen allways? Something calls the "playerTick" twice at the same time. That should not happen, GT does not know how to handle that and crashes. I can somehow prevent that crash, but some random other mod is really at fault here. 
What DBeaver version do you use?
Do the logs appear?
Can you provide a server launch log (if multiplayer) or client startup log (if single player)?
Did you find any solution ?
What do you think?  If you do not like this solution, I can also add an option to turn off the sort-by-stroke-number and to enable back the sort-by-accuracy. Please let me hear your opinion. 
Can you post the npc savedata for that NPC?

does anyone has solution for this? Please. 
Could a manual location entry be allowed? Like city/country or even GPS coordinates?~~ "Manual entry is obviously allowed - it's the search function." UPDATE: My issue was user error! Thanks martykan. 
What OS are you using?
What's the build version of this plugin ? 
Do you have an idea what could be the best UI for manual entry?

Can you expand on that? Because we are not supposed to use TestNG in Quarkus.
Can you share the stack trace @resmo? After the upgrade, does it happen with all old VMs and are you deploy a new VM post upgrade, stop and start it? 
Couldn't recreate this - is this still happening to you in the latest build?
Would it be possible fo you to post a deodexed SystemUI? This would also fix an issue with the "x" mobile data indicator not showing from what I've seen in the logs.  
Do you know how that could be reproduced easily locally so we can test it ?
Could you enable debug logging as per the booklet (https://owntracks.org/booklet/features/android/#debug-log) and post that here? There should be a line prefixed with "connect string" that should show the url it's trying to message (including the port).
Do you know exactly which page contains the URL ending in  ``?pos=7001``? That would help to debug if there is any bug in the link extractor or somewhere else.
Could you try to reproduce the issue with this version? https://ci.chaosfield.at/job/ActuallyAdditions/job/ActuallyAdditions-unstable/139/artifact/build/libs/ActuallyAdditions-1.10.2-r64-139.jar 
Do we have the space to change the wording to "Alpha Strike/Battle Force" from everywhere that is just "Battle Force"?
Do you have the ability to a) down grade your docker image to the older version that was previously there, b) commit your source code / export ws if necessary, c) then upgrade to latest version followed by ws import and / or setting up a new workspace that imports your git code? 
Does this issue also effect eclipse/che project or is it specific to codenvy only? 
Can you provide me with more details? 
What's this AP Turrets? Sounds interesting. 
Did you ever see it before? And what do you mean with: "I never saw the 4 BTS around my house." ? To me it simply sound like you don't know what you're doing, so please correct me if I'm wrong. 
What is the status? 
What's the resource that's having the trouble? 
Do you have the number of entries showing? Are there any entries in the group you selected? (Groups settings button.) 
Do the exact same images fail in 0.1.2 as 0.2.0m3, or are you just using the same file type?  Some complex and proprietary formats require a project now (m2 and m3 I think), several other posts scattered across here and the forums refer to it.
Can you please share with us the output from `./gradlew -version`? 
What do you thing, @karindr?
Does the app have the storage permission? Were you ask to give it? (You should have, if the app worked as expected.) 
Did the `CommandLine::setCaseInsensitiveEnumValuesAllowed(true)` suggestion solve your issue?
what intellij version?  ``` @lexer::members {  hi /* foo */  mom } ``` 
Do all channels have logos? If some don't, I'll bet the # of errors lines up with the number of channels without logos. 
Which server?  ---  Notes for myself: From the stacktrace, it looks like the server's brand is `null`.  It shouldn't be `null` in most cases, but if it's not getting sent, that might be why (do some servers not send it?  or is it a race condition?) 
What about that? 
Could you look at your _Preferences > Install/Updates > Available Update Sites_ and look for anything prefixed with `http://download.eclipse.org/linuxtools`?
Which Sorin (full card name)?
Which sample are you using to reproduce the issue? 
What do you think needs to be done?

Which map is this?  (It looks like some `HitObject`'s `pixelLength` might be negative.)
Could you post the plugin settings file? It should be located at `~/.IntelliJIdea2016.1/config/options/saveactions_settings.xml`. You can try deleting the file (or renaming it to "saveactions_settings.xml.old") so it resets the default plugin values. 
Does this happen in a Vanilla Crafting Table? 
Wouldn't that require making a custom type of crafting recipe?
Do you know how the backpack was placed? Did anything happen with it? Machine interaction? WorldEdit?  (I don't work on WBs anymore, I figure I'm going to ask some follow up questions so the current maintainers will have more information once they get around to working on the mod again.)
Don't you have a common CA cert for your company certs?  > I have the option to group them together into a single certificate file which is .P7B encoded  Can not say for sure. At least you can try it.
What OS and IDE do you use?
Can you post the entire text dump? Curious as to where this shows up. 
Can you tell us how to reproduce please?

Can you verify this issue with the latest version of each mod with no other mods installed?
Could you please provide a sample demo project that reproduces this error (a link to a git repo or zip) so that we can verify it?
Can anyone confirm this? If this is the case we should move this into its own issue. 
What version of Forge? Mods and mod versions? Version of Waterfall? Your server versions? 
Can you try out the mirror example provided by dokany? In our forum you find a [guide](https://community.cryptomator.org/t/for-version-1-4-0-and-higher-is-it-dokany-or-just-me-or-maybe-cryptomator-p/2507) to use it. Before exiting the program (step 10 in the guide) close the lid/send your device to sleep/etc and after the reboot test if the vault is still accessible.
What Java and Project version are you using?
Could you proof if the ~~onadd~~ onclick event will be fired instead the outrigger event?  You could set a breakpoint in the didReceiveLocalNotification method. Maybe the fireDateDistance on a real device takes longer time than in the simulator. 
Must be this line https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/agents/ls-csharp/src/main/resources/org.eclipse.che.ls.csharp.script.sh#L102  Does this happen to a new workspace?
Can you post the code here ? 
Can you tell us which Asqatasun version you use : RELEASE (4.x.x) or develop version ?

Do you have an error.log in your plugins/ArtMap folder?
How can you say that this problem is related to `google-cloud-translate`? Could you please share the full stack trace, and also the warnings you are getting when building the app? 
What's the problem here? 
What version was this?
Can  you give me the json url that for getting the graph data? and the payload  for example the url: /json.htm?idx=4&range=day&sensor=Percentage&type=graph  and the result is then something like  {    "result" : [       {          "d" : "2019-02-10 14:50",          "v" : "0.72"       },       {          "d" : "2019-02-10 14:55",          "v" : "0.78"       },  
Did this issue only just now re-appear? This is now the 3rd issue report you've made about this problem.
Can you provide the full stacktrace if possible so the other guys who have more experience with this API can see what code is making this call?
What if we rip out the data binding and just hard code the solution to the problem at hand? 
Don't we already read that source as-of #354?  See lines 64-75.  If that's not working, there's a bug.  Can you be more clear on what "can not be read (on manjaro)" means?  Should we be looking for a return value from a file rather than just checking the file's existence?
Can you try updating to the latest version to see if the problem still occurs?
What else could be causing this? If you have logs to share I'll take a look
Could you please collect your IDE logs (**Help → Compress Logs And Show in Explorer**), and send them to `[REDACTED]@jetbrains.com`? Thanks.

Can you try [this](https://github.com/DeadlyMC/QuickCarpet114/files/3693795/quickcarpet-2.0.0-dev.20191005.234048.zip) version? (Need to unzip it, for some reason GitHub doesn't allow JARs as attachments)   
When is the app available again?  I think he means that the images are always displaying as 'landscape' on the main screen of the app. I think it was probably designed that way for aesthetic purposes, otherwise the grid would not look uniform. Is this something we want to change? 
Did you already try to reduce Config.INTEGRATE_RUBI_RULES_RECURSION_LIMIT ?
What version of spigot are you running? Also could you send me a list of your plugins? (Screenshots are fine)
Which device are you using? 
Does `bazel clean` eventually succeed?
Do you see anything in the adb logs that might indicate a potential problem?
could you test it against 6.3.4 version?
Could you confirm that the other cases works for you as well and if not on which platform you are running? 
Can I just skip places which doesn't compile?  I don't think we can skip compilation error, now you can build the model without the erroring files: by default, Spoon is in "no classpath mode", which means it will work even if not all sources files are given as input. 
Does any custom armour actually work with Smart Moving? 
Could you elaborate a bit on what is needed? Thanks.
When this happens is it 'permanent' or do the items flicker on and off? Would you be able to let me know if the same thing happens with fused glass or fused quartz? They use 80% the same renderer. I can't make this happen at all. 
When this happens, what does `/profile c 0 0` show? 
Can you try it ?  
Maybe that one gets omitted somehow in your build envoronment? I am generating it before jarring, so if you run without jar that would be causing issues. 
How come you already depend on :build_data_proto? How do I repro this?
Do you have `index.shard.check_on_startup` set by any chance? 
Do you run the jar file directly? Or do you use the shell script? If second, try running the jar directly via command line: `java -jar BlossomsPogoManager.jar` 
Whats a youtube radio channel? It should be a normal livestream, but ita true that one does not work.
Does it say the right things to the player? Does it claim to lock/unlock? 
Can you share the generated code involved?
What java are you using that has List<>.sort? 
Can I work on it? 
Maybe we can disable auto-build when the interface is missing?
How exactly are you doing this? How are you swapping the syringe? 
Do you have something like that in the document? If so, does the issue still reproduce if you remove it?
Can you explain me what links make that happen (I tested with multiple cases)?
Do you have a kinetic dynamo in the same chunk as the presses? If you have, please remove it, replace it with some other generator for now and see whether the bug stops happening. Something like this has happened before and I suspect that the dynamos cause it. 
Can you update them?
Could you please dump me that table?
Can you instruct me on how to reproduce it?

What OS are you using @petrux ? 
What version are you using and can you give some more details?  
Does this happen instantly when you start the server or does it only happen randomly?
Can you give some sample names where this occurs? We have multiple test cases for sorting, and I assumed that handling "." in it is working.  Do yo really have two files with the exact same file name? Otherwise your workaround would not apply?
What is your OS?

Does it work on other emulators?
Could not replicate, would you post full example? What OS and JVM are you using? 
does it work when your inventory is empty ( minus the bit ), are you using a mod that alters your inventory in some fashion?  I must be missing some critical piece of information that makes this crash possible.  I've tried testing with BOP, and Quark so far. ( BOP for a modded block to test with ) 
What's the value of the `java.version` system property on that JRE? 
Would it be possible to provide a test case?
Do you know since when is this rule should be necessary or where a change came from, that triggers this?

Would it be possible to add a comment how your table definition looks like? Are you using BIT(n)?  
Why a new map? Can you not load the same map again?
Would you like to open a PR with your patch so we can review?  From what I see, even if we shutdown, the loop `while(current==null)` may prevent the thread to stop. We may need something like `while(active && current==null)` instead, to be more responsive to shutdown.  Thanks!
What do you mean "not capable of processing packets"?
Could you try with the latest version and see if a clean install still has a problem for you? 
Could you upgrade to that and retry? 
What are your device specifications?
Could you please share the entire alfio.log? (you should have it under logs/)  Thanks
Can you tell me what version you are using? I assume 0.07, the current release?  Would probably be best to talk about that directly. Where are you from? Europe, US? Knowing that, we could determine if it would be easier for you to talk to me or @Jezzadabomb338. :) 
Can you share a gif or video of this happening?
What does the CLI say then?
Does this happen when sorting using InvTweaks? / Did you sort when opening?
Would it be acceptable if it honored the Edit->Preferences->Accessibility->Chat Font Size or would you want two separate font sizes, one for chat one for the macro editor?
Could you check the size of the downloaded GeoLite2 database files in `plugins/EssentialsGeoIP`?
Can you confirm you have this set to true in your manifest?  ``` <meta-data android:name="Rush_debug" android:value="true" /> ```  Also as a side note, you do not need to save the children first, saving the parent object takes care of that for you. 
Can you add relevant output from your server log? I just tried to by killing rabbitmq and restarting it during message processing and reconnecting worked fine. 
What is the limit on document size? 
Which Java version are you using? 
Can you send me your map? (I need it for testing this bug, because your map is maybe too big and LegacyRegion maybe doesn't count with this)
However, we have a unit test that verifies the behavior at hand => https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/blob/master/src/test/java/org/springframework/hateoas/client/TraversonTest.java#L234-L248  Do you have a particular URI or hypermedia JSON fragment that actually makes the code blow up? That would be handy to avoid regressions.
How bad is this? i.e. how soon do we need to fix it? 
Which version did you update from? 5.6? 
Can you try clearing the cache and restarting IntelliJ? 
Could you provide a pull request or suggest changes via a patch while we resolve the Ant build issues?  I would really like to have your fixes go into 2.2 RC4 before 2.2.0. 
Should be fixed by https://github.com/jakimfett/Minechem/pull/632  @IAA-ShRaPNeL could I get you to test this with the latest build from the [Minechem Jenkins](http://jenkins.jakimfett.com/view/ForgeModding/job/Minechem%201.7%20v5/)? 
Can you provide an example of the code that changes the event time? It may be possible that a new event is created but I think you would still need to explicitly add it to your calendar object. In any case the UID property should be unique so we may need to add some deduplication.
Can you upload the crash report (of the server if it's running on a server, or the client if it's a singleplayer world)?
What database? Is there anything in error log? What is in Query Manager log (you need to enable metadata queries logging to see what actually happens)? 
Can you run any container with curl and this to execute this command manually?
Can you post a picture of that bug? 
Can you check 2.3.0? There were some changes between those versions that may have impact

Use format with Unix like slashes.
Do you have some scripts or configuration that we can test to try and reproduce this locally?
Did you check if they are fired? 
Might be related to #405  @danielsauter did you see any of this?
Do you know when this happens?
Does it work there? Just trying to figure out whether the fix is only in the library or in SAM local as well.
What's the specific number you're using along with header information and method (POST vs GET vs PUT etc)? And what is the actual response output that you get back? 
Can you confirm and close the issue ? 
Which tests are failing ?
Maybe @oscargus can provide some insights?  @JabRef/developers Maybe we should ditch Open Office integration, since Open Office died anyway? I do not know if the current integration can be ported easily to Libre Office  
Does the player have Builder's job? In the jobConfig.yml file, is there a block type in the Place method that is Brewing_Stand?
Can you please post the android log while you create the folder on ui and one while you create through the web ui?
Would you mind doing so?   You can find the Error Log in the lower right hand corner if it's currently shown, otherwise you can show it by selecting it from the Window menu. 
Did you set the database field in the configuration panel?  Cheers,  David 
When you say this it works fine when running from the command line, how are you running your application? Are you using `mvn spring-boot:run` or `java -jar`?
What game mode and difficulty where you in with the  issue of the Ichthyosaurus?  2. I think the whole herbivores eat Lily pads thing depends on what herbivore it is. I'm sure that the Henodus is way to small and "aquatic" to just go and pull down a nearly 1 meter long lily pad... 
Can you clarify further? Both click repo + enter and click repo + click confirm works on mine.  Is the text field empty?  
Could you try it out if possible? (You'll have to build master from source)

Why would you need this?
Can you upload a minimal content package which reproduces the 'not direct child' problem? 
Do you really *need* to use it? Doing what nearly everyone else does (i.e. AAC) is definitely the path of least resistance, unless that's a non-started from a product perspective.
why would it be one since it is not shared ? 
Maybe a nice feature in 2.0?
Could you please also have a look in the client log files if there are more error messages? The above is just a "lost connection" and not really helpful for finding the cause... 
Can you get some output with debug-mode enabled please?
Do you have a copy of the console error?
Should jooqFaces offer a facesContext wrapper for redirections? 
Could you help to check the server side? 
Which version of Spring Boot were you using before you upgraded?
what about the (parrallel whatever it was named) mode, does it has any influence?
Did you define it an area? 
Which part of the ITT config is about those stats? The global durability modifiers for instance apply to all tools anyway. The overrides in particular are intended to do this, and I can't see any other place in the config file about that.  Also, which stats exactly are being modified? 
Could you also report the version of Maven that you are using? I don't see how this could come from OpenRefine's own Maven configuration since we do not specify the source repository at all.
Can you clarify?
What is the output for you there? Because the error is device specific
Can you give me the novel/hostsite link so that I can reproduce it?

Would you agree? 
What server and what jdbc driver (version) do you use? Are there any error in error log (https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Log-files) ?

Maybe there is some special scenario with replication slots?
Could you try to give the an entity to replicate the problem though?

Can you maybe post your whole code especially where you handle request and do the response?
Does [0.0.51](https://github.com/GoranM/bdx/releases/tag/v0.0.51) work? 
Shouldn't we leave this open, so we don't forget to take the hack out once we've got a fixed version of txtmark? 
Could you possibly upload a screen recording of the issue or describe the steps in more detail? Thank you.
What version of _Gnirehtet_ do you use? On which platform?  Could you see relevant problems in the logs (in the relay server window and through `adb logcat`)?

does it happen after a seek, or in which method do you call player.getDuration())?
How would I reproduce that exception? Can you show an example test? 
What version are you updating from?  Could you please try to run the server again with the same files and the linker version of MassiveCore. It contains some hopefully useful debug information. https://www.dropbox.com/s/ezn2zcdjjcvwa8a/MassiveCore.jar?dl=0
What server jar are you using specifically? 
Which OS?

What do you think it should be? 
Can I assign the ticket to you? 
Can you test this separately to pin it down? And do you see the different subfolders options based on the collections in the right click menu? 
Did CQL-to-ELM report any errors regarding that line of code or did it run smoothly and just produce unexpected ELM?  I'd hope that it would have reported an error since `@12:30:00.000` isn't really a valid construct in CQL.
Would you please share some parts of your code, so I can try to reproduce this issue myself?
Do you know what types of components you were trying to link at the time?

This usually happens when either the list of API endpoints could not be loaded (due to `rest_transport_uri` problems), an entry is malformed somehow (often a whitespace character somewhere) or a Javascript exception during loading.  Thanks! 
What is it? 
Can you try with VBOs and Vsync? If you can, you should try with and without Optifine and compare the results.
Can you run with -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1 (effectively disabling the GraalVM compiler) and see if it still occurs? Maybe also just -XX:-UseJVMCICompiler flag instead to check whether it is an issue specific to the JDK.
Can you post crash reports for some of the other crashes so I can see the actual error in them?
What's in the logs of your Graylog nodes? Are there error or warning messages in the Developer (JavaScript) console of your web browser? Are you using the root account or a normal user account to check the availability of the menu item?
Do you get the revert changes pop up the second time you try to revert?
Can you give me a hint where to look at? What do you mean with "available locations"? Additional for me it works, so it is even harder to debug ;-) 
Which menu's (in English) should I use to get this screen? 
Can you send a Screenshot of the setup with the clock?
Can you attach the yaml or json for one of the configmaps containing one of these plans? I can see if I can reproduce quickly with that.  The second error is just broken error handling which is an easy fix.

Could you please send the excel file you're looking to import? That would let me know I am seeing the exact same bug that you're experiencing. My email is draquemail@gmail.com.  I'll be able to link you to a build where this has been corrected once I've tracked down and fixed the problem.
Do you want to me to adjust the constants already? 
Could you check if its fixed in the 1.2 alpha if you have time? Thanks!

What do you get when you inspect the servers open file set when it is in that state?  ``` chappy$ jps 11114 Bootstrapper 11402 Jps chappy$ lsof -p 11114 ```  You may want to pipe the output of `lsof` to a file. 
Maybe? It's obviously not supposed to be there, but it's quite spectacular. 
Why/is the code checking events in other worlds? 
could you please provide some logs (with a clean startup sequence)? Thanks, Thomas E.-E.

Can you think of anything else it could be? 
Can you please send the full log when you get your hands on them? 
Can I work on this?
How large are these files?
How sure are we it's that bad? Will a new project created in 1.4.0 work or is this only for converted projects? (It wasn't clear to me the initial reporter had converted their project.) 
Which version of theia? Could you share the devfile you are using to create a workspace?

Does the issue persist when using 27ab759c02ecbf1ea2f91c4a95674d5a67e825d0 (DBI 0.5 compatibility branch)? 
Could you pull my patch and try it again? Thank you
Did you make anything before opening the configuration map that could trigger that behavior?
Could you try removing `ignore` from the override commands list and aliasing it to `essentials:ignore`? In addition, `eignore` should already exist without the need to manually specify it in `commands.yml`.
Where did you download iDisguise 5.8.1?  The error log does not fit the code of iDisguise 5.8.1...
how does it glitch? And has this happened for multiple saves? I may know of the bug you're talking about.
Could you explain in more detail what happens in your case? Do you see exceptions or is just hanging?

When did you downloaded your tacit?  Did you download from tacit website or nightly build from wiki?  Thanks, Vijayan B. 
which react-native version are you using?
Did you restart Android Studio? It seems that there are issues when parsing the bundled content.json which is weird. Which OS are you using? 
Can you share how you're making the request so I can try to replicate?  Also, are you certain it's not the API you're proxying to that's returning the 500? Since there's no stack trace in the 2nd example you've given, that seems like it might be the case.
Can you find exactly which build this breaks in? 
Which JVM or device did this occur on? Can you reproduce it consistently?
Can you please kindly check if this version solves your problem: http://www.cgeo.org/cgeo-RC.apk  What device and Android version are you using?

Which process do you kill? When? 
How did you get this exception ? Could you provide more details ? 
Could you tell me the detail? ~~Which version of Pcap4J/Java are you using?~~  Could you write the command line you executed?  I think you are using 0.9.14 but it may be developing version. Have you tried the latest version on the Maven Central Repository?

could you add the build ID you were using so we can try to repro?
Could you try upgrading to the latest version and see if it's still an issue?

What's the output of `java --version` on the command line? And the output of `echo $JAVA_HOME`? 
Do you mind sending the whole log file? I need to check some other things, and the way GitHub puts it here doesn't help. It'd also help if you could take a screenshot or film the setup while / before it happens...  Thanks for the report :) 
Can you please provide a minimal and complete sample to reproduce the problem?
Maybe we can add some more logging to find the cause? Or the Syncthing source may help?  Also, there's a lot of messages related to root, maybe it has to do with that in some way? 
Does this happen when you rotate the screen after opening the dialog? Or the slider just doesn't appear? 
What device and Android version? [Edit: Remembered email. Nexus 5 with 4.4.2] Can anyone else verify? The audio stream setting should only be a matter of preference by how Android handles audio. 
which version please?

Where does the script fail ? 
Can you please post your Xposed log here? 
Could you please clarify that?

What's the version of sharding-proxy?
Could you provide a test case to reproduce this? As-is it's unclear what we can do to fix this. 
Does it happen on a new world or are you still attempting to use the older one? 
Could you please look into the response headers that you're getting back with `Internal Error` and extract the `request-id`? That would help us pin-point the cause of the problem.
Does the issue happen when you disable all other mods and only keep RPO with the resource pack?
Can anyone else verify?
Can you say version of AppMetrica?
Do you see this specific step completes eventually? or, does it fail?  Irrespective of that,  I think the REST response should handle the step execution with the null ID. Hence, this is a bug. Thanks for reporting!
How can I reproduce the issue?  The primary key is a generated UUID. I'm wondering how a primary key violation can happen.

Does this appear on a saved list or only on your view (which I guess is a search result)?
What configs? What conduits? I just tested them and they all work fine. 
Would you like to contribute a PR that adds an `Assert` to the beginning of this method?
What do you think?
Do you have the source .msg?
Would you have a stack trace? and code which creates map?

What does your /var/log/graylog-server/server.log show right after you try a search? 
Can you provide the error stack trace?
Could you run the .exe in the console and see if any messages are printed?
Did you get it working yet? Because this doesn't make sense to me, to be honest. If you still having this issue, it would be most helpful if you could provide an [MCV](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) (in a zip or something).
What version of Minecraft? 
What update was this issue reintroduced in?

Does that approach not work here for some reason? 
Can you test the latest release without deploying to production?
can you pastebin the config of the game that is doing this please?

How would I reproduce it? 
Does this only happen on Euphoria rom? 
Do you want to see horizotal scroll? 
Can you provide a little more information on what the expected outcome is?

Maybe the image ressource is just missing? 
Can you paste here the xml code?

Can you see if you can still reproduce this after the above commit?
Can't you just use a harvester + planter instead?  I assume they're called something strange but they certainly exist.
What even is the "Enchiridion Editor"? 
Could you please take multiple stack dumps from the process while it is in this hanging state? You can do this by calling "jstack <pid>" multiple times and pipe the output to separate files. Being able to dig through these would help us a lot. Thanks! 
Does this occur when the config option "Allow String as Tool Binding" is set to `false`? 
Can you detail what you put on application environment and on datalib ? In case the url in datalib does not start by http or https or ftp, the url defined at application level should be inserted before the service url where you can leave only the relative url.

can be closed, right? 
May I know from what screen you are sharing? Is it from custom Chrome tab?

what's your server version? 
Would you be able to supply a minimal reproducer containing only the Spring Data JPA and cache stuff that exhibits the problematic behavior?
Did you remove coal ore from that chest, or is that the distribution that you got?
Could you try the build at http://build.warlock.cc/sproctor/2.0.0.110_snapshot/ and see if you have any better luck there? If not, could you attach that log file it references? 
does it work when your inventory is empty ( minus the bit ), are you using a mod that alters your inventory in some fashion?  I must be missing some critical piece of information that makes this crash possible.  I've tried testing with BOP, and Quark so far. ( BOP for a modded block to test with ) 
What version of Android are you using? 
What are the inventories you are using? Are they definitely the right directions? 
How does your `getPap` method look like? Does it actually return an object which is not `null`?
Can you provide the parameters you are using? We aren't setting "x-message-ttl" in our codebase (to none or anything else). Is this the standard build?  I wonder if in a unit test, we can define a queue with the ttl to reproduce the error? cc @shakuzen 
Would you instead issue a GetFeatureInfo per layer? 
Do you have a JUnit test to show this behavior? It would be handy for analysis.
do you mean in the source code of the app?
Did you use maven to build the library? 
Why dint i see this earlier? f**k! guess i lost over 480 lots of items 
Can you try again using this? This build should include some more useful debug information. I can't reproduce this on my own machine.  [recaf-1.15.1-debug.jar.zip](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/files/3292912/recaf-1.15.1-debug.jar.zip)  ***  In the meantime if you download the source code and compile via `mvn package` it will generate a proper JDK 11+ compliant jar. 
When you say the stops "are correct", do you mean the stops all exist in the GTFS data, or all those stops actually exist in real life?  Also, do any of the stops have the same GTFS `stop_id`? 
Would you know what would be the correct module-info ?
Did you configure alluxio to point to a UFS? Have you followed the guide here:  https://docs.alluxio.io/os/user/stable/en/deploy/Running-Alluxio-On-Kubernetes.html  Please let us know if there are further issues.

Could you post the whole log?
Would you be able to share a heap dump of the node upon OOME? Or if that is too sensitive, screenshots of a heap analysis tool showing the top consumers?
Why ? Because **Achilles** provides very **limited** support for secondary index. Why ? Because they're tricky to use and do not scale very well. Documentation here: https://github.com/doanduyhai/Achilles/wiki/Entity-Mapping#secondary-index 
what is it about the book that is unclear about parameters ( other than left recursive arguments)? I'd be happy to add to the next release. 
Could you please write the suggested java code, so it is more clear?
Could you send me the full Forge log?
Do you have any ideas how to achieve it?  P.S. I now realized that our current implementation of `$$.texts()` is slow. It calls `getText()` for EVERY element in loop. We should better get all texts with one JS call. Apparently it will also solve your problem. 
Can you confirm you have network connectivity when this issue occurs ?
Can you send me the source file (via slack if you wish to keep private)?
Do you guys saw that bug when there was no scroll limits on? Disclaimer: I'm currently testing from #849, which may have an impact on the matter.

Could you give me a .zip file with the 2x textures so I can test it properly?
Can someone confirm? 
Can you extend the issue descriptio? In which views does the issue occur?
What version do you using? 
Maybe the parent can (and should be) be set in the activities? 
Maybe you have a lot of snapshots on the Azure repository?
Could this be related to this?: https://github.com/moezbhatti/qksms/issues/1121
Why are you returning a `CompositeByteBuf` from your service? You should specify a meaningful type, even if `byte[]` so the response data will be available.  A blocking client will have its buffer released immediately, which is the correct behavior
Do you know the reason for it ? A quick hack would be to set it around 99 if it exceeds 100   ``` java  this.setString((((value * 100) / max) > 100 ? 99.99 : (value * 100) / max) + "%"); ``` 
Can you please provide more detail in your steps?  My test: I selected Experimental Tech, Dark Age, Inner sphere set movement to 5/8/5, Added two Bombast Lasers, allocated all of the jumpjets and lasers and it's still functional.   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8506084/66408196-59f9e080-e9a3-11e9-995d-13d5d8aee02d.png) 
When is this going to be fixed? It causes errors with other plugins with they check for online players. 
does it crash when only rc is installed?
Maybe this is not important at all? I assume the question is quite relevant to THIS issue you raised. Rephrasing you words " in virtually every app..." there is `fge`, `jackson-coreutils` and often Guava 16.
Can you provide the server-side log for the SSP instance, both from when exiting, and then when loading back in to view the transmutation broken? Sounds like something's not properly unloading/reloading unless the pack restarts.
Does this reliably happen still? 
Do we really need a penalty for height restrictor? It should have maxheight already. It is like passing under a bridge, which also does not have a penalty, only maxheight.  https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2733546066#map=19/48.07528/11.10064   `<select value="100" t="barrier" v="height_restrictor"/>` https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/542c33d860c658a81f4c56b81a8a3b4b85308ad8/routing/routing.xml#L480
Where do i look? 
Can you share your source code somewhere on Github?
Why not just remove the value WORST from the PriorityCode enum ?  This brings the benefit that priority changing upwards and downwards is symmetrical. It is unlogical that there should be 4 values for decreasing the priority down and only 3 values for boosting up. 
Does this occur with the most recent builds? 
Can you enable trace logging and give me the (redacted) query + response issued directly to slack?
Do you know if it's the same with DECSLRM right and left margins and CUF&CUB?
What sort of models are these and could you please provide or link to model code/JSON?
Which version?  In the logs, does it look like PermissionsEx was disabled? Or does AuthMe say it hooked into PermissionsEx before it was enabled?  I'm guessing PermissionsEx had some problem on startup but somehow the server still sent an event that it was enabled, so we think we can work with it 
What about this?  ``` public OrientVertex getVertexByID(String id) {     OrientGraph graph = MyGraphFactorySingleton.getInstance().getGraphInstance();     return graph.getVertex(id); } ```  Do you call the shutdown after read ? 
May be some module that can represent popular modules in the cool way?  I don't really want to hardcode this for every possible object. 
What is your Docker version?

Could you send me a .world file which displays this behaviour when exported? (Let me know exactly which material is missing in the export.) 
Do you see other tags that could surround good text?  If so, we can make this issue a feature request.  As for the title, you should get it already when present.  If you confirm you have some href tags with a title attribute and it does not get picked up, I would consider it a bug and look into it. 
Does it have side effects? What happrns in such a case?
can I close this issue @spinaldf?
Could it be that in your case (terrain, lights) it's the same?
What's the scope for selected credentials ? (System/Global/User ?)

Where is this edit option? Could't find it.
Can you paste some example code to help me reproduce the issue?
What does the code I linked have to do with machines searching for the cleanroom controller?  Seems to me your understanding of it might be backwards, and where is there any requirement for a continuous chain of tile entities connecting the machine to the controller block?
Can you please open a separate bug for this? 
May I ask you to provide a TRACE log?
can you try if you get paste issues in other areas (create offer, offer book filter)?

what  Screenshots?
Can you please create a thread dump and/or use a debugger to investigate this problem further? Thanks!

While these are possible, why on earth would you need them?  I would think when the car is off you wouldn't want any lights on?
Could you reproduce it?
Does it hang? Does it error? Also, do you have any code to share?
can you put your files here so that I can have a look to them? If you don't want to put them here you can send them by email at contact@arnaudguyon.fr  thanks!  Arnaud. 
Maybe this was due to a reload? I don't know, sorry.
Can you share that file?

Could you take a look and confirm that?
Which version of pulsar are you using?

Can you try downloading it as well? (or just install both `buildcraft-7.99.16.jar` and `buildcraft-compat-7.99.16.jar`)  Note that if that works this is *still* a bug, as transport shouldn't have a dependency on silicon

Can you reproduce this behavior with the latest tag?

How often does this happen? Is it reproducible? Two things would be helpful from a debugging perspective:  1. Logs at `DEBUG` or `TRACE` that explain what's happening when the client is trying to reconnect. 2. `tcpdump` data showing us what's happening at a network level.  Thanks!
Can you fix the link to the APK? Or did you mean to link the CameraView official demo?

What kind of system are you running? Is that in the default vanilla launcher? And possibly a mod list would be helpful.
Would you be able to tell the SDK version of Instabug you're using?
What do you get when you run it just in R, not in RStudio?
Did you plan to submit a pull-request with fixes? 
What should be our convention?  I prefer using quotes.
Does it work ok for non-XML documents? In essence no big modifications have been made in the webdav code for a very long time.
Did you enable "Cache CLOB values" option? 
Could you try replicating this with either PEX 1.23.4 or LuckPerms? We can't guarantee consistent behaviour on the PEX version you're using.  In addition, does this occur on [release builds](https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX) on 1.13.2?  ---  #2166 may affect this, but it seems unlikely.
Does the job actually start?
However, we might want to define a (reasonable) default value for it so that we do not need to explicitly set it?
What happens when you uninstall AIMSICD (which is currently required) & install directly from the provided link? 
Would you please mind to explain where `resourceContext` is coming from?
What do you suggest? I'd vote for silently dropping messages with wrong (also legacy) format as if they could not be decrypted.
How is your task and OSS setup? 
Can you try do reproduce it with just these mods on your end?  It could be another mod hooking into item rendering and forgetting to reset some rendering flags.

How shall we change the organise import?

Do we need to reimplement it from scratch?
Could you please zip them and attach them to this issue?
Could you save the book and check in the **allegretto.omr** file (which is just a zip file) what the content of the **book.xml** file is? (it is a very small file, about a dozen of lines, you can post its content on line here). Check the lines dealing with sheet entities and score entities.
Can you post the full stack trace? Do you have a specific device or emulator this happens on?  Thanks!
Maybe it's just a “ vs. " error? Your quotes differ at least in your post...
Which stack hits if access logging is switched off? 
What's the hilly biome? 
whats wrong about it precisely? What did you exactly do and what was meant ot happen? Where was its power coming in from?   This is how it looks to me  ![wat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/621529/54480613-aacba100-47e7-11e9-9442-2d5a95662005.gif) 
Do you have a test case or some code that I can see to reproduce your issue? 
Do you run a local full node in prunded mode? That would be a reason. Bisq require a non-pruned node if local host node is running. Can you post a screenshot of the settings/network screen? Do you have any network restrictions or network problems? Does Tor browser work well?
Can we close it?
Can you share a sample file ?
Can you share the source code of your app?
Can you please check if `C:\Users\vleon\Downloads\quarkus-coding-dojo\graalvm-ce-19.2.1\bin\native-image.cmd` is valid executable?
Can I expect a fix for this in the nearest future? This bug prevents us from moving to Gauge. 
Why this is messy when I open the Travis log?
Do both produce the same results? This unfortunately could also be a DRM thing...
How large of an image display do I have to create for it to create such a lag spike? It might be caused by something specific ImageOnMap does, like adding and removing a lot of entities rapidly.
Which version of minecraft are you using? 
Do you know the feature branch on which this has been implemented? :) 
How did you spot that bug? Seems like `sqlToDottedPath` is only used in unit tests, so I guess it can be removed anyway. 
Why does Grid or DataProvider break down because of it?
What version of EssentialsX are you running? `/ess`
What is your OS? Can you try disabling firewall? When firewall is on, I have the same issues on Ubuntu, since it blocks communications between containers.
What's the content of your Models.java file? They will only be in the same file if all the entities are in the same java package, otherwise you'll have a different Models.java file in the other package. 
Can you provide some lines of code (a test) that I can try on my side or even a more detailed stack trace if you have one? THX in advance

Can you paste your `fml-client-latest.log` to gist and link it here? 
What version of hawtio are you running?  We did add some code to prevent HTML from getting potentially executed, this may have introduced this behavior. 
Can you share the relevant .d file, you will find it in the bazel-out (somewhere like `bazel-out/local-fastbuild/bin/_objs/...`)?
Could you build a self contained piece of code that demonstrates the problem? 
Could you post the 020 migration causing trouble? It's hard to pin point the exact cause without it. 
While running the `./gradlew build` command, does `compileJava` and `checkstyleMain` run and succeed?  Anyway, what are you running `./gradlew build` for? 
Can you please give me the password for the zip file and also the code you used? I have not been able to reproduce this issue with some sample zip files which have directories in it. For me ZipInputStream works fine.
Could your provide a list of your plugins?
Do you have a feed url where the issue occurs so that I can test locally? 
Can you include logs? from %userprofile%/.runelite/logs/application.log
Does this come up in multiple apps obfuscated with the same protector?  Does IDA / dexlib2 / dexdump fail?  Is that method ever called? Honestly, I'm surprised it doesn't fail validation because that `p54870` register index is so high and both it and `p3` are outside of the `registers 2` range.
Could you please try this?
Do they work ok in other launchers that support icon packs?
Would you happen to have any test cases that reproduce the problem? 
What would be the correct order? Method, property then augmentation ?
What do you think? Have you tested applying the CRD with OpenShift 3.11?
Can you please elaborate?  Thanks. 
Could you add some screenshots otherwise?
Do you have more details about your situation?
Could you refresh the tab to check if it helps?
maybe linked to the move from codenvy ci to centos ci @vparfonov  ?
don't you have to add `get = {"is*", "get*"}` to the style? 
Should we instead assign it to all classes if there is no course set in LegionBoard? 
Could you get me something like a twitch launcher export(don't need to make the pack public for that iirc)? Or any other launcher for that matter.
Don't follow, what is the issue? Please the describe the actual vs expected behavior.  Thanks
Would it be possible for you to set `'-Dio.netty.leakDetection.level=advanced'` as described to find the leak please? 
can you try with 7.99.15-pre4? that has improved logging but i suspect this is a case of you having content mods on the client that are not installed on the server (#3990)
Can you reproduce this with just RTG? Because I don't recall seeing anything like this with just RTG, nor RTG in a small mod pack. What biome were you in when that screenshot was taken? Also, it would be nice to see your `fml-client-latest.log` (you provided `latest.log`, which isn't much help :) 
Can you take a pcap of the problem ? Open the sniffer under MitM and record the traffic to a file.  thank you for your support :blush:  
What is your under file system and what was the compute task you ran that result in this error? 
Can you turn up logging to ALL for `org.jenkinsci.plugins.ghprb` and attach that? 
Which javadoc? the ScopeInfo or somewhere else?
How did you stop the server? 
Which variant is that? Could you post your startup log?
How did you trigger the problem?
Maybe we could change the recipe to have at the bottom instead of clay, a bowl? It seems somewhat logical... 
Can you provide code example that causes this error?
What's the expected behavior? From the way it's described it sounds like the SDK is behaving appropriately. I.E. your source input stream does not support mark/reset so the SDK can't reset it on a retry. 
Shouldn't it have been removed already? 
Maybe you can open a new issue at the deck server repository?
Does it also happen with the rust version?  Possibly related to https://github.com/Genymobile/gnirehtet/issues/136.

Can you find the exact search that produced this, and include the URL here? I'll have a hard time reproducing the issue and debugging without it.
Could you give some examples of what you'd like to use the custom analyzer for? 
Should I submit this issue to htsjdk? Thank you. 
What do you mean you have to throw the eggs to collect the dye?  disabling the throwing is meant to make players have to use Hatchery's "Nest" to hatch chickens. 
Can you post a logcat? Maybe this helps to figure it out. 
Did MyWarp run on this server before?  Does MyWarp's plugin-folder exist and are there any files within it? 
What if a server operator doesn't want to use ProtocolLib? Just tried with a plain server and AuthMe, this error will occur. Now we are dependent on another plugin.  
Can you confirm that this only happens when only ic2 is installed without TR or other mods being in the pack?
Do you know if the auth.statusChange event is firing? 
Would it make sense for `syndesis minishift --install` to set this up by default perhaps?
Which version are you using? 
Would you be able to collect the adb logs of a debug build I'd send you?
Will you be able to retest? 
Shouldn't the PS3eye initialization method in Main.start() call CameraFactory.registerCamera? That would solve the problem and it's what the registerCamera method is for. 
Does this also happen with an older distribution?   Can you attach the log output for the run which failed? There might be a locale issue with the input VCF perhaps?
Did the paste result in the addition of imports?  Did it result in reformatting of the pasted code (addition/removal of ws)? 
what version? 
Did you experience any problem with 2.2? 
Could you check Error Log for any errors regarding connection save/load? 
Could you please check that the new option "Camera folder" in ownCloud settings is pointing to the location where your camera app stores pictures?  Thanks. 
Can you post the output of  `$gpg ~/.kontalk/kontalk-public.asc` ? Should look like this (cut the address for privacy):  ``` pub  rsa2048/4C3668B1 2015-01-06 uid                            Alex_tigase (NO COMMENT) <374b04dfa548f8b79....@beta.kontalk.net> sub  rsa2048/346A72E2 2015-01-06 ```

Should I detect this problem at kompile time or just give a better error message at runtime? 
What server version are you running?
Could you post the stack trace place? :) 
What was the previous version?
Can you attach log? 
Could you link the plugin? And I doubt we'll hook it because that sounds like something outside of the scope of this project.  
Should I correct it for that?  Also, I am still getting SHA1 errors on JS language module - it may be related to Windows. 
Would that be worth it?
Did you update extra spells? if not, the update can be found here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-spells-electroblobs-wizardry/files/2700768
Can you tell me a bit about what you're using it for?  This is an internal method so I'm a little hesitant to promote it's usage too much.
Where exactly did you see it?
How comes no one ever noticed that before? Then again, I pretty much never set my machine's top side to 'disabled' while powering it from below trough blocks... 
Could you report the output of `ls -l tools/PetrifyTools/` command in your Workcraft directory please? 
Can you confirm that the config value is declared as an integer and not as a decimal? I would have thought that [this test](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome/pull/1423/files#diff-5e38bc0bc2283f77cf75e3a4d2bb168aR52) covers your use case - I fully agree that if you compare it against -2, it should be true. @sjka Could you have a look, please? 
Could you do that instead?
Do you have a Haste sigil on? It provides an increase to your jump too. 
Maybe even specific to `uic`?  Re: new session -- it could indeed be related. It looks like `RPATH` takes precedence over `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, but `RUNPATH` doesn't, and the problem observed in that case was caused by system Qt 5 libraries in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` taking precedence over the paths baked into the binaries. 
Can you show again what exactly introduced that change?
Can you post the log? 
Why don't you attach it to this issue? 
Does this occur everytime you kill a Advanced Vampire or only sometimes and does it only happen with advanced vampires or also with normal vampires or even hunters? Thank You 
Maybe this is coming from Android6?
Would this not work for you @kothar?

Why not make the columns that are visible be the fields in the preview objects? We return a set number of them, so iterating through them and picking out the unique field names seems more reliable. 
Why would it make sense to let all pedestrian go through private roads? 
What do you mean? What positions would we be looking at after the last move? 
What do you mean by "off the map"? As in not on route? That happens because of zoom levels. As you zoom in closer it eventually gets back on route. Also, buses don't broadcast their location accurately in downtown so they look like they're inside buildings sometimes. 
When you say "both crash" does that mean that they crash when both are installed, or each one individually crashes? Also please include your version of forge.
What machine? Does right-clicking the machine make the item go in, or is there a GUI? If the latter, use an item exporter instead of a player simulator.
Can you solve this? 
why it is 2 when cycle is 1?
Do you have a specific use case why it would be necessary, or was this just confusion about why it doesn't work? Just move your mock to `setup` and everything should work fine.
How are we supposed to connect the two? Again, I'm not saying this is not the problem, but I'm not following the logic here.

Can I have a copy of the config that caused this? 
Do you perhaps have CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR exported? 
Why do you want to use endpoint name as registration Id ? and why is it a problem to register ? 
What database type are you using? I may need a copy...
Could you provide a PDF that leads to the error on your machine?
Can you show me a small example that demonstrates the problem you're having? Also, what version of the library are you using? 
what's method? can provide a demo module?

What version are you using? 
can you try on the 1.0.3 please ?
What was the last build you were on where it worked?  Is it still broken in latest? 
Can you give an example please? This will help to figure out what's going on..  > how to deal with fields residing in object that are inside a collection, that i'm trying to populate?  Not sure I understand this point, do you mean fields that are of collection type? 
does it happen with any process?
When exactly do you see this error? Try to uninstall DBeaver completely (or remove DBeaver directory if you use portable version) and then install it again.
Can you expound on that? 
Can you provide a screenshot, and repository link, so i can test it? Thanks 
Would you like to install the latest Che 7 where we use Theia as IDE? (in such case you need to run some k8s or OpenShift cluster, for as easier options to try may be minikube or minishift)

Can I make those changes on that branch now or is there still release work ongoing on that branch? 
Do you have a configuration that reliably reproduces this problem? and could you describe your environment?  If we can reliably reproduce the issue, then we should be able to fix it.
Which scenario needs to use hessian1? Please tell me which version you are using.

Would you mind sharing your default encoding and OS? To find your default encoding quickly, you can run `java -XshowSettings` in your system console and it will be listed as `file.encoding` near the top.  I should hopefully be able to fix this by making it explicitly write the files as UTF-8.
Where and how are you using RotateImageTransform in your code?
Could you also try to explicitly set a region like `"region": "us-west"`? 
How are we supposed to know otherwise if the paintbrush does anything on a given block? 
Should there be an option to add to the "Configure operations for widget" an operation that already appears there (I think we shouldn't allow that)? because currently it let's me do it and then the operation doesn't work properly- pressing on enable operation for it does nothing. @yuvalsimon 
What exactly does "break Scoreboards" mean to you? What is broken?
Can you create a repo with a failing test? That will be really helpful. 
Do you have YourKit to profile it ? 
Does a save/load fix this or no? 
Could you do some research on where the GUI is created and filled and see which methods are responsible for generating the UI? That would facilitate looking for the differences between the pre- and post-Soot APKs a lot. I'm currently on holidays, but I'll have a look when I'm back in the office. 
What platform are you on? Looks like a bug in the git hook script, more specifically [here](https://github.com/Darkyenus/DarkyenusTimeTracker/blob/master/resources/hooks/prepare-commit-msg#L52).

Do you have this issue with other video podcasts, or is it in particular with this one? 
Can you post a sample DDL? 
Can you check whether this still occurs with Flyway 4.0? 
Does this imply that only the display is wrong, but the info is still there (everything appears again after kill and restart of c:geo)? Can we know if full details were sent back from gc.com (debug-log)? 
What in your opinion should it be like otherwise? @treba123  
Did you render the document prior to trying to publish it?
What does this error mean to you? Is only the tree affected, or is BootsFaces broken altogether on Java 6 and 7? 
Where is that configuration stored? My blocks don't lose their NBT when converting to a Multipart. Then again, they are mostly cables which don't store a lot of data/do very much
Could you elaborate on what the conflicted files look like? Are they just normal files? Or are they 0 bytes files, which were originally folders, or something weird like that? 
What version of forge are you on?
Would you like to provide a fix for this issue?
should be up and running again, can you confirm?
Shouldn't the Debian package create that?

What URL did you enter? Was it https?
Do we need to fix this for 1.1.0? Is it a blocker? 
What is the value of `getOption("viewer")` in your session?
Do you happen to know the size of the file that it failed on?  If you re-run with -X it should log the path of the file before the exception. 
Do yo remember if you triggered some searches before getting it ?  Could you send a bug report asap if you reproduce it ? I don't find the way to have it except if the server sent them out of order (but the android could have an issue too). 
Could you debug on your own network what would be the correct working url?  It looks like the problem lies with the username password, I've added them in front of the url, but I think it should also be replaced at #USERNAME right? 
Could you try with the "user-specific dirctory"?  The storage of the group structure has changed since version 3.4 (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1276). It still has some issues (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1495), but works well in other regards. 
Will have a think still - do you know if anyone else is getting this issue?
Did EvoSuite fail to find it automatically?  When you write:  `-Dtools_jar_location="tools.jar"`  I assume you do not use the string "tools.jar", but the actual absolute path to its location?  which version of Windows and JDK are you using?  
Can you guys check this out?
Do you use any Plugins? Is this CrossWalk or WebView?
Can anyone else replicate this?
Could you recheck your steps, mb something you are doing but not mentioning triggers this bug? 
Does YourkitProfiler instrument class files on disk?
Can you explain what happens when you put in a vanilla ore, does it happen for all vanilla ores? Try making a creative world and try every ore.  No matter what the problem is, it must be relater to the pack and not Ender IO itself. 
Do you have a sample application somewhere? 
How can you debug anything with only half the stacktrace anyway?  _Most of the time_ the top of the trace is all that's necessary _(kind of how like IntelliJ truncates unnecessary lines in it's traces in console)_

Do you use Jenkins GIT plugin? Or do you have a "free style" job with a custom build script where you do something like "git clone ..."?  The second one will likely give this problem. 
Can you edit the workspace? What do you mean by repository? I assumed you meant different team projects in the same Collection. All of the sources in a particular workspace have to come from the same collection. Perhaps a few screenshots would help me understand your scenario better. Thanks, Jason

Could you post table(s) DDL to reproduce this?
What version of the idea-doT plugin do you have?  
Can you try again using Druid 0.6.150? 
Can you see which connections these are? To which endpoint?  @nextcloud/server-triage have you heard something similar? Mostly we use dav endpoints on server and they return always a proper message back, which then *should* lead to closing the connection, or?
Which watchface/watchapp are you trying to configure? Is the experimental support for background js enabled?
Can you edit the above to use fully package qualified names? That might make this clearer.
What kind of phone do you use?  Best wishes

Can the issue be closed?
What export format do you use?
Can you post (or email to me) the file `<glowroot dir>/tmp/preload-some-super-types-cache`?  In the meantime, the problem looks like it was caused by 6fb2204d4c4c0337ed910d46df6649dd8de641aa (which was introduced in 0.13.1), so you should be ok for now if you downgrade the agent to 0.13.0.  Thanks, Trask 
Did you mean "undo"? 
Could you provide a couple of PDFs we can test with?
Did we break this just recently with the big chunk refactor or just make it worse? Sounds like the kind of thing that's also keeping the headless worlds from saving correctly.

Did you update recently? It's probably broken since https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/507b00f7ec3145e817b200db571b8bd93b40c330.   Try using `useDefaultSemantics()` instead of `setSemantics()`. It's probably better than making skylark_semantics public (unless someone needs it).
What is the output of `bazel version`?
Can you send us the device make and model, Android OS version, and log output? 
Might be the same cause as #37?

Can you check what I have? 
What makes you think it is an issue with  RL?  Either way this isn't going to be a runelite issue. I've had issues before with static buildup in my wireless mice where it would drop inputs and cause doubleclicks. Possibly look into that.

Could you write the Figure term to file and attach it here? Then I could try and reproduce the bug on my own machine. 
Would it not be better to detect invalid values and change them than to rename the properties? You run the risk of corrupting even worlds that aren't using invalid IDs. 
Would you be able to maybe post a screen shot of the set up or, even better, make a simple case I can easily replicate that has the issue?

What is your use case? 
Could you verify this?
Can you reproduce this with forge 1715 or higher? 
Do you mean column list?  It is not visible because dialog has too small size. DBeaver remembers dialog size from previous usage and sometimes it is too small. We must set its size to fit all contents at least. Thank you for the bug report.  Workaround: resize dialog manually (using mouse).
Can you try deleting project in the terminal?

Can you provide any more detailed logs? I can't seem to find any change that should be causing that . .  
What Linux distribution are you using?
Does this make sense to also backport to the 3.0 line? I assume that this code doesn't change very often so the same bug would exist there? 
What issue do you have with making plots? Would really help having a few more programmers to work on this as we do have ~7 more projects planned for the future.

What container is this? Tomcat has a `checkThatConnectorsHaveStarted` and an log of the allocated port "Tomcat started on port(s):".  All this happens before `refresh` completes.  Maybe @wilkinsona has an idea? 
What's the status of this issue? I face the exact same problem. You can easily reproduce it using the below trivial code:     public void func1() throws Exception {         throw new Exception("Bla Bla...");     }          public void func2() {         try {             func1();         }catch(Exception je) {             Log.p(je.toString());         }     }  Now simply call func2()

Did you make it fun?  
Could you be that person?
Can you find out from the log which loan it was trying to invest into at that moment? This error message is saying that there was no *loan name* on the loan, and that just sounds like nonsense.

Maybe the keys could be stored inside the address book record of android? That way they would be automatically synced with other devices as well... Of course one could also use a pgp keyring app, but I think that might confuse users...

Can you provide a log as described [here](https://github.com/Mishiranu/Dashchan/wiki/Home-EN#the-app-crashes)?
Maybe you can test them? 
Do we need to rename the files ?  Because if this is an url issue, we probably could just encode the url, but not rename the file (I assume altering the original file can be problematic). 
Could you link the plugin? And I doubt we'll hook it because that sounds like something outside of the scope of this project.

What did you enter when you created the webcam? Make sure you don't have a trailing slash when creating the camera's IP address. We automatically append `/mjpg/video.mjpg` to the end of the URL if you don't do it. Alternatively, try using the address `10.17.36.12/mjpg/video.mjpg` and see if that works. 
What version? The mode change was really bad up until ~785? I think?  e: A screenshot of the 'bad' way of looking at it would be a huge help.

What client are you using? Can you add torrents manually via .torrent or .magnet link or by uploading ('opening' with transdroid) a local .torrent file? 
Did you try re-downloading it to exclude any possible corruption of the jar?  Other than that would this be an issue that @lucko needs to look into.

Can you describe these pages? There is no new config page in the app, so this happens in the browser? Does this mean that the browser does not open the app, but redirects to another page?  > oauth approval page  What is this page?  Maybe some screenshots can help clarify the issue.

Can you please tell us what's causing this? From that warning I'd say you're trying to make a NPC inventory of an invalid size. If I'm not mistaken, inventories must have sizes that are a multiple of 9. So 27 works, but 30 doesn't.

Could you show one screenshot showing both of them as part of the same network?  What happens when you reset the network (=add+remove a random cable)?
Why would it _not_ be able to contain "string" properties?  I think what you're saying is that your business logic dictates that PagedData<ShopDTO> will _only_ contain `ShopDTO` elements. But there's no way for Enunciate to determine that at compile-time.

Would you please help provided a detailed steps to reproduce this? 
Can you provide more information to help repro?  I'd like to know in particular the dependency of your project, if possible, and how often you see this error. It is not clear to me why `ThreadFactoryBuilder` will end up using `VmRequestThreadFactory`.

Could you decompile your Kotlin file with `fun createFitnessTrackerManager()` method into Java and share it? I am particularly interested in how Kotlin generates Java code for the method. Then I will create a test which exactly reproduces the issue to narrow it down.
Did you start a previous version (0.7.0 or 0.8.0) of the exporter before?   Currently, the exporter has no database update mechanism. So the table is not updated if you start a new version. You need to update the database manually or remove it ;)

Does it keep working even if you wait long? I cannot reproduce that problem. Very strange... 
Can you tell me what should happen after the spec gets edited? Should we call the same API we call when creating an API Provider based integration to get the integration object back? If yes, does it mean that the previous integration will effectively be discarded, with all its changes?

Where does this come from? There is no org.digitalcampus.oppia.task.CourseSizeTask class in the project, neither any cast to String in the adapter method. I guess this does not apply to the current version. 
Can you grab a profile? There are some instructions here: https://perf-html.io/docs/#/./guide-remote-profiling  I'm not sure how to enable the devtools from FxR, but maybe @larsbergstrom or @bluemarvin can help with that. I think it's in the settings?

What IDE, Version and OS are you running?  The plugin does not handle the rendering or clipping of the tooltip. I will try to duplicate this because on my dev system it always displays the full multiline tooltip.
What build were you running before you updated (so I can figure out exactly which commit caused this)?  I have a pretty good idea what's doing it, meaning I'll have to implement some way of storing Pets using normal NBT data.  EDIT: Is it just Spigot that is causing this? 
How reproducible is the crash? 3. Is it device specific? 4. Can you reproduce this using `voice-quickstart-android`? 5. Does `CallInvite.reject()` work when you don't have a cellular call? 6. Is this reproducible using beta17?  Thanks.
How would you like to go on this one? We don't have anything saved on the server related to checklist right now. It's just a local database.

Could you post the crash report please?
Should this perhaps be a list instead?
Could you please be more specific with the error/context? Having several constants in the same interface is totally fine with JSweet AFAIK, and I have just added a [test](https://github.com/cincheo/jsweet/commit/ca9dfef10e4f51f9bfe15e05ca5cd004de642d2a) to make sure it works (it passes).

Do you want to remove the second instance check and submit a PR? 
What mod version are you using? 
What do you mean? 
Can you try putting in an absolute folder instead of the relative path?  I am wondering if that is the root cause.  Also - just to start, can you do the docker run syntax without compose to see if the same error exists?
What did you do to get the above log? 
Does build 21 work? Or 20? Or 19?
What operating system are you testing on?  Does it occur on more than one?  One possibility is that it's a build issue for one platform, but I'll need to dig in more to figure out what's going on.

What is your project configuration?  (We look for haxelibs differently depending upon your compile settings.)   We've actually got code in there to find your haxelibs and put  them in the project for you.  It has a few issues, mostly with being overly aggressive.
Does it also happen with HEE alone, were you playing on a server and is that log client-side? I think I fixed it now, but it'd be nice to have more input to know exactly what caused it, instead of guessing. 
Maybe we also should _not_ expose `getAggregation` methods on a bucketing aggregation because it does not make sense (and I doubt it's valid on ES side)? Then there would also be no point for a bucketing aggr to extend the `Aggregation` class... am I missing something? 
Can you add more of a description as to -what- fails?

Did PR #1158 resolve this issue?
Do you have it downloaded and deployed maybe?  Are you saying you modified your build or your cluster? You shouldn't have to do either. What did you change? I am concerned this could have caused the problems.  The rest could be a knock-on problem from having mismatched Kafka versions.
