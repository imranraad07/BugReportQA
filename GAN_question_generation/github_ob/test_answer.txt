bechyňská smoleč is corrupted too  my mistake 
sure     i've not been able to reproduce this with what i posted above or below  i tried restarting the client multiple times  restarting my pc and putting it in sleep mode while the notes were in place 
no clue  i have heard of some random render issues in the over world  other than this i only see this issue on space stations  and only in unlit areas

ah  i see  does it really look that asymmetrical to have it on the top left  i guess we can leave it for the time being  and change in the future if users complain  maybe it is just me who always accidentally rotates maps    
it happens every time and is followed by an endless loop of
it shouldn't   the sc plugin uses native libraries   dll  and  dylib    which are loaded in the  stark  class  dependencies on plugin   the stranger thing is that it is not working in both systems  windows   macos  
yes  when that player died  this error was in console  also how do i reverse the stack on that player 
i will get back to you about this   i have this issue with multiple devices  it has been there since i started testing st for android for couple months   thanks
yes but it will always return an ender io bucket regardless of the inputted item  in this case its a wooden bucket but is returning an ender io iron bucket full of fluid 
i agree with you something strange happened  i will investigate this deeply later  maybe we are in the case we have an ongoing handshake with read epoch   1  just after the change cipher spec  and so no established session     so we have an ongoing handshake bu read epoch is not equal to record epoch   but in all case  i think this code should be as robust as possible  and any client_hello with epoch  0 should restart an handshake  this will avoid any blocking state 
linear but i do not think it matters as i observed problems regardless of the number of hardware cycles 
the setup is a bit involved so i can get back to you on that if the dumps are insufficient   i've shared three dumps that occurred while using graalvm to run a jruby on rails benchmark  https   drive google com drive folders 11etzojvv2vl9e_wcwtaoz3ffqsjtssvp usp sharing
no  pimotte 'sy up   no resume' does give the same error so does not help  i will email the log files to  binwiederhier
i found the issue and yes its not a bug from the addon  i used  ui getcurrent   navigate       in my login view to navigate to the main ui after login  inspecting google chromes network tab showed  that the styles of the addon are loaded after the dom loading is already done  i could fix that behaviour by using  ui getcurrent   getpage   setlocation       but i'm not sure if that is the desired usage of vaadin's navigation  thank you for the quick reply 
placed a schematic  left it there and did some other stuff  then boom
for me it looks like another type of error then test failure   testgetfilenamewithrewriting net pms util fileutiltest   time elapsed  0 005 sec      error  java lang nullpointerexception  null     at net pms util fileutil getfilenamewithrewriting fileutil java 225      at net pms util fileutiltest testgetfilenamewithrewriting fileutiltest java 82 
an additional option is to queue up the refs to be deleted and send them later on the same thread 
ok  i tried that  including timings for the gc  it holds a lot longer  but still dies in the end     however  that’s when the thread died  i don’t know why

it won't double it since tmaster only runs on 1 node  so it would add 1 1 with the number of topologies we run  which is insignificant   we use a watch on statemanger for the packing plan for a couple of reasons    the executors need the packing plan and doing rpc with them isn't practical due to their lifecycle  following the same patter for the tmaster is consistent    the initial deployment should be able to proceed without a requirement that the deploying user  where the scheduler as a library might run  maintains a connection to the topology for the entire startup phase  so the client puts some state in statemanager and if that succeeds it launches the aurora containers and it's done  from then on the topology can initialize itself  we don't want the production topology to have a dep on the users client  which scheduler   tmaster rpc would require 
if i remember correctly the main problem was that there was use on a stack variable after it went out of scope   these functions are where it occurred   5  rulecontext  parserrulecontext  addchild rulecontext  ruleinvocation    children push_back ruleinvocation   return ruleinvocation     6  void parser  unrollrecursioncontexts parserrulecontext  parentctx    _precedencestack pop_back    _ctx  stop   _input  lt  1   parserrulecontext  retctx   _ctx     save current ctx  return value      unroll so ctx is as it was before call to recursive method if  _parselisteners size     0    while  _ctx    parentctx    triggerexitruleevent    _ctx   dynamic_cast parserrulecontext    _ctx  parent       else   _ctx   parentctx        hook into tree retctx  parent   parentctx   if  _buildparsetrees    parentctx    nullptr       add return ctx into invoking rule's tree parentctx  addchild retctx        i believe somehow child went out of scope during the recursion process

thanks for the quick reply  and ha  i figured you'd ask  we definitely want to use the 'native' options in unirest over a custom client if we can  as far as i can recall  when we last looked at doing this  there were several options that unirest didn't support  below i've done my best to recall the options we need and look up their current support status  but there may be one or two i'm missing  feel free to correct me on the support status as needed     user agent string  supported via  setdefaultheader    or  adddefaultheader      connect timeout  supported via  connecttimeout      socket timeout  supported via  sockettimeout      max connections  supported via  concurrency      max connections per route  supported via  concurrency      disable redirect handling  supported via  followredirects      redirect strategy  unsupported  although this may not be needed    allow use of java system properties  supported via  usesystemproperties      disable tls validation  supported via  verifyssl     looks like the unirest implementation  may  work  but we'll need to test   we also explicitly define a default  socketconfig  with the socket timeout we want  in addition to the default  requestconfig   due to some historical bugs in the http client library  i suppose we could reassess if this is needed  but i know it was an issue in the past   overall  it's looking like much of what we need is covered by unirest  so i think i'll give it a spin and test things out 
i'm unable to reproduce the error myself  but have asked the user to try to narrow down the error by creating a short note and long note and try to cause the error to happen

thanks for taking a look  kevinushey     here is the sm package and my test package if it helps at all   sm packages zip  https   github com rstudio rstudio files 2746314 sm packages zip   also  when testing again  the first build would succeed  then after editing the  sm_fail    function  the error occurred on the next build 
also i think refresh time probably should be calculated based on ttl instead of lease duration  or creation_ttl    for example  if you create a token using     the ttl value is always decreasing  it shows the current ttl remaining  whereas creation_ttl  also called lease_duration in the unwrap response  is always the same   refresh time calculated based on lease_duration can be off by a lot if the token was not used immediately after it was created  so i think using ttl is a better idea    this may require an additional call to the token lookup api because ttl is not part of the unwrap response

there was a log for just one day on one of the phones   just to be clear  there are logs both before and after that three day period  for example  there were logs for yesterday  only the logs for those three days are missing  the phones were not restarted during this whole period as they were on charging  also  all three phones are password and fingerprint protected

 bananeweizen  i agree  that this oom is basically the same memory leak as mentioned in #3778  shall we close this issue then 
ideally no  but there are currently bugs in exectuion that can lead to uncaught exceptions  this isn't about helping normal users  it's to help us develop k itself   for example  if you check out 182cbfa5e35014827fa7d5d2e6e08d8bdf58e54f  go into tutorial 1_k 4_imp++ lesson_8 and run    after that  krun has quit  here it's not so bad because it's on the first step  but if it happens after hundreds of steps or at the end of execution it's pretty annoying to make multiple runs narrowing down the number of successfully taken steps to see the preceding state

the uninstall or reset all app data via appmanager in the android settings  or wait three days   the important thing is that between the first and the second part of the sequence you don't use the same caches  or clean the cache cache   or simply only fo the second part of the sequence after a reinstall 
hm  now i don't quite understand how this should work  1   enable authentication for  project endpoint  is on 1  i have gitlab repo  https   my_gitlab com jenkins_sandbox user webhook test    1  next i create multibranch project at my jenkins  http   my_jenkins com 8008 job test_webhooks_project   in project configuration i add git source specified above  1  after that  i add webhook to gitlab repo  without any jenkins user or api key   http   my_jenkins com 8080 project test_webhooks_project  1   test  button return status 200  but not trigger jenkins project  any push to repo also return 200  but jenkins project is triggered and started   so authorization doesn't required  or i did something wrong   thank you   p s  maybe it is ok  i don't found any way to trigger project by webhook in repo that not speficied in project's settings  i mean that if my jenkins project uses gitlab_repo_1  and i set up webhook to this project in gitlab_repo_2  then project not triggers  so if project can be runned just by repos specified in project config  then i think this is enough for security  unauthorized users can't create and modify projects

thank you  jmcphers   i can confirm that str x  does increase reference count   a bit unexpected to be honest  not sure whether that is intentional   at the moment  i have not yet installed rstudio 1 2  since the compiled version is not yet listed  will try that later 
hi hunterness   i tested with the new neo4j java driver 1 7 2 and the issue hasn't come resurfaced so i'm going to close the issue  thx
photos likely won't help but i will provide more detail to better explain the issue   query produced integer fields displayed in data editors  by default  appear as "grouped"  e g "1000" is displayed as "1 000"  there is a checkbox option in preferences  data editor  data formats preference panel titled "use grouping" that toggles between displaying the comma or not   if a data editor is already displaying an integer  and the checkbox state is changed  even if the change is "applied"  the current data editor integer display will not be changed to respect the new "use grouping" setting  this means that if the editor is displaying "1 000"  and the checkbox is cleared in the preference  the editor will continue to display "1 000"  to effect the change  the editor must be closed and reopened  and then the effect will take place  and the integer will now be displayed as "1000"   i hope that provides enough detail

 koppor  thank you for your reply  concerning "user specific file directory" i will reply to that tomorrow  when i have multiple users in the database environment  we have a common user logging in the database  so the general directory was false  definitely the documentation needs more clarification  concerning the groups i will put my two cents in #1495  since in a shared database things are missing 
 task  has not a no arg constructor defined and is included as a library in my application   i cannot add a no arg constructor    the following class is   not   defined in my main application but in a library which i use  the library uses jackson but my main application uses json b  by the way  the library creates instances of  task class  from json under the hood  but i do   not   generate these instances directly from my application code   it is created by the library    hence  my application code  except the library which i use  does not make use of the jackson annotations in any way 
i am  so  sorry i haven't had a chance to check this out  i don't think i can do it on the boxes where i'm using it "in anger"  but i will try and at least spin up a nano or something with a similar config and give it a quick whirl

i have the latest railcraft installed with the world gen module disabled  i haven't tested whether chunk generation works  but any of the debugging commands do not work  the workaround i currently use is to disable cog's railcraft module outright since i don't want any railcraft worldgen anyway 
it started a long time ago but just now finally narrowed it down to what the issue was   i had avoided the issue by looping things differently in past   but i would say i first ran into the issue at least a year ago but it may be older than that

i have to sheepishly admit i haven't written libgdx unit tests before  i've been needing to get around to doing it for my own project anyway so i guess now's the time to figure that out  p  through some further testing i can confirm this only occurs with the pooledengine  i have reverted back to engine and created my own 'create' methods as such  so as not to break the rest of my code in the mean while  that just return new instances          and everything is happy  this at least narrows it down specifically to the reuse of entities in the pooledengine

 yegor256 can't we use  pmo  for that  we can update it's balance on each zerocracy fee for closing task and then send bonuses  also we're using  fkproject  to pay debts   it looks not correct  maybe it would be better to send transaction from one project to  pmo  on new debt and then pay debts from  pmo

the  idatabaseconnector  and  iconnectionservice  interfaces of the  com nextep designer installer  plugin were not consistent with the corresponding interfaces of the  com nextep designer core  plugin in terms of thrown exceptions  so i changed the  idatabaseconnector  and  iconnectionservice  interfaces of the  com nextep designer installer  plugin to throw  sqlexception  exceptions instead of  installerexception   which is besides more logical too   connection failure to the repository database is now correctly detected again

nope  sorry  nothing at all  it was one of the first things i've tried but i forgot to mention it   i still blame the native packager  though  since i can reproduce the issue at any time i'd be happy to look into it  but i don't know a thing about native packaging nor javafx  any keywords you might suggest i look into 
the reference to the topic  which is named for example 'iris10 20  dita'  in the dita map is correct and it looks like this             topicref href "topics flowers iris10 20 25 dita"  
no  not reproducable with either tpch  nor mysql connector   problem is with hive it seems 
as said before  it's not bothering me in any way  i just wanted to share it with you 
i tend to prefer  xcollection    over  collection    whenever i know that the relevant documents can't be in subcollections  so i do not have to bother about whether subcollections are actually present or not  defensive programming against changes in the database layout     it is not relevant for the bug  though  the error is triggered with  collection    as well as with  xcollection    
i can get a bit further with 4 7 2  but that can't deal with "auto" i've also 4 9 1  but this requires a newer libc  when that's in the ld path the sun jdk malfunctions  deadlocking on a futex  the build then doesn't get any further than the exec   out to "java  verson"  wrappering that out then leads to the lib abi compatibility  problem resurfacing when the java code tries to dlopen whatever naive code dso the bazel build has made    i've also the intel compilers  but you'll see that's not without it own set of issues 
this was 9 6 0 
no  i dont't  but i receive a lot of reports  up to 10 s  and a lot of them with the same cause  maybe it's timing or threading problem  in my database i have 4 entries with same stacktrace text  same version_code and version_name but different bug_id  and id  
i think he maybe closed this as i accidentally submitted instead of putting "enter" when just entering the ticket initially    so it was no where near complete  but probably left it closed since it's technically a duplicate of #104  not at all the same behavior    but i guess the same error   that one is closed as he keeps thinking he's fixed it

to return pending transaction  its need only database  as any valid user connected will be owner or super user  i dont see there are any case of using multiple user with same database  so this query will work nice to rollback transaction for owner or super user of postgres database 
my mistake  i am confused  normaly those issues in the conversation are listed as issues here in github  and resolved in commits  but commits and open issues didn't list it  it's a philosophical question  keep up the good work    
i'll try again  but it blows up trying to install       image  https   user images githubusercontent com 20825058 63969450 be498c00 ca56 11e9 8992 f0ae693aa836 png   lol  scrap that     i had dbeaver running in another virtual desktop     however  while i am an idiot  your installer should be smart enough to detect that and tell me  "hey  idiot  you have an instance running  shut it down before installing   "  paraphrasing of course 
hello ！ schematron is   thank you very much
adb logs as soon as i can reliably recreate the issue  it's sporadic
actually  the cleanup method is called twice from different threads when running in local mode  one does not have the output stream initialized  cf  log output with the null check applied 
 zolotov i have it installed 
i'll check that  thank you

ok i think i have narrowed down the bug  due to the convoluted nature of what i built it was not easy to follow  even for me  but i managed to deduce it to a smaller pattern between refined storage and storage drawers  i have an interface block that my machines pipe into via ender io  and i have an external storage connected to a drawer controller master than has four 2x2 drawers on it  two are for ores two are for dusts  if i add a dust to the system via a grid it does into the drawers correctly  if i add a single dust via the import row of the interface it goes in correctly  however  if i put two dusts in there three end up in the drawer  3 will end up with 6  4 ends up 10  etc  i was clearing the drawer between each test   also if i add a stack upgrade to the interface  there is no problem  so i think it has to do with the interface importing and how it exports to  the drawer network    i am going to submit over a rs also and reference this issue  though i think it may just be an rs issue 
hi vlad   interesting  i just did several tests with a remote machine node which does not have any source and using the otp debugger i can attach  step  break  etc  however  i noticed that it doesn't work unless i have loaded the module into the vm on the remote node _before_ starting the debugger and doing module  interpret     a little background  my application is that i am developing small embedded computers which run erlang and which have very constrained memory  i am very impressed with erlide and it looks like an ideal way to develop application code for these remote devices    hence my series of experiments with trying to get debugging working   thanks  devin
wow thanks for your fast respond  its happened on client  i think the problem is with the multiple files upload  because when i changed the variable to false  the file upload did working  but only for single image    or maybe i need to setup something else  cause when i tried to upload 3 files  in my laptop browser  its a web after all   it doesnt seems to have any trouble
 spencergibb this is netty api  for example when reactor netty buffers the incoming content it does the following  https   github com reactor reactor netty blob 0 7 x src main java reactor ipc netty channel fluxreceive java#l319 l327  if the buffered content is not released then the following stack trace will be provided by netty

thank you  xinyuan liu  the problem was related to java  actually  i had installed java  nonetheless  i had not set java_home  i think it makes sense to note that users should set java_home before using the tool 
well  the game starts up fine then when i go to load the world it pops up the with screen saying "loading world" and it goes to a black screen after 30 seconds as if the world is ready to load then crashes

dita ot 2 5 2 but probably older versions have the same problem  i'm not sure how this usually works when running the dita ot integrator from the command line using the "dita  install"  possibly because my dita ot is installed in a folder which has french accents    we run our automated tests in such a folder

i already knew that  doesn't item getitemfromblock block  do the same thing   anyways  changing it from that to  new itemstack block   getitem    since you need the item and not the itemstack  right   doesn't seem to help     is there any reason why calling ignorenbttags would cause it to work with the getnbt method  but not with using the + to craft   i've tried debugging by creating an identical itemstack to the one i'm having trouble with  and then calling getnbt on it  and it seems to be ignoring the correct nbt tags  while the in game + feature seems to be having trouble   actually  now that i've checked  it doesn't seem to be working for items  either   i've been looking through your code  is isidentical in stackhelper supposed to use itemstack areitemstacktagsequal   shouldn't it be filtered through getnbt

inconsistent but mostly seems to slow down  all id elements are set to 1tick rates but extraction often slows down to once per second  this also happens a lot while inside a compact machine with the item storage claimed via ftb utils and chunkloaded via chickenchunks   since most inputs are always on farms i cannot easily tell the difference between  5s tick rates and a full stop  will try to test in creative with vanilla nether portals     edit    tested a bit in creative with the same modpack and could not get a full stop  so it might be a severe slowdown due to the increased load of my "main" world  i _did_ catch the transient end of a slowdown though  the id transfer system appears to be working at a significantly slower rate while i am in a different dimension despite being chunkloaded   my test setup consists of a series of te ducts drawing from an infinite item source into a chest  here  aa large crate  vanilla chest works too   from there id transfers to a second chest  which is much faster than the ducts while observed directly  the second chest is then emptied into a trash can by a larger number of ducts such that the second chest is always almost empty   i then enter a nether portal behind me  wait a while in the nether  then go back through the portal and immediately open the first  id "input"  chest  depending on loading times and waiting time in the nether the chest will contain a significant number of item stacks  which are promptly drained into the second chest and removed as the system picks up speed again once i am in the overworld  i have also observed this behaviour with the ender chests in my compact machines   test setup    2018 02 27_17 21 05  https   user images githubusercontent com 22204328 36743800 75603608 1beb 11e8 8a85 3dcb55061753 png

my dpi is 440  update  excuse me  i just looked up my smallest width in developer options and it says 392  so i changed it to 400 and everything is alright now

no  it does not go away  i don't have the device with me  so i cannot cite the error msg  but it was samething like "attachment      cache     does not exist"   to check it yourself  you could try disabling your internet  sharing a file with blitzmail   stopping blitzmail  and cleaning its cache  starting blitzmail and internet  and you should get the error   thanks and greetings

the result is not checked for signing key e g   after injecting the key no exception occured and everything worked well  of course  the issue is for communication requiring message signing 
i did receive the ability after the crash  i also attempted to get a haste buff but crashed again  i don't think that crash was related to your mod  it had something to do with creepers and i fixed that  i'll do some more testing and let you know what i find

it is the explicit null on "notes" that is causing your problem  firebird doesn't like the use of explicit null keywords  on not null    the solution is to use another tool until it is fixed i feel  it's too much of a faff to go edit he generated ddls manually each time    cheers   andy

you are right  i was not using the latest version  sorry for not double checking  but i think i found another potencial minor bug  if you dont specify an aligntolerance  default value of 0   then you will get an indeterminate form 0 0 when the owner gets aligned  because targetrotation    rotation   rotationsize   rotation is 0  and rotationsize is 0   the align check should take into acount that  and check for a value minor or equal to the aligntolerance

my test case is a bit complex but i try to put a simple version  the problem may also originate from 'elemmatch' operator since it is used as well and i just realized that operator not found error is also in the console

for what i have read now the updated title is the exact meaning of old devices   i have discovered that the format string to set the time in the server request was incompatible with that devices  and changing it has solved the problem in my device with 2 3 7  in the format we used 'h' for hours and now i have set 'k' as it's explained here   http   developer android com reference android text format dateformat html  i would like to test the solution in more devices  but until late afternoon today i don't think that i would have access to the other device in witch i have discovered the issue   maybe is better to wait to that test to make the pull request  although in the 2 3 7 device the problem was present with "playstore" version and master of development and now it's ok

thanks for the quick fix 
i cannot remeber very clearly about the steps  but the trace is short i remember  i tried hard to reproduce this issue  but unfortunately fail to provide you a good test 
i'm using everything the the 2 0 beta1 release  except for  gst java core  and now the newer  jna   it seems to have helped a tiny bit  though without fail  my app doesn't fully exit when i quit  there's still the hanging process issue  i'm using eclipse and can see the app doesn't fully terminate until i hit the red stop button  it now gives me the  warning  no real random source present  error when i quit my app sometimes  which didn't seem to happen at that specific time before  so  the results aren't much different yet  i'll look at using the older gstreamer binaries  if that's even possible  thanks  neilcsmith net  
i'm using 1 2 10
filename pattern   table _  timestamp      table _ timestamp   with our without the   sign  the file name is always the same  i try to export a json file  see this    grafik  https   user images githubusercontent com 6271057 36643999 d689c1ae 1a53 11e8 946a 5167ccf3b425 png   without the   sign  i get a json file on my desktop which is just fine and contains my data as expected 
that's a good question  not very knowledgeable about mc modding at all  so i'm swimming in ignorance here  could it have something to do with this recent change   https   github com minecraftforge minecraftforge commit 205f5c13c844540000ed41fbc85057cb8de5ab53  best i could find  clue wise 
yes  2012 12 26 20 36 03  info   bloodmoon  disabling bloodmoon v0 20 2 why does it disable 
the latest update seems to have fixed the issue  i can see lots of pages with items when i search "emc " in nei  approx 6000 items or so vs 2000ish before
i was referring the the double blind problem we discussed 
we presented the difficulties in a skype conversation to  raul mz and agreed on the needed improvements 
yes  the conclusion of that status update is " over the breakfast table  what else am i to think "  but that doesn't show in the app

i didn't know you could do that and i consider it a bug  i think picking up climb and brolly tokens should have no effect on anything else and should happen immediately 
 arvindsv i noticed that with the plug in but i didn't raise it was because it was working with 18 7  so  i presumed something about how the server handles it has changed    now  if you look at my report  you will see that the form params on both versions are same  however as it enters the rails layer  the input payload has got restructured a bit  if you can help me with how the request gets processed until the rails controller part  it would help me debug this further too    i can revert to an older plug in version as a workaround before either fixing here or in the plug in    let me know 
 sjudd 1  i do not know why incorrect results has been written to the disk cache  but they really existed in cache  and the scenario we came across was that the disk cache file can not been decoded successfully  2  i do not know what is your meaning  3  with default decoders and our custom remote modelloaders 4  4 7 1
that's a good question and i have no idea  sometimes my owncloud vps is slow anyway so i thought there may be time out or something with the app  just guessing      unfortunately my phone isn't rooted so i can't get logcat

 loosebazooka  i am not sure if it is connected to windows or its version  i have installed an ubuntu os with virtualbox  and i could deploy without any problem  the output of that command is     so an empty array    chanseokoh  i agree  could you reproduce the error  i followed  this tutorial  https   codelabs developers google com codelabs cloud app engine springboot index html index    2f  index#0  on my windows 8 1 computer  and i got the exception 
on mine too  it´s a crashreport from the playstore
i upgraded to the latest forge  and i can now see the items  unfortunately  i cannot click on the items and place them into my inventory on survival  i can only do this on creative  but since this is a new problem  i opened a new issue  unless this is intentional 
looks like there's two problems   on one machine  it's a jvm memory issue error code 137  one another machine  it's the git clone on the host that has unknown userid group     going to git clone inside the container   correct userid group is set   and rebuild from there 
 jasontedor all clear  i read your first statement as the logic is the one that we found to be accurate for most cases  but i think that what you meant is that we need to find a better logic for this  which we don't know what is the best 
i can't verify at the moment because the code doesn't compile on my debian with up to date default jre from apt repositories  i'll try to get the code to compile and i'll let you know as soon as i do  at the moment i'm still getting six errors  but i'll be working on this code about an hour every morning this week 
i can completely reproduce the problem with new turbines in my original bevo test world  i can't reproduce the problem in a minimal modpack with only mekanism   nei   pressure pipes  when i get a chance  i'll try creating a new bevo world and testing there 
the  road is not tagged with "access private"  only the access by vehicles is restricted  the restrictions for pedestrians are either inherited from "access " or they are explicitly set by "foot "  and similar the restrictions for horses

yeah  using   cni plugins amd64 v0 6 0 tgz   with bazel 0 13 0rc1 works   i don't like having to ratchet to a particular bazel version  but i guess we can do it if necessary   it's going to be particularly painful for our release branches  we'll either have to require a maximum bazel version of 0 11  or we'll have to require a minimum bazel version of 0 13  neither of which is ideal 
the only log that i got is that android iab initialised with the          i'm doing a debug log   for every item that i got from query inventory and only on ios the log is called  on android is never called

when i go to  'report an issue' and try to paste something  long press hold  in the title section the application just dies 
yes  i used the dagger of sacrifice
okay  definitely sounds like it's worth trying  i tried the method  you described here  https   github com eclipse che issues 14164   and the first part is clear for me  but the second is a little confusing  what is che cr  how can i modify this field in this file exactly  should i do it prior to creating my che project on openshift or by configurating its properties afterwards   i also tried using the grouped certificate comprised of the company's certificates  that didn't work at all    i guess i gotta use the specific certificate  some trial and error should cover that 
here is the reasoning for this  there is a chance this may be wrong  that's why i am keeping the issue around  1  a quick preview of how hdfs leasing works  the namenode creates a temporary file for the client  if any client is trying to open the hdfs file again  this lease is checked against  the lease file is deleted which the owner closes the stream  continuous heartbeat ensures that the owner is still alive  in case the owner has not closed the file and some other open call is received for the file  the lease is broken  when the lease is broken  the namenode waits for the original owner to send heartbeat for designated time and if it is not received  breaks the lease   there is a pending discussion to be had for using this behavior for hdfs locking    now the interesting part is the waiting period  in case of a different client than the current owner the wait period is 1 minute  if the owner is same  the wait period is one hour    2  with the second stacktrace   something bad happens in the container which is running one instance of everything hdfs  the datanode  and maybe the namenode  is not accessible after this error in the second stack trace  because of which the owner can not write to the file as well as close the stream  the lease is not released in the usual way  now the namenode datanode recovers and is available  any further attempt to open is a lease breaking operation  and as we are doing it from the same client   the wait period is one hour  in case of multiple datanode the assumption is that a bad datanode is replaced and namenode ensures that the lease is maintained properly  the writes and close never fail the way they are failing here and we will never be in this situation   i recommend keeping the issue around as there are multiple places where this explanation may be wrong and the issue may still appear in case of a multinode hdfs deployment 
stefandollase you may be correct  i most likely assumed something that i wasn't even seeing  i have since checked and it's because the open file dialog doesn't show the folder path i mistakenly thought it was going to the main saves folder under  minecraft  it isn't it is  in fact  going to the proper saves folder for that profile  this is a non issue  please close this

hey harald   so far it fails for all splitting of  mgf files  i generate them with progenesis qi by exporting the ms ms spectra from there  i do a filtering where i exclude all hits that are ranked in the ms ms spectra 10 or higher to make searches faster and still not losing ids   unfortunately i need to split those big  mgf files  this file here has a size of around 1 7 gb  because somehow our mascot search engine cannot handle  mfg files which are bigger than 1gb   the  mgf files are made from high resolution mass spec  raw files with a long gradient  5h    best regards andreas     __________________________   andreas hentschel  m  sc  research associate lipidomics  isas  e v  otto hahn straße 6b 44227 dortmund  germany  p  +49  0 2 31 13 92 4206  f  +49   0 2 31 13 92 4850 andreas hentschel isas de www isas de   __________________________  leibniz institut  für analytische wissenschaften – isas – e v  bunsen kirchhoff straße 11    44139 dortmund  germany sitz   register  dortmund   amtsgericht dortmund vr  1724 vorstand  prof  dr  albert sickmann   prof  dr  norbert esser   jürgen  bethke __________________________       von    harald barsnes  notifications github com    an    compomics searchgui  searchgui noreply github com    kopie    andreasisas  andreas hentschel isas de   author  author noreply github com    gesendet    08 05 2017 15 30   betreff    re   compomics searchgui  splitting and indexing  mgf files is not working correctly  #145     hi andreas   thanks for telling us about this  to be honest we pretty much stay away from the mgf splitting as it can have a minor impact on the results  as each mgf file is processed separately by the search engines   can i ask you where the mgf files comes from and why it's so big  and how big is it btw   i've just tested the splitting though  and it still works fine on my side  does it fail for all files on your side or just this particular one   best regards   harald  — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  or mute the thread

 erikfleischer yes that's what i meant  i will do some tests with an emulator to see what i can do

yes  mtlib is installed 
 jvalkeal  the shell is a sub module in core  so whenever we release scdf core  it is implicit that we will have an equivalent shell release  i was hoping to make a simple improvement to resolve the shell version automatically and add a download link in shell ui    there's a lot of chatter due to incompatible shell + server combo  we could make it simpler for the users to download the right shell release  perhaps when we will have a lot more apis to support  we could revisit the versioning angle  thoughts 
that seems to have fixed it but also disabled the hardness x4  even made new config for itr  the mining speed of all things scales again now like skills and momentum mining ring etc  but the hardness of blocks is entirely gone  i mean it’s in the config but with iton true and on false doesn’t matter still the same base speed hardness   yes i did restart in between global hardness change true false

hi  thanks for the response  i actually have another eclipse work space where the appe runs perfectly  but in an new repository when i try to run the java standard appengine project i'm getting the above said error  i am attaching the preference file along with this comment    p s  i have installed the latest version of gcloud  i used java 8 and still i am not able to run the app in an new work space  entire prefences    eclipse workspace prefs zip  https   github com googlecloudplatform google cloud eclipse files 3555461 eclipse workspace prefs zip  the preferences file    preferences zip  https   github com googlecloudplatform google cloud eclipse files 3555440 preferences zip  java version      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 29875835 63939011 d5eb3980 ca83 11e9 9ed8 42c5177c75e3 png  gcloud vresion      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 29875835 63939106 121e9a00 ca84 11e9 8dac 69e89562a6b4 png  installed gcloud components      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 29875835 63939073 fc10d980 ca83 11e9 8c99 6ea886c34863 png   please help me understand what i have done and what i should have done  thanks in advance

okay  i suppose i should have mentioned a few things    i cannot reproduce the bug in a modpack with ender io alone    the bug happens in my world which also has 250+ other mods   the power line gets its power from a p2p tunnel   it's not only on server restart but also when placing lights  i have to place the light first then the power conduit or it won't work   i haven't tried applying a redstone signal to it to see what happens    i haven't tried with the latest that just got out

 miethanerr is this correct  is it no longer compatible with previous versions  so we cannot use existing services 

hi  bsideup   initial test "passes"  but there are several logs like this    it reproduces all the time on my pc    but before making it reproducible  i played  around with  sc  properties and delays    i've updated tc so it will fail test 
thank you  it works fine with  cc_library   am i right that functionality of  cc_inc_library    prefix  matches  strip_include_prefix  attribute of  cc_library    
currently i don't have one because it didn't work so far so i abandoned this thing   e g   for using sprintf and sscanf  stdio h would have to be #included  or it shoudn't work    but if they are needed and stdio h had been  #included   then  all ansi standard features also should have to be provided  e g   float formatting    in case a nano user would not like to have these full features but just some basic ones he should have to #include a different smaller lib    let's call it nanoio h  feat  a  sprintf_nano derivative of smaller memory claims  this argument was often heard when talking about the "full features"   for  h and  c files i just don't see how to save or open such a file in the editor window additionally in an additional tab window   i can't write code and save it to a file named "myheader h"   and if my current dir contains 2 files  e g  sdfgetsdemo ino ansitools h i can't even find the header file listed using the file_open menu   and if i currently start sketch i get a program "bareminimum" pattern  if i designed it to be a header then i can't "save_as" by a name like myheader h or ansitools h   that's roughly what it is about

i could post the logs as well  i'll will get a video of the bug today    with verbose 
i try again  now this issue is pass  but have a new issue 
 jesmrec sorry  we've tried it on 2 9 1  it doesn't work  but as far as we know  it stopped working 2 days before i created the issue and that's why i expect the issue came in 2 9 0 as that was released 2 days before creating this issue   i just edited my original post and changed "owncloud app version" under "environment data" to 2 9 1  i also tried it once more to make sure and it's not working in 2 9 1 
 gitmensch   yes  but i'm starting to doubt it would help in this case  i had just accidently set the export option "no conversion of the instruction expression contents"  if this option is disabled  the export looks pretty fine  the good question  however  is whether the extraction of the type definition and variable declarations should happen in the "no conversion" mode  this isn't specified exactly  and the real difficulty is to define all consequences of this mode in a consistent and sensible way for all target languages  and yes   to write the test cases forces to specify the intended functionality

it seems to be more than just updating this script  in the end  as several bundles seem to not be living in the org eclipse kapua    namespace anymore   at least the jars aren't  i started to update the scripts but stopped   there since i guess first step is to make sure all kapua bundles are   org eclipse kapua xxx jar as per eclipse development process   le sam  15 oct  2016 02 13  henryk konsek notifications github com a écrit

ok  i've whitelisted n ify in minminguard  system ui was already whitelisted    before doing that though i had tried again and it seems the icon is updating without having to hide and show the shade again  but it seems to be very erratic  sometimes it takes a while to do it  up to 6 seconds or more  and sometimes it does it almost instantly  the behavior is the same if i turn toggle mobile data from the quick tile  collapsed or expanded   or from settings  there's a delay in the icon update wither way 
replicates in ie  firefox  and chrome  checked the error in ff and chrome  and it is identical    it looks like  bkutils initializecometd  is only defined in  core src main web app beakerembed js   then i would wonder if beakerembed js is no longer getting loaded in beaker js where the error is thrown   i also cleared the browser cache
ok  i looked a bit into it again  i'll write the workaround at the bottom  so people might notice it better  i'll possibly open a separate feature request issue on the other stuff  since it's clearly not related  so i'll just focus on the bug  but first of all i'd like to apologise for not finding the other issue before  even though i find some of the other ones   basically i noticed the same behaviour as someone mentioned on the other issue  when i go to turn on the "read and write to the ankidroid database" permission in the settings  it would turn on  but it wouldn't stay on when checking the menu again  ankidroid's setting would work just fine  and as someone said  the other curious thing compared to ankidroid is if you try to switch it on and then off  it would say "this app was designed for an older version of android  denying permission may cause it to no longer function as intended   cancel   deny anyway "  presumably referring to the pre 23 api level   i tried all kinds of different things  and i can't even manually enable the permission through adb with package manager  however  trying to do that finally gave me something useful in logcat  "packagemanager  cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app"   so  i'm pretty convinced what's happening is that because ankidroid is 23+ api level  it can set the runtime permission just fine  and it's also possible the whole "cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app" has come as a security feature in a newer different android version   why does it work sometimes at all then  i assume it's because if you install aedict first  the whole "com ichi2 anki permission read_write_database" doesn't even exist so you can't request it  and with the "legacy apps"  on newer androids   you can only change permissions on install time    or possibly revoke and re grant permissions that were granted on install time  you can even see "install permissions"  granted or not  separated from the others when you do "adb shell dumpsys package com ichi2 anki   grep perm"   in the end i don't think it's an _actual_ bug in android  since it seems like it's something that was put there on purpose    but obviously the ui should say something about it  i don't think custom permissions between pre 23 and post 23 apps is a common thing  i can't even find anything other than the actual android sources if i google for "cannot grant runtime permission to a legacy app"   unfortunately i think the only proper solution would be to increase api level  but of course that's a huge hassle code wise     workaround  make sure you install aedict after ankidroid  if you already have both  uninstall just aedict and reinstall it   
yes on twitch
i was looking up a single vertex by its long id  the getvertex api is more convenient because i just want the single vertex back  not an iterable or iterator   i switched to getvertices  which is what will be called internally if i go through gremlin  is it the official recommendation that all janus calls go through gremlin  i prefer to use the janus apis directly when they make sense as i feel that some of the gremlin query re writing can be a little un predictable    anyways  there's 2 for sure bugs here that need to be addressed  using gremlin won't fix them   1  the javadoc for getvertex is wrong as it states that it will return null if the vertex doesn't exist  either we should fix the javadoc or we should fix the method  i would prefer fixing the method  but i'm not sure if anyone is relying on the exception throwing behavior  i would assume not as it's an undeclared assert error  2  getvertices should not throw an exception when a vertex doesn't exist and batch loading is enabled  i get that we are skipping the existence check to help performance  but once we determine that the vertex doesn't exist  it should just be removed from the response  there's no good reason for having it behave differently when batch loading is enabled 
i just retested with higher emitter intensity and it works  my glow stone blocks were really far from what i was trying to light with them on emitter intensity   13  raised to max and it worked fine except torches on the wall turned the walls around them white  _

sorry if my explanation wasn't clear enough  i use swift_library rule in my own project which is located in a different workspace than bazel  i build it with pre built bazel 0 4 0 from homebrew  to load the rule i use   but when i use it the build fails with error from the first post  if i add  xcrunwrapper  binding to my project's workspace file the build succeeds  i'm not sure if it's the intended behaviour that user should provide the binding or just using  load  should be enough

it looks perfectly reasonable from that log output and when i select that line in particular  granted  after i've added the index back in  it looks fine   i count 10 columns   i dug into this before i figured out the index fix  i don't know why it's expecting 8  apparently it thinks  header    null   or getting 9  apparently that's what  condensetrailingtokens  does   if i pad that site to get the vc above and below they all look well behaved  whitespace and everything

yes i tried different theme but this problem exist in all of those situations in my view you can change the text color to make it different from the drawer's background color 
from my point of view  making geturl throw on non optional parameters and adding geturlbase would already make the api much better 
a side note that shouldn't really matter is that it was in the nether  it was basaltic magma from primal core  i read it wrong    however the blocks that are broken in the pack do not "contain monster eggs" they are nether blocks  they do not spawn from the block like monster eggs would  i do not know what mod adds it  my guess is primal core  nether ex or cyclic  seeing how silverfish from monster egg spawns on the block broken and not the breaker serched for the mods that added add the hellfish and silverfish in the nether  and came across this   "never quarry nether when you're using nether ore mod if you don't tweak the hellfish config  it will break your server  " so apparently someone else has had the same issue

thanks for the response to this  at the moment i'm using a parameter type definition defined as  number  that matches both integer and float returning a double   this would provide a nice bases to work up a generalized  polymorphic  number matcher that works as suggested   time permitting i would like to help with adding this as a new feature   there are a couple of other ideas based on what our business experts are putting in features that might also be useful  i e  lists in step definitions' "and applying adjustments 1  1 32  2 67  3  3 86  4 2"
ah ok  got it     yes  i put the  debugremove above application class declaration for build up towards prod release  but that will take some time   but i get the logic now  thanks for the quick reply  
 tobiaskaminsky sorry  no  i cannot do this in the next days 
at async receivecommand queue_name  hello2command class   if in queue a current command is hellocommand 
this is the definition  the actual number is  232323 as you can see below  this has changed in the past week or so 
 johanvos i'm trying to build sample project  https   github com gluonhq client samples tree master maven hellofxml  nothing changed  apart from adding  verbose  to pom xml  i was thinking about trying out  maven client plugin 0 0 12 snapshot  but it seems it's not deployed    jperedadnr   i downloaded exact version as you linked  not sure if it's ok to post complete output here or better only excerpt   opting for complete one and asking  
unfortunately our project is currently incompatible with spring vault core v2 x x  this is because of _spring vault core_'s dependency on _springframework_ v5 1 0 release  or higher   our project relies on a lower version  and upgrading would take a large level of effort   i also tried to run using v2 1 0 release  and couldn't due to missing classes only found in spring framework v5   up

 len  wont get a value in that case as  parseint  will throw a  numberformatexception  because its argument is  null  and not a parseable string   6d0e680 should fix it in this regard  respectively "fix" as in throwing a "clearer" exception  i'd maybe even omit the  null  check as i cant tell right now what will happen now  according to the documentation the end of the stream has been reached when  readline  returns  null   so i'd assume the response body might not have a valid structure to begin with in these cases 
i uploaded a video  because it's very hard to explain    https   www youtube com watch v cnfx81odbqk pd  i noticed i'm using gregtech certus quartz because the mod replaces it  still i don't think that's the problem 
hi  luigidellaquila  maybe it was bug _github com_  do you see my issue completely  like this   issue  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7984378 12445599 d7d54512 bf6d 11e5 95f6 ce5e357dc66b jpg   because my friend from other country sees my issue like this    badissue  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7984378 12445906 c6737e54 bf6f 11e5 806d 876559e40de8 jpg 
hmm    to be honest  i have completion suggesters in my mapping  but not in the documents i was bulk indexing  the bulk indexing process should have been the only process that was running at the time of the exception  the bulk indexer is shuffling data over from one type to another in the same index  no deletions  no updates  just bulk index requests  is it possible that it's caused by something that es does in the background   unfortunately i don't have access to the mapping right now  but i can send it to you tomorrow if that helps  there's multiple completion suggesters for about 3 different types  we're in the process of updating an es 1 x mapping to es 5 x  so i'm not even sure if something's wrong on our side  i'm personally not a pro with suggesters tbh  
bug still exists    d  https   i vgy me bs9oxi png after restart it will tp you but on the wrong ps
here it is     hth

oh  phonegao build 3 1，android 4 03 and the usage just like yours address https   github com ankama phonegap sysinfo
i meant adding an option so users could turn it on off at will  i'm working on it just to see if i can pull it off  folks with bigger screens might want it

hi imotov  it's quite a big bit of json and i had to obscure the index and shard information as it was too long for the comment section in github  if you need it happy to talk offline via email etc  we quite a large number of indices 
activating abilities and casting spells etc  at the end of an opponent's turn would probably occur more often than doing nothing during an opponent's turn   it's the last possible moment to use any mana available  and would be very useful 
my game actually started up just fine  i crash upon entering my world  i will try your suggestion and report back  edit  did not work  i deleted the config and map files and even started a new test world
sorry for late response  there is some code where this problem appears     in this case i get the following suggestion  see image     nullfalsepositive  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10072693 25938652 3e7224e0 3630 11e7 8874 7cbe90a7fea0 png   i cant use this suggestion  null      because this variable is never set before   disabling this reporting is not good at all  because it reported mostly the correct problem  only in cases when the variable is never initilized before it will be wrong   i have the latest phpstorm  2017 1 3  because of eap   but it also works wrong on open released versions  2017 1 2   work on windows and have the latest plugin 
thanks  sir  is there any other link for guidelines

i can reproduce the count difference using one sstable file  so i like to seek your help tracking this issue   our data is composite key + composite column names data  i choose one example sstable files including  data db file about 1190323388 bytes  plus compressioninfor db  index db  filter db  summary db  statistics db   the sstable2json  parsing the data db file  will output 195238 as count of row key  if i iterator the columns  i will get 46167243 columns from these row keys   now  i built the index of the above set data  after that  i wrote the following unit test code     the output is  keycnt   195234 recordcnt   46167221  so using hadoop sstable  it looks like i lost 4 row keys  and 22 columns  i have the  index db and  index db index files  but not sure how internal you are using the index file to generate the split and parsing the  data db file  any help for debugging this issue   thanks
i'm using hoxton release   i didn't had much time to debug  but i'm pretty sure  but not entirely  that it's not a spring cloud netflix problem because the discovery works fine on any other spring application in my project    i've change the logging level of the  instancediscoverylistener  and as far as i can see the   heartbeat  events are received  i see  discovering new instances from discoveryclient  print repeatedly    moreover  what i have done to test it is to add a new java class in the project that autowires the eurekadiscoveryclient and schedule a method that calls the  getservices    and prints the result  i can clearly see that the discovery client is not receiving any new instance while on eureka they are correctly registered    i think i've never seen the error  but it could be related  this may explain why the first time the registry is fetched correctly  i will look into it and let you know 
same issue
i'm running win7 64bits  and using junit to run a test  surefire maven plugin    tests are exactly in the same environment  i only have to change  java_home  environnent variable from  c  program files java jdk1 6 0_45  to  c  program files java jdk1 7 0_51  and run  mvn test  for the problem to occur   maybe it's a performance issue of the jvm  totally unrelated to mapdb    test is an integration test from a closed source project  using multiple mapdb at the same time with custom serializers  it's measuring performance for about 1 000 000 records and 1000 sized transaction chuncks   i'll try to write an external unit test showing the performance issue with a unique database    
well  i fixed it    will need to re break it to see

yes the issue still exists in the current version   i solved it by re implementing the filter base class  i used a scheduledexecutorservice to periodically execute the polling of the events on the eth client instead of a while true  loop with a thread sleep    the problem is that by using a fixed threadpool and the busy wait approach  the executorservice runs out of threads and its queue grows  i suspect that this leads to a complete blocking of the app process in android systems  since it uses too much resources  i attached my implementation of the filter class  please note that i only tested this with a few contracts with 3 events each  so far i don't have any problems  but i haven't tested this solution throughly   best regards  repfuesch      ursprüngliche nachricht     von   notifications github com datum   24 03 2017   11 53  cet  an   web3j noreply github com cc   flo schuepfer bluewin ch  mention noreply github com betreff   re   web3j web3j  calls on contract hang after event subscription  #69   repfuesch is this still an issue  — you are receiving this because you were mentioned  reply to this email directly  view it on github  or mute the thread         "api_version" "1 0" "publisher"  "api_key" "05dde50f1d1a384dd78767c55493e4bb" "name" "github"  "entity"  "external_key" "github web3j web3j" "title" "web3j web3j" "subtitle" "github repository" "main_image_url" "https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 143418 17495839 a5054eac 5d88 11e6 95fc 7290892c7bb5 png" "avatar_image_url" "https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 143418 15842166 7c72db34 2c0b 11e6 9aed b52498112777 png" "action"  "name" "open in github" "url" "https   github com web3j web3j"   "updates"  "snippets"   "icon" "person" "message" " conor10 in #69   repfuesch is this still an issue "   "action"  "name" "view issue" "url" "https   github com web3j web3j issues 69#issuecomment 288991563"

sorry  it seems i was wrong i could catch the bug on studio 2 3 3 and plugin 2 3 3 still  i'll try to make a sample soon  it annoying to reproduce the bug because i need to scroll excessively  i also notice that on all crashes free ram was about 2 5   i got full dump 
1  48 nodes  41 data  4 http balancer  3 master nodes 2  icu  2 3 0  all nodes 3  openjdk 7_u55  all nodes  i'm indexing a lot  but this message has  sadly  nothing to do with it  if i stop it persists  one easy way to trigger it sooner is to add more replicas to the index   other nodes dont really have anything interesting  master nodes have last messages from the 4 days ago about adding a node to the cluster except for the actual elected master  http nodes dont have anything  data nodes have gc message from some 8 hours ago
i think  not entirely sure  that it is possible that one line of input generates multiple outputs  in case of multiple alt allele's   but more importantly  we saw a difference in order before  a check was build in for this  but is now gone  probably after the switch to the new framework   furthermore in emx we can have lines missing one of the required attributes  those will cause error's  but if you'll omit them the output vcf and input repository differ in length
well  now i can't replicate it either  i wonder if there's some intermittent bug with dates getting set in the future  if i notice it again i'll try and get more log info 
there no stack trace available  it happens on class   method

hi  dogloveroc  thank you for the fast feedback  this may happen if you use a java version prior to 1 8 or openjdk  could you please try installing  this java runtime  https   java com en download   and then launch the wizard with it

can you try it  i've also extracted the archive manually and that's way faster

yeap  the jenkinsfile complains because it is expecting to find a boolean and it is getting a string  the thing is we can mitigate by casting but if we need to cast then it ain't transparent when using the plugin  do not get me wrong  you've done a hell of a job here developing it  it is just that after we updated our jenkins server to the latest lts the use case when we use your plugin is failing with github specifically  we've tested it in bitbucket and things work as a charm  so i am unsure why this is failing  my feeling is that if you do not cast to a string things should work   the gui  is just boilerplate for the real impact we are seeing    
the command that failed like this last time was  bazel build   src test shell bazel        i don't think it's specific to the command  though 
with 'develop' code  for the xhtml output the table of contents contains highlighted to entire subtree of topicrefs under the flagged topicref  maybe somehow i expected that the actual topic content would have that color applied to it    for the pdf output neither table of contents not actual topic content reflect the flagging conditions 
yes  thanks for reminding 
no problem  this code definitely needs some serious thinking about proper refresh conditions 
rombert   our project folder structure is little different  so even though i am able to add this as content project  i am not able to see changes getting reflected    i also created linked folder  jcr_root  to point to webapp folder  that didnt work as well      image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 14977933 13056000 8a432080 d3e0 11e5 8a42 d1b88c85c135 png

well  the root cause is that in the mysql jdbc preparedstatement settimestampinternal method  there is a checking  this serversupportsfracsecs   which is to detect  the current connection agains the mysql's version   but when connect to the sharding proxy  the response of the checking detectfractionalsecondssupport is false   and btw  my mysql server is 5 7 25 version and the jdbc driver is 5 1 43        below is the code in the mysql driver preparedstatement for your reference

yes  i can confirm this  the two jar libraries i use come from the sonatype snapshot repository and are    quasar core 0 7 4 20150921 123502 3 jdk8 jar   quasar kotlin 0 7 4 20150921 123715 3 jar  the kotlin version i use in my project is  0 13 1514    removing it will probably result in it not being instrumented at all  but i will test that and get back to you   adding a kotlin annotation would probably be the best way to go   it leaves the java annotations as is which is working all good but if a new annotation would be able to hint the instrumenting then that would be the cleanest solution i think   when there's anything i need to test furthermore please do let me hear

the images need to be available under a apache 2 0 compatible license and we prefer vectors  on the contributors page you can find some sources we used in the past  sources requiring attribution should be mentioned there  the style should fit with the existing ones 
it was my firewall  ignore me i am a noob

hmm only way to reproduce is to break an annotator manually at a point where it will update entities in the database  like it happend with the  255 into string field here   if our annotators all work  then this is no longer an issue 
thank you both for responding  happy to hear that a fix may be in the works   my current dubious work around is to unequip the backpack  which   doesn't   pop into my inventory  incidentally  then teleport to the rf dimension using the matter transmitter   anyhow  love your mods guys 
hi  lambdapioneer  i reproduce this issue on lenovo k900  with android 4 3 inside
you're right   i did not saw it was a 'docker' strategy   in fact the issue is that this run once strategy is available for all nodes  even the non docker ones    thanks a lot 
yes  this problem still appears in latest build 
do you have only one ssl certificate on that server   as far as i know  that problem only occurs if your server provides multiple certificates for different domains  sni   in that case  the app  if it doesn't support sni  will just use a "random" certificate  maybe first or last of the server config i guess  depends on the server    when using ssl i can't activate the service  "test" will fail with a generic error as far as i remember  i am not in possession of the phone right now    i will report back if i have any more information   here my concrete example    my picture gallery is located at https   pics stefanwienert de  that cert is valid etc pp   but  if connecting without sni  like     i just receive any certificate  for another of my domains fahrrad filter de  
nothing sip related in log or in terminal  there is some exception in org jitsi impl neomedia notify audiosystemclipimpl exitrunonceinplaythread audiosystemclipimpl java 124 but unrelated   jitsi originated    followed by server's       server is sending the same trying and ok responses twice  also in "ok" case  so it looks to me like jitsi connected properly but marked account as offline regardless   reverting 5f9610c alone fixes the issue for me

these were the values  the necessary transaction fee is  0 00000733 btc  0 9 satoshis byte  transaction size  0 816 kb  so probably increasing the minimum to 2 sat byte is the easier solution  this is the type of silent error that may leave people in the dark

let me ask the admin of the server   my client didn't crash  it just booted me off the server  i'm playing smp  sorry for not mentioning that sooner    i can confirm that the crash does  not  occur in single player when using a  blank  cheated in  biome crystal  trying to get a non cheated one is proving a little challenging  so a single player crash log might take a little longer   
i just tried creating a new game with the same modules active  all that potions is dependent on  and i was unable to reproduce it as well  i think it is safe to close this issue since it was most likely a local issue with that specific save  i'll keep an eye out for it occurring again when i use the game later tonight

doesn't seem the case  to test i have done this   1  select distinct uuid from metadata     90 values  same as the total records  2  do a csw getrecords with maxrecords 100 to get all results  90  and with a xslt process extract the uuids   3  compare the uuids from 1  and 2   the uuids are the same  the problem happens when pagination is used

oh dear    ya know  i hadn't actually tried that  and it seems to have worked  now i feel incredibly foolish  the possibility completely flew over my head   it's still a weirdly consistent thing  but much less of a problem than i initially thought then   0 i tested it  they spawn just fine under every circumstance aside from in their towers  so it's definitely tied to that  and only effecting the evil dudes  if it matters  i have recurrent complex  dungeon tactics  and ice and fire all  and biomes'o plenty in this current build  all of which fiddle with generation a good bit

try again  as my grammar change is checked in now  as is the above test  but with an  ignore   the grammar change allows an array to be returned by an expression  i e  remember how we were trying to allow array references to be expressions in the grammar     so the idea is that you can have an expression  like a case statement or a built in function return an array type  like this       the getdatatype   should return an array pdatatype  but my guess is that it's returning the element type instead 
 eivantsov  thanks a lot 
i don't quite understand the parsing code and it seems to fail not even in the docker code  so i guess the first question would be if the reply from the daemon is ok or not and why the parser does not like that  in a json validator i did not get an error  i assume one should be able to reproduce this by changing https   github com docker java docker java blob master src test resources samples 1 22 info 1 json  looks like one might be able to just add the "some host name" part from above

hello  you can see the accurate input i'm providing in the gif and you can see the behavioural response from the lsp   i was trying to get it to auto complete my inputs  the thing is that sometimes it just triggers on it's own while i'm typing  sometimes it doesn't get triggered by the  ctrl + space  shortcut  sometimes it overwrites the entire line  or it just spits the correct method one line lower leaving the residue i was typing where it was and similar stuff

there are ftests for folo in the addons folo ftests module   i'm not sure if that's what you're after   basically  folo  just a dumb shortening of "follow"  is a content tracking api  it exposes a set of rest urls that basically the same as the ones you would normally use to download or upload content  with the difference that they allow you to specify a tracking id  when you download or upload content via one of these urls  instead of the main ones   folo will add entries to the tracking record corresponding to that tracking id  it also exposes a few rest resources for sealing  closing  the tracking record  and downloading   deleting the record   where you'd normally use the following to download content from the public group     you'll see logs for the ftests in embedders savant target failsafe tests  just like with any other ftest   a test like this one might be modified to have an upload and a download of the same file  then the rest of the test would show what's in the tracking record   https   github com commonjava indy blob master addons folo ftests src main java org commonjava indy folo ftest report storefileandverifyintrackingreporttest java

os x el capitan  unity 5 3 and 5 4   i'm not sure if a gif would be super useful  the steps are simply   add a break point press attach to unity and select it in the list press play on unity  the consulo console will say successfully attached to unity  but the breakpoints won't fire   pressing pause in the debugger will pause unity however  so it definitely seems attached  this is the same on three different computers of mine

i have one primary node and 3 replica   when failover happens  the following is logged by redisson    "time" "2019 01 10t16 08 35 968 0800" "fullmessage" "detected dns change  master rediss   xxxxx usw2 cache amazonaws com 6379 has changed ip from 10 153 99 49 to 10 153 99 219" "loggername" "org redisson connection dnsmonitor" "thread" "redisson netty 1 12" "severity" "info"   it seems to me that redisson did identify the changes  but when i ran " netstat  nt   sort +5   fgrep  6379   grep  n  "  i saw redisson sent "syn_sent" to previous primary node even redisson had already "established" connection with new primary node  once failover completed  it took about 10 mins   redisson "established" connection with previous primary node as well  33 connections to previous primary node  34 connections to new primary node   another thing i noticed is that the following two calls seem using different connection pools  redissonclient getmapcache "foo"  get key  always uses pool which points to new primary node   redissonclient getmapcache "foo"  size   always uses pool which points to previous primary node  after failover happens  in about minute  get key  starts to work  but size    keeps on throwing "slaveconnectionpool no available redis entries" error   the reason i'm trying not to use individual node is that if we need to add new node or delete a node  i don't want to restart app with new node configuration  we used aws redis  cluster mode disabled   the primary node can handle both read and write  the other nodes are mainly for failover 
yes  when the animation is complete  it gets redrawing and is accurate  i guess  it is because of integer zoom level and animation starts after zoom level changed  i think  if animation started with old zoom level it would be accurate animation

1  you restrict templates to come from the dynamiccities module  https   github com terasology dynamiccities blob develop src main java org terasology dynamiccities buildings buildingmanager java#l107  2  the map entry has only the prefab name as key  so two prefabs with the same name coming from different modules would overide each other  https   github com terasology dynamiccities blob develop src main java org terasology dynamiccities buildings buildingmanager java#l109  3  you are comparing only the strings to match  you should consider something like the asset resolving mechanism  maybe can reuse it   that is used when querying blocks  for instance   https   github com terasology dynamiccities blob develop src main java org terasology dynamiccities buildings buildingmanager java#l220

 tasiek nice  it's good to know the root of the problem  could yo help me  by providing me a link to the tv app 1 4 release's source code  just to try to fix it by my self  i've been modifying the latests development versiones but they're crashing randomnly  i'd like to try the last release version  thanks
good that it's easy to fix  about same behavior in editor and in apk i would find it consistent  yes  how do you think   if you want retro compatibility  since no one complained in the past  you can keep the fatal notfound exception

in my case chunking happens because i have varnish in front of my nginx webserver compressing text files with gzip  i don't know how to reproduce this directly but maybe people in the owncloud bug know  possibly by enabling gzip chunked is used

this is another topic  there are ways to delete those old images from the history  please open an issue for this   we cannot make documentation depend on cloud services  the whole goal of git is that everyone has portable code and documentation  by linking things to cloud services you make this project dependent  avoid dependencies  please   we don't want dependencies   if we decide to move to another service  e g  gitlab i don't want to take care of updating images in tons of repositories   please keep it simple

the same thing happens with the nightly   a few things that might be helpful in tracking it down     it is reliably triggered when i start or stop moving my mouse    there is sometimes a less strong baseline level of flicker  not captured on the video  with a semi constant frequency of about  5hz   this flicker doesn't last as long as the big long flickers you see on the video   i get a similar type of flicker when scrolling with the scroll bar 
this has fixed the issue  md678685  https   github com lucko luckperms commit 6baa472567a13c9ce2d7ef99e7d5722e99b1cdb5  if there is still something specific you would like shared from our startup log let me know  i cannot share the full log unfortunately

hi nicolas  yes  it happens all the time  version 2 10 2   android 9
this occurs for me when i open intellij on a project directory for the first time  if i haven't run the following commands     so my best guess is that ghc mod is the source of the issue  but it would be nice to have intellij catch the abnormal status as opposed to hanging 
now it's work   thanks 
thx  and sorry for not giving log files   checking this myself i have been busy the last few days  but i am happy you found it
one of the pitfalls that might come up is  that some action are multiselection able and some are not  so for instance "rename" makes no sense really if you select 10 projects  actually a lot of actions that are followed by a dialog are things you probably dont want for multiselection  so that might lead to a concept where you need to annotate your actions whether they can be executed with multiple nodes selected and change the right click popup menu accordingly

i've now been able to reproduce this on my local whereas previously i was only encountering on our production server  it seems like the version is incorrect like it is somehow using the created date      one other thing to note is that our schema_version table does not have a "state" column  this showed in the https   flywaydb org blog flyway 4 0 but that could be database specific or redundant

the version is structr 3 2 1 201904081513 bb967  i do not remember exactly how the situation was created  now i tried to reproduce thing by remembering   at the time i had no clue how to use the pages tab  i didn't know about the tree view and tried to delete a page via the "properties" menu   there i clicked a "x" which was probably the "x" beside the name  after doing this the name was set to null and the behavior described above set it  i think it is reproducible this way

i've reproduced it in single player just by spawning a few ghosts and some thaumcraft eldritch mobs   i suppose we can throw potions at entities with splash or arrows too   we're also using the infernal mobs mod  they will change potions when mob is spawning and might update them periodically 
here is the video of it working  it seems like it is an issue that only crops up just after install  now  as you can see in the video it does update itself on the apt get update periodic task   https   erayan com shared 2016 02 08_17 53 33 mp4  so it seems something is off with the timing on time of install 
url will keep changing  this is not fixed element  different client will use different urls  url is where client has installed faveo online  this is not something we can control or know off
my modification take always the first result key word  "résultat"   so  2 solutions    take local  replace list  resultcolumnnames getauthorizednames    by a map  "fr"  "résultat" and "en"  "result"  and use get element by key  with local variable     just switch "result" and "résultat" and use always "result"  always "en" by default in sql    what do you think about it 
sorry ma1co this is a user error on my end   i tried recording via i720 and it recorded up to 2 hours   so maybe it doesn't work for all video formats 
i didn't force close them  and neither app has a specific "exit" function  so both apps are probably "running" in some way in the background  but i'm not interacting with them at all  i assume the apps run until unless the phone is running low on available resources  which isn't likely to happen on the note9  
i bound the 'bomb' key to rmb  and the 'gun' key to lmb 
sorry for late reply i was using 720  have just updated will let you know thanks for getting back to me
hi again    it's a testnet  i slightly modified your code and truncated the number to fit the ushort   changed this setrefblocknum ushort valueof blockid getnumberfromhash     to this setrefblocknum ushort valueof blockid getnumberfromhash     0xffff   and it works  but i don't know  if it is a legitimate   
i think current representation is good and we don't need to change it  the program works fine if you are using exporting and importing facilities only  it is just that i am reversing board somewhere in the gui  so just need to have deep look into this and carefully fix it  i hate myself and my code now  needed to implement this carefully in first place 
 tolusha  my workaround was to create project first and then run  chectl  to install che  some how chectl does not create project if one does not exist any more 
it should have been these builds      1843  https   travis ci org janusgraph janusgraph builds 492193490   targeted  0 2  which didn't get the flaky marking     1902  https   travis ci org janusgraph janusgraph builds 498592012   this build belongs to  this commit  https   github com janusgraph janusgraph commit 4682509e753f7934dc6fd9da30989248181d758f  which was merged before the flaky marking was added  so the test probably just failed the number of retries in travis   so  this really seems to be not an issue any more 
thanks for the comments   i got the plugins from here  yeah chest terminal is not working at all  but lucky blocks works fine they just cant make them but they can open them   if i knew where in the code it was looking at the recipe for the autocrafter i may be able to fix it  but its strange that its the only machine that cant take in heads  it can output them just not input them

i agree with you about even malicious data should never trigger such an exception   i have a tcp input with two extractors  the first extracts data with grok pattern and extract the field localtime  for example  localtime   "05 may 2015 07 00 00 +0200"  the second extractor is a timestamp extractor that copies the field localtime and convert string to date type with the pattern "dd mmm yyyy hh mm ss z"   i think this is correct because the message have a correct timestamp when i search it    "localtime"   "05 may 2015 07 00 00 +0200" "timestamp"   "2015 05 05 05 00 00 000"  the timezone on the system running the graylog server is      date +" z  z" cest +0200

this is related indirectly  we have contexts in the hierarchy that ultimately do not depend on  genericapplicationcontext  and some methods where not available   jhoeller provided a pragmatic fix for that that explains why there are two new methods to implement in 5 2    it looks like this will be interesting for  annotationconfigreactivewebapplicationcontext     annotationconfigreactivewebapplicationcontext  should stop extending from  abstractrefreshableconfigapplicationcontext   there is a class affected in framework and i am waiting for juergen to apply a consistent fix here

​a brand new fresh clone into a different directory fixed it   stupid git indexing   when will they ever fix that   i even did a  git reset   hard   u   and it still didn't update all the necessary files that it should have   this might be a windows git bug lurking i'm sure   that  git reset  command has always worked for me in the past  and even helped  ostephens get unstuck once before as well when i told him to do that same thing   for some reason  its not working out so well in my case   oh well  the fresh new clone did the trick however   thanks  wetneb  ​
we have some more complex search implementations in which we build the query based on wether results can be found for parts of this query   so something like  if  q clonequery   field "field1"  equal "value"  count     0  q field "field1"  equal "value"   if  q clonequery        i am aware that its not a good design practice and working with proper aggregations would certainly allow us to achieve the same and more performant result  but i was wondering how the method is suppose to work instead  i am sure having a way of cloning a complex query to be used independantly can be of use in a lot of scenarios   e g  database consistency checks while unit testing 
mh ok seems to be a connection error  i'll try to fix it and get back to you 
sorry  i think i accidently removed some info when i initially submitted this ticket  if you import an emx you readily imported and then use the same options again  it does not inform you that you have already imported this data  but gives an unrelated error    i hope this is clear   otherwise just let me know 
hi  thanks for looking into this   the error can be reproduced with the following args  this was one of the possible configurations on page 18 of manual pdf     tc com ibm uk hursley perfharness jms r11 sender  d queuetest  db 4  dx 6  dn 5  the resulting output is below   invalid parameter   dn must be within the specified bounds of  db and  dx 09 20 19 257  controlthread1  error com ibm uk hursley perfharness   the current configuration is not valid  try re running with  h to see available options   a slightly different error occurs if i specifically pass in the destination factory class name    tc com ibm uk hursley perfharness jms r11 sender  d queuetest  db 4  dx 6  dn 5  df com ibm uk hursley perfharness multidestinationfactory  the resulting output is below   invalid parameter   dx must be     db 09 12 51 213  controlthread1  error com ibm uk hursley perfharness   the current configuration is not valid  try re running with  h to see available options   please let me know if you need any more details 
you can try with the example test  "benvenuto nel mondo della sintesi vocale "  without a dot it works  but when dot is present an exception is thrown

we don't this before prior 2 0 x every class had only one cluster  how there are multiply clusters per node and it doesn't seems to be working correctly  looks like it is related to order in server list  "servers"   "nodel" "node2" " new_node "      but i am not sure 
that sounds like it would solve the problem  however i tend to like properties more than environment variables  this way it's easier to integrate with jenkins and maven  e  g  i can run a build like   and it doesn't pollute the build server's environment   if such a feature is going to be integrated it may be a good idea to mark it  as experimental for some time since i am not exactly sure if it does really make sense that way  i mean  if it wasn't for the docker in docker setup  then socket  localhost  ip  someotherhost holds true und is perfectly reasonable  the new feature may cause things to become more complicated  also more powerful  and it must be seen if similar situations do exist where it comes in handy  maybe provisioning jenkins slaves with docker or running a whole container as test would be another use case for this

i did indeed miss out the  groups treated as primary  but that doesn't seem to be the cause of the error  i also removed the  bind address  section entirely     ticket #172 seems to have to the same sort of conclusion  and as such there are two tickets on the same thing    best if one of them is closed imo 
i don't have stable version of android studio  but it's beta 6 already  so should work fine  all i did is git clone the repo  and open it on the ide  all gradle settings weren't changed from their default ones    the error occurred when updating the project to lates gradle version   however  after trying to import it again  without updating the gradle version  and it got a different issue     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 5357526 31053027 5761ea1c a69c 11e7 8f88 ec7b5b0f4f04 png   then i chose to sync project again  and now it works fine     however  i tried the "comparison" sample  and out of all items there  when i tried "fresco"  with "network"  as i did for all   it took more and more memory  till the app crashed silently  is it intended to be this way  almost all others just got the memory have a random number  but none really crashed    i also noticed that sometimes when i try to build a sample i get a warning error     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 5357526 31053493 2a91d4f6 a6a7 11e7 9a19 8eb07fdfaaaf png  sometimes it warns something about architecture  however  when i choose to run  it runs fine

i tested the fix by invoking the new code indirectly through the  de dentrassi maven rpm  https   ctron github io rpm builder index html  maven plugin and it successfully created a  rpm file larger than 2gb  the file created was 2487127517 bytes   i can no longer reproduce the problem  so i believe the fix works  at least on my system and use case 
none so far 
 tthuem my workspace was named featureide  but i created a new workspace and tested again  there is still the same issue   the weird is that the altered example templates are restored on an eclipse restart 
it took some time to pin this down  but i found the 2 2 snapshot downloadable on the site to have this problem  the latest code from github or earlier versions does not show this behavior

 philip lamb the original issue was that keys are detected but you can write a different key by mistake if you release the input outside of the target key  the pr fixed the problem but has caused missed keys instead   i pushed a new solution in https   github com mozillareality firefoxreality pull 1159  which captures the down key until the press is released  so it always types the correct key even if you release the pointer outside 
sure  where can i send it

hi  it seemed to start working on quarkus 0 21 1 but i'm not sure why  it also works on 0 21 2 now that that has been released  however  it does still have the same error as mentioned above when building with 0 21 0  the gradle version is 5 5 1

i emailed you some of the logs from the help inat account 
it would straight up crash the app  once i restarted the app  it wouldn't have saved any changes   i can reproduce it again  if you want a crash dump

ahh yeah  in the web gui it says "global discovery servers" are "ok" which i assume means that the announce server is fine   also i do have local discovery as enabled for both  along with global discovery and upnp  but the nodes still can't seem to see each other  i have them both configured with each other's device id and the folder id is the same for the one folder i'd like to sync  which is shared among them   in my firewall on the phone i can see traffic from my other device on the lan incoming but no outgoing from the phone  and also no incoming on my other device running windows on the lan 
wow  that was quick  i just checked it again with 2 0 2 snapshot and does resolve the issue  thx a lot  👍
both
i think we probably want to make the load balancing strategies pluggable  i’m generally not into pluggable things  why not just include a good implementation in the box   but in this case i think being pluggable gives us options we can’t build otherwise   one strategy i really like is from what grpc calls an external load balancer  https   grpc io grpc core md_doc_load balancing html https   grpc io blog loadbalancing
yes  clicked that  clicked each individually  clicked all clickable links 💃
this is a shortened version of the code that creates the blocks

i absolutely cannot seem to reproduce this without survivalist and mining quickly thru stone 
that would require a migration or invalidation  but otherwise would be equivalent to the osx route we employ 
here is the build file in my  bazel website  branch where i am working on this  https   github com davidzchen bazel website blob third party build   i have added the convenience symlinks to the  exclude  list for the glob  but adding any file that begins with  bazel   would still cause this error to occur 
basically  every time we make changes to the codebase  i run the gradle build install  the first time the apk is installed it crashes with the previous error  the next time i build install  it works  so for every change we need to compile install twice   
i was using notepad++ on windows  set to uft 8 
just checked  here's the german error message   "der log eintrag wurde scheinbar nicht gesendet  bitte auf der betreffenden geocaching webseite prüfen "  sound like pretty generic basic text   but i found out something  yes  it is not a generic problem  it seems to be related to twitter publish  "diesen eintrag auf twitter veröffentlichen"   if i uncheck this a comment on the tb  i could not check "discover" and "grab" on my own tb  went through without any error back to the main page of the tb 
i just did not want to introduce another parameter that sort of serves the purpose of the topic parameter   i think having two parameters with mutually exclusive rule is more complicated   it just seemed that supporting a "variable" in the topic parameter is simpler   in the future  if we do support allowing attributes in parameter for java operator  the code changes required to migrate is smaller   once a parameter is introduced  it becomes an api   i do not want to have to support this extra parameter when we support attributes in parameter in the future 
it happens with all entities as well as both third and first person  it may be a lighting issue  i could be wrong  but for every major lighting update that occurs seems to be the interval at which the vehicle flickers  i've decided to not use shaders and have switched to pr luminance which is a basic lighting resource pack which uses optifine and doesn't affect the vehicles  it seems to only occur with lighting related to dedicated shader packs and not resource packs which have a similar mechanic   really nice mod btw  flan's mod doesn't really like me so i had to do some digging to find an alternative  came across this and i'm glad i did 
could we add a second criteria in the sortby order

i used the last commit   set up scene2d ui libgdx test and you will catch these problems easier because it use json e reflection alot    i remember that the compare was failing  both types should be equal   is it because type dont have interfacescache object or for some reason type was created and didn't use the same pointer as type2

hi   this is not a test of my  wish it was      it's something that start happening a few times a week  since we start making calls between desktop and mobile  3g hsdpa 4g cellphone  users   i imagine that can be caused by something like you describe  corrupted video   but i don't have a way to reproduce it   do you think upgrading to 2 11 will help   is there a date for 2 12  
 cjayswal   it's a typo mistake only in the github while reporting this issue but not with my actual code please follow the steps below   add these maven dependencies to pom xml   dependency   groupid com qmetry  groupid   artifactid qaf  artifactid   version 2 1 13  version    dependency   dependency    dependency   groupid org testng  groupid   artifactid testng  artifactid   version 6 14 3  version    dependency   1  create an excel file excelfile xls  and sheet name as  excelreader  with columns as  name address email  and one row with some values  2 point this to qaf dataprovider and give the sheetname as well  3 in the  test method  call data get "name"  and observe you will see an exception  i'm running this in eclipse with run as testng option    other information  i'm using jdk 1 8 version 
i have a feeling that the method we use to fetch data from the api is to blame  cc  k88hudson

 sladomic i suspect this is because i have not yet copied  vgg_faces pb  to the sd card   can you modify the code to show a descriptive message when the file is missing  and instructions on how to add it  to help future developers experiencing the same 
sure  go ahead  see e g  https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 49458 for another example of how to deprecate something properly 
i delayed doing manual sync  i feel like manual sy down up would put them back into sync    i have three clients  laptop  work and home    on home  daemon was started by syncany gui which was unresponsive to restart  so i did a sy daemon force stop and sy daemon start   after a full night  home is still out of sync  i know because there were files added yesterday at work  of course  work may be having issues  too 
yes  i have already build the libbridge so  and put it into the bin directary
okay the rotate script doesn't work without fawe  but to be fair    worldedit has problems with scrips in general  it can't even execute one of the build scripts  plain we doesn't say "error while executing" though    2017 07 28_14 18 17  https   user images githubusercontent com 23323875 28716847 9e3a7ed4 739f 11e7 9f29 c08fb6c3a7dc png   here's the rotate script btw   worked on an older version of fawe as well as the build scrips    rotate zip  https   github com boy0001 fastasyncworldedit files 1182988 rotate zip 
thanks for the quick response  indeed i have this annotation on my main application class 
yes  the template file is placed in that folder only 
it stops the simulation  like pause   but in addition the next step button made nothing  i was not able to do one more step  like i can do after a pause  
maybe we can implement a thread safe wrapper that extends printstream  or outputstream   and then put the ansioutputstream inside 
i have verified that this issue has been resolved 
my code doesn't retry when the request fail  i've added a log when the request start  i call it one time  it's happens on   xt1068 gt l9300l gtl8552b gt l9070  37  is at 4 3 
yes it happens on the sample app as well   no the android api or google api emulators don't have a problem with it   on debug i do not see anything strange  i am using sdk 11   the xperia has ics 4 0 1 on it
hi   sample streams below  with hd streams this issue is more noticeable  in our case the delay is not a big issue  is almost the same as with mediaplayer  and it think is related to gop in multicast video streams  but we need to find a solution how to make the next video start immediately and do the caching while keeping the last videos frame      or    thnx
yes the time of the day in the game  it make that only when i turn on light and wait a little time  after turn it off time work great  i try it on a fresh server and fresh map 1 5 2 forge 738 with the same effect  thanks
i found the error is caused by the optimization of  obviously here is a buggy copy propagation that assigning an integer number 1065353216 to the float variable instead of parsing it to float 
my mistake     i've misunderstood exception message  in that case  i believe that only one loop will solve all problems 
i flew to those coordinates  just exploring around checking for any bugs  that's the only one i found so far and the village wasn't like that in snapshot 5  in snapshot 5 the village generates normally on the same seed  which is weird
 eivantsov using https   github com minishift minishift tree master addons che and have not provided any github clientid and secret nor registered an app on the github side     seeing  github_client_id  and  github_client_secret  only now   i guess one needs to set those  and then it works   smile  sorry  let's close this  and i'll try with that  and re open if still nok 
it says v 0 1 4 here  i don't know how to get the full build number 
unfortunately  because i want to run the test suite inside to jenkins docker agent  i've disabled ryuk using the  testcontainers_ryuk_disabled  environment variable 
ah thanks   actually i was playing with damn vulnerable websockets  docker version  you start it with docker run  d  p 80 80  p 8080 8080 tssoffsec dvws you have to put dvws local in the host file  otherwise websockets do not work   when finally i had everything working  kali updated zap to 2 8 0 and it stopped working again   i configured zap with port 8081 as a proxy listener   what happens is that when dvws local is redirected to https   dvws local  all requests that use websockets simply do not go through  not sure if it's relevant  if it's a zap issue or a dvws issue 
i'm running musiccabinet 0 7 24c   the version of dsub doesn't seem to matter since i update automatically so i'm always on whatever is the most recent on google play    i'm still trying to figure out how to reproduce the problem   i went to check my phone and it did occur but i can't make it happen on command   my usual usage of the app is in my car so i will have songs queued up and playing through the aux  port   once i get where i'm going i pull the cable from the port  autopauses the song     i'll use other apps fine throughout the day and once i go back to use the app a few hours later i will usually run into the issue where i can view everything but the tracks in an album     i tried to use the "send log" and send it to my google drive but it captures a lot more than just things related to dsub  i would have to remove a lot of information to make it something i could send   is it possible to narrow logging down to something only on dsub's end 
i was actually using your sample app and it was exhibiting the "black when scrolling"   i did add     to stickylistheaderslistview in main xml and that did fix the issue  thanks    could adding this in the stickylistheader library be a better solution  in code     if i use a regular listview  then i don't need to add this extra attribute to the list view 
 ns1123  hi  i still not to start worker or any setting for worker  i am trying to run master with this config and encounter this error  thanks 
to confirm my config for  vm stats interval  is also at 60s also on kvm  incidentally  looking at the code  i think vmware and xen are handling this differently  so they may possibly be returning correct results  haven't tested though   yes  tested on 4 11 2 0 4 12 master with ubuntu16 04 18 04 centos7 vms  my stress test ended up running for 5hrs and the metrics never really changed 
sure  will get back to you later
great to hear that  i had no chance to try master yet  is the master branch based on 6 x  i'm really looking forward to try 6 x too 
 tobigr   thescrabi   my device  samsung galaxy a7  2015  model  sm a700fd os  android 6 0 1  marshmallow app version  0 11 1 country  india  did i clean my cache before trying     yes is my device rooted     no  hope this helps 
will have to try  but that's as annoying to do as just closing the tab and saving via popup 
i'd guess when you have no credentials at all  from a clean installation for example

with current master it looks like it now only happens on softmaxderivative
 sevasafris no particular reason  we saw it in the readme and felt it was more appropriate to use it because we use spring boot 
i tried both hardened and leadstone fluxducts as well as basic universal cable from mekanism 
i never experienced this with other connectors using oauth but to be fair i did not play with them as much as i did with concur  there were no other deployments  no reset  nothing  it was on minishift  syndesis tag 1 4 5 so no image updates and i did not run any tests  it was all done manually   exactly what you mentioned   i set the oauth for concur  created concur connection and integration  it was  database    mapper    concur  create listitem     log  body  headers     log  everything   all i did between republishing was editing the mapper step 
i haven't used tox but can certainly give it a go  how shall i find you on there 
 allek5 well i just "hacked" the code in authstate there is the method "getclientsecret" and at line 632 there is the method getclientauthentication   which takes the clientsecret  if any  and acts like that
yes   it started right when i added these 2 mods   i tried last 2 versions in a clean instance and they worked fine   and now in a clean instance with same settings and these 2 mods it loads into world fine   no optifine in either instance

i'm still struggling for this problem  yes its really suspicious  because windows 10 in turkish is installed on my laptop  and turkish has that character    i really dont know how to find out default encoding  but on save as in notepad first encoding option was ansi  and notepad++ shows utf 8 for generated file   i tried now followings for maven compiler plugin  but there is still ı instead i   
yes  it fixes the problem    i will try it with the command line option to provide an extra file and report back  however  i think the property should be included out of the box  otherwise there are files in the payara micro jar that are somewhat superfluous 
i was on m4 before  i am not sure how you want me to add and remove a channel  what do you  want me to do

yeah it worked before the update   sure  i did the copy paste workaround  that works  it just should not be necessary to write your password in plain text somewhere before you paste it into a password field 😉
really  also from cache details navigation menu  not only from cache list 
tested cerberus in qa with     centos 6 5 x86_64    firefox 24 5 esr     jdk 1 7 0_40   ran test case "page vcconfig zipcodesmanagement   0009a" for pt  execution id   12997570   the behaviour is still the same  all actions and controls after the "managedialog" action are not executed  additionally  a screenshot is generated for that action  even though verbose is set to zero and execution result is ok 
there's only shown "event cache"  not earth cache as i wrote at the beginning  in the filter panel above the list    the switch button solved my problem  now i can see all caches again   so i think the "recycle bin" icon is not supposed to clear the filter if it was set on the main screen 
hello and thank you very much for getting back to me  i tried the 0 9 6 package  but the result is the same  what else could be the catch 
well  to be honest  this should be a connection property  rather than a connector property  but the way we have the concur connector now is that you can only change the oauth settings at the connector level  so this makes the  host  property at a setting at connector level    otherwise you might setup oauth urls to point to _implementation_ environment and connection host property to point to _production_ environment   it's also a quirk of concur to have oauth apps that don't span multiple environments  as salesforce  google and twitter do    with that preamble  we only have this need for the concur connector  we don't have it for any other connector we currently ship  and it seems that it's super specific to how concur has things setup  in the long run we might find other systems that work this way  then we need to think about oauth settings at connection level i think   i think users will set these properties mostly once  i think users will mirror the environments they use in syndesis  meaning production syndesis instance would target production environment of a system  and test syndesis instance would target test environment of a system

to create a tilelevel the user must supply an image of the map  the map is a one pixel to one tile ratio  the mapcolor is the color the developer should use in the map image to represent that specific tile   so if the user uses #000000 for the mapcolor than any place in the map image that the color #000000 appears the tile defined mapcolor will appear

i'm able to run the stash plugin using docker  but it always fails using a mac  and we need it to run on a mac to build ios apps   hopefully this helps     i'll have a look and see if i can find the plugin stash pr log for this 
usually it would happen if i just started my computer  opened eclipse  and immediately chose to open my app's map editor  i'll give you more information about exactly what was going on when it happens next time   yeah  17 seconds is a bit much and i usually end up force closing the app when it takes longer than about 7 seconds  once i try it again  it only takes on average 1 second or so   how did you get that profiling view that shows how long each process takes  is that part of eclipse

hi   bug is still there in 2015 04 11 nb  i can reproduce the "loose of filter" when from a filtered list i enter in cache details then i go back to the list  which is not filtered anymore    this occurs on lists  nearby   list caches from map when i use the filtrer status    with trackable   hope this helps to reproduce   ps   it's funny how often developpers are not able to reproduce a bug or how users are not able to explain clearly steps to reproduce a bug

hi jules   yes i expected that it will use the hpo terms associated with the omim id   the error message is really confusing  it gives the impression that some files are missing  maybe we should add a better error  like  please insert hpo terms for method phenix   or convert the omim id to hpo terms 
i'd say it's quite possible    but i woudln't expect it when you are confirming connection

well  maven is fine  but i'd like a jar without the dependencies packaged  the one that would come out of maven if you removed the shade plugin  i think the best option would be to create one jar for inclusion into other projects  with a pom that specifies the dependencies  and  in addition  a standalone jar that can be used directly from the command line  i guess  both of them could be uploaded to maven central with different artifact types  unfortunately  i'm not sure how to get this to work with maven as i have abandoned it in favor of gradle some time ago

it is possible that it wasn't shutdown correctly though this instance is running on one of our cloud servers  we have a policy of not using kill  9 unless there is no other choice  due to the fact that the instance is running in the cloud  nor does the machine ever experience a sudden loss of power  i'll try to get the db  andrey  i think you know this already  but it needs to be stated  a general problem with orient db continues to be that the database is brittle  and over time information is lost  we see this behavior on pretty much all installations

i actually just finished creating a test app that reproduces part of the issues we are seeing  i found a race condition with the building of instabug and updating the user info that i fixed in our code  but there is an issue when we first run the app  instabug won't show  if we exit the app and then reopen the app  instabug seems to work normally  if we force close the app  and reopen the app  instabug won't show  we are initializing instabug in the application  i will post the sample code in a couple of hours

thank you  i just upgraded on google play and i am back in business  if geocaching can be considered "work"  
that is weird  i'm using ubuntu 14 04 running fluxbox  the file in question was one with chinese characters mixed with latin containing     the chinese equivalent of   worked fine   i'll try to find the exact filename and i'll post it here once i find it 
 fyahfox the account list  more generally wherever it takes one back button to quit the app at the moment 
right now it will only happen for unexpected errors  e g   sam is down or we can't connect to it at all for some other reason  like a firewall rule  or they make a breaking change to their api   if you get an authorization error with sam  e g   because you are not registered with fc  we will return an empty list   in other words  for unlikely unexpected events  that still end up occasionally happening 
thanks for your explanation  raphael   from my end  as a user  an activity a is started  if i accidentally selected another new activity b  the   undo   action should cancel b and return back to a  this makes sense because i am still want to stay in activity a   the app currently does follow this common sense  great   but  if i started a and then terminated a  which means i finished a   and then i accidentally selected another new activity b when i actually planned to select activity c  i hope the   undo   action should cancel b but should not restart a  in other words  the app should show    no activity     because i already terminated a  and i do not want to restart a   undoing the full action  including the termination of the previous one  in this case a  will force me to terminate a again before i can start c  which is annoying   also  restarting a affects the duration of a which i selected before   thus  i think this could be a bug or issue that should be resolved to improve user experience  hope my explanation makes sense    thanks

yes  it doesn't show because search results in your case don't give any non unicode chars  try to reproduce it in a unit test  without real connection to github
the pom xml provided in the sample project contains the minimum archives required to compile and run the tests   each one of the archives was added because of a compiler or test run issue in which a needed class was not present   comment out the archive for testng lines 65 69   running the test  "mvn test" displays the following msg   error  org jboss resteasy test core basic byetest  time elapsed  1 082 s      error  java lang reflect invocationtargetexception caused by  java lang noclassdeffounderror  org testng annotations beforeclass  to resolve this i had to add the testng archive    my test code has not changed between quarkus 1 1 1 final and 1 2 0 final updating to version 1 2 0 final this issue occurred 
 mfussenegger thanks for your quick response   i just tried the refresh command and it didn't work  i test this with multiple node  let me setup a single node cluster and try this again  will get back to you later   best regards  ryan

it seems that they're ignored for the effect  at least i got a couple of times where i have the board with 3 metal blocks with  1  move left to dissappear and other tree that were more recent  and block smash+ activated and then there wasn't any more metal blocks in the board
my only use case is the  complete  one    i see no problem with adding the exception argument to  after   having only one is less confusing

we can add a simple  atomicboolean  flag to the  tracker  object  and raise it when  setuserid  is called  then in the following call to the  track  method we could check that flag after the call to  injectbaseparams  and if it's  raised  inject the "deviceparams" and lower the flag  what do you think  d4rken    i ran a little test and seems to be working fine now 
yep  you're right  it works the same way with just code rearrange

yes that's correct for both cases when source branch and target branch are updated   for the case when the target branch is updated  2 rescoped_to events are sent with different values for   pull_request_from_hash   1  one value will be the latest commit on the source branch 2  one value will be the previous commit hash on the target branch 
wow  it is fixed in 1 5 3 snapshot  i will close this issue 
no still trying to fix   
hello  mcomella   i first noticed the bug by going to outlook com to see my mails but i tried it with numerama com to be sure that the bug is not linked to outlook com and it also happened  so the generic steps are  1  go to a website w 1  connect to this website 1  access your profile  or whatever data that need you to be connected to be seen  1  use the notification to clear you navigation 1  go to w again  expected behavior  you should reconnect to see your profile   actual behavior  you do not need to reconnect to see your profile

just update your version  a mute mic button is now available 
nearby uploads did not require significant changes to regular uploads  i think it's very unlikely that the small changes made would have caused the failures  also  the review re  failed uploads was made while production was still in 2 6   if that user was in beta  i'd think he would have used beta feedback instead of quitting beta just so he could post a regular review   i will try and look at what might be causing this when i work on the upload overhaul  it would be very helpful to know where the images were stored etc  though

it did conflict with mystcraft  can´t remember which version i did use the first time  who is reserving the id´s at the wrong time i can´t tell  but my guess is that xcompwiz have more experiences on this area      but my biggest issue was that i needed to update the config file on the client and server side to fix this  if you enter a cm and the config file on the client side is not set to the same dimension as the server side this happened   just let me know if there is any more information you need

i tried first time with v3 7 4 and had the same problem  i updated to dev build just to make sure isnt that version 
you're correct   my phrasing was vague   it's just testrig and  testrig via antlrworks    no other tools 
it was the same issue  possibly   so  i did the following   1  just ran  grakn server start  as a non root user  let's call him user   this resulted in an access denied error  2  modified access rights   sudo chown user user  opt grakn core server services cassandra cassandra yaml    and then tried to  grakn server start  again  this resulted in the same  code 3  error i mentioned above  3   sudo grakn server start  after that has lead to a different error   an error has occurred during boot up  please run 'grakn server status' or check the logs located under the 'logs' directory  process exited with code '100'  ''   the logs have this to say about that last error

unfortunately not  i tried generating a fresh project on a different machine and got a different stack     some notes about my setup    i'm making an xcode project with a single apple_bundle as its target   we don't currently have any tests in the project   i'm creating the project with   build with buck  full command is "buck project    targetname   build with buck"   the xcode project mostly generates  i can open the  xcworkspace and it has all targets  but no schemes  i can manually create the schemes and the project will run   the  xcodeproj file does not have a name  it generates as " xcodeproj" instead of "targetname xcodeproj"    project generation works fine on the sample buck ios project   buck version is a965937ccdadf8119a98ab766c3feb0708dc424e  sorry  i wish i had more specifics  i will update if i make any more progress on the issue 
 tomwhite sorry   i wasn't thinking  we keep hitting this issue in different places and i was assuming you had seen it before  the issue is that there was no spec for contig names  and when they made hg38 they allowed contig names like  hla 1 3 52   6+  which are terrible because they are ambiguous with the format for specifying intervals   everyone in the world who wrote software that parses contig names and intervals was using the implicit assumption that     and     didn't appear in the contig names and write intervals as  contig start stop    so we had to modify all the code that parses intervals to first try to understand it as a complete contig name and if that matches a contig in the sequence dictionary stop parsing it     i will track down a file that triggers the issue 
apparently  this is also a known issue in java map implementation  keys can also leak if they are mutable    i guess its the users responsibility to be careful 
i think it's not a specific image problem   all gifs begins starting animation late than before

do you think that an  naturalcomparatorifpossible  comparator would be possible     the check to verify the type of element would occur only once  and wouldn't require a catch to  classcastexception   and this would just add an additional boolean evaluation and a method call  if you're worried about performance then you could maybe remove the method call and put everything in the  compare    method  also that comparator should be thread safe event if mutable as the only state shared is the boolean  and even if it's overridden  it shouldn't be an issue  that comparator can't be shared across many trees as the  usenatural  is specific to a tree   do you think this could work

let me see if i am misunderstanding  yoosiba  my understanding was that the library manager lets you add dependencies that you use in your project  your project should be tested against whatever dependencies you define  but the tests of the dependencies themselves should not be run in the context of your project   in other words  if for some reason react used mangelhaft  we should not run react's tests because we are using that library  or if online presence used stdlib  we shouldn't run stdlib's tests when we are testing onlinepresence  stdlib has its own test  own build cycle  own everything    in other words we don't test the things we use  we only test how we use them  that is my understanding

thanks for the quick answer  i'm using the following maven release  which i believe is the latest release  as 3 3 6 is still snapshot   there seems to be no such constructor  new fftw_iodim int n   which would let me specify an array length  the only constructors present are   new fftw_iodim    and  new fftw_iodim pointer p    so do i have to use  calloc  or  realloc  to allocate a void  array   put my fftw_iodim in there and then use the pointer cast constructor  new fftw_iodim pointer p   with that array   also  suppose i would not use the  fftw_iodim_do_not_use_me  class but instead the normal   fftw_iodim   how would i set the parameters

i thank you for taking the time to analyze my humble request and respond in kind   my goal was to suggest or provide myself  a slight enhancement to your very rational approach to a rules library   keeping things simple  not trying to boil the ocean   i'm buried right now  but i will submit a pull request and examples for you to consider  within the coming weeks   i think the deep hierarchy issue requires more analysis   i'd love to know the more complicated use cases engaged by library users   my intuition says it's probably not as big of a problem as one might think  especially if you manage expectations up front  a user of the library who cares to decorate an abstract "rule" class gets the responsibility of implementing their solution s  correctly     btw  i'm using your library for an iot project at a fortune 10 company  and i've noticed that the division of code implementing the when   then   methods is seldom 50 50 but more like 90 10 or 80 20 in either direction  so that might factor into the deep hierarchy analysis   best wishes  dave

 xlambchopsx  don't worry  i'm not even sure aimsicd   needs   to start before radio connection  but as  e3v3a already mentioned  letting it start up on boot and restarting it upon kill would rock 
it is jenkins ver  1 531   regards   daniel
i can reproduce is fairly reliably in our test environments  running it concurrently on 25+ servers makes finding these issues pretty easy    i'll try the window length option next week   the particular topic that experiences this issue gets a burst of traffic just after the start up process completes  priming a bunch of caches with some reference data    this was on the latest release  aeron 0 9 8   agrona 0 5 1  
uh  actually  its working  i spoke too soon    been working on this for hours now  updated to 1 7 2 beta  running 1 6 4 resonant rise     all good  sorry for taking your time
i am also using 2 0 2 version but still facing the issue 
yes you are right    i made a mistake  the functioning of the buffers of energy changed between mc 1 6 4 and mc 1 7 10   i made test and that works correctly  the machine did not work at the moment or i returned inside    at the time it has me seemed strange  i would pay more attention in the future     sorry for the disturbance     can i close the issue    i will prevent people who looks at me that it is me who am deceived to me    _    so  i do not know if it's a good one place to speak about it but i made a mod spotlight of ender io 2 0 in french  i cover the mod since its release in 1 5 2 you can put me on the site  i made the first part and the others arrive in the weekend     thanks for your answer and for ender io    ps  sorry for my english  but it is reverso   ' have a nice day  
good to hear  no problem at the meantime i use those without with_ack_receipt  but although without such ack  if i send it with reliable  i have no need and it's alright to operate with _with_ack_receipt if i don't do anything after another end ack back   on a side  could you please point me out to jraknet documentation  i can find only simple demo code that client server connects with each other but not send receive any packets  i might miss something  thank you marf 
here is the result of your suggested change  sorry  what do you mean by command line args in terminal view  i am debugging direclty using f5  the application runs successfully but fails to debug       error1  https   user images githubusercontent com 22391260 45144282 fb6d9c00 b1bd 11e8 86c5 8c0a6d898731 jpg 
hi   after setting this option to false  the problem is no longer encoutered  thanks   the problem is i am working on a protected project  perhaps is there a way to communicate you my ontology without letting everybody access to it   kinds regards   ga

it's a limitation of the browse  not the appbuilder   for a variable or expression displayed without    the column is added but it has name       when walking the widget tree of the browser it's not possible to identify those columns   if  myvariable   myvariable  is used the column widget name will be "myvariable"

hi david  no  i don't have a working xml file for this sensor  ozwcp also never worked reliably for me   on the other hand  maybe i can help you with the bit fiddling  if this is your problem   if you just want to have bit 3 enabled it should be a decimal 8  2³   and also a hex 8  0x08     dieter
i don't think i can  it needs root access right  my device is pretty niche so i haven't found a way to root it yet and my usb cord's broken 
i just found out  setcheckboxselected    works as expected  but  ischeckboxselected i   don't work  at least in my app    nothing special really 
after updating i did not notice the bug again  though my network has been connected to a battery since then  i'll try to reconstruct the original situation in a creative world when i have time 
please go ahead i won't have time to fix this  best of luck   
the pr i mentioned is just a first step to bring more transparency into the process  by no means the goal     "recent" is very tricky when you index concurrently different documents of different sizes on different nodes  depending on how things run  there is no notion of a clear "recent" shard as each replica may be behind on different documents  all in flight  i currently have some thoughts on how to approach this better but it's early stages  one of the options is take make a intermediate step which will indeed involve some heuristic around "recency" 
hi  android 9 0  all permissions enabled except for access to read notifications   speaking of permissions  the first setup screen with the option to set or skip permissions setup is confusing  it should be clearly stated which permissions are required for the app to work and the purpose of the permissions  ideally permissions should be asked runtime  not upfront 
no  but it shouldn't exclude directories just because they contain a buck file   it should only exclude directories if that buck file defines a project_config for that directory module   an example would be a module containing a lib  directory which in turn contained both  jar files and a buck file with a load of prebuild_jar entries  since the commit referenced above  that lib  directory is being excluded from its parent module and is therefore hidden in intellij  it wouldn't make sense to put a project_config   in lib buck because there are no appropriate src_roots    there are no sources 
are you sure you have schema links in your config files  i don't think i'm doing anything unusual  at least nothing i'm aware of    below is my launch config 
sorry but the only information that we have is that json  the server receive it from a reporting tool  we don t  know what action the user has done  or in what step the error occur

 spacecowboy i forgot to add that i'm using the  neo4j python driver  https   neo4j com developer python #neo4j python driver   here's the neo4j  session run    section  everything works except when i want to add a long super long string  at  app_file_base64  
unfortunately it's rendering exactly the same in 0 3 10  that version was the first version of your app i tried and where i first spotted the issue but didn't report it  i saw 1 0 0 and hoped this may have fixed the issue  especially with the note about headings  but i saw it was the same and thought it was about time i reported it   note that my workflow  when converting these previously text only files to markdown is generally just to add headings  i e  ## in front of lines  and that is when things seem to go wrong   if you would like a non redacted version of the  md file  for easier reading  let me know a non public way i can get it to you 
it's referenced in the push fixes branch  so it will close when that branch is merged

yes  for each mc versions i created a solo game  saved it  and then quit mc  tried also with mc 1 6 4  and amidst works correctly  tried also with mc 1 4 7  and amidst crashes   but i found something interresting  there is a problem between mc launcher 1 6 61  i do not tried with other launchers  and mc versions lower than 1 6    in the launcher  i create a profile lower than 1 6  1 5 2 for exemple  and then i redefine in the profile editor an other game directory  then i start mc and created a solo game  cut just one tree  save my game and quit mc  after that i reopen mc and my solo game have been disapeared   i open my file explorer and the world files are correctly stored in the new directory  then i'm going into the original saved game directory and i find a second directory corresponding to my world  but this one is really badly configured  i suppressed this directory and copy my world save from the new directory to the original  i start mc and it's magic   my solo world now exists  i open it and play again before save it and quit mc  then with my explorer  in the new directory  files dates correspond to me playing time  but in the original mc directory  files dates are wrongs   si i deduce that mc loads game from the original saved games directory  but stores it in the new directory  with mc version higher or equal than 1 6  this problem doesn't exist   i don't know if there is a relation between this fact and my problem with the use of mc   1 6 but i find this coincidence really strange  so i created a new profile in 1 5 2 with the original game directory  created a world  played just one minute  saved it and then quit  but amidst crashed again   ps   i know there are a lot of english faults     i'm sorry and hope that you will understand what i tried to talk about     i'm french   
i am not sure why  but i have been unable to get any traffic coming from strongbox  requests and responses from clients to strongboxes are showing up fine  but requests from strongbox to the web are not showing up in my proxy program fiddler   maybe does strongbox not respect the system proxy  or fiddler is not capturing everything for some reason  i am not sure why  but i am working on it

at least full application on off would be helpful   yes  i use traccar web for 20 cars with gps data and there's a problem with some  half  that  every minute  send same positions  10 x  7am  20pm   13 hours  x 60 minutes   7200 per day x 1 week   a lot of entries   i should filter from the datasource so that the db doesn't get redundant data  i'll do it anyway  but i found strange the high cpu and analyzing queries in the db  found it was related to events     btw   my gps data collector only gets data at work hours    so  by night  it's all devices being 'offline' x devicetimeout

i don't think it's a matter of 2d vs 3d  if you have a game where you control the player or something else  with the mouse  e g  moba or strategy game controls  not clamping the mouse can often times result in unwanted behavior  especially in full screen mode  i agree though  that maybe this shouldn't be the default

alright  will do  has been a while since i have been doing these things so i forgot that i should isolate the problem first with any client side graphical mods  p thanks  i will remove them one by one and see when it stops occurring   edit  oh  and it's not smoothfont  i removed that first because i suspected it  didn't make a difference  so either xray or clienttweaks  will see     edit 2  apparently  it's neither  i think it may be portalgun but in order for me to continue investigating  i will need to play singleplayer and not multiplayer  i will come back once i have more information

i apologise for the delays in a reply  but we have found the following out     pterodactyl does not make the folder read only when the server is running   we tried your fix with  # libloader jar  but to no avail   same error as before   the error specifically states that forge can't lock the base of our container  so i'm not sure what's going on there   we have other "mixin" mods  mods that don't originate from the pack itself  working just fine  so we don't think it's the tickprofiler mod's fault   however  i am now out of ideas to try to fix it    and the fact that a fresh spongeforge server running on my local machine works fine baffles me

yes  i removed the old files in tomcat and redeployed the new war file   hmm this is odd  i realize now i was wrong when i said it was showing the wrong colours and styling   it is actually just applying the default bootstrap css  i have been using a bootstrap css theme  http   bootswatch com superhero   and it worked properly with version 2 0 2 0  however with 2 0 3 0  it seems like it's not picking up everything from the new bootstrap css file  and the elements on webpage are from the basic bootstrap css   with some parts from the new css  like the brand in the navbar    could this be a solution  http   gwtbootstrap github com gwt bootstrap apidocs com github gwtbootstrap client ui config configurator html i will try this later  missed this earlier because all was working with version 2 0 2 0

hi   no   i'm not using packrat  yes   listinstalledpackages reproduces the error and i've produced a traceback  i've done this from my imac  which shows exactly the same issue  rather than the macbook pro so if there is a slight discrepancy between the first report and the second that will be why    traceback txt  https   github com rstudio rstudio files 2466207 traceback txt

yes this appeared after migrating to 0 8 6  i guess it has to to with the fact  that the look of lumen changed with this release  yep i also noticed this behavior

i'll check it out but i definitely think that will solve the issue    have you looked into deferredregistry t  and registryobject t   it's a slightly more complex system but it automatically generates suppliers that are then automatically registered  allowing for static initialization of anything that has a forge registry  i mostly based the code in mysticalworld on  tropicraft's system  https   github com tropicraft tropicraft blob 1 14 src main java net tropicraft core common block tropicraftblocks java    my library for it in mysticallib  https   github com mysticmods mysticallib blob 1 14 src main java epicsquid mysticallib registry modregistry java  is still fresh   here's an example of it  https   github com mysticmods mysticalworld blob 1 14 src main java epicsquid mysticalworld init modblocks java    i'm not sure if it would precisely resolve the issue in this case  but at the very you'll be able to tell if the serializer is being accessed  before  the actual registry event for the serializer    just beware that it's better to do entitytypes statically    upon testing  there's now another error that appears to be shifting back to an optional failing  so     i think it's fixed 
hi   sorry  so the complete context is that we have a container running latest jetty 9 3 10 v20160621 and unfortunately we're stuck with that  cometd java however is using 9 2 18 v20160721   between 9 2 18 v20160721 and 9 3 10 v20160621 there have been some refactorings within the jetty library  and trying to use cometd with 9 3 10 v20160621 generates the issue below      where  pathspec  here is now  org eclipse jetty http pathmap pathspec  instead   so at runtime when an instance of  jettywebsockettransport  is created  an instance of  servletpathspec  is requested as part of initialisation  which in turn will trigger a classloader lookup  with the expectation to find a  org eclipse jetty websocket server pathmap pathspec  which doesn't exist anymore   what's more important is that there could be a series of such things that would break at runtime  and these would prevent running cometd on more recent versions of jetty

nope  that's a different issue  this registration must be perfomed in the sm metrics extension

i think building a minimal jar file and shipping the assets folder is good for a number of reasons 
 testforstephen sorry  i can't include the full argfile  here's a potentially relevant portion however    it looks like both the  app main  and  app test  folders are being included in the classpath  is this possibly a bug  or is there a way for me to specify some classpath exclusion for a particular directory

in the underground structure that looks like that included photo  if you use the block breaker from actually additions to break the respawning ore block it will collect the ore into the actually additions block breaker inventory and it still drops the same ore onto the ground  so you get 2x the amount from the structure  not sure if that is sufficiently explained now  maybe dupe bug is the wrong term

hmm  the phone and pebble classic were both just laying on my desk  20 40cm apart from each other  while i was sleeping  so no moving  no  active nor passive missed  phone call or anything in between  also no missed call in the morning  could just be that i got some e mails  but this also never had any influence on the connection behaviour of gadgetbridge  while wearing it or just over night laying on my desk    last time was also "randomly" without phone call before  but i was driving my car 2 weeks ago   if i am doing phone calls they get announced on the pebble  but afterwards pebble stays initialized in gadgetbridge  so doing phone calls or getting phone calls have never made issues problems   and yep  i am on latest 2 9 1 firmware   maybe there is a "alive" package from phone or gadgetbridge missing while bluetooth connection is active and therefore pebble closes the connection  i mean i was able by tapping on pebble  in gadgetbridge  one or two times to get connection initialized again  therefore i assume that bluetooth was still working and pebble is recognized as pebble and not as mi band or anything else like versions before  what could be  i also had the problem  that if coming home while taking phone with me and pebble stays at home  that i had to switch bluetooth on and off to connect to pebble again    but i do not remember if i first tested just tapping on pebble in gadgetbridge or not  but automatically reconnecting was also not working  but from this behaviour i also missed to save a log  i will check in the afternoon after coming home again how if phone will connect to pebble and will paste the logs  
i see  i'm using vscode  is ghidra telling eclipse to disable the timeout or does eclipse do it automatically  if it's the latter then i'll report this to  vscode java test  https   github com microsoft vscode java test   if it's an eclipse setting then it may be available for me to change since vscode java is using eclipse jdt ls

similar to how a train knows that it's being locked i suppose  locomotives hook into the train object to inspect the list of tracks locking the train  the same concept could be applied to tokens  though i haven't decided yet how to prevent trains from the entering the block  whether you will need a track or if it "just knows"

in the second example  i was expecting the "join lines" to be grayed out  because the result will introduce a syntax error  and we are talking about an ide who understands the syntax of the language  not a simple text editor that treats each line as "text"   i just checked pycharm  and it behaves like in the erlang case     which is funny      up to you to decide if the second case is expected behavior or a bug

hi  thanks to take a look   it happens in a samsung with v21 and in the emulator v26  as mentioned is hard to reproduce manually so i add a breakpoint on the oncreate  on that moment i turn the device and continue the debugger   what it might be important to say is that i am initializing the adapter onactivitycreated inside the fragment      so  what i can see with the debugger is   activity oncreate    turn device    onacrtivitycreated    init adapter    activity recreates    onactivitycreated is called again  new view  new adapter     init new adapter    post runnable from old adapter is called    nullpointer because it misses the reference

i should have mentioned  this exact same code works fine when using the '3 1 0' version of the library   all i did was swap the library to use '4 0 0 beta1'    sure  i called the library using the code i listed above  1  the dialog opens as it did in version 3    2  i clicked on a folder  which opened up to list some files on my device 3  i selected a file and hit ok  as a test  i created a new android project with a single button that calls the intent as shown above   i used the default style and activity declaration as shown in your readme   i'm getting the same exception on both an android 5 and android 7 device

yes i am using citizens2 and shopkeepers  the error only started happening when i updated stackmob   i understand that its not caused by stackmob  however  the error is  hence  it would be good idea to handle it  i made a pr check it out let me know if its ok 🙂 #78
it can run react 5 without any problems on the same server  it currently have 4gb of ram to play with  it crashes every time it run any  re command

there will be an error  unknown property "issaled" in return type  if the  mapping like this  it can be work   mapping target   "saled" expression    "java null   entity getissaled       1   entity getissaled   "   why the target is saled but not issaled  sorry  english is poor  it's may be hard to understand    
after my latest attempt to fix this problem  i have been unable to reproduce the problem on two different platforms  i am closing this issue  if anyone else experiences this problem after release 0 update 0  and i expect some other platforms will experience something like it anyway   open a new issue 
 fviale yes  something similar was used     however  i think it's more a workaround since the same configuration  i mean number of pa nodes and tasks submitted  but a different sleep timeout value in task code  reduced to 25 seconds  does not make exceed the default limit  this last observation let me think it is more an application problem than a system configuration issue 
as far as i'm aware there doesn't seem to come up anything special in console when it happens 
 ktoso  will do now   did you try the steps in the example to reproduce on your system   on mine  i most definitely see the problem 
thank's for fast answer  yes i'm using maven  and  0 6  stable version   now i downloaded  0 7 snapshot  from     i will investigate all errors  but there is a lot of stack trace o_o

 dcbriccetti sorry for that poor description  it's not exactly about "words"  look at the part of form           data id "a26280000014qdjaae"                       start                         end                         today                         deviceid                         simid                         phonenumber                         phonenumber                           text                          phonenumber                       closemessage             data   as you can see  the questions are inside group with name  phonenumber  so the path is like   data phonenumber text  where the path to automatically added  hidden question at the beginning of a form is   data phonenumber   the same problem occurs if we use one of other existed name   start    end  etc   this case should be caught by form builder creator but someone might edit a form manually so my fix is only to avoid the crash

i put 5 0 in the title because that's the version i was testing  it seems that although some of these are not new strings  they weren't truncating in previous versions   so seems like some are regressions   i don't have a previous build or screenshots to tell though  but i filed truncation issues for the previous release  and these strings weren't part of the truncations  i believe 
 ice1000 thank you very much for the reply   sadly  still the same problem  code is now
it happens intermittently  but when it does happen that's pretty much how it is  repeated presses of the back button navigate the page in the background back  but the overlay stays on top  only a restart of the app appears to fix it   the issue started after the mathjax update so it may be that  also this morning my phone updated to android 7 1 1 so that may be related  but i don't remember if i encountered the issue yesterday 
my apologizes for the less provided informations  i thougt that my description were sufficient enough    windows 10 version 1709  project sdk  1 8 0_144 project language level  8  important for reproducing this error  my maven pom      my presumption  as described earlier  is that jda 3 3 1_299 is compiled with java 9  where the method  java nio buffer flip    is overwritten by  java nio shortbuffer flip     used at  net dv8tion jda core audio audioconnection encodetoopus audioconnection java 537    if i use java 1 8 0_144 and project language level 8  then i get a  java lang nosuchmethoderror  exception  because my runtime tries to call the method  java nio shortbuffer flip     which does not exist under java 8 and should be  java nio buffer flip

changing the name is not a problem in vscode  it's the id that matters  we just have to update the docs  if you look at the other extensions in the marketplace  mentioning the company name in the name is not common  red hat is really the exception here  also we always show the publisher along with name and description

hi   i had fixed this issue  it turned out that i have to disable the security manager  after i disable it  i can sent data to s3 now 
so my current approach looks like this 
that's a great guess  but i've already compiled most  if not all  of my static dependencies pic   i'm out sick today  but one example is that dyld won't be able to find the shared library for gtest main   bizzarrely  that's a bazel built shared library completey unrelated to the other dependecy with the static child  which happens to be grpc    so in this unit test example   ''' cc_test        deps        "gtest main"     "grpc"  # depends on static foo a             the so for gtest main will not be found unless i set linkstatic 1 on grpc   strange but true 
hey  dariuszseweryn  thanks for taking a look at this  for us  yes  receiving the indication is important to the transmission    our use case is that when we subscribe to the characteristic it fires a characteristic change event with a value  we then write to another characteristic which causes us to receive another characteristic change event with another value that we combine into a key    i have had better results when writing the client descriptor myself while starting to observe the change event from rxblegattcallback

thanks  updated to 2 0 3 snapshot  the bug fixed 
i am not sure about that because i do not know that much about mail spec which is a bit complicated    but only in  if  content instanceof string        we check if something is attachment and https   docs oracle com javaee 6 api javax mail part html#getcontent 28 29 says  for example  the object returned for "text plain" content is usually a string object  so usually    always     what if it is going to be inputstream or something else for some other mimetype  anyway i do not think it can happen very often  probably only if some other library will mess with datahandlers or some other case but i havent seen that yet   but since we are here there is one more thing to consider  _  which is connected to previous one  what about images  for example  image png  that are inline  they will usually go to if  content instanceof inputstream        or the new else      since there is no check for disposition they will be always treated as attachment  but i think that images can be also inline  probably some other stuff theoretically can be inline to   for example some email clients can show images inside message and some other show them as attachments  but we loose that information     anyway i am not sure what you should do in such case  email addmessage   which doesnt seem right since it is usally for text plain  text html  or maybe there should be email addinline

i believe this used to work fine and was only recently introduced seeing as it was used as a solution in a previous post  https   github com runelite runelite issues 2719   i originally tested this on java 8 until i updated to the latest version so i believe it's not related to the version of java    i'd like to also mention the issue only occurs when using the gpu plugin and works fine otherwise

edit  i just tested by deleting the community bridge directory and letting it reload with a server restart  i made all the config edits again and tested   this test is with craftbukkit 1 7 2   i'm still getting the same problems  it adds the group the player is in  but it doesn't remove the old group that they are no longer a part of   also  it made that same null yml file again   also  it still only   i was using the latest spigot build for 1 7 9   i just loaded up craftbukkit 1 7 2 build and it still does the same thing  no player file is created in the players folder and it only adds groups rather than remove groups they are not a part of   my next test is going to be to delete my config file and let it reload with your latest update that you just released couple day's ago

lol  i should have said the previous version  i'll try this new version and let you know my results 
yes  we have different self parameterized classes  but also java's enum can be listed as a cause of stack overflow  as enum is in fact enum lt e extends enum lt e gt  gt    we have tried to use custom serializers for those unbounded generic classes  like abc t    but it seems that gwt jackson first analyzes the class hierarchy  before starting to generate the mappers and using custom serializers   i have put some system out println into jtypename java  to log the visited classes  to trace what is happening  and as said  just the fact that some problematic class is on the classpath  and never used for the serialization  causes stack overflow  when matching object or     fields  this means that if i have some java bean  with some abc    field  every known class will be processed as a possible candidate for " "   because i saw many gwt ui classes  like listbox etc  which are never serialized  not even referenced by the serialization classes  but were listed in the console   i must mention  that this happens with gwt unit tests  currently we cannot try this in the normal hosted mode in the browser 
 ibuziuk i'm updating it via the command   kubectl edit cm che   and afterwards i restart the che pod with   kubectl scale   replicas 0 deployment che   and   kubectl scale   replicas 1 deployment che     how do i read the value of   che_workspace_devfile__registry__url'' of the che pod 
yes  this is the github link i provided above  same link as last issue but you can update the project to get the new module that contains the code 
again  the mod is checking permissions  i even posted 3 ways one item on project e tests for permissions before breaking a block  as for the plugin to cancel the drop  considering this has happened with 3 different protection plugins  i'm only going to assume this is a sponge bug   i wish you would read what i've already put in the first post before asking that 
ok  apologies for being vague  in order to invoke the issue  in my pom i specify   gwtquery 1 4 3 snapshot enhance plugin 1 0 5  the issue is that when i drag an element  in ios i just see rettt in the console many times  this console message is generated in com google gwt query client plugins events eventslistener  in it's onbrowserevent   method   i tried it on my nexus 7 and no issue  but on my old ipad ios 8 1 1  the drag doesn't work  and when i attach the ipad to my imac  i see the rettt in the console        what is quite interesting is that this issue even shows up when i test in sdm mode in chrome with touch emulation enabled  when i select nexus 7 emulation  no problem  but if i select iphone6 or ipad 1 2  i have the issue   so is it related to my  gwt xml    here's my gwt xml     xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"    module rename to "gwt_module"       module 
i'll check   interesting bit was that i had a few blocks  sadly not all  in a chest and they were ok  just world placed blocks poofed 
for example  i want streaming video youtube via opera mini java  but after click "watch video"  its not responding  in version 1 2 6 test2 and lower its still can responding to video player 
hi  here is the attached capture   regards    screenshot_qksms_20180419 093002 1  https   user images githubusercontent com 38519576 38977895 01ab58bc 43b6 11e8 9e86 b270daaf85fe png 
the screenshot is from dynmap  full world render right after the regeneration   but that explains why the world has only terrain generated   don't forget the command bug here   i do the "pregeneration" of the world to reduce the server load when players are online and moving around to find other biomes or so  if i only generate the terrain  there is still lost of work for my cpu when the decoration is generated  so this will not really do  what i want   totally remove world generation lag   maybe a config paramter can do the trick here  so i can switch to full generation  terrain + decoration  for every filler run  to toally remove that i need additional cpu load for that  because with every change in a chunk dynmap is refreshing the map too  causing additional load 
thanks

that sounds great  any idea when a version with the fix will be available in fdriod  i'd prefer to not have to install the apk directly   i agree  colons in filenames are not great  but some artists   podcasts put colons in the names of the titles of songs episodes  so they inevitably end up in the filenames     there are lots of music players that can play files that have colon in their name  i'm not sure what the technical limitation of parsing out special characters from a file name would be    the default music player that ships with lineage os   music player  https   github com maxfour music player   simple music player  https   github com simplemobiletools simple music player   vanilla music  https   github com vanilla music vanilla  there are other's i'm sure  these are just the ones that worked as i went down the list of music players in fdroid  i prefer the ui in odyssey and how it handles relative path playlists  so i'd really rather continue using it rather than switching to something else if this can be fixed   edit  i'm not a java programmer  but in the commit mentioned above  why not split on "   " instead of " " to handle urls

when i added a deadline or timeout to the request  it terminated after the expected duration with a timeout  however  no request was ever initiated over the wire   i looked over the places where the  catch  throwable t      log    pattern is used with executors  in every case i saw  it looked like the log was a last ditch effort to alert the user that something that should _never_ happen had happened  since these cases represent legitimately irrecoverable errors  perhaps _catastrophic failure_ is appropriate  grpc can't fix the problem  and likely the user's code can't either without recompilation

 brettwooldridge  hikaricp version was 2 7 4 but i've changed it to 3 1 0  problem is persist using both versions   minimum idle is 2 but 0 doesn't do much too  maximum pool size is 20 but i've tried it with 5  nothing really changed    nunnrlc  should i really stop them that way  because as you see in the initialization method i always stop the previous dataset if the conditions are met  i've debugged it for a while and it seems to be work right  i mean it creates a new dataset when it's needed 
yeah that must be it    but we should find out what the matter is  because if it can happen that would be really bad

it looks like the problem is that remote posts have an id similar to  tag null channels buddycloud org  user github topics buddycloud org posts 092f2389 38e8 445c a347 6e1bd3308add   and local posts just have  092f2389 38e8 445c a347 6e1bd3308add   so when you prepend it with a node name  for local posts you have node id and for remote posts you have node tag node id  right     so why are remote posts stored with a tag node id   wouldn't just storing the post id  without node and tag  which can be found elsewhere anyway  solve this     spoiler alert  i'm not a fan of parsing ids  which are supposed to be opaque strings  i had to add it in the node server for requests that return results from several nodes at once  but i didn't like it

hi  climbage   sorry for the delayed response   my java version is oracle jdk 7 45  centos 6 6 this behaviour of hanging only happens for certain value of geometry point  my work around was to print the point before calling geodesicdistanceonwgs84 function  the value of point that hangs geodesicdistanceonwgs84 causes printing of the same to crash  i catch the exception and don't call geodesicdistanceonwgs84 for those odd point values   what i have not been able to figure out is in which case i end up creating a point that manifests this behaviour

the gcal binding  not really a binding  could implement its function without the consoleinterpreter   it has a simple syntax   wiki  https   github com openhab openhab wiki gcal binding   where the description field of a google calendar entry is in the format     at the start and end time of the calendar entry  it will either send a command or post an update to the named item with the given state or command   so gcal could be made to work correctly under oh1 and oh2 if a subset of the consoleinterpreter code were incorporated directly into it   in fact  it would make more sense not to use the consoleinterpreter  since the consoleinterpreter sends messages to the console  as if someone is issuing commands there   another reason not to use the consoleinterpreter is that it performs more function than what is documented in the wiki  which seems unsafe in terms of what the user might expect 
i'm having trouble reproducing the problem  i created a new unity project added a script and imported the project in consulo  this time though it didn't pick up any of the unity classes either  as before though it still found the namespaces    i tried restarting the ide but that didn't work  then i deleted the    consulo   project directory and imported the project again and this time the everything worked correctly  including the astarpathfinding files   i've tried deleting the project an creating a new one but now i just cannot recreate the problem  i've also deleted and reimported my other project and that's fixed the problem 
oddly enough  the bugs only appeared while on a dedicated server  we have improvable skills 3 which has a max health skill and we also have botania which has a ring capable of adding hearts  it was really strange where the text was still displayed and flashing colors but then it would also change our max hp back to 20 every other tick while every other tick had it going back to the other value  while in singleplayer the bugs didn't seem to appear 
  it happens on samsung galaxy s7 and s8     yes  it happens every time   i have to check logcat  i'll write you again

hi axel    i've found that the root cause is that i use data sources with autocommit mode set to false  in this case even extremely simple case  just schema history table creation without any migration  fails in concurrent environment  i've reproduced it in naive test  here  https   github com apanasevich flyway commit 03a47e00a355106a1d5f9f6fb1cca20bf0360687  in a separate branch    also  i've commited a  fix  https   github com apanasevich flyway commit 8afe727e6ae073af7e0c4f6e111b0e64080015cd  in another branch  could you take a look on it  if you find it correct  i'll create a pr   unfortunately  i can't find any test in the repository  so  i've checked the fix only with postgresql  but i think the problem is related to other dbmses 
just tested it  with this release version  i'm having exactly the same problem  can't undo until i open  and close  an experiment  this mean at startup of course  until i launch a simulation   here also  no redo even afterlauchung relaunching experiment   when i say opening experiment  i don't have to run any model  just go to the "simulation perspective" by choosing an experiment 
i'm using the latest version  i just updated easer today 
settings  protocol unfortunately does not include any entry for the crash
thanks  looking forward to your investigation  please let me know if you require any further information 
this happens on master and latest published snapshot   7 8 snapshot    the   optimized   part looks suspicious
i am not exactly sure but yes i was playing with update settings for threadpool 
no writes to internal sd in my case prolongs the lifespan  also  maybe caching in memory could be an option for devices with more ram  maybe adding a wrapper over the caching stuff that allows to choose either file cache or ram cache    also no traces of 4chin on storage

 leoek  absolutely  as you can see from https   github com pspdfkit react native blob fec925dcc83aeba9fe25e3658644d55cb1fe5629 windows reactnativepspdfkit reactnativepspdfkit pspdfkitviewmanager cs#l63 l105 we were creating a css file that can be passed to the pspdfkit for windows framework  this file would subsequently be passed to a  webview  which drives the pspdfkit for windows framework  but because of file limitations within uwp  you cannot simply pass a file from a local path to the  webview  to  fetch   it has to be a file within the web context which is what https   docs microsoft com en us windows uwp app resources uri schemes#ms appx and ms appx web explains  the issue here is that the files accessible from the web context is only from the install folder  in production mode  it is not possible to write or move into the install folder for security reasons  which is understandable   this is why previously it was working when debugging but not when deploying   i hope this is understandable and just ask if you need any other clarification 
oddly enough  i've tried multiple times  and cant replicate it in any world  one of the weirdest bugs i've ever experienced  so i'm not sure if it's even fixable on your end  i can break all the blocks and replace and it still happens  i can spawn in the blocks needed and it still happens  but only in this world  it's strange 
your example works until i add the config server starter as dependency      even if configuration in config server is empty or even if it doesn't connect to config server   wiremock server port  is 0

i have several fixed issues which might be released very soon  but there is no hurry  i can delay it until you are ready to release 0 0 4    btw  why would you version less4j with alpha or beta since the version is 0 0 x which implicitly means that it is kind of alpha  it would help if you would document the reasoning behind versioning used for less4j

hey  aguibert     when calling  jsonb tojson account getpriceplancurrent     the root object is of class   priceplan hibernateproxy something   and the serializer is engaged  because this goes through  serializeroot     the object   tenant   inside of the   priceplancurrent   is not serialized using my serializer  it goes through objectserializer's  marshallproperty     the same goes if i do  jsonb tojson account    it is crucial to have this because a proxy might be out of session an uninitialized and i need to be able handle that properly in my serializer

hi   dennisoelkers  i don't think so  it does get appended to other commands like webpack and generally they run fine i'd say  here is another excerpt  the failure in this is due to something else i think  considering the circumstances  it was working before tm   minus the tests  the problem with checkproductionbuild is more like a side show event i wanted to get out of the equation     in terms of enviroment configuration  i have set http_proxy  https_proxy as well as ftp_proxy  and again in lowercase  because some things like them uppercase  other lowercase  in the  etc enviroment  additionally i added a proxy entry to  etc maven settings xml  i may have performed a blood sacrifice at some point to get the proxy working for yet another maven plugin  but i think that was for a different project  not graylog

we use maven as the build system for openhab  my dependencies in the pom xml look like this    so  when i build my jar with the first set of deps  when it runs on my ubuntu 16 04 platform  it fails with the error shown in my first post  when it runs on 18 04  it runs fine   when i build with the second set of deps  it works fine on both platforms   one thing i should point out    in both cases i'm specifying jna 5 4 0  since that's the jna version that openhab includes  that's different than the jna version specified by lazysodium 4 2 4 
need to check that  in case it doesn't it seems a duplicate of #4611

i was using jitpack to enable direct builds from github so if i needed to make changes to clarity i could do so in a fork and build it directly   i suppose i can use the central version in current master and use clarity head in source2 branch   that said  a tagged release should probably not break

  the repetition of a bug  permit priorisation of a redundant detected bug    _correspond to number of testcase where the same bug id has been created on the corresponding tag execution _      yes  that what i had in mind  "testcases affected" would be a clearer title for user understanding      i have in mind the fact that bugid are open to the testcaselevel  but it seemed to me that it was more precise to open a bug at the execution level because the  country robot combinaison could impact the execution   but in reality  this is maybe too specific to my organisation and some users do not use countries in cerberus  so yes  link the testcase associated should be the better solution       if  noko fa    then no bug reported      the collapse could be close like screen attached  user will be aware of the feature  but it would not disburb users  what do you think      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 29098010 32368318 afe149dc c085 11e7 8399 17ea16fa7cde png   here is the new mock up        buglist  https   user images githubusercontent com 29098010 32370121 3813c4e6 c08c 11e7 8c23 f2497a816a87 jpg

your comment gave me an idea   it may be that hbase prescribes this behavior   from  hbase's client proto  line 144   https   github com apache hbase blob 543c64d2e9d2fc608ef65cafd485a910d4b8d480 hbase protocol src main protobuf client proto#l144      this seems like it should be interpreted as "delete row r "  does that make sense   maybe asynchbase needs to internally realize the no op nature of the request and simply not send it    or just a warning in the comments of the  deleterequest  constructors that present a  byte     qualifiers  parameter  
nope  no response from the repository maintainers either so it seems to be abondoned

thanks for investigating the issue  yes  it seems that you have found the problem  if the calendar widget opens the all day event directly  using stock calendar app  it shows incorrect information spanning over two days  i do not use google’s calendar   but if the event is opened from the stock calendar app without using the calendar widget  the event is correctly placed in only one day  do you think you can workaround the problem of the bad api to handle those requests correctly from the calendar widget

you are correct  the npe should not be thrown  and yet it is   by your own code  not ours  as you said  the authenticationactivity is launched by oauth internally  not by us   actually  it's your oauthmanager that's starting the authenticationactivity  not webauthprovider as you stated     we have not yet figured out the steps to reproduce the crash  there must be some condition in restoring the activity state that's leading to the npe    regardless of how it's happening  your library should handle the error   not crash  the fact that your launchauthenticationintent   will do "nothing" if the bundle is null is another problem  it's called lack of error handling  it would be preferable if you could properly handle the null bundle and recover gracefully  otherwise a simple np check would at least stop it from crashing   btw  the crash is happening across all devices and android versions 4 7  lastly  telling customers that their efforts to identify and fix bugs in your software is 'nonsense' is pretty unprofessional

maybe i should not use the words "hot deployment"  the application is a swing gui application and not a web project   we are frequently using the "apply code changes" feature in netbeans to load classes into a running application  this saves time because it takes a long time to start the application and to load needed data    so i was wondering if this is possible  maybe i am missing something  or if this feature is planned for the future 
hi  sorry for the delay    here's the stacktrace 
it just guess that onstreamadded is not called  because as i can see only here objects are removed from maps  it is just guess again that promises and notifications are not cleaned by gc  because they are held in these maps  and probably elsewhere  but maps seems the best candidates   i only have class histograms when full gc started to happen and finally application stuck in it   and there are lot of hashmap node instances  13        1034896       33116672  java util hashmap node  count of promises  notifications grows from full gc to full gc  although i see from logs  that count of currently sending pushes are below our limits  10k   will try some simulations tomorrow

i'm not sure how to create a test to show this bug  should i go in the " src test java spoon test" folder and i memo create a case with my tested files

so if for testing purposes  if i need to go to  1 10  1 often because it's a boss location  i could assign the address "boss" to to the coordinate  1 10  1 and from then on  i could type teleport boss instead of  1 10  1  just to make it easier   and hm  maybe it was a mapping discrepancy between us  if it works now  that's fine  and yeah  current coordinate would only make sense for the test profile 
i am working on isolating the code that causes it  in the meantime i wonder if the "immutability" is the key to the problem  i am doing the following   put key1  value1   put key1  value2    where value1 and value2 are two different objects  does that cause problems   what if the sequence was like this   put key1  value1  remove key1  put key1  value2   would that be correct   on fri  jun 21  2013 at 4 12 am  jan kotek notifications github com wrote 
 anishshah101 sorry i didn't come back to you  i will try to elaborate a little bit more although as  tarelli  said if you are starting to fix some bugs this is not one of the easiest  the problem has to do with the way we are loading the dom and executing the jquery  if you want to execute some jquery commands on a html component you usually need to embed the jquery command in a     we are doing something wrong because sometimes we are trying to execute a command on the console component  i e   this  https   github com openworm org geppetto frontend blob master src main webapp js geppetto console js#l277  and the dom is not ready  console is null   therefore a js error occurs  some components  simulation buttons  zoom in out  etc  are not loaded in the layout and the console can't be opened  it is a random error i guess because it depends on many things internet speed  local js processing  elements being loaded asyncronous    this error may potentially happen in a different line also because of async execution   if you finally try to fix this bug let me know if i can be of any help  this time i will be faster in answering you   
in spring data we support annotations and meta annotations that are annotated with jsr305 annotations to discover whether a package  class or method has opted in for non nullability  we do not express a limit on meta annotation nesting  so one can use either directly jsr305 annotations  spring framework annotations  that are annotated with jsr305  or further  composed annotations    that's  why we are using  annotatedelementutils     nonnull 's  when  attribute expresses non nullability or allows opting out to express that a particular argument or return value may be null

on my win10 workstation the test crashes after 19 seconds with a stackoverflow  but the stack size on windows is much lower than on linux  like only 250   i tried the same test in an ubuntu 16 vm with 5gb  there the test runs for a whole minute  then it crashes with      testcase name "stresstest" classname "org dizitart testing nitritestresstest" time "59 335"       failure message "java lang outofmemoryerror  gc overhead limit exceeded" type "java lang outofmemoryerror" java lang outofmemoryerror  gc overhead limit exceeded 	at org h2 mvstore page splitnode page java 400  	at org h2 mvstore page split page java 371  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 205  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 209  	at org h2 mvstore mvmap put mvmap java 211    on java version "1 8 0_131" java tm  se runtime environment  build 1 8 0_131 b11  java hotspot tm  64 bit server vm  build 25 131 b11  mixed mode   again inside a a page split loop in mvstore mvmap put where the problem seems to be in     protected object put page p  long writeversion  object key  object value                                      page c   p getchildpage index  copy writeversion           if  c getmemory     store getpagesplitsize      c getkeycount     1                   split on the way down             int at   c getkeycount     2              object k   c getkey at               page split   c split at               p setchild index  split               p insertnode index  k  c                  now we are not sure where to add             return put p  writeversion  key  value                     object result   put c  writeversion  key  value           p setchild index  c           return result          it looks like it's creating maps of only 11 records  after 11 records it splits the map  adds them as child node to the current page and self calls the method  no wonder that after 15000 records the stack goes 1363 calls deep and the map containers occupy more space than the actual data  something is very wrong here anyway  when i put a breakpoint in line " if  c getmemory     store getpagesplitsize      c getkeycount     1   " i see that for every insert it stops a few times on this line  6 times for the first insert  and for every two new inserts after that it stops there one additional time  increasing the page size by a factor 1000 might help  but the whole concept of getting a deeper call stack for every other insert seems very wrong  please put your breakpoint on mvmap line 201 and see if you get the same behavior 
i think this might only be an issue when creating the very first script window   once i had a bunch of script windows open i was able to select the database normally   i forgot about this open issue until i saw jeisoncp's reply   in testing it i did a few things that brought the issue back    from a new instance of dbeaver with multiple scripts and table editors open  restored from previously closed sessions  the selection of database and server works      i right click on a script tab then select "close all"   double click a database connection   press "new script"   it seems to open an arbitrary database on that connection   mouse clicks don't register around the selection object  can't drag it anywhere  open the dropdowns  etc    here's an obfuscated screenshot   dbeaver  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8485770 15029593 3f4e9c60 121c 11e6 8a89 38450d1bcc63 jpg   i'll do some more testing on this   is there anything else you would like to see know   i realize the screenshot looks completely normal but i have limited time at the moment and can't produce a full series of screenshots 
i do not tested more but i think that is plugin conflict   2012 8 6 jacek notifications github com   ##   aroeira servidor minecraft www aroeira info
 fleshgrinder you are correct in this case  but if we use short ternary we can get error on undefined variable  but with constructions like  isset    empty        we should never get error on undefined variable    p s i saw  rentalhost report issue related to empty  isset and    oprator

the filter is invokded  but the response is not expected  it seem the setting of zuul debug host is not valid  how do it should be configed   actually  i want to use it as the blue green deployment 
i have reproduced it 100  of the time on my test world 
correct me if i'm wrong  each sticker or filter is added to the rootview as a layer  then when i'm changing the source bitmap in order to for example change bitmap contrast  it won't be able to make changes to the rootview and this will cause the error i'm facing  anyhow  i want to save all changes together  any solution 
an error occurred while switching the database
i found a lead  http   stackoverflow com questions 2972986 how to unmap a file from memory mapped using filechannel in java blacklisting all the alt contigs will results in a whole lot of file handles being opened then immediately closed  but not actually released until the next gc  hence the file handle exhaustion that doesn't happen on large input data sets even when using an order of magnitude more threads  i'll add some explicit defensive gcs into gridss and see if that improves things 
i'll try to do it on monday

 airsquared hey  sorry for the late reply but it's working now
lineage os 14 1 newpipe seens to be the only app causing this issue  ive tried changing my system animations but it didn't fix it 
here's a simplified version of my code     this shows the dropdown  but the placeholder doesn't show up  any ideas 
master branch on monday  ok i will retry in master branch today 
i do not see the file in my phone's collection media  it appears to be working on desktop  however  i do not seen the file in my desktop's collection media either and both collection media's have the same amount of files  8106  so i'm guessing are identical  the smallest file in desktop's collection media isn't silent   what do you think is going on here  please help 
compile 'com evernote android job 1 2 0 rc4'
i'd suggest to accept both  tei and  xml  as naming tei files  xml makes sense  maybe  when no files are matched  output a warning such as "no file found with extension  extension  in input directory "
if i have that error the next time i try to post a complete stack 
the behavior is a little less wacky  but you can still type past the character limit   
seems that this will be dependent on camel consuming kafka 0 9 0 0 or greater
 doanduyhai   all i did was create table xyz with secondary index xid in cassandra then due to bug mentioned in ticket  i had to use raw query   i needed pagination like dsl   with raw   api  so set fetchsize to 10 but page _1   has list of size 200 which is total number of records  i was expecting it to return 10 in list item     is there any other way we should set paging state and fetchsize when using raw   api  than below      here xyz matches columns from xyz table and is pojo

alright i can provide you with some more information i gathered    i found the demo structure spawning in the nether and clearing all its surrounding   so it did spawn with air  although when i spawn it in my other world it wont clear land  this let me to the conclusion this might be an bug with multiverse since the world im trying to use it with is a multiverse world  but in the normal world also doesn´t spawns with air    but now to your request   https   www mediafire com #3a40jv4zbhcaq this are the schematic files i use    also here is a list of my plugins   armorstandeditor builders wand chestcleaner choptree4 crazyenchantment crazycrates cs corelib customstructures deathchest essentialsx 2 0 1  essentialsxchat fawe healthbar  which i dont use currently  hologramms infernalmobs killermoney minepacks multipleresources muliverse core multiverse portals musicraft permissionsex shopkeeper also not in use  silkspawners slimefun sudo vault worldborder worldedit xpboost   i hope this helps you

sure thing i've added a couple of fixed items   couple regular drawer items   by the way it's a cool library i'd love to integrate it in my new app        setsupportactionbar  toolbar  findviewbyid r id toolbar_home            getsupportactionbar   setdisplayshowhomeenabled true           getsupportactionbar   settitle "dash board"      only the last item is displayed when  the last item   the last fixeditem     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10850787 8036039 dc50d1ac 0dec 11e5 99f3 bceaf4014a62 png 
yea  the more i think about it the worse the idea i had for implementing it is but i still think it would be a great touch 
ok  you're right about the fact that the library is part of the app  that went through my mind and i didn't understand why the strict mode policy was thrown    i tested the sample app with the same emulator and i don't get the exception  so it must be something i'm doing wrong in my code  note that i'm extending  com nononsenseapps filepicker filepickeractivity  and  com nononsenseapps filepicker filepickerfragment  to provide file folder thumbnails  maybe it has to do with that  i'm gonna have to investigate and try some things   sorry for the false flag

hi there  first of all   h outputscript library "bsf" name "js button js" target "head"    does not work    neither within the index xhtml nor within the ui fragment    pavankd do you have an on the fly minimal example  otherwise i'll create one 
hello    we suggest to rely on the client version that can be defined in the service class  then we change the methods in typeutils  toedm  toedmdatetime  to pass the version as parameter  and finally introduce some logic to choose the date format based on the version  with the adding of the new format   if you're fine with this solution we can submit it  we just wanted to check with you first as we're new to this framework  we wanted to be sure we got it right    cheers antoine
this was caused because of encryption on server side  and as i am notified there are still some issues with encryption on server side 

hi  bsideup   yes we use 1 8 0 
it has to be "debug from   to"  when the component gets "fresh" data  not from "debug from   to"  it works normally 
so  i think that  x 1 hour or less before y  _would_ be  true  if  x  is at the exact same time as  y   because i said an hour or less  and 0 hours is less than 1 hour   the more that i think about this case  the more that i think it overrides the exclusive definition of the before  in fact  i think it's even broader than i initially proposed above  consider  x 1 hour before y   intuitively  if  x  is exactly 1 hour before  y   it should return true  but based on the exclusive definition of before  it should return false   in other words  i think the relative qualifiers should override the exclusivity of the before after comparison operator in all cases  not just where the two boundaries meet  thoughts 
we need to do synchronisation on a finer level since the eager update and the periodic refresh happen concurrently  there are rules associated with how the additional fields should be read from write to that if future methods follow should fix the problems in general  provided that the client's physical clock is sufficiently accurate   that's from what i reason about it at the moment but i could be wrong 
i don't think this is broken  settime works for me without having to change the brightness

greetings  tobiaskaminsky   have you tried bigger files  i run into this issue when editing  pdfs   40 100 mb    i'm sure it's new to 3 5  because i used to do the same with the same files  i used to use the deprecated __available offline__ feature   i use xodo to add annotations to pdfs  they get saved  and they used to get uploaded automatically without a glitch   now  after upgrading to the 3 5 version  i edit  the files  i sync them by hand  the uploading starts  it gets __to full 100 __  and __then__ it spits out a message "upload failed"   i have to use  __share__ button from the xodo reader  upload it to nextcloud  works flawlessly  every time  but it gets uploaded under a modified name    delete the old file   and  rename the new file to the old filename    did those details help   i'm  right now  in the middle of exam madness  and i don't have neither logcat nor adb set up  it won't be until the beginning of march when i might be able have a look at it   i've also tried uploading small text files  and they work well  but the larger pdf do not   could you try those   i can send you one of the files  if you want     if it helps  server logs might be more accessible for me  
works great  thank you

now reading your comment i checked again  seems i did not kill the app after switching to white theme but just "restarted"  this seems to bring up an inconsitent situation between the layouts  now it indeed looks normal and after switching back to black theme and not killing the app the white border was missing  so forget about this issue   sorry

i understand that large structures need a lot of bandwith to synchronize but why is an upload required  my upload speed is about 110kb s and during login or teleport to that area the client does use almost the complete upload speed  so of course the client needs to download the whole structure and that takes some time  but why does the client "reupload" almost the same data  it did not have it before the teleport login of course

i think this mod has only one version 1 0 so we probably use the same version we both get it by "import github mod" and several gamers succeed in joining the game i don't know their situations  but when i update the game to 98 1 i succeed in joining other's game in the local network instead of steam network does it mean this bug is fixed i couldn't check if it will be succeed through the steam network because there isn't anyone playing games with this mod i will try to check if it will succeed 
 dmzaytsev i think a better approach is to check for an existing bower version first     this returns the available version and if present  there is no need to re install bower again  agreed that this is a pretty trivial thing and even running  npm install bower  might get it from cache instead of actually downloading  but installing a package each time you build doesn't seem like a good workflow  or maybe i'm missing something   dmzaytsev

i import a rgb image as a mask  select one to one  the only option that actually works  has something to do with worldmachine   so it gets imported as annotations   i then use a brush or global operations  using 'only on yellow annotations' as a way to select  or any annotation   then if i click on an area with any sort of annotation  it covers those as well  so if i have an area with red and yellow annotations  and select to affect only the yellow  it will still affect red

 tylerbenson the agent is actively breaking things  because it runs the  tracingsession  it throws the  methodnotfound  exception and therefore crashes our app  meaning that if you have an external dependency using guava 27+  you cannot use dd agent in your project

 eolivelli  yes is correct  bk2 had been partitioned from the network  we were writing on bookkeeeper with replica 2  precisely at that moment on bk1 and bk2  and at that moment bk3 was reading the data from bk2  when bk2 was partitioned  we expected bk3 to read from bk1 after a few minutes  instead after 30 minutes he was still trying to read the data from bk2   i have this expection from bk3 logs 
i found out that the issue only arises when i share the packetdecoder between channels  could it be that replayingdecoders are not meant to be shared   here's the decoder    sharable public class packetdecoder extends replayingdecoder packetdecoder packetdecoderstate        public static enum packetdecoderstate           read_nothing  read_header              let me know if you still want to see the inboundpackethandler 
so i couldn't get the full trace  so i tried to do it from the command line where it worked  long story short  seems like the issue was caused by another  jar which had an older version of  junit bundled included and when adding 4 10 it went after that jar so basically classpath issue    embarassing      _      that said  i still think the code example in rulechain should be replaced with my snippet since it is actually compilable and runnable 
thanks  thebentobox  i do like that idea of the command   with minecraft adding several new blocks items  not having the aliases easily accessible is going to make things quite tricky  and i know you guys are going to get 10 000 people asking you where they are    i mean  i know where to find them  but not everyone does    i think the other reason i like the idea of them being in the docs  is because everything else is there  so it just makes sense to throw them in there as well

i'm using the same version  whenever i click on a contact  it takes me back to the chat list  it works fine when i disable the option  are you not experiencing the same 
i got 10 enabled indexers and 1 temporary disabled  according to the stats tab i average slightly over 100 searches each day for 8 of the indexers  "indexer api accesses"  during the last month  two of them are below 10 searches with a fairly high failure rate so i should probably disable them 
hi michael  thank you for getting back to me  here is a screenshot of one of the devices  we use 8 different ones and crushing happens inconsistently on all models only on long audio sessions  all devices were installed with the latest oc version  the app is on all the time with no other action on the background  as far as i see the device doesn't go to sleep  although the screen shuts after a minute or so  by the way the app on ipod touch devices runs faultlessly   ziv    sent from my iphone
hey  with ' parameters' it works now  there was something cached in background so it doesn't worked the first time i tried it      thanks for your help 
it is definitely a bug in qr code reading  if i generate the qr code the proper email is inside of the url of the charts api  otpauth   totp user+z address com followed by the secret etc  however when scanning the qr code it erorrs out  so technically you could classify it as a generating issue if it is suppose to escape those characters  or the qr scanner should be reading them  either way it is a bug for sure

yes  i have auto upload on both  i want to have them both  as idea is to test beta  no point in testing beta  if i turn off auto upload   what is annoying me is this error message  maybe i am wrong  but i am hoping if we can backoff for the time of upload  we can avoid this error message  never sure if it is real error  or locking error   other options that came to my mind is    can we delay beta version for 15min 2 during scheduling  schedulefilessyncifneeded   so jobs are "somewhat" interleaved  using setexact   maybe  or just checking inside job if we are started on round number of minutes  00 15 30 45 for prod  7 5  22 5  37 5  52 5 for beta  and sleep a bit  i am not expert on any of this  so i might be very wrong     why trylock cannot take shared lock  i don't see need for exclusive lock  if we are just reading uploading file  i guess  if lock can be promoted to shared  we can have multiple jobs work on it

sorry for the late answer   i'm on db2  but it looks like you could reproduce it   thanks for the extremly fast reaction and your good product   
when i read the spec i was reading that paragraph as applying to the previously specified parameters  access_token  token_type  expires_in  refresh_token  scope    it also goes on to say that the "the client must ignore unrecognized values names in the response"  which again suggests we should be a little more forgiving in how we deal with unexpected value names   if nothing else it would have been helpful if this was easier to code around as this took me a little while to debug  i came across this upgrading from spring 5 to spring 5 1  spring 5 was forgiving of extra values i think

distributed session implementation such as redis and hazelcast  only update the modified part of session data to session storage   and the session modification is captured by calling  websession  setattribute   only modify session data's value without calling  setattribute   session data will not be updated anyway   for example   the following code will not add  "key"  "value"  to session key a_dict_type_session_key 's value  if use redis or hazelcast based distributed session      setattribute  is overwrite by redis or hazelcast based distributed session to capture session data's modification   for the above reason  we finally got "authorization_request_not_found" in some case since the code failed to update session's data

we're building with gradle  and the relevant part of our resolution strategy is that we don't allow dependencies with conflicting versions  e g   configurations all   	resolutionstrategy   		failonversionconflict   	     we can solve this by excluding transitive dependencies for a given dependency  and lock down the version by defining an explicit dependency  this we must live with when separate dependencies have transitive conflicts  but we prefer not to do so for a single dependency in isolation

after speaking with matt about this  i believe there was an onerror function showing custom error output and not outputting line numbers properly so looks like this is probably a non issue 
i can wait    thank you for fixing 
i have no clue  i guess kotlin have chosen that for better readability  actually  kotlin is not not checking the type  also a field of type string like  val isfoo   string  will translate to  isfoo    and  setfoo string

i am interested in submitting a pr  i will try this today 
 cweitkamp  yes  sure  the issue is not with the host definition   this is the docker container external port  the issue is the internal side of the container where openhab   the bindings are running  basically you need two parameters to be able to resolve this  the one for the host that indicates other external devices how to contact openhab and the internal for the binding that indicates the binding how to access the container internally  you may want to look at the most current version of the homematic binding  they had a similar issue and resolved it by adding the internal parameter and the behavior indicated in my resolution proposal

thanks for the quick response and for having already addressed the issue by the sounds of it   just updated to v3 2 10  will try it in a few hours when i head home and report back 
thank you for the quick reply    yes  there are testng dependencies on the classpath   one we explicitly provide  6 4   the other is from powermock modue testng  which transitively brings in 6 2    i cannot remove these from our pom for two reasons   first  it breaks eclipse   there are a number of "type org testng ihookable cannot be resolved   it is indirectly referenced from required  class files "   i launched with  clean for eclipse and did a maven refresh project configuration and clean build just for paranoia sake    second  it breaks the maven command line build  which uses testng for both unit and integration tests   the plugin did appear to work fine before this last upgrade   sorry  i do not remember my prior version  which i know is notably unhelpful    invoking a test via run rather than debug works fine    saish

there obviously should always be a way to resize the window  at the moment i fixed it in my code by adding setshowresizecorner true  in a componentlistener under the componentmoved   method  putting it in componentresized   does not work  maximize now does not have the corner and unmaximizing again regains the resize corner  which is the correct result   i think keeping the corner is the solution that i think looks the best   making window sides and corners resizable would  i think  need an aditional border of some sort and i don't think that would look as good   the best solution is to provide options for all  optionally make window sides and corners resizable and  the already implemented  ability to show or hide the resize corner   it is however up to you   as a side note  you are doing great work  weblaf looks superb and it has been a blast to use it 
works  thanks a lot

unfortunately  i don't think there is a general rule   german writers would likely simply avoid ending a sentence with a digit   there are too many  1  platz  1  preis  1  mannschaft  1  bundesliga  1  liga  1  rang  1  kategorie  1  reise  1  tag  52  woche  3  monat  1  jahrhundert  1  buch samuel  42  kongress  "1  simmeringer sport club"  "1  fc nürnberg"   these are all grammatical correct use  it's not specific to dates  that was just where i first noticed that this is really a major problem  once you look out for them  they are literally everywhere  just go to http   de wikipedia org  and type "1 " into the search box  even with "42 " you get many suggestions   so i believe my workaround is doing the best heuristic   assume that digits followed by a dot does not end a sentence  it could  but it usually won't    there are other cases where the assumption that a dot always ends a sentence is incorrect   in particular abbreviations may or may not end a sentence  "Äpfel  bananen  usw  sind obst " is another example that is incorrectly split by corenlp   usw    etc   apples  bananas  etc  are fruit   but these are hard to define without already having pos tags and without massive learning dictionary  to get some samples  you could look at wikipedia page titles  https   de wikipedia org w index php title usw  redirect no  for the digits+ no space +dot rule  i  guess that not splitting the sentence is correct in over 90  of cases  but that is a wild guess  linguists might be able to come up with a number  though

it was working in a earlier version of the private "modpack"  but now it isn't  http   imgur com a srnij i will try it with less mods 
i used it with an attackhook   to make a name tag mod it checks the items name then sets the name tag
the plugin is 0 0 20  it doesn't seem to trigger on load  but it does trigger quite a few times  my last editing session had 6 triggers between start and clear of the error   either way  a decision was made to refactor to a json model instead of yaml  for other reasons  so the problem hasn't reoccurred

i'll test it with just ender io installed and see if it still happens   steps for reproducing are  1  place item conduits next to two machines 2  place ender energy conduits in the same space as the item conduits 3  change the settings of one of the conduit connections to he machines 4  copy settings from the changed conduit face 5  paste the settings to the second conduit face

jo   thank you for the suggestion  that appears to have been the problem  in in the past i must not have paid much attention to whether i was typing in the "save in" field or the "save bag as" window  but i followed your directions to type in the "save bag as" window and was successful  i think it would be helpful to make it clear to users that they should click the "browse" button and not just fill in the "save in" field  i will be sure to clarify this step in my institution's documentation   jamie

no

those failures are only encountered while running a travis build  feels like a very rare random occurring bug  i prefer to proceed with #617  after that i can investigate more 
i think i cancelled it  but not sure at this point  was on vacation and not paying close attention   sorry   i think the main thing i would have expected is for the size reporting to have a reasonable value  or switch to showing just bytes transferred if it can no longer calculate percentage  since it appears to be tolerant of deletion  this is good i think    at least the display should be corrected    there's also something to be said for having it only check size once    does oc actually tolerate the file size increasing during the upload process    however  i can also see some justification for  if it's going to continuously check the size   it might be worthwhile to note the deletion and abort the transfer   i can also see the opposite   oc could protect against an accidental deletion if the upload was already in progress     no strong opinion on the behavior choice   but the ui shouldn't display a gibberish percentage when it doesn't know the file size any more    another option   grab the file size continuously as you are now  but cache the last successful one  if you can no longer determine the size  use the cached value going forward  but highlight that it's out of date in the progress ui in some manner 
done 
so far i understand githud  never used it before  i can only edit i file at a time  but many changes require more than one file to alter

hi  sherfert   we tried running with the snapshot flag and while it lessened the frequency of the observed issue  it was still present  what you're describing sounds like neo4j does not meet acid compliance  specifically isolation    our situation in the real world is far more complex than the simple example  it's a cluster of 5 core nodes and 3 read nodes with several ingestion apps writing data and many more apis reading data  we're ingesting data from a pipeline and end up deleting and recreating both nodes and relationships during reingestion  we're seeing these deletes creates interfere with at least 2 locations in our system and in multiple ways  both from referencing the original node and referencing nodes attached to the entry node   we've implemented some logic to mitigate this by retrying queries in situations that we recognize as being invalid  but it by no means covers all our edge cases  because of this  we'd really like to be able to avoid rewriting our ingestion transaction as it would be a pretty substantial rewrite   i guess i'm left with 2 questions at this point  1  does this mean that neo4j is not acid compliant  2  for the  unsupported dbms query snapshot   should we choose to enable this on our servers  what sort of performance impact might we see  it does seem to make the situation better  but it might not be worth it if we lose performance

hi  i have two android mini tv boxes  one is cx 919 with 4 2 2 "stock" rom  the other one is mk808 with 4 1  the problem happens on both devices with the same scenario  but with different symptoms  on cx 919 you see the crash above  while on mk808 i see strange rendering artifacts  like split screen and snow during playback   the scenario is always the same  use a multi variant  hls source  for example 0 1 2   where 0 is the best quality  and wait until a situation where exoplayer decided to switch from a lower quality source to a higher one   i've also added some printings in hlschucksource  getchunkoperation   and i noticed that in the given scenario the player simply "ignores" higher quality chunks  and crashes  on acodec  while reaching to the last buffered chunk of the lower quality sample  i'm starting to suspect that maybe the higher quality sample isn't perfectly aligned with the lower one  for example  if the "lower" chunk contains video from 0 to 6000000us  then the "higher" one doesn't continue the video smoothly at 6000000us    i really want to understand how to smooth transition between different variants is designed to work  so i will be able to try to dig in deeper in to this     any thought on this   thanks

it could be possible  to write such kind of test  but i'm not sure   the point is that you need 2 different threads  which are calling  gettypedeclaration  from the same type reference at the same time  so they both enter here  https   github com inria spoon blob 10e983b20f7bbf793e87d965f2e1730f48f35bc8 src main java spoon reflect factory typefactory java#l555  btw  does it seem like a bug to you  or  gettypedeclaration    is not supposed to be thread safe

for me it would be a menu entry on the main screen  "report problem"  with a popup then asking "do you want to send the logs as well   yes no cancel  with the default being yes "   i would not like an additional setting  it is not a big deal if we store  say  500 messages of 40 characters  that would be 20kb of ram  we would only store the severity and the data  we wouldn't duplicate the tag for example

i have tried using only what mytown provides and then also attempted the forgeessentials mod   it worked with allowing mytown commands to be ran but also allowed students to break blocks inside of protected areas and gave op commands as well   it could be my lack of knowledge with fe and how it works exactly but it felt like it would require running through 1000+ commands one by one in order to get fe to work properly with the edu setup and combing through every command to learn exactly what it does   i tried their denydefault but kept getting syntax errors  again  limited updates due to forge 1291    i tried mytown cmd outsider    and mytown cmd everyone    by itself with default fe permissions and with mixes of many attempts of other setups   all led to dead ends and frustration w o permissions working the way i thought they should or wanted   there could also be something behind the scenes with the edu version with permissions but documentation on it is pretty much non existent   i have started combing through the code for their wrapper and launcher but have limited time lately as life is a bit busy   i'll keep chuggin along to see what happens   any advice or thought is appreciated   thanks

hi  thanks for helping on this   i think i found the reason  i add connection listener after the very first  hub fireconnect    gets called  which causes first update to  map  is skipped since  listenersmap  was empty  then when i shutdown my redis server   maps replace  in  hub firedisconnect  doesn't work because the  addr  is still not included in  maps    another question i have is  looks like hub firedisconnect   will only be triggered when there is an action requiring a connection to redis server and it's failed  does it mean if my redisson client only acts as a subscriber in a pubsub flow  my connection listener will never get a ondisconnect   callback when redis server is down  unless i send another command to that server  is it correct   thanks

in the case of searchly  all administrative features of elasticsearch are restricted from the api  according to their documentation  that doesn't leave us with a lot of room  does it  i'm sure that searchly have their reasons to do so  but that is one case out of millions of users  and many of them are not developing in shared environments with special restrictions   i still believe that the right endpoint to call by default should be   _cat health  which could be overridden via configuration properties   instead of having  management health elasticsearch indices   we could have  management health elasticsearch endpoint  _cat health

 joschi thanks for the fix  tested the datadog one   withstatsdhost    and it works as expected  thanks
downloaded and manually installed 3 7 4 from github   unfortunately  no change with 3 7 4 
i uninstalled google contact sync using titanium backup  i just tested this again by installing uninstalling it again  and found that i can easily reproduce the error  it requires 2 reboots before the group uid shows back up
yes the damage is enabled and it was a normal gate  not a pegasus gate  all damage is taken by my armor and more testing showd that a protection iv enchanted endstell armor from enderio can save your life too

the distributed jetty server doesn't change the default value of the above setting  despite the javadoc documentation   it's default value is  true    httpconfiguration java      param delay if true  delay the application dispatch until content is available  default false      changing it to false seems to fix the issue  1  the   dopost   servlet is now called immediately after all headers are received  2  the   onerror   event is raised on idle timeout  3  the server answer with 500 server error   the fix seems to work also in the original web application that uses cometd  the   asyncjsontransport  abstractreader#onerror   method is called on idle timeout   can you confirm that it is fine to set the setdelaydispatchuntilcontent setting to false on a cometd application  the server handles both long poll and websocket client connections 
yes  the yellow circle is shown  however  i think it shouldn't because the selected option is delete  however  lets leave this to  masensio since here we reproduce it

yes they can access anything in the same area  anything at all  just not the activation of the portal  they can occasionally open the interface to the keystone receptacle  but that is it  and we aren't sure how they do that when it happens   it is the same problem with and without rune combinations  once we figured out it was a problem  we stepped into a brand new world and tried tons of different combinations and the like  different set ups  different combinations  different numbers of gates on the same combination  while i am here  i do have a question  where gates that have a rune combo only accessible by a keystone with the same combo your original design  or are gates that share the same combination should be able to link to each other without a keystone   date  sat  28 feb 2015 19 23 48  0800 from  notifications github com to  arsmagica2 noreply github com cc  manga_cartoonist hotmail com subject  re   arsmagica2  gates are not accessible by any player in mp  except host   #1104   can they access chests  etc  in the same area   does the gate have a rune combination set   — reply to this email directly or view it on github

 timtay microsoft the clients are sending at least 1 message every 4 minutes and they're authenticated with device key   as for mqtt that's the last exception that appears  it seems there's some serious problem with the reconnect  right now the only way to make iot hub work continuously and reconnect on connection loss is to treat disconnected_retrying as disconnected  closing the client en opening a new one 
ghc mod version 5 4 0 0 compiled by ghc 7 6 3  perhaps the culprit is changing my ghc version  not sure why that would be  just a stab in the dark  edit  nope 
it comes up even if there's no   git  directory  even after a brand new installation  it also up when i choose  open project  and  new project   it's the same behavior as if i run   usr bin git  from the terminal  but what i mean to say is  if i have no interest in version control and never chose to do anything with  git   i still keep getting prompted to install it and xcode because the git executable is  correctly  set to   usr bin git   so i effectively have to tell rstudio and macos that i'm not interested in version control by telling it that the  git  executable is something incorrect

hi yes if i comment rush android it compiles successfully 
we use a dana rs   in any case   the last bolus statement lines has the info of the current bolus   not the previous one   img_20191102_085634  https   user images githubusercontent com 30212759 68060059 c079e080 fd4e 11e9 8f5a 86b032472a99 jpg 
this is one 
 sormuras with which release will this change be published
after my initial post i realised that anything after 37  or perhaps 47  might not be supported  so i refactored all of the colors in my script to range of 30 to 37   the problem is the exact same  it still only removes the escape sequences  it does not replace them with colors  using these same codes with just 'echo  e' works fine  so i believe this is python specific   i call the python script with ' u' to disable caching  and print with      just to be extra sure      the user profile that runs the script has its default shell set to  usr bin sh  i've tried using ' e'  ' 033' and ' x1b' 
cannot reproduce this one  will reopen if it pops up 
so  i changed the following    cp   stsassumerolewithsamlcredentialsprovider          builder            stsclient stsclient builder   region region us_east_1  httpclient httpclient  build             asynccredentialupdateenabled true           refreshrequest supplier           build       to    cp   stsassumerolewithsamlcredentialsprovider                  builder                                stsclient                     stsclient                     builder                       region region us_east_1                      httpclient httpclient                      credentialsprovider anonymouscredentialsprovider create    build                                       asynccredentialupdateenabled true                   refreshrequest supplier                   build       and instead of getting the previously mentioned error  i'm just getting a 403 error from the sts service    software amazon awssdk services sts model stsexception  access denied  service  sts  status code  403

that's what i thought   which make me wonder why we get that error  after looking at the link  perhaps there is a setting we've missed somewhere  that tell osm not to look for this bubble   
never mind found the issue  i had another version apple core mod  with another name on the same folder xd
here is an example  login object is parsed as null when header is content type  application json  charset utf 8 but works when header is content type  application json i got around it by changing the client library  okhttp    controller      public response login models login login     model  excluding getters and setters public class login       string usr      string pwd   headers  accept  _ _ content type  application json  charset utf 8 post body   "usr" "someuser"  "pwd" "test" 
i've added a zip file which follows the following  1  shows current view folder structure 2  create a new root folder under " views"  3  move the subfolder " data oms" which has subfolders and views to the newly created folder  4  shows new folder state 5  pre export 6  export 7  after closing the model and trying to re import  receives the import error regarding bad counts    importerror zip  https   github com archi contribs database plugin files 3734837 importerror zip     i also attempted to just replicate the folders and only move the views themselves  but it fails for the same reasons 
thanks for your answer  now i know how to get thread dump so i cann't reproduce this permanent behavior as it was before  tomorrow i will try to reproduce it on windows  on windows behavior is same as that on linux but on windows system sends information about crash to microsoft after i close the dbeaver window by click to window close button 
it happens nearly every week  on both servers  with low traffic      at the time it is not working i have a established connection in netstat    apnsclient says also it is not connected and connecting again is not working  and tcpdump shows that their is a open connection  i'm using di and queueing so their is only one instance of apns client in my application  seems that he is losing the correct state internally 
hi  jimczi   ok  so if it is finally a breaking change and so  only a "docs" issue  i think that this doc page especially should be updated  referenced by kibana search bar     https   www elastic co guide en elasticsearch reference current query dsl query string query html#query string syntax

yes  exactly   we have something like that 
 k9 log txt  https   github com k9mail k 9 files 3844882 k9 log txt 
those could be options as well  i just went for the most obvious fix  that provides a decent workflow  could be enhanced 
if there is no impact  is it expected to log it as a warning  i'd expect us to be more silent

hi  clint    i don't know how to upload  rar file into gist  so i updated my post in google mail list  and attached the logs of 20 nodes in my post  you can download it from https   groups google com forum # topic elasticsearch myw ruxcj8a   the logs are for 0 90 0 beta1      today i tested the latest the es version 0 90 0 beta1  it has the same problem    my test configure is as following    20 nodes  10 96 250 211 212 213 are master nodes  211 is the leader  214 and 215 are load balancer  other 15 nodes are data nodes    my test step is as following    1  after the cluster is up  i created an empty index  test1 curl  xput 10 96 250 214 10200 test1  "ok" true "acknowledged" true  curl  xget 10 96 250 211 10200 _cluster health pretty true     "cluster_name"   "es test 0 90 0 beta1"    "status"   "yellow"    "timed_out"   false    "number_of_nodes"   20    "number_of_data_nodes"   15    "active_primary_shards"   15    "active_shards"   27    "relocating_shards"   0    "initializing_shards"   3    "unassigned_shards"   0     the cluster stayed in this state for long time   2  then i created another empty index  abcd1234 curl  xput 10 96 250 214 10200 abcd1234  "ok" true "acknowledged" false  curl  xget 10 96 250 211 10200 _cluster health pretty true     "cluster_name"   "es test 0 90 0 beta1"    "status"   "red"    "timed_out"   false    "number_of_nodes"   20    "number_of_data_nodes"   15    "active_primary_shards"   29    "active_shards"   53    "relocating_shards"   0    "initializing_shards"   6    "unassigned_shards"   1   the cluster stayed in this state for long time  3  then i created one more empty index   curl  xput 10 96 250 214 10200 1234abcd  "ok" true "acknowledged" false  curl  xget 10 96 250 211 10200 _cluster health pretty true     "cluster_name"   "es test 0 90 0 beta1"    "status"   "red"    "timed_out"   false    "number_of_nodes"   20    "number_of_data_nodes"   15    "active_primary_shards"   43    "active_shards"   78    "relocating_shards"   0    "initializing_shards"   6    "unassigned_shards"   6     the cluster stayed in this state for long time    thank you    regards   dong aihua 
your comment is expected  ignorant  apathetic and gonna stay that way  no ear for a customer just a little bad mouth  good dy mr arduino  this should good posted too  you have no concern for cusotmer concerns whatsoever  prior purchase cusotmer  on sat  apr 23  2016 at 4 33 pm  paul stoffregen notifications github com wrote 
thanks   just testing it out now 
i tested with device and simulator  ios 9 and ios 10  xcode beta and stable and it's always the same wrong line numbers   my class looks as simple as this     i'm using the latest stable intellij idea plugin  i created an ios device run configuration   i really can't explain why it works for you  florianf  while it fails for me  i'm not using retro lambda for this project  i just created the default project with the wizard in idea     florianf do you maybe have some local uncomitted changes that prevent the problem from happening 
exactly  it only happens when scaling is applied  displaying cmyk jpegs without scaling works fine 
sure i could start a pr  for now   i know in vs code the grammar seems to do the right thing with regard to raw strings  i think they have their grammar from another repo as well  i can investigate where their grammar is originally from  if this grammar has more recent updates this could be a better overall alternative  i'll let you know 
 wvpaf ok  thank you  we will try soon    fredgc yes  of course we can play different content on our nexus player  the same stream  but not encrypted  is playing good 
 device setconnected true     device setstatus 0    two separated function calls in two threads in most all the time
 scholzj your commit fixes the issue  thank you
it's fixed in the weekly releases  https   github com zaproxy zaproxy wiki downloads#zap weekly

i'll give it a try 
the right click exclude from    proxy is being done from the sites tree   they vanish from the sites tree after i do this 
i am still slightly confused as to why the breakpoint i set did not hit  as it happens  and i don't expect anyone else to  i have my own tile server    the differences showing the maplink stuff   mykonos1  https   user images githubusercontent com 861631 55570120 ae718a00 56fa 11e9 8976 2fdf5bbd6cfb gif  and   mykonos2  https   user images githubusercontent com 861631 55570141 b92c1f00 56fa 11e9 80cf 2d7e7f4bc98f gif   so relatively minor   its just i like to see as little difference between xowa and mediawiki  it could just be text and no link 
i can't reproduce again  it working now  but it's not worked when i need   
my locale is tr_tr utf 8   i remove other language files  without english and turkish  and  lc_all c mvn install  command runs perfectly now 
an artificial example   dot  has a default node node spacing  nns  of 15 and  neato  has one of 12  the  layoutdotexporter  retrieves nss from a graph using the  coreoptions  class  there  a default nss of 10 is specified  thus  for a graph without any explicit nss set  both  dot  and  neato  end up having nss of 10   additionally  after the first  #getproperty nss   call  the graph will actually have a specified nss  10

i've only noticed it on larger tables  ones smaller than around 10mb tend to be negligible   i did try it with intellij's built in db console  and on the sql server itself  and neither had this problem with comments   here's a run  3 of each  from the query manager 
discussion during  ehcache weekly dev meeting   8 january 2015  https   plus google com events c7lgves3acscvgr9l075240rrmg  led to the conclusion that  at least  all declared failed keys should be invalidated in  store  so  whether or not the write via  cachewriter  was successful  the next  ehcache get  access to any value declared failed will yield the value from the store of record   converting this issue to a bug 
sure  device is a samsung galaxy note 2   gt n7100  android version 4 3  server  owncloud 6 0 1  as a additional note  this seems to happen only if i enable the auto sync in the android settings for the owncloud client 
where can i find that version     see also https   github com bartoszprzybylski owncloud android issues 21

simply a service with a configuration     will lose   mycontext  if   client id   "myservice"   will be annotated with   jacksonfeatures   as i wrote before i think the problem is how a new client is created in httpclientintroductionadvice#getclient 
sorry  leticiarossi  i didn't specify everything in the first post   by the way to help you speed up the analyzing process i've created a sample project with the reproducible behaviour using 1 1 0 beta02  moreover  i've changed the bug triggering code a bit https   github com matpag material textinputtest  if you need anything else just ask   ps  if you figure out the problem and be able to point me in the right direction i can work on the fix
that would certainly work   i was looking at your docs on the config stuff a bit  but i was only seeing excludes  not includes 
i'm using 1 0 3 
hello kay sure  i did import all default patterns  i did not check for those messages  but will do  it seems to be some misinterpretation of some characters  for example  a numbered field identified as int is not recognized on gl  changing to some string  it goes on  on the debugger  this doesn't happen  i'll get that error message and drop to you   enviado do meu ipad

hi   no  it is not  the offending files arent in the github repository  they are downloaded at build time  but once download  you can build arduino  even if there are changes in the tree at the condition the changes are not for these files   i've this problem since several weeks now   this morning once again because bridge 1 6 0 zip has changed its version  so i've downloaded it directly with the browser  and everything was fine   i've set the  ignoreerrors  parameter to  true  in untar unzip download   however i don't know the value the  trustanchors  parameter should have   regards jean luc

 tsmaeder this is on the openshift dev cluster we use  i don't think it's a cluster issue as it's pretty consistently reproducible   what do you mean by "default" registry  we're currently moving away from having che provide default registries of any kind  since the che openshift io registries are for prod prod preview only    https   github com eclipse che issues 14266   i've tested    che server  7 0 0  + devfile registry  7 0 0  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  nightly  + devfile registry  7 0 0  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  7 0 0  + devfile registry  nightly  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  nightly  + devfile registry  nightly  + plugin registry  7 0 0   works   che server  nightly  + devfile registry  nightly  + plugin registry  nightly     does not work

 hotstepper13 as for the last question  in my experience  as long as the servers have found each other initially  additions and removals works seamlessly  so the answer is "yes"  and the one that went down will be removed

 sijie in practice most users prefer to start bookie in the background especially in production environments  so it would be better to support this  however  as discussed with  jiazhai   the original intention of  bin pulsar  is to use  pulsar_env sh   therefore i'm not sure it's appropriate to pass the  bookie_extra_opts  in  bin pulsar   if this way can be accepted i can make a pr trying to address this 
sure  i'm installing maven now

the official barcode scanner android app does not work  it is the same as pictured above  i did however install the released glass barcode scanner application they have  https   github com zxing zxing releases tag bsglass 0 2 1  and that works and can be called via intent   apologies for any wasted time  it would be cool if y'all made your project compatible for glass projects too since they have the library done     thanks for your time

waiting a bit longer might actually have helped  or it might have been a result of otherwise disabled wlan0 coming back online at roughly the same time  but not in kura   also switching  pass dns servers through dhcp  on and off doesn't have the same effect as on wlan0 interface  with wlan0 named is started stopped as a result of the switch 
hi，  davecturner thank you for your reply  i think you are right  i enabled write caching on the disk  and i hope i can detect the error by elasticsearch shard  while i insert data by bulk api  kill the elasticsearch  i delete the bottom line and some bytes in translog 2 tlog  then running the elasticsearch shard   and this is my data_path file    elasticsearch zip  https   github com elastic elasticsearch files 3235320 elasticsearch zip

 tobiaskaminsky i am still having this issue with nc dev 20170810  i have noticed the following once the app to share from open nc  1  when you use the folder that is presented  the buttons take effect  2  if a new folder is created  nc will enter the folder  then buttons have no effect  3  if you create a new folder nc enters it  if you exit the folder  buttons have an effect  4  if you create a folder  concecutively create several folders  getting down deeper in the folder structure   the folder nc enters never have any effects on the buttons  however  if you go up once  then the buttons will behave as expected

i have discovered that there are two different bugs  the first is the issue above  another appears when you call     i don't know if my code is that one which contains a bug  but i checked everything twice and couldn't find anything

this was found when trying to get dependencies updated in a project with an urgent release   i just haven't had time yet  please re open 
sorry  for getting back to you so late  but here are the methods that are being referenced by those method ids     also here is the  original trace  https   github com spideruci blinky files 462916 fy_script1 trc zip   the program is jedit   it is not a big problem for us  but we were just curious what is going on here 
 thethirdone we are providing the repo link to students before the terms begin and they mostly will be downloading the latest release instead of the pre release  and we would prefer if there's a version number  i e  1 3 1  to specify and work on 
 ibuziuk our goal is to achieve multiple users  the current phenomenon is that the workspace status changes directly from starting to stopped in which workspaces failed to start
yes  it works 
 martinlippert sorry  this problem has not been solved  the most intuitive feeling i get from performance problems is that they are caused by compilation  win10 processes often go into a state of suspended animation   which may only need to solve the compilation problems introduced by java9 modules  perhaps it was a compilation problem  and i was also in a state of suspended animation when i used the prompt in the springboot project application yml file i apologize for not being able to provide a sample project for this 
i sadly don't have thermal expansion i'm using a pack called all the mods expert 
something like this in logging yml 
because it's public server  i even don't know where this molecular assemblers and how many of them there is  but i will try to reproduce this in new world with busses  and as temporary solution i just made molecular assemblers to ignore patterns in it 
no fluid pipes are attached only using the buttons   probably i was not clear enough  sorry englisch is not my native language  also for negative values to appear you need to get over 1630 xp 1640 the negative value  1636 will show but only on a server  singleplayer worlds work fine    did some more testing the exact value where it wraps to negative is 1639xp  also made a little video hope that helps to clarify    https   youtu be 8u 1rjjyxvs

hi  davideas  thanks for the quick answer  i can do so next week  but actually  you can simply inspect the code in your example app of flexibleadapter  the bug is e g  visible in the "header and sections" example as described above   just use an s8 emulator or cloud device and you will see that the "long click on x" toast is not shown on this device  i think this is enough for you to understand what i mean  i don't think posting my code would help you since the bug is apparently not in my code  as it happens in your example app as well    ps  next week i can try your tip with flexibleadapter enablelogs      and possibly be more specific with the bug as well  but i guess you know your code best  so a quick look from your side and confirmation that it's a flexibleadapter bug would help for sure
i get this  that player has multiple groups but it shows only the player group the group priority is the same the groups  https   gist github com andinis 74f11d5786187faf3dae8fed5d1c8681   edit  i made the group that has the different spawn on a higher priority still doesnt recognize that group only player group  when i remove the playergroup and only leave the other group it does teleport to the wanted location

i have a server developed by nodejs with socket io 1 4 5   working with both js and c++ client   i'm trying to convert my server to netty socketio 1 7 11 when i done some feature  i test with web client  use socket io      it's work well with all feature   connect  disconnect  event  broadcast     but when i use my c++ client  i get error when connect to server  i'm try read in c++ lib and see    https   github com cocos2d cocos2d x blob v3 cocos network socketio cpp    but  in java when read b64 use integer type      list string  b64   querydecoder parameters   get "b64"       if  b64    null    b64 get 0     null                          integer enable   integer valueof b64 get 0           this throw exception                         ctx channel   attr encoderhandler b64  set enable    1                      i don't know i need change lib in cocos2d x framework or add try catch in this to work  because both libs i also use binary version     thanks for listening and support    👍
i wonder if spring boot could do more if there was also a programmatic way to receive those events outside of just logging them  perhaps then if the  actionmovierepository  bean can't be injected we could check for those evens and provide a failure analyzer to point it out   i imagine one reason that the log gets missed is because it's superseded by an actual exception  my initial instinct would be to start with the stacktrace  rather than to think about hunting backwards in the logs for other messages 
this is a regression   the boolean is not being deserialized on the rest api call    the boolean is in the comment bean and stored in the relationship between the referenceable and the comment   this function has been working ok and just began to fail recently 
thanks  fixed by running  alter table  bm_player_mute_records  add column  soft  tinyint 1    manually  and yeah  i updated from 5 6 
 java swing jayatana  https   code google com p java swing ayatana   _"is a project that brings ubuntu global menu  appmenu  and hud support for java swing applications "_  says  webupd8 org  http   www webupd8 org 2014 02 get unity global menu hud support for html    it's obviously not strictly necessary but buys me the convenience of the hud  searchable menus  and of course a nicer design   i'm not sure this is on the arduino side  but   as stated before   all other java software i use runs just smooth 
i sent an email with the two required files like attachements  i don't have full stacktrace access  i only have the information in the file  now there is also device name 
on that day  i got it to happen twice  but i haven't been able to reproduce it since   if it's okay  please keep this open a bit longer and i'll provide more details if i can get it to happen again   one thing    i've ran into weird race conditions with the sopho's av and apt in the past   i imagine it's possible sopho's could be the cause of this issue too 
i am using version 1 0 3  the issue is with the "logger" definition   when i create the logger as below  the application runs without issue  logger "com abc def"  info   "file"   root warn   "file"  "cloud watch"    but as soon as i use the "cloud watch" appender in the logger definition  the application fails to start  logger "com abc def"  info   "file"  "cloud watch"   root warn   "file"  "cloud watch"  
i have firgotten to mention that i am using the insight pump  may be that is the reason why the system fails because i have read a post on gitter about it 
well i was wrong about supressingexception  it works fine at least in my test case  website becomes very slow when db shuts down  but it's nothing with cache2k but jdbc pooling internals   about eviction issue  i cannot reproduce it because it only happens on my high traffic website  and also once  last week  on a low traffic website  here is the way i construct a cache2k

 damienmg florian wants me to ask you if i can just rollback this change 
with 2 completely different projects of which one used to work before 
hi   thanks for your reaction  i'll try out your suggestion and will let you know if the behaviour is as expected   regards   rudie 
hi  1  create a default flutter 1 12 13 project  2  install the package  0 1 7  3  when running a dialog appears on the android screen saying that my app has stopped  4  if i remove the package the app runs normally  only that 
actually the code i posted above is from 3 2 1   i tried 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 snapshot with the same results before entering this bug   i had to roll back to 3 1 1 for the time being 
i was actually able to install the update by   1  removing the buildship update site from the preferences  1  going to the eclipse marketplace page for buildship  1  selecting "update" on the button   the update site has also reappeared in the list but now i don't get any errors  presumably because i now have the update  
i was trying with 2 3 4   after working around #1150  by calling getaccesscontrolexposeheaders   once before calling setaccesscontrolexposeheaders    i was setting "etag" as an exposed header   however  in the browser  the etag wasn't visible and looking at the http response i found that access control expose headers was not present in the web server responses   i put it down to the lack of an appropriate call in headerutils addresponseheaders   looking at what i think is still current  https   github com restlet restlet framework java blob master modules org restlet src org restlet engine header headerutils java  i don't see anything to set the httpresponse header for the access control expose headers header    i'd expect to see something like the same code as for the access control allow headers header 
yes  it completely helps      thx   for those who are in docker land and want to see how i overcame it  i use the following assets to build my es json logging docker image 
hi  tuteng   i have attached all the 3 configs which i modified  i did run with and without  tlsprotocols  and  tlsciphers   where broker uses to negotiate during tls handshake but nothing worked  openssl 1 1 0g is available on ubuntu server   tls_running_config_inprogress zip  https   github com apache pulsar files 3044180 tls_running_config_inprogress zip   bin pulsar admin tenants list is ok      no   it does throw error like below   but without any auth tenants list works fine  while generating the ca for broker common  name given as hostname and for client given as admin
i just tested it with 2015 11 29 nb1 and it looks fine to me  good to include on  release 
opened safeslinger and picked quickpic from the add attachment button
well yes and i tried create a new world or go to a server and it crashes too    trying to contact my friends to test it  maybe it's our modpack's fault 
sadly  no   i've been unable to reproduce  and lost the failing test result     in any event  the failure was that there were fewer job requests than expected   probably the change you just made will fix the problem   i'll close this  and re open if i see failures again 
the problem with the membership is solved and the second page for the institute is gone  but if you search for joz_  there is still an entry for the deleted page  https   oerworldmap org resource  q joz_
 mgarin can you try again with a jcombobox  from my own application it seems to be only with combobox's and the same issue in both 1 28 and 1 29's beta   from the same 1 29 screenshot of the program in #345 we can see none of the combobox's work with baseline alignment  label's and text fields seem to be fine    lgm web 1 29  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3212801 11116471 d1916896 8900 11e5 8241 806d3fc2f85a png   for the "hardware acceleration " preferences  this is the layout 
yeah  i finished it    a slightly different version     major  mind add me on skype  artembatutin
yes i just tested it with commit  10ff2945f7    it happens with any appbuilder application  for example the blank template   the debugging session starts and it instantly ends  internally we get exception that the socket was closed on the other end 
 aesteve it might be the case  since we also disabled cbor for localstack 
yes  i did  this can be easily reproduced by applying  this patch  http   pastebin com 6h4nmz12  to the sample project  it basically sets flag_translucent_status and fitssystemwindows "true" in the main layout file  this will make the crouton appear  behind the status bar  http   i imgur com ymfkcg4 png  when it should appear below the action bar   the solution i suggested  by the way  won't fix it  i just tested it 
i have an idea to what is happening as i came across this before with another attribute  android studio is changing the way they parse attributes  for instance they were switching enum parsing from integer to string in my previous case  my temporary solution was  view isineditmode  to check if it was in preview windows  error stack trace 
i am using mac os x 10 9  in chrome 31 0 1650 57 and firefox 16 0 2 it doesn't work for me  i create a new empty project and test it there again 
i downloaded the most recent version of the plugin nucleus 0 27 0 1 10 2 pr2 s5 1 https   github com nucleuspowered nucleus releases download 0 27 0 pr2 nucleus 0 27 0 1 10 2 pr2 s5 1 plugin jar 
 erick03 if you mean a solution for being able to update  compilesdkversion  to  23   we need to create and register a new notification instead of calling  notification setlatesteventinfo      from my conversation  here  https   code google com p android issues detail id 73720#c5  with google on the best practice for updating notifications     me        google      so the solution is to implement the above  and test to make sure reminders still work correctly   it's on my todo list  but i've been trying to focus on getting the ui redesign to the point of release   pr's accepted    
this output shows that removing 1960 caused 2000 to be removed as well 
 example project zip  https   github com qoomon maven git versioning extension files 3392737 example project zip  see attached file  i've tried to simplified the project as much as could and kept only the relevant information  as you can see  we have a  version  specified in the root pom xml  this tag refers to a   revision  property  defined in the same pom xml  the maven module pom xml inherits from this root pom xml and also refers to the   revision  property  at first  the   version  from the extension didn't like the fact my version was referring to a property  so i've hard coded the version directly in the version tag  but still didn't work for maven module that also refered to   revision  property   anyway  let me know if you have enough information with the attached file  maybe it's the way we are configured with the flatten plugin  
15 9  although iirc it might've been the same for 15 10 as i had tried to test it in my own personal and more updated modpack 
i discovered this a couple of days ago and wondered since i thought we implemented that  then i discussed this with osio che team and not everyone thought that we should implement it  but we agreed that it is better to ask you and stevan 
ok  in the simplest possible form  just add the following dependency and the error occurs 
excellent  all these exceptions are gone after retesting the scenarios with a local build containing the latest master   smile   1st_place_medal 
 nicolas raoul the main problem with doing that is  what do we return as the value of  single jsonobject  getrevertrespobjectsingle    in the case of  client newcall request  execute     timing out  the function is   nonnull  so it will not be as simple as returning null  certainly still doable but would take more time and going through more of the code 
sure  same way i did since 2 1 or so  drag old exist from   applications   to trash  obviously its isn't running    relog os user   drag new exist into   applications    click on exist in   applications   after its done copying from dmg  configure mem settings  and confirm that the old data directory should be reused

hello stephane   first of all  i would like to apologize for the late answer but i was a bit away from work      finally  i found where does this issue come from    and i am quite embarrassed because the problem was totally related to my fragments lifecycle and not to rs   indeed  on orientation change i misunderstood how android worked and i was recreating my fragments whereas android was already taking care of it  that's explained why everything was duplicated     so  thanks for shedding some light on my issue and i feel deeply sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you 
ok  seem's to work  i uncheckt jshint and npm and the deadly indexing stoped   thanks
i seems like the root cause of the indefinite waiting is that after i click "save as draft"  the site is not redirected to integrations  and rather the view stays on the new integration page  the indefinite waiting occurs after second click on "save as draft"  which seems to try to create the integration  which already exists  this occurs in the log      2018 02 16 09 51 45 245 info  currentflow  error saving integration      "_body"  "   "error "  "uniqueproperty "  "message "  "value 'test' is not unique "  "property "  "create obj name "  "    "status"  400    "ok"  false    "statustext"  "bad request"      full log is attached    error_saving_integration log  https   github com syndesisio syndesis files 1730701 error_saving_integration log

one module  consisting of around 60 classes  although  i think it was indexing all my haxelibs which are substantial   thanks for that metric   maybe i didn't wait long enough   i gave it about 15 minutes  and it appeared as though intellij was trying to produce a crash log   it had a rather devastating impact on my intellij instance as a whole   i had to blow away all preferences and caches so i'm a little apprehensive to try again immediately     perhaps this issue should be closed  and i'll try again  or  keep my eyes open for the next release of this plugin   thanks for the insight

i deleted all configs except for forge cfg  and it does still crash  before the inspirations cfg can regenerate  however  it does generate a global cfg with some inspirations related options  https   pastebin com qddkhrie  if i change the "global config" option in forge cfg to false  the inspirations cfg does generate  and here it is  https   pastebin com vzbhz9a9  edit  i don't know what purpose the global config serves  i think i enabled it because i assumed it was related to the dimension unload delay  i shall disable it to fix the issue on my end 
i do not think it is related to buycraft per se  as i seem to get it with other scheduling mods and plugins   pixelmon seems to suffer similarly  here's the log from one of these crashes   2018 07 12 1 log  https   github com spongepowered spongecommon files 2191499 2018 07 12 1 log

no  i added it just in my code  never thought about having to add a library more than just once
i don't mean to be confusing   there's two issues  1  as described in #146  it appears that only   servers      server      id registry hub docker io  id      is supported in  settings xml   the credentials even appear to be applied to my own server  which i reference from my  pom xml  as   registry docker company com  registry    i had expected to add a  settings xml  entry such as   servers      server      id docker company com  id       but that didn't do anything  i now have in my  settings xml    servers      server      id registry hub docker io  id      with user name password for my own server  for the interim  funky  but different issue  #146   2  as meant in this issue  the documentation just talks a lot about  registry hub docker io   emphasis on  io    and it talks about it as if it's the default url for the docker registry  particularly that second quote in the original comment gave me that impression   but it seems to me now that this is not a valid url for a docker registry  rather  registry hub docker com  is  is it meant as a url  in which case i'd say _that's wrong_  or is it meant as an identifier of some sort 
i pass activity to glide with    no fragments involved     i tried glide clear imageview  on activity close  no effect  still rawdata remains allocated    i thought you're aware about the problem  if you're not i need to ensure i don't miss anything  could just be my fault   looks like some gifresourcedecoder decoder_pool references gifdecoder  that's why gifdecoder is retained forever and huge rawdata inside it    can't see gifresourcedecoder decoder_pool in the latest sources  probably the issue is already fixed  i build against 3 6 1

i am separating stdout from stderr already  the issue is that the message is included in both streams   regarding stdout vs  stderr and expectations  if the programmatic contract with the cli is expressed via both stdout and stderr  then both should provide structured responses  if the contract is always communicated via stdout  only it should provide a structured response and stderr can be free form   i integrate other clis with the ide  notably the salesforce dx cli  and when you run it with a    json  argument  the exit code determines which stream you should consume  both of which are written in json format   if pmd is only intended to write a structured xml response to stdout when run with the   f xml  argument  i agree that it doesn't matter how stderr is formatted  the contract just needs to be communicated documented enough for integrators

redisson 1 1 3 recompiled with jackson core downgraded to 2 1 4  dropwizard framework depends on it 
i guess it is caused by the auto umount of user home folder by ecryptfs in ubuntu 16 04 
the following code produces the same error when trying to extract a method from the body of  test

sorry for late reply 1  its ok that the slots are not item specific but for farm automation with ae2 or this mod i like to set the slots to a specific item like the hoe or a axe to auto pipe new tools into the slots so that not two tools of the same type can be in the farm  2  consume stacks means that in the left set of slots 1 item not planted to create a placeholder for this plant    3  your farm current pickup all plants and stores them first in the left set slots for planting so the farm fills itself with the farmed potato's or carrots  thats ok but the farm can only export from the right set of slots  i think that the handling of the pickup needs a configuration  ingame configfile  to make the default location for of harvested plants the right or the left set of slots     mfg ppvolto
i'm implementing actions for ashley  i want to keep the possibility and syntax of adding parallel events to entities just like its done with gdx actor events where you can write things like  actor addaction action1   actor addaction action2    and they will work together as parallel actions   in my implementation there's one actioncomponent and one acionsystem  you can add an action to an entity with this kind of syntax  actions moveto entity  x  y  duration    the static method adds the logic to the actioncomponent  but before doing it  it checks if the entity already has the actioncomponent and ads one if it hasn't  so turns out if i add 2 actions to an entity in a row  the second one won't know that the previous one already scheduled the actioncomponent creation and instead of adding only logic to the scheduled component  it will schedule a new component creation and overwrite previous one 
sorry here is the original image and yep i change the image position before cropping    20160505_173429  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 725227 15048782 3e74bafc 12eb 11e6 9c71 661dba9a0a72 jpg   attaching the image appeared in landscape format so it looks like it's something about meta data rotation with attribute exifinterface tag_orientation 

first  i got rid of those    's  i didn't keep the original java files and corresponding java json files  so we don't know which programs produces these bugs  btw  there are just so many of the programs having these     outputs  this might be a problem of the dom driver 
or at least make it so that the user can use the internal sd card 
ok  i will switch to waterfall tomorrow  please give me a few days to observe  thank you

hi  maxieds  i've performed some small tests  your app crashes when screen rotates   so i need to turn off screen rotation before usage  logged 3 different connections and like the output of your log export 
i'm not quite sure but believe that i checked that  too  think it was the same error message   i found a workaround by changing the  foreach part by     surprisingly this works fine for me   maybe this is useful for someone else   
can you access to  above two links  if you can  you will see a short video and find the difference if you compare two videos carefully the problem is the gif doesn't play smoothly  it lose frames in gridview  the first gif seems most obvious  you can observe the changes of it's hand   my english is poor  i hope you can understand thanks for your help

no  i don't think there is such settings  burp itself is terrible at unicode  i simply intercept some json response and add those characters  i suspect that pasting unicode isn't supported either  so i paste base64 encoded text   0idqgnca0idqgnca    and hit  ctrl  +  shift  +  b  to decode it in proxy intercept tab  neither copy nor paste of unicode works in burp   this bug only happens to http response  according to my experiments

http   i imgur com ah2ar2x png nabbed a screen from random video with outdated mod to give you an idea  you see how there is 64x soldified experience in it  well if i keep opening dropping xp and opening it sometimes doesn't show there  it just shows as an empty slot  clicking in the empty slot has the correct behavior though   i can still withdraw the xp perfectly fine   the glitch happens at random   is video still needed 
hey  thanks for the new release  but unfortunately  the bug remains  same message as previously in the console  with "error  bdx build failed" at the end

i guess   r  are here to prevent matching an eventual existing  icon  file which is not the one from the os  how unlikely it could be   i guess the original template is this one  https   github com github gitignore blob master global osx gitignore  but the 2   r  of this one are parsed into   0  somewhere  i'm not sure but that might be related to a57acd46f149218c  which was solving issue #13   i don't have any clue in mind on how to solve this  but i guess that  pragmatically  having  icon  without any   r  may be less likely to cause troubles than  icon  with   0  which may break things regarding tools you use  what do you think 
this fixes the problem   thanks a lot

hi  marcanpilami  i will recheck it on monday   the issue was in text selection   logs displayed correctly  but  i was can't select them  so  i can't select some part of logs and copy paste it to somewhere  but  without time filter everything is ok 
it's this plugin  https   ore spongepowered org blood griefprevention they were working fine together until a chestshop was made in an admin claim  i saw the console started just spitting out errors so i tried to restart it  and i could no longer join  this was the first chest shop that was made so i don't know if it's just them in general or if it was because it was in a claim   i've stopped using total economy in the meantime  but i kept a backup of the files from when it was last on so i'll try disabling the chest shops now   edit  same results with chestshops disabled  also tried deleting griefprevention

i was also under the impression that the issue has been fixed on 1 4 7  however i still have it on two different computers  my main development notebook and a surface pro which i carry around     it seems that selecting "sleep" in windows start menu and then waking up shortly after seems not enough to trigger it    however  yesterday evening i left my surface in "sleep" by pressing the power key and closing the lid  this morning the dokany letter was "taken" and shown in explorer but data inside was inaccessible as per the op   my guess is that there is a "deeper" sleep state  similar to hibernate perhaps  that is entered after some time and not immediately  hibernate however is not enabled on this particular device so it must be the deep sleep of windows 10    i'll  try to enable hibernation and see if it changes something or if it makes it easier to reproduce  i'll also try the mirror suggestion and report back   update 1  hybernation alone is not enough to trigger the issue reliably

i have researched a bit further on this  and  it seems to have to do with   windows vista   onward   user account control   and windows protection mechanism for its   c  program   directory   if i start _dbeaver_ as i described in the support issue  with   mydata   directory in the   c  program  x86    directory then _dbeaver_ can't will not generate a   dbeaver debug log   file    this is a bit surprising since the    log   file is created without any fuss   if i instead ask _dbeaver_ to generate its configuration files in the   c  programdata   directory  then the   dbeaver debug log   file is created      ps    on   windows xp    or earlier  it is allowed to create and edit files in the   c  program   directory  so the   dbeaver debug log   file is created without any trouble     pps    with a bit of luck this might solve my support issue #3750  trouble to run repacked version of _dbeaver_  i will try it out when i get back to work  i'm currently on vacation

technically this is not in production since the generated tests are not running in ci  but it fails when i run them manually on api client staging repository   regarding  write   that's fair enough  in that case maybe we want to switch the design back to the original one    i remember that originally  mockstream write    was placed at the end of the each test case but i recommended to move into the common  mockserverstreaminggrpcmethod  in a pr

hi  if it can help  the method is implemented in a separate jar  which his not included in the compiler class path  this because the plugin has been plugged in the _api_ module  not the _impl_  so at generation time  non information  a part from declaration   is provided to plugin  anyway the implementation of the method can return _null_ if the resource has not been found

clickhouse server has a specific option to set the user as "readonly" which users delete  create etc  queries are ignored  that user will have read only access   please check related clickhouse documentation page  https   clickhouse docs readthedocs io en latest access_rights html    when i try to connect a with a readonly user from dbeaver to clickhouse server  dbeaver tries to set "extremes" value as false  due to that query clickhouse server gives error  because of readonly user   so there should be an option on dbeaver connection settings  when its enabled  means readonly   dbeaver shouldnt send any query related to writing  create  update  delete  set etc    makes sense   p s  i'll also try to get the exact error message

we used to paint the coastline with separate rules for  closed  or not and a fixed width for all zoom levels  which didn't look very good   now appearance is more clear  but some may still like to have coastline in the maps  that's why i didn't remove it from  tag mapping   to let them paint it if they want   the land polygons  if they are split  cannot be used easily for that without artifacts

it can be reproduced with any version up to  dalston sr1  included  i created a simple application using the spring initializr by including the features  web    eureka  and  actuator   here is a short excerpt of the logs   once the application is started  try to _pause_ it via a call to  post  pause      the eurekaserviceregistry simply update the instancestatus   but nothing is listening to these changes anymore since he eurekaclient is dead   and nothing will restart it  nothing will happen anymore beyond this point  the application won't be registered with the eureka server anymore nor any heartbeat will be sent 
hi  aurelhubert sorry for late response  the error appears when i use ahbottom version 1 3 1 to android version below api 23  marshmallow      no i didn't use vectors i still used drawables for the icons     appcompat i used are v7 24 0 0  so i rollback using ahbottom version 1 2 3 and it's works well across api level e g from 16 to 24

i tried with both upgrade and doing a fresh install on the nextcloud app  it could be to do with the odd file system layout on the original fairphones  the internal nand is partitioned into a 1gb "internal storage" and a 13gb "phone storage"  this is before you add an sd card    https   support fairphone com hc en us articles 201327645 what is the storage layout of the fairphone 1   i previously had the nextcloud app on the "phone storage" internal partition 
the important part of the pom i think is this         plugin  		 groupid org springframework boot  groupid  		 artifactid spring boot maven plugin  artifactid  		 configuration  			 executable true  executable  		  configuration  	  plugin    it creates an executable jar which brings the boot inf structure  boot inf classes cassandra migration  i think supplying multiple paths instead of just one would resolve the issue   here's the jar format  https   docs spring io spring boot docs current reference html executable jar html
i did not think of that  i'll try to make the gradle plugin use this for x compilation  not sure i'll be for the 2 6 release  as i'm swamped  but maybe   i guess we can close this issue  thanks 
i have managed to reproduce this on different android versions  4 2  4 4  5 1  
no  it wont allow the tool part ot be replaced giving the standard warning saying the modifier cannot be combined with luck etc etc

not sure this is the equivalent     i think the problem here lies in the fact that the server time is slightly more in the future than the client time    notice the 1000ms sleep time   we are after the  date  sent from the server 
yes
i imported an integration that was failing for ricardo   here  https   drive google com file d 1hpbkgzc8thx05_aqo5ixnhnhh2afjjxs view usp sharing  is the zip export   the integration started with webhook and then invoked a rest api via custom api connector and ended up publishing to slack  could be that the issue is only when we use  pipeline  which we do for custom api connectors and  iirc  don't for http connectors

let me try to explain how views actually look  1  video texture fits all the screen  but actually rendering may not cover all it's area  for example  screen 1080x2220 and typical video 16 9 is rendering like 1080x608 and other area is just black   it's necessary to have such a big texture to be able make animated transitions scales crops etc from one screen to another  2  if subtitleview measured like 1080x2220 then we have a huge size of text and it's not i'am expect      if it is measured to video frame size 1080x608 and located in screen center over video then there's a bug when cues rendered somewhere bottom outside subtitle's view

sorry for the confusion  what i tried to do is  extend product entity to add a new field a  and then extend orderitemfieldserviceimpl to add a field with name product a  when admin app starts up  an exception of "unable to find the field declared in fielddata  product a  on the target class  org broadleafcommerce core order domain orderitemimpl   or any registered entity class that derives from it " is thrown    after some tracing  this seems to be resulted in method getfield class    clazz  string fieldname  of fieldmanager line 95  where entities 0  is used for matching instead of matchedclasses  in my case the matched entity is entities 1  so field can't not be found in entities 0  which is productbundle   hope this clarifies the confusion  thanks

well  i'm not completely sure  pyramid  is actually necessary at all  but since we are offering it as a way to build 3d shapes  i would expect they are all treated the same way with respect to their various possibilities  and being textured in the display is one of them  so  yes  either we remove  pyramid  altogether  or we implement its  textured  display

aha  more information needed to reproduce this  when running the zip i get the correct documentation  but when i apply the following enunciate xml file that i use then it appear again  so if the default generation is used  then the documentation is correctly generated  this this is even more of a corner case than i realized

jesse   i don't want to drop the table   geonetwork does in its database init method  dblib java    we could change all that in 2 12 x but probably not in 2 10 x   in any case it's probably safer for geonetwork to remove the table rather than assume that a table with that name has the structure it expects    that aside  the problem seems to be caused by earlier code in jeevesengine which opens a database channel  originally to test the db connection  which is now also being used to select stuff from the services table but which is never closed  this seems to hang the drop table call made later by geonetwork dblib when initializing the database  closing that test channel in jeevesengine fixes the problem and releases a channel  probably better for resource usage   i'm just making sure that this has no other implications before committing the fix   cheers  simon       from  jesse eichar  notifications github com  sent  monday  10 february 2014 9 13 pm to  geonetwork core geonetwork cc  pigot  simon  cmar  hobart  subject  re   core geonetwork  postgres database loading hangs webapp when trying to drop services and serviceparameters table  #387   why do you want to drop table  shouldn't you simply delete the records   — reply to this email directly or view it on githubhttps   github com geonetwork core geonetwork issues 387#issuecomment 34615961

in my mod omt i use 2 systems  one that tracks all listeners  on the server inventory container  detectandsendchanges    and just distributes a custom network message  simpleimpl  to each listener per tick  explanation for the other is down further  they both make gui information that is not inventory  since minecraft handles that itself  super smooth and doesnt impact performance nearly as much as block updates do   for the first system that can be used for guis that have an inventory container  https   github com openmodularturretsteam openmodularturrets blob 1 12 src main java omtteam openmodularturrets client gui containers turretbasecontainer java#l140 l149 https   github com openmodularturretsteam openmodularturrets blob 1 12 src main java omtteam openmodularturrets network messages messageturretbase java   and i have an additional system that works for guis without inventory containers  it is a tiny bit more complicated and uses my library mod  basically the tileentities that use it need to implement an interface  and have a list variable that gets updated through that interface  in their update   method they send a message to each member of that list containing needed information and additionally they scrub that list every 20 lists or so  checking player distance from block  in case a crash occurs or the gui did not close properly    https   github com openmodularturretsteam omlib blob 1 12 src main java omtteam omlib network isyncablete java  this interface is then used by 2 messages that get sent during init of a gui on the client and on gui close  https   github com openmodularturretsteam omlib blob 1 12 src main java omtteam omlib client gui trustedplayersgui java#l75 l80 those messages are really simple  they simply grab the listener list via a function on the interface and either add or remove a listener based on the contents of the message   sounds a bit complicated but this solved all the sync issues   performance  due to block updates  unneceesary information flow  issues in my mod s

that was also my thinking  but i tried it with only gc com active and it still shows the same thing  i force stopped c geo and restarted it and the log looks exactly like above  then i activated ec com  alone and in combination with gc com  and can see the same behaviour also for ec com  the requests are also send twice  
hmm   that was a bug  thank's for noticing this  i just logged off and then on and everything is normal now   
the unbreaking enchantment is able to be applied via the enchanting table though   and it is used in the code to reduce power cost by adding a chance to not consume power on usage  if unbreaking isn't desired for this effect  is it possible to add a new enchantment for powered tools that specifically reduces power draw 
nope  only replaced the file and restarted server its fixed

sam local has nothing to do with the swagger that generates html and css portion   the security mechanism that is used with swagger i found was conflicting with the sam local proxy security   in fact the mvc portion of spring boot used with lambda was requiring a login user name and password  which in fact without lambda is not a requirement   i have provided two examples  one with swagger  and one without   the lambda example does not have swagger support  but it would be nice to have it   i can provide and reproduce a test case that provides a failing result  with swagger integrated into the lambda example     otherwise  you can look at the two test cases  and let me know what you think

thanks for this amazing fast response  i've just tried using the newly created  spring data webflux  from pr #938  my webflux application runs successfully but it seems that deserialization is broken for non entity view types when using  bodytomono   the deserialization done with all fields assigned to null 
if there are no ranks available then an info message should come up to say mann whitney requires ranks  upload ranks to use this test   or if there are no ranks don't have the option in the drop down box    rank file missing some of the genes  will a rank of zero be ignored   i would rather we don't exclude the gene but by default put it at the bottom of the rank list or in the advanced settings maybe have this as a setting to either exclude unranked genes or include 
at least  select version     returns "10 3 7 mariadb log" in our mariadb maxscale environment and something like "5 0 96 standard" in mysql 
what's interesting  i noticed that some folders would sync while others did not  last night i tried the same thing on my wife's phone and all worked as should  i reinstalled the app on my phone with no change  i cleared cache and reinstalled  same issue  i did that about half a dozen times  rebooting the phone hooping that some small piece of install remained that was preventing the app from uploading photos videos from the main folder  changed to a new folder on the server to upload to  nothing was happening   then  not attributing to anything that i did  the files were uploaded on their own    now  again it seems to have stalled  force rescan does not change anything   yes  i am on the latest stable android apk

i'm not sure if i understand what you mean  if you just use the current demo for cards  https   gwtbootstrap3 github io gwtbootstrap3 demo #card  in firefox  you'll see the issue i'm referring to here  i confirmed that it's not something on the recent version of firefox and went as far back as firefox 31  does that make sense 
hi i tested with 1 3 3 and  4  same issue unfortunately i do no have a stacktrace 'cause i fixed my eureka clients to set both urls as a quick workaround but remains sensible to new clients who do not do the same   i looked over commit f95f7a5 and it sounds good  thx for that  i'll test when new version will be available   christophe

in this case i'm just using free hosting somewhere  so i'm not entirely certain how to check  i can tell you that fever itself works more or less normally in chrome  though  there aren't any trailing spaces in any field  or leading for that matter

hi  apologies for the misleading issue above i have finally reproduced with curl  i had missed something from my mapping previously   this seems to be cause by nested fields  in the last step outlined below there are 2 results  if the mapping for entitycontent is removed then there are no results  this is correct   n b  not sure if this helps or not but this is a regression from 1 7 3 caught by one of our tests as part of me upgrading to 2 1 0  steps

yes we do use lambda     but looking at the assertion which for reference is    the cname that comes through is  "' lcom sun enterprise connectors authentication connectorsecuritymap "  which looks perfectly fine  i think the assertion is just wrong as the 'l' character indicates an object type not an array type  i suspect just changing the assert to  assert cname charat 0     ' '    would work    although this is a pre coffee assessment

first  thank you for the quick response and the test case   we could reproduce the problem by slightly modifying the test case in the pull request   you just need to run update view after the 2 x objects are saved and before the 3 x objects are saved  which is what happens in normal syncing with the server  first  get the conflict state  update view  then get conflict resolution  update view    we have an idea for a fix as well   but that comes later     please re open this issue after reviewing the new test case 
 kevinushey  i was running an example that i found online   i don't actually need to read  stdin  in general   the issue is that when i ran  readlines file "stdin"    i could not do anything in the rstudio console   i had to restart the r session   the issue that i'd like to have fixed is that the command above should not block the console   could  stdin  handling be updated so that  readlines file "stdin"    just returns  character 0   like rgui does

hey  thanks for the quick reply    this is correct  when playing mobarena itself  everything behaves as expected  the problem occurs with teleports completely unrelated to any mobarena    the oppisite is the case   mobarena _allows_ teleports that other plugins have cancelled   that is it sets cancelled to _false_ even though a different plugin previously set it to _true_    i can confirm that this is the case  in the original test i had the     permission  wildcard for all permissions  set for my account  without that permission  which also implicitly unsets the  mobarena admin teleport  permission  the teleport remains cancelled  i e  mobarena no longer interferes with the other plugin   i can understand that sometimes forcing the event to be uncancelled for moving players to and from the arena is necessary to keep other plugins from interfering  but i don't see a reason to uncancel it based on a permission  having a permission to _not cancel_ teleports for ops inside an arena is great   but actively _uncancelling_ previously already cancelled events makes no sense imo   thanks for looking into it

i'm only building for android so i haven't tested it on ios 
it did solve the problem  thanks   it might be a good idea to add a descriptive error instead of just failing  tho 
not possible  only that "extended standby" option is available   i always have a few 'essential' apps running on background and they never stop doing their job with the screen off  but chibe seems to stop working after screen off lock  when i turn the screen on it starts working again  similar 'alarm clock' apps always work     e g  set chibe hourly  i e  next should be 5 pm  then alarm app to 5 05pm  chibe fails  alarm app works   maybe you missed something to wake up the device   anyway  i gonna retest this tomorrow  well today  later

hi  geosearchef    thanks for the quick response  i'm certain the client is aware where it can find the forged alliance installation  considering it has worked before and according to the settings  the path is correct   i set it again just to make sure but the error still occurs   i uploaded the full version of the latest log  including at least one occurence of this error  you can find it  here  http   f cybrox eu t faf log      yep     i downgraded to  0 7 7 2 alpha  and can connect just fine  so it seems to be an issue with  0 8 0 beta 
yes   on mon  oct 9  2017 at 5 38 pm marcel hlopko  notifications github com  wrote 
it is not clear to me this will solve the issue and may present more issues than it solves  other project types do not have the ant scripts  in nbproject  either  they maybe provision for this i have not had time to look  perhaps a better  or at least quicker  strategy would be to disable plugin functionality on non compatible project types  
i grabbed alpha08  the first query runs fine  the second indeed takes a lot of time  but it does not crash as it used to   as it does a big antijoin operation followed by a double optional match   anyways  i don't think that's a problem  i changed that query a lot since then  see its  commit history  https   github com ldbc ldbc_snb_implementations commits master cypher queries opencypher bi 19 cypher    it turned out i misinterpreted the ldbc spec in one place and we also changed the semantics of the query in another  the new query runs a few seconds using alpha08   so in conclusion  i believe this issue is fixed now 
logcat doesn't seem to have anything when opening the player discovery      it does freeze for maybe two seconds after returning      i tried  mupeace debug apk  and it doesn't seem to be any different 
super cool 
thanks applied fix  change to asertxmltag is not required  i was trying to add testcase according to exact scenario i had encountered but this fix does not need it   updated pull request 
it seems that using a  viewpropertyanimator  on the progress bar triggers the issue 
soory  it seems to be problem of the apache server  after deactivating nextcloud the problems came after some time back   have the reinstall the server and in the moment it's working  can't investigate the problem anymore 
yes  probably it's the same  i have one preferencefragment that loads preferences that consists nested prferencescreens

no   that does not match my case   maybe i was a little unclear  network  internet  so disable all internet connection leads to the problem   follow the steps above and tell me if you can reproduce this   by the way  the non available location should be avoided if you switch on coarse location on your device   
imo  k wall is right  also given that we have this issue too #2863 related to resources not deleted probably due to lack of owner references i think it's worth giving this a look  apart from that  lulf   it's maybe correct to adapt systemtests to use the documented uninstalling process  i'm thinking of a reason not to do it but nothing comes to my mind  maybe  kornys have something to say
sorry for the delay  i've send details by mail
gregory   i agree it is a complex issue but also maybe a flaw in the tap protocol    if tap has started writing to the http response  it is forbidden by http to change the http status  forward or redirect   http_header info     as you said  if the response is committed  then the tap server can not modify the response  except close it but not reset it   of course  you should log such rare cases in the uws log with stack traces    maybe you should bufferize the complete tap response  formatter  in memory or into tmp files in order to let the response ready      or explain that issue at the ivoa level to make a tap enhancement    laurent

the thing is it breaks if you enable merge paths but doesn't if you turn them off   i have the same behavior in my flutter port and i'm looking for clarification on these mappings   flutter's been great   i nearly have parity with the android version and i'm hoping to release an initial version soon  need a pr i have open in the engine to land that enables path measure and path operations

 gunnarmorling hello gunnar  thank you for the offer  i would like to implment this fix but i´m short of time at the moment  anyways  i do not discart coming back to implement it sometime 
well  this is interesting  i reinstalled the 2169 and i can't reproduce the freeze problem anymore 🤔 i cleared the logs   caches multiple times before the updates  so i don't have the logs unfortunately    i'll send you the logs if i can reproduce the freezing again  sorry    and thanks  😅
as a first step  changing the error message is enough for us 
i agree using duplicate column names is bad practice but forcing clients to select every column to avoid including two  or more   _id  is a bit annoying  cry    how would you feel about keeping   1 etc    or would it be possible to append the table name instead   _id_table1   _id_table2

i agree with  kbd bug  kbd   even if it has never worked 
i see it opening and i can navigate it but as soon as i click to "choose" a file  it closes  i get that exception and the app crashes or freezes

it's everything on the screenshots to be frank…oracle java 1 8 0 u 45  x86_64   had the same problem with the   non supported   openjdk version  but didn't test other java versions as of yet
 edmundoa thanks for the help   i'm a bit confused by your first paragraph  first day is still jan 1 for me  because there should be no dec 31 logs at all and all these timestamps are ingested explicitly   but if i understand you correctly  it doesn't matter and yes  you are right  switching minute resolution does not show any time shift in the histogram unlike the day resolution  so this really seems to be exactly #1830  i completely missed this issue when looking up past ones

hi  i understand the cassandra restriction limitation to mentioned  the only reason i was using the  column annotation  was becaue i wanted be able to explicitly set the name of the counter  would it be possible to add an attribute to  counter to set the generated name for it in the schema  
sure
one is  r  and the others is  ctrl+r  so we should be able to have both

hey i'm really sorry i completely forgot about this  here a video of the bug  https   nextcloud abifog com index php s xokgzy6x4w4rb4f  btw  i think this can be fixed by explicitly disabling split screen support for goyp like the uber app  when its launched in split screen  it overrules all other apps and maximizes  something similar should happen when goyp is triggered by launching a selected app in split screen

thanks for taking a look at this   been banging my head on it for a bit   your screen shot shows that the browser accessed localhost 8080 elda def foo bar 1   the failure condition arises when you dereference the actual uri in the data   try pointing the browser at  http   example org def foo bar 1   see the second bullet in the list of ways that does work   if you don't want to mess with your hosts file and ports  you might try modifying the data so that the data is    http   localhost 8080 elda def foo bar 1 skos inscheme http   localhost 8080 elda def foo bar    though that is not how i've been seeing it happen   if that doesn't trigger it for you  then i can try to mirror your setup   they symptoms of the loop are    tomcat at   100  cpu utilization for many minutes   fan gets loud   no stack trace   have to kill tomcat to recover   elda logging says its about to render the result and then it heads of to never never land  i have an apache front end proxying to elda in tomcat7 on ubuntu 14 04   have had it fail on elda 1 3 3 and 1 3 4   my environment is a bit unusual   i'm using docker so that could introduce an issue   if it doesn't reproduce for you  i can try it in vm instead     note the xslt renderer is working   the velocity renderer is working with  the  html extension and other access uri patterns

well  it doesn't give any errors  but it just doesn't put any reference to moviemeter  id or any scraped field  inside the xml files of the scraped movies  so maybe it can't retrieve the id on its own or maybe it doesn't scrape at all  even with a nfo with moviemeter id present    example of scraped movie  nfo file present  but no moviemeter id inside  with latest yamj and only scraping from moviemeter  not imdb  nfo etc in priority   http   d h st xis1  the entire test yamj and jukebox  http   d h st caw6

 joshiste during our cicd process  we have a phase where we run the app as a non web app on a random port  this is causing failure due to above exception 
actually the change updated it to 25 0 1  added you in cc  maybe they are doing something wrong on their ci about it  since it is not breaking with ndk12  i think we can remove it from release blocker 
also  your reply that "this is a limitation of gradle itself" seems to ignore my initial statement    do you still need a sample from me   i'm not clear at this point 
hi joschi    i will test it with the next beta version    thanks

 ryanjbaxter thanks for your response  the reason being we do not want the developer to be concerned with the fact the service is a eureka client in development mode  it is a  infrastructure concern  we only want to use the service as a eureka client  in higher environments by applying a profile accordingly   but  the concern now being it worked fine for us when we were using spring boot 1 4 5  probably something has changed in next version of spring 1 5 3 which has caused this breaking change for us  i was not able to find anything from the release notes   do you mean creating a eurekaclient bean would resolve this issue  not sure how that would do so 
the version is 0 6 0  and line 248 cannot generate a cce  so it must be the type cast call  but then the exception seen should have been a  malformedclaimexception 
the config has no effect  yea it just appears the same before you configure
hi alex  i'm actually pretty sure that volumes doesn't do what i want since they are only available at runtime  what i want is some way of pulling artifacts out of the built vm at build time  it seems that docker cp would achieve this  but there is no binding for it  i'd be interested in adding this if you thought it was a good idea and could point me at where in the code it should sit
if you run the application with    gradlew bootrun  you will see that it cannot be started 
oh  sorry  0 5 1  i assumed autoupdates   just updated to 0 5 2  looks like npe gone 
yea agreed   nothing should be valid _when executing_ which is why i assume it's tryin to kill some tools   specifically  this code is never referenced  so likely not used  i didn't fully unpack the protector    so i'm assuming it's not used     dexlib2 handles this fine since baksmali worked on it   no access to ida right now or dexdump   this actually would be a cool detection use case for a protector or anti trick if apkid or something detected register ranges outside the context of the function 
yup  just updated to bata9 and everything seems to be working as expected 
buildcraft and applied energistics  i have also tried other mods and same thing  when i take out bungee and just connect straight to the server it works great 
sorry  i should have given a screen copy    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 12892581 15964328 495dd3e2 2f18 11e6 9d31 2577badd3120 png  here  "where" should automatically be converted in upper case  but it is not the case   
image  http   i imgur com 3hq0g8b png  generator has a lever on the front or sides  doesn't matter   i shorted the multiblock down to just a generator and a generator controller and had the same results   ssp image  http   i imgur com 5ts3boh png  after some time troubleshooting  this ends up being a crossmod interaction with   botania   removed it and sure enough  the noise persisting forever behavior goes away   i'm not sure where to take the debugging process from here  its a little baffling

good question  i couldn't tell  what would be a fast vnc server setup to test 
my server is currently on 1 7 10 so i'm currently unsure if this happens on the newer minecraft versions
sorry  mistake  i meant "beam"  english   is sometimes not so easy   
it is working perfectly in my device i observed this behavior in oneplus 6t i don't have that phone i will get in two days i will update the log message in pr template
yea 0 7 1 does not have that issue  thanks 👍
sorry for not answering  i was offline yesterday  the last version fixed the issue 
i couldn't setup admin access at once  i used this online service  https   bcrypt generator com  it generated a hash  but it didn't work  i thought  it was because of "special" symbols  like       that's why i put the password in quotes  then i tried another online service  http   bcrypthashgenerator apphb com  it's hash worked  finally  i forgot to remove them   as soon as online generators are not reliable  and there is no way to access admin tools without having hashed password  would it be better    to have some standalone util for generating hashes for passwords    to let login to admin without a password  then you can generate hash using built in tool     to skip passwords hashing  and let users encrypt their passwords using master key   for me all this three "security" realted topics  "application secret" "password hashing with  bcrypt " "master password for values"  looked a little bit messy  or complex  when i read docs  probably  it could be a subject for simplification or more clear explanation

i was using the default  so i assume that's english  i may not be likely to find a zero width space in many encodings anyway  i am boldly assuming  so changing language may be a no go altogether   can the mapping between unicode code points and encodings be somehow influenced  i don't think a zero width space is mapped very well onto a     when there is something like a soft hyphen available  and yes  opinions may vary   if the rationale here is that all unmappable characters are shown as     can i perhaps configure that last resort somewhere   i can work around this problem by using soft hyphens  which are actually rendered properly  and keep their function   they may even be more appropriate for my purpose  which is making line break suggestions as to prevent line overflows   however  the soft hyphens appear in tocs  both fo pdf and htmlhelp  as regular dashes  which of course  is not what i want  do you want me to open a new issue for that

no it's not correct  i'm missing some notifications which i can see while i browse to the notifications page  i'm only seeing 17 returned from curl and just noticed that the notification page is returning duplicate entries on page 1 and 2  so what i see is  on the first page there are 10 notifications  and on page 2 there are 10 notifications  what i'm seeing is on page 1 is notifications with title 1 10 and on page 2 i see notifications 2 11  so on page 2 i'm not seeing the top most notification entry from page 1  but i'm seeing the other 9  plus 1 extra which isn't on page 1  hope it doesn't sound to confusing  i've included 2 screenshots  where you can see the bottom of page 1 and page 2  and you can see that there are 2 identical notifcations displayed altough i only created it once  the json that curl returned is valid  i posted in duckduck go json parser     1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 26430811 23950825 9499c90c 098c 11e7 9954 99daab57713c png    2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 26430811 23950829 97791024 098c 11e7 978b 59f1ecd109fa png

i guess the complexity is due to the fact while ticks are removed from the timeseries  the cachedindicator's value list is not touched and we rely on the beginindex  endindex  and removedtickcount to square up the two    on cachedindicator java line  87   result   calculate removedtickscount     looks like it causes the stack overflow  should it be  result   calculate 0      just let me know if this is the direction you want to go and i'll create a pull request  i already have the fix in my local "fork" and it works without issue

 jmakeig and  clockworked247  thanks for the comments   if i've worked long and hard to create a mapping definition in quickstart  that definition's representation in the ui should not break if a user deletes updates adds documents in staging   i like the idea of highlighting properties that the ui can no longer find   and that can happen currently if a user adds or deletes documents in staging   i also think the user should also see the type and value information that was there before  the ui can't show this information with the current data model when the property is gone 
which is what i would expect  the thing is  the live data passed through the same sync pipeline as my localhost index  so i suppose the newer  live build takes care of these null pointers

for incremental build i see main java  23 27  cannot find symbol symbol    class main_stringfoo_builder location  interface foo bar main stringfoo main java  17 5  builder extends the wrong type  should be main_genericfoo_builder   i don't see errors for clean build  also i don't see any of the warnings  but probably you're correct     so you will keep this and add separate bug  too 
this is not the warning from the catch clauses inside gcmavailablehelper that you had recently surrounded with "if  build debug "   it doesn't even get to that point because the gcmavailablehelper  class cannot be loaded at all

actually with the samples that you given  but i just change the data and add some function to do multiple delete 
seems to happen in any case  they just don't get deleted at all from the database
in the case of our own code and our own tests  we already use  doprivileged  in any locations which i'm aware of  but even if we weren't  we give our own code permission to read any system property   actually  we give junit the permission to read any system property as well  but _because it isn't using  doprivileged _  callers further down the stack get checked as well  and apparently no matter what we put into the security policy  those ones can't be marked as trusted   we use the security manager to stop code  both libraries and our own code  since this is a testing framework  it seems reasonable to get extra checking for free where possible   doing various things we don't want them to do  but mostly to stop them writing data outside of where we tell them to or exiting the jvm  yeah  it has actually happened before     the former could theoretically be done by writing a custom nio2 filesystem which wraps the real filesystem  but it would be a lot of work to make it support absolutely everything the real one supports  the latter is impossible to do any other way  at least as far as i am aware 
this looks like it has been fixed

i have installed it through the boards manager  arduino ide version 1 8 11 core 2 6 3  i was following below steps mentioned here     https   github com azure azure iot arduino  i think some issue with "platform local txt" file  but i don't know what's the exact issue here 
it's going to be tricky to do much with the cluster metadata before loading plugins   do we need to write to the keystore at all during startup  could we instead move the responsibility for upgrading an old format keystore to the  elasticsearch keystore  command   that said  on reflection the keystore might not matter so much here anyway because it's something that a user can create again themselves  it could be enough to emit a more actionable error message telling them to delete and re create it if it can't be loaded

yes  both  file and folder with the same name within the same parent directory  and yes  i'm familiar with vaults and can assure the problem is definitly related to file structure  moreover  there are a lot of other files and folders  beside the corrupted ones  in the same parent directory which are absolutely clean 
yes  it works nicely now 
works for me  thank you  soundtricker

yes  that's what it should do    problem is that it doesn't go to half  it goes to a bit more than half  i thought the screenshots explanatory text would explain it   my screen is a 4 3 screen  1280 1024 pixels  it should try to fit it to half the screen  then notice the client doesn't fit  and make it as big as it has to be   but  it makes the client slightly bigger  see  black bars  these can be removed if i manually resize the client   if it's not clear  i can make a video on it   ps  sorry for not replying  deathbeam  i must've forgotten  if i use other programs  they take half the width  but they don't have a minimum width  if you know of a program that also has a minimum width  i can test it 
my previous release was some months old  from july  at that time  the path was " usr bin  bin"   anything else had to be explicity referenced with an absolute path or placed in the evnironment   the "exec env  " shows the you are trying to clear the environment  but then you place a leaky definition of path coming from the operator's console  that seems like a problem  particularly in standalone mode   this genrule should illustrate the issue 
i built mapstruct from master and then the generated code is just fine      sorry for opening this issue  i guess it can be closed  thx guys for this great tool

nothing in console  what is suppose to happen  like it use to in tekkit classic  is  f access restricts a territory to the person you assign it too  like it would lock chests  breaking blocks etc unless you were the faction leader and officer  but my faction members can break blocks and open my chests even though it says they have restricted access in that territory  you would do  f access f "dangerline"  my faction  and  f access p enterprise12  me  which would normally restrict it so only i can do anything within that territory   feel free to send somebody in to see what i mean  24 46 189 96 25565   tekkit lite website  www nucleartekkit enjin com  uptime  2 10pm eastern time zone  today i should be on around 5 6 to 10pm

helllo  bclozel  thank you for the reaction   in our team  we provided our own custom  requestedcontenttyperesolver  for  requestmappinghandlermapping  to convert our own accept header and content type header   this is because the accept header controls versioning    usually  handlermapping is executed in the following order   1   webfluxendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver   2   controllerendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver   3   requestmappinghandlermapping   customrequestedcontenttyperesolver   the value of mediatypesattribute cached by  headercontenttyperesolver  of  webfluxendpointhandlermapping  is cleared when  controllerendpointhandlermapping  ends   however  for some reason  our team executed handlermapping in the following order   i am aware that this is a rare case    1   webfluxendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver   2   requestmappinghandlermapping   customrequestedcontenttyperesolver  3   controllerendpointhandlermapping    headercontenttyperesolver    in this case  the mediatypesattribute value cached by the  headercontenttyperesolver  of  webfluxendpointhandlermapping  is inherited by  requestmappinghandlermapping  without being cleared  therefore  we can no longer resolve the mediatypesattribute with the customrequestedcontenttyperesolver   manipulating the handlermapping order can solve the above problem  however  if   webfluxendpointhandlermapping  alone can clear the value of mediatypesattribute  can the value of mediatypesattribute be handled without depending on the order of handlermapping   what do you think

uh  yes  i can always reproduce it  i use the latest the riot version from the playstore with android 6  to my knowledge i have all relevant power saving features disabled   when i get a mention or a highlight on matrix  my phone vibrates and the led starts blinking  when i now open riot in the browser and read the message the phone continues to blink  now when i pick up my phone and open riot android  i can see the notifications for a split second and then the client apparently gets all informations from the server and marks everything read and deletes the notifications

heya  jmmv  i don't know a lot about the docker internals but will tell you whatever i can   when using the   v   pwd  w   src  flag on docker  i am saying "i want the contents of the current directory   given by    pwd  w   to be mounted under docker at   src "   i was calling this volume because it uses the   v  flag  but it looks like the correct name is "bind mount"  https   docs docker com storage bind mounts   the sources are definitely on windows  the host  in this case  in the current directory  i just checked and it is indeed a ntfs drive   the sources are being exposed inside the running docker container  as far as i know they aren't copied anywhere  changes that i do in the host are reflected in the container  and vice versa  i don't know the details of how docker accomplishes this   i think there is a bug in bazel's    watchfs  because    the files do change inside the container     file changes are not recognized with    watchfs    file changes are recognized with without    watchfs

an empty coordinate array would be the obvious equivalent representation  and what i initially expected i'd get  i dug through the geojsonwriter code and realized it was a deliberate choice that  to quote a comment in the test class  "empty atomic geometries are not supported in geojson"  so my suggestion for using a  null value was based on that  and the spec's somewhat vague "implementation _may_ interpret   "    personally  i'd prefer an empty coordinate array  to maintain the type as you say  but i don't know if that has  say  some interop issues 
i have version 1 8 and it appears my rom is headered as its at 4097 even tough its fresh out of the rar folder and japanese  should i go get another one or can i just patch it to be unheadered with something like lunarips edit i'm off to find a new one  sorry i'm not great with understanding how technology works  i'll have to draw you something for taking this much of your time as an apology

hi   so i tried to create a message with no number in the 'to' field  but the app doesnt allow me to do that  it does not even save it as a draft without a number in or contact name in the field  i went through all the logs in that phone  to see if a specific phone number came with no phone number  but that is not the case  they all have either a contact name or phone number attached to them

the difference is that the    out file  i provided had a   vcf  suffix  i have to provide some suffix here  because otherwise exomiser deletes whatever is after the last period and replaces it with   vcf   e g     out file my output prefix  results in  my output vcf   if i provide    out file path to out vcf file vcf   it tries to generate  path to out genes tsv file genes tsv     one potential solution that might clarify things would be to change    out file  to    out prefix  and not have any suffix parsing overwriting  in the meantime  i need to switch to specifying    out file out file dummysuffix

hi florian   i agree that there should be a default value  but i have no idea what that parameter does or want  i am the wrong person to ask  but if you ask me  just by looking at the description  i would expect one 1  
it's pretty hard to replicate  i've only had it happen once since posting the crash report and i have no idea what triggers it but i think it has to do with setting insane speeds on it and spamming the control block     from what players have told me  the issue happened once while placing a second caller next to an existing caller  the other time  the issue happened from setting very fast speed on the elevator and spamming the caller block  interesting enough  one of the two caller blocks disappeared entirely and then as soon as the one next to it was clicked  the crash occurred   if i can find a good way to replicate this i'll letcha know 
 benoitf i will try to reproduce it locally and will provide more info   for now all i know is that  dkuleshov showed me that cli failed and when i asked him to pull   eclipse che cli nightly  it pulled newer image  i checked he didn't use any skips or   fast it was only start command

i built new images tonight from current develop branch and i still have this issue  i verified that i have elasticsearch 2 3 4 jar in lib extra  i am building and using docker images in openshift  but i wouldn't think this should be any different from the regular docker images  let me know if there is something else i can try to help troubleshoot this 
done   
it is my fault  no this lib issue  have to take care which kind of context you used  check the codes at the permission have granted  if any error happens  error listener will catch it and present 
in a normal situation  yes  however this is a fix that modifies a user's action  e g  the user might have created the  nomedia file on purpose   i'll see how long 3 0 2 will last and  if needed  i'll delay this to 3 0 4 or 3 1  whichever comes first

i've tried all caps  "wool"  and when i enable debug and reload this is the debug output     as you can see  it reads null for place and break events  it seems like it blocks all colours of wool 
action can be performed on testcase page  a user that is not testadmin can change the test case from working to anything else  fully_implemented  for example  and save the test case  after that  he can change the test case behaviour without anyone being "alerted"  however  the user cannot move the test case to working if he is not testadmin

1  i have seen this with two alerts  and their alert conditions were    "alert is triggered when there is more than one message in the last 6 minutes  grace period  60 minutes  not including any messages in alert notification  configured to repeat notifications "  this alert should have fired off after restarting it  but never did      "alert is triggered when there is less than one message in the last 10 minutes  grace period  60 minutes  not including any messages in alert notification  configured to repeat notifications "  for this alert i made it more sensitive by changing the threshold to "less than 1111 messages"  then it should have fired off straight away  it did not fire off until half an hour later   2  i haven't found a reliable way to make the alert condition work again  my current workaround is to create an entire new stream  alert  and notification from scratch with the exact same configuration as the old one   and those new ones work   3  i am not sure  the "unresolved alerts" list doesn't make sense to me   i can see a couple of alert in there listed as "still ongoing" when i know the corresponding stream does not have any messages anymore  may be a problem unto itself

the container itself supports the array  but the configurate serializers do not accept array types by default  the issue is that i registered serializers necessary for arrays  but they are not being used from within  org spongepowered common config dataserializabletypeserializer

the quick fix will result in an implicit  nullpointerexception  if one blindly calls the  get    methods of  reactivequeryresult without doing a  hasresults    check  so if the get methods of  unifiedqueryexecutor  has something similar  i e  to determine if results are present or not   perhaps throwing  implicitly or explicitly   nullpointerexception  in the interim is ok  but from an api design point  imho it is much clearer to explicitly throw an  unchecked exception  such as  nosuchelementexception     nodatafoundexception  as  nullpointerexception  wouldn't convey the intention

you are correct that  4 6 2  and  4 7 3  don't exist for  spotless ext eclipse jdt    but  goomph  knows about them  so we should be able to make a lockfile for them   if you don't have time to provide the lockfiles  can you point me to instructions for how to make them

sure   1  go on https   regex101 com  2  type in the regexp part    w+  word matching  3  the text part   "Éabc" 3  you can change the modifier on the right on the regexp part to get u for unicode   you will see as a word Éabc with the modifier  and abc without the modifier  the same thing happens inside openrefine with utf8 16 file  it is not a bug but an interpretation of the regexp  in fact  the problem is far more complex than this simple example  if you want a complete explanation on unicode regexp  please this document is exceptionnal   https   www regular expressions info unicode html  i invite you to read on the dot operator to understand why it could be useful to have a u modifier    i find a way to get good results with the  p   tag  but sometimes it would be far more simple to do it with the modifier  by the way  a very interesting problem for my own experience    thank you for your interest

a user of this library might rely on  configuration isnamespacecleanupenabled    in order to cleanup their own stuff   we were using our own flag to control this behavior  but we dropped it in favor of using arq cube one  it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel for such behavior   so  we create our stuff and  in the end  we check for that flag to decide whether or not to cleanup the stuff we created   the problem is that by default  that flag is set to  false  on arq cube  given  destroynamespace  is true by default   which is semantically wrong  since its meaning is  "should we cleanup stuff after the tests run "   the fact the the whole namespace is going to be destroyed at the end of the suite should not affect the fact we should cleanup the stuff we created   example of workflow  1  test1 runs and creates  say  a buildconfig named "build" 1  test1 finishes  but we don't delete the buildconfig above because  configuration isnamespacecleanupenabled    returned false 1  test2 starts but fails because it also creates a buildconfig named "build"   duplicated resource  1  test suite ends  namespace is cleaned up   note the broken behavior on step 3 above  with my patch this is fixed  because it makes configuration less subjective

it would be more like the flap indicator or the pull brake than an instrument 
i don't think the issue is with the priority between powers  the issue is that time eddy+ runs the power's atendofturn callback twice without the action queue getting cleared in between  normally the actions queued as part of the powers callback would remove that power before the next turns end happens

 ronblum i'm seeing the same thing you are  previously run   not cleared chunks can be queued  while not previously run chunks   run but cleared can't be queued 
we have a  resttemplate  correctly configured for the app and want to use the other benefits of  testresttemplate  in tests   i expect mutation methods  such as  addauthentication   to change it  but not a constructor   if  resttemplate  was immutable  the constructor couldn't alter it   with accepting only  resttemplatebuilder  instances  will it set objects on the builder only when null or the default  or always   we need ability to specify something and not have it replaced  an unexpected replacement consumes time determining why something isn't working    since  resttemplate  is mutable  a current workaround is to set it again afterwards

the only non dl modification is to change the forge version to   the latest   1 12 2 14 23 5 2838  it was on 2836  and another mod was complaining    upon further experimentation  the number of missed ticks is definitely dramatically reduced in this version   it's a little annoying  but manageable  averaging about a second's worth of ticks per minute  it's mostly the 'conflicting with a previous registration' spam that's  a bit alarming   the issue is reproducible to the extent that restarting the server does not fix it  i'm not quite sure where to go beyond that  will try moving power inputs around and replacing them 
i don't recall it ever working   otoh  the post i linked to above stated that it worked in 2 5 m2  frankly  i don't see anything materially different between m2 and m4  other than the charset change you already mentioned   from what i saw  even the  javax mail  and  org apache commons mail  lib versions didn't change   as it works with the oh1 binding  there must be something different

this is exactly what my issue is  i am indeed overriding the  applicationcontext  itself because it only works as a facade when  genericapplicationcontext resourceloader  is  null   otherwise it uses the resource loading capabilities of its superclass  since  genericapplicationcontext  derives from  defaultresourceloader   therefore  when custom protocol resolvers are registered with the  applicationcontext  itself  actually  the  defaultresourceloader  it extends  they fail to be consulted once devtools injects the custom  resourceloader   therefore  i chose to reimplement  applicationcontext getresource  to easily showcase the fact that this method is never called   you are correct in your suggestion to change the testcase the way you did  as you then implement the workaround i illustrated  what my tests show is that if  genericapplicationcontext resourceloader  is not set  then the  applicationcontext 's implementation is not used  therefore its behaviour is lost   the main problem here is that  applicationcontext  in some cases is not just a facade  but an actual implementor of  resourceloader   if you ask me  a better solution would be to remove  defaultresourceloader  from the inheritance chain of  genericapplicationcontext  and always delegate to an instance property  this would however be a breaking change and i understand that this cannot be changed at the moment  neither is it in spring boot  but in spring context    is the problem more clear now  do you need anything else from me to help

i use non aoe attacks when this happens  but it seem your right about the calling for help thing  wich i know existed but felt weird in the last version  but it's mostly due to 1  there are no way to tell if the other pokemon are targeting me like a "a wild     appeared" text  it feel like the other one attack me with no reason  and 2  my active pokemobs target another pokemob than the one i was fighting  so if i attack magikarp a  and magikarp b come to help  my pokemob will sometimes target b instead of a  and it's even worse when there are more magikarp  so maybe the problem comes from the fact that there need a way to know if other pokemob are targeting me + my pokemobs need to attack the one i am targeting  it would be even better if i can target another pokemob while in battle with another one  like attacking magikarp a then using a move on b then going back to a for example  i think it worked at some point but dont anymore

this session header is set only inside this interceptor per request  i also set some extra headers like language  date  api version  user agent  however response also can contain this header with same name  that's why i extract it from each response to get new value  and i have 2nd interceptor to do another job related to response   i think its related to http 2 0  when we test on staging server with http 2 disabled this issue disappears

removing tostring might work  it could just potentially break some backward compatibility  e g  transform map files which map "undefined" to something else    and it does not solve a deeper problem  if you post undef on a stringitem  it will not reconstruct an undeftype  but a stringtype instead  so i wonder if we might have to introduce some reserved keyword and put the undeftype at the top of the accepteddatatypes in stringitem

nevermind  the leak is actually on the tile pool threads only  the image fetcher is an awt thread  started for asynchronous fetching of images  that i noticed  in visualvm  got instantiated every time a tile factory was set  but as of latest java 7 it stops properly  i remember that it lingered there in the past  on an old jvm 6 version   the tile pool leak bug has been here written on a sticky note on my desk for a long time  and it's been a while since i last checked it against the most recent oracle jvm  with your fix we should be all set    thanks
yes  i have no trouble connecting to his backend  and after this failure  i can go to another screen and get other downloads   just to be clean  re reading my original comment   when i said "after a few hours are collected" i was referring to hours of guide data  not that i had to wait hours for it to start syncing again   i've also used my browser and done things like myth gethostname as fast as i can press ctrl r e g  refresh and had no failures   i suspect this is a result of tcp rsts that i've discussed in the past  but without being able to capture protocol  i can't prove it   i would suggest that the test for backend availability might be enhanced to make more than one check  if all is well  there would be no impact on data transfer  if gethostname failed  maybe it could be retried  or  could calls to that function be passed with an argument s  for how long to try  and or how many attempts to make  just tossing out ideas

there are two issues  1  when a project admin  who are not system administrators  is redirected to the system administration page when they aren't authorized to be at that page  it is a potential security issue  2  if the plugin only supports system administration configuration and repository level configuration  why is there a link at the project level

great  thank you for such a quick reaction  version 2 8 9 build 2326 seems to work fine  i once got some exception but am currently unable to reproduce it  it will probably come up again when i pass this version to the team  hopefully i will be able to provide some valuable debug then   i had to symlink the plugin directory   ln  s plugins 2 8 9 plugins 2 8 8    without it i received an error indicating the ganttproject  gp  was unable to find resources   i tested various scenarios    externally lock with user_1  token_a  gp unlock with user_1   success  ok     externally lock with user_2  token_a  gp unlock with user_1   denied by 403 from the server after gp's attempt to unlock  ok     gp lock  save project   success  ok     gp lock  gp unlock   success  ok    saving with acquired lock works  i can see the "if" header in the packet dump   padlock is visible whenever there is a lock on file  my login next to the padlock is visible only if gp acquired the lock during the current session  stale lock  after killing  9 the gp  is not recognized by gp as its own lock  no login next to the green padlock  and it seems perfectly logical  just noting it  
for the most basic example  i create the drawer  when it slides out all content is clickable but when clicked will click the content area and close the drawer    drawergrarment mdrawergarment   new drawergarment this  r layout slidingdrawer_contents   
e g  openshift explorer view assert  have connection in openshift explorer exec  open context menu of the given connection  assert  there is menu item with submenu called "new" exec  click some menu item  e g  manage ssh keys     exec  open context menu again assert  there is not any menu item new  which was in the context menu before looking up in context menu for the previous menu item  that manage ssh keys       it probably seems to be eclipse problem bcs  of comment in swtbot source code  "in e4  if the context menu contains submenus it appears as disposed after detection  so we use the contextmenuhelper" but their solution seems to be ineffective 
 jhoeller i already  reverted the workaround on master yesterday  https   github com spring projects spring integration commit fc827e1f929e3a5a77738e42f246c9c298f8a78b  and all is fine  thanks   i am building our 5 1 x against 5 1 9 snapshots and don't see any problems there either  although we only had the problem on master  when we went to a shared handler factory across multiple components

hi   i do not see weird htaccess access  i use lighttpd 1 4 35 web server  all configuration is fine an ok double checked everything  did not make any changes since several months 
hello  thanks for your reply   according to the answers i see on this  stackoverflow  http   stackoverflow com questions 23149417 proguard project txt not found in android studio  question  it seems that because i imported this old eclipse project into android studio  proguard rules txt did not actually exist in my project directory  instead i now replaced it with a default made proguard rules pro file   i also made an example app doing the same steps over again  with the default generated proguard rules pro   and fortunately i got it to work this time  seems like the issue is resolved

 herau actually  it seems not   stephanegigandet just managed to reproduce on his phone  and he never installed this application in dev mode  he had an old version from the playstore  which was crashing when loading a product   then he upgraded to the newest version from the playstore and the issue was still  reproducing  then  he cleaned the application cache and application data  as i described above   relaunched the application and everything worked fine

no  i did not    it seems to be blowing up while building ddr    fyi  fjeremic could you have someone on the jit team triage this   i can provide core dumps etc 
if excluded  all worked fine  it’s problem in asm  because this library has restriction  utf8 length like 65535
hi claus    the behavior seems to be  1  when a queue is selected from the tree it populates the list of messages 2  if you click the link to open a message before 5 seconds after you select the queue  you can see the headers  3  if you click the link to open a message after 5 seconds from selecting the queue  it will still show the message body but not the headers and properties  and you also can't do a move    that's even if you have opened the message before  i e  if you close the message dialog and reopen that message whether the data is pruned that allows seeing the headers depends on the 5 seconds since selecting the queue  3  if you keep the dialog open for a message and it shows the headers  they don't go away  it doesn't refresh   hope that explains it 
yes  i get the crash every time i run it on mac either through eclipse or console  however  it runs fine on linux vm or emr    the crash happens within 2 3 minutes
sir i have a question also about how can i convert audio file to text in android i can find any sample in the sdk only microphone sir need help
possibly  and furthermore  i've also confirmed that animation smoothing also breaks on wyrms  makes them jittery  like above 
i played around with  grantpermissionrules  https   developer android com reference android support test rule grantpermissionrule  and i was able to get some of the tests running  hopefully  that's a big hint for a new contributor to take this on 
no  i didn't  this was as bare bones a project as i could make  a single placeholder   restcontroller    using the copypasta tomcat exclude undertow include  but i couldn't get it to work  finally gave up and went back to tomcat 
sure  if necessary i'll hack the ant build to skip the unit tests  i probably won't have time to work on this until wednesday 
following a helpful chat with  dsyer i now have a much better understand of the intent here   inmemorymetricrepository  is  largely  an internal of the actuator's metrics support  application code should deal with  gaugeservice  and  counterservice   both of which are present with both java 7 and java 8  the javadoc needs to be updated on  metricrepositoryautoconfiguration  to reflect this 
hi  laa   the logs just printed the stack trace that i have copied above and the db content is too large to be shared 
hello     i didn't solve the issue  but figured out the problem was also occuring with the java examples  i tried on another pc  and looks like the combo  latest java version + latest intellij version with quarkus 1 1 1 final leads to tests failing in intellij  but not in maven    since it's apparently not related to kotlin  i thought i'd close the issue to avoid misleading report 
yes it does  i just tested it with a new server  _minecraft  1 8 9 spongeapi  4 2 0 snapshot 79f9c8e spongevanilla  1 8 9 4 2 0 beta 348_  should i close it here then and create a new issue it in the common repo 
i would think making the default level to only log warn and above be more appropriate  that may need us to add logback configuration for the ui code   https   www baeldung com logback open to see what others think          mandy chessell
mouse5 and mouse4
i'll try soon  for now i killed minecraft after 45 min waiting for only buildcraft lib 
sure  here it is  http   prntscr com engi7o
here you go   chaos legion30170101 zip  https   github com megamek mekhq files 2270513 chaos legion30170101 zip   just checked again  fwiw   this happens in all my saves  i´ve attached one that doesn´t need a heap of customs in order to load  here´s the log for the attempt with this save    mekhqlog txt  https   github com megamek mekhq files 2270524 mekhqlog txt   also   this bug has appeared both in fresh 0 45 0 campaigns and those carried from 0 44 0 or earlier 
the folder was missing but it seems to be working fine after manually adding it   thanks  and sorry for the late reply    
hmm  i tried it again and it seems to work  i have no clue what was going on   sorry to bother you
is it maybe possible to do something for that case 
thank you very very much for your efforts   the second version worked  only thing that was weird was that the migration upgrade process took less then a minute and i read that it takes 10 to 30 minutes  but after a short view my permissions seem to be correct   perhaps you are interested in that i didn't have a  data data biz bokhorst xprivacy xprivacy db   file   again thank you and best regards to south holland

mirakel is 2 1 2 from the play store   i did a duplicated setup under centos 6 4 and recompiled taskd taskwarrior from scratch   behavior stays the same  taskwarrior works mirakle doesn't   i'll get back to you with a logcat   thanks so far 
doesn't look like it  but i can't be sure  the reason this fails  is because of the change of the scope of the closure  which binds it to the prophecy object instead of the test object  causing "static" to be pointed at something else  this is behavior you cannot predict and you can't resolve easily as it can go through many layers of abstraction   personally i would simply turn this particular check off if it's in a closure that's not directly used within the same scope

will do  closing for now until i have the time to try this out

single player   there isn't a crash so i'm not sure what part of the logs you want to see  i don't see any mention of mana batteries or prisms or the power cache you mentioned in #741 in there  what are we looking for   there is a am2powerdata folder  it has sub folders for dimension 0   1  7  and  31   1 and 7 are empty  0 has files for chunks near the origin  though these are all empty  the one for dimension  31 has a single file corresponding with the region where my base is  though my base is in dimension 0   the one in dimension  31 is 36kb in size  and seems to have references to many  many nodes in it  though there are only a few anywhere in my world  and i don't really know how to parse the file here  
my backend  maybe frontend too  might have been with mode http

proposal      code style   we can use default style of android studio with following tweaks     maximum consecutive blank lines  1   blank lines before closing brace ' '  0   note   default android studio style uses spaces for indentation instead of tabs  let me know if you prefer tabs     license     for files which don't have   any   license copyright header  add gplv3 header with your name    for files which   only   have your name  add gplv3 header too    we can also add gplv3 header to xml files if thats okay with you   remaining files are attributed to michael a  macdonald  i believe these are under gplv2 license but i could not find a definitive answer  if these files are licensed under gplv2  we can add gplv2 or gplv3  whichever you prefer  header     refactoring   i am refactoring  vncconn  to remove dependency on  vnccanvas   it will allow us to keep  vncconn  alive across activity restarts so that we can enable rotation of  vnccanvasactivity    thanks 
workaround is user has to change the content of  components api mediation bin start sh   i don't know what triggers this  apparently  this problem was not spotted on marist and in rocket environment  we ran into this on broadocm system and when i was building docker images for 1 6 0

 payara micro remote cdi event demo zip  https   github com payara payara files 2419095 payara micro remote cdi event demo zip   hi  yes i have tried with string events  in the example i posted it is a simple serializable object as there is another method in the application which  observes a string   i have attached a sample application  it is simply a case of starting 2 instances of payara micro using mvn exec exec  note that in the pom xml  the version of payara is 5 1 81  which works fine  change this to 5 182 or 5 183 to see the issue

yes it recovers without any problem   i was asking if the plugin is open source to see if i could provide a pr  but i can't    
agreed   i can't explain why it pains me so  but looking at my statistics and seeing how little i've scrobbled this year hurts my heart a little   wow  sounds awesome  yes  i scrobble to both last fm and libre fm   i don't really reference my libre fm stuff as often since there is less historical data due to me starting to use it much later   i just like the idea of not having my data owned by last fm in case they ever become jerks  or get bought out by jerks  and prevent me from accessing it   thanks for the quick response and hard work   
i haven't tried any other versions nor operating systems  i'll try the previous versions of the sdk  though i'm unable to test on windows or linux  if someone is able to try either os  i'll push this code to  my fork of the repo  https   github com kkirigaya java discordrpc  for someone to test on

i can confirm that interpolated value is  null  now  as opposed to  "null"  string   however  required   true  is still not respected  in other words  i expect  missingparameterexception  if the option value was not provided  i don't expect  null    and to reiterate  i don't specifically want to use  defaultvalue  attribute  i am looking for a way to define an option that will check explicit command line arg     mypath       first  then check environment variable    mypath    then fail with clear error message if neither is available  and obviously use     mypath      or   mypath  value if available   do you consider this a reasonable usecase or this isn't something picocli is meant to do 
files are fully accessible from both stock and nonstock  fx  file managers   renaming  deleting and other modifications work   and yes  there are files present in regular media library and adding them to the playlist works normally   i am able to play them

i opened the quarry  as it now as a gui in 8 0   and wondered if the new items are a filter  i couldn't put anything in  and tried shift clicking  when it crashed 
i have three hard drive  c  d and e   and i have some tests  here is the results     when zap bat located at drive c   homepath  can find  zap_jvm properties   when zap bat located at another drive except drive c like drive d   homepath  can't find  zap_jvm properties    i think maybe windows can automatically add current drive when use  homepath   so when we use start zap in drive c  everything is fine  when we start in another drive   homepath  is not we want

because i can't replicate the issue without applecore installed  hunger overhaul and spice of life are not installed 
i've had a further look  but still none the wiser what the framework code is doing that we aren't  for now  since i'm not using this code in production   i'm just going to put the  domain getcomputerdomain    line in the appropriate place  the sspi api documentation from microsoft is dismal 
not a problem  i am running version 3 1 3 
i have sent one to you encrypted with you public key deadfa11
i used 200000000 and it still fails 
would it be possible to have a check in place in hostport that checks if there is more than one      and  and no       that or verify that it is actually a proper ipv6 address rather than reporting back an invalid address

absolutely 
if it is a conflict  i have no way of knowing  because it works on all my server's members that have windows linux operating systems  just not the mac users  it would have to be done at a later date  and they're not too happy  because i already spent time uninstalling and reinstalling stuff and such  is there a mod conflict checker or something  or better yet  a way to make mac run java better   lol clairfy core mods  if that will lower the work load 
hi philip  no proxy in my case  we send despatch_advicess or invoices and we receive orders  yes  the use of httpclient could help  starting from your code  i would like to create a simple as2 client  prototype   with only this functionality  i will share if you want   fiorenzo
i added another point so the path didn't run through the rocket with the same results  the right path was longer than the left and the heading was increasing positive  i tried another path with a clockwise turn where right should have been more than left and it isn't  the heading went negative when i would have expected plus  i know from last year that we had to negate the navx yaw reading because a clockwise turn with it was a positive value while pathfinder standard was clockwise negative  we were running vanaka's motion profile generator last year but switched to path weaver this year  we couldn't get the simplest turns to run until we switched back to motion profile generator    on mon  jan 21  2019 at 1 54 pm sam carlberg  notifications github com  wrote 
thanks for suggestion on   debug   that showed we were pointing at two locations and one of these locations included some unwanted migration files   short term fix was to rm those files in build script and once we did that the "ignored" issue went away   longer term fix is to add a gradle property to pass in the   locations   not to worry about the u22__allow_null_ordroutinginfo sql as "missing" that file still needs to be added to our build artifacts   it's safe to close this ticket

strange  now it also worked  i can’t remember how it occured anymore 
sure  i'll test it later today and provide an update on the results   thanks   steve

yes  slemeur  i am interested to work on this feature   sleshchenko please do let me know how can i contribute 
it's the other way around  i have over 4 000 documents that match that query  so i set scroll_size to 4000 so i could update them all in one request  but only 1 000 get updated at a time  i have to run the  _update_by_query  four times to get all documents updated  which is not what i expected 
latest  2 1 1  as well as  2 1 0  ga  
that's the question that needs answering  would the url resource contain full path data so we could check that the regex  "  file   +   jar   "  doesn't match the result     except that wouldn't then work when running a spring fat jar
the latest version 7 1  also sorry it don't know what you mean by pastebin of the log file  i'm terrible at computer stuff  ill post the crash report if thats what you meant if not please tell me where to find what you mean sorry and thanks 
yes  we could fix this so that if you had the environment variable set  or the download service enabled  it could pick those up  we'd still need to make the change to go down the cram path though  however  in the  common    case where neither of those is true  the downstream failures may not be obvious  so maybe we should have this check for a  cram extension  and throw only if neither of default reference or download are set   on mon  nov 16  2015 at 2 07 pm  tim fennell notifications github com wrote 
correct  if it is less than 8 chars then account validation function gets confused  as long as it is equal to 8 chars it is fine  it does not even needs to be posix compliant   though having it as posix compliant would help in case of integrating it with an ldap server or federated authentication in future   
cheers  i appreciate it  this has really given me some headaches over the last two weeks   could it be that it has something to do with my ubuntu vms not having enough resources to keep all threads and ssh connections alive  i find it quite weird that i never observed this issue on my  way more powerful  windows machines

i've bookmarked two videos that i know it happened on for sure  so i can keep testing   it just happened to me again on one of them  this time  it was after unlocking the phone and pressing play  audio went out of sync  but then i tried it again and it didn't happen  so i can't reproduce it reliably yet 
i am using choco 4 0 4   something important related to nogoodprops changed during the two minor versions 
i am not blaming spigot because all the other plugins managed to find a way to cancel event without it leaking somehow  i think this can be fixed in skript by trying a different method or changing the code  as for the items breaking  it is really easy to reproduce but just not clear exactly what causes it  if you cancel event of 2 items and then put 1 in your offhand  spam click both  then they will stop working properly and ignore the trigger  it will cancel event on these items for other irrelevant clicks  i think that's the easiest way to reproduce the second bug  all though i've done it without using offhand and sometimes doing nothing at all

yes  sir
i hope so  tried to find some example with same kind of functionality  but all offered just moving to another page   that could be also included in test directory  and just load the page from file when running integration test phase

this happens when microprofile rest client is used inside a jax rs endpoint     or you can check out https   github com quarkusio quarkus quickstarts pull 151 and run in native mode
unfortunately i don't have much time right now  but i think the case is very simple to reproduce

 tobiaskaminsky the pre existing auto upload folders can be changed from instant upload to something else  but the auto upload folder connections themselves can not themselves be deleted  and when i reinstall they revert back to be set to instant upload  i believe this last part is correct  i need to reinstall to double check but i'm currently traveling so haven't had time to check  i can soon though  perhaps tonight     also there are some folders that it it trying to sync such as "reddit_sync"  which is from a reddit client app called reddit sync which i have uninstalled and deleted all trace of on my phone   as no new images are ever going to be placed inside the reddit sync folder again  because the app has been uninstalled and won't be reinstalled   nextcloud android client will never recreate the reddit_sync folder  as it did with the screenshots folder in instant upload after i took some screenshots  but it's still junking up my list of autoupload folder connections

discussed in fixitfriday   we've decided that we want to keep the  lte  adjustment and to fix it to follow the following rules      lte  adjustment only happens if rounding appears in the date math expression  eg  now d  or  2017 01 01 14 53 12   h    rounding is implemented as a floor operation on the date  using the specified unit   then  any other calculations are applied  eg  +2h +10m    etc   the smallest unit mentioned in the date math expression should be used for the  lte  adjustment    for example       lte  now d  rounds down to midnight  then adds 24 hours minus 1ms       lte  now d+2h  rounds down to midnight  adds two hours  then adds 1 hour minus 1 ms      lte  now h + 1d  rounds down to the nearest hour  adds 24 hours  then adds 1 hour minus 1ms  this probably requires a significant rewrite of our date math parser 
these are not modes  the usual blocks from version 1 11 2  but why are they not    
i tried the to reproduce the screenshots above but it worked correct   i clicked on the tag "system thinking" in the column for jan  got to the next page and went back by using the back button of the browser  same with clicking on one the tag "france" and going back for the service   but there was again the homepage text in the wrong place  see below     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 18674205 15814010 beee1174 2bc3 11e6 98c4 1999740be226 png  using the back button to reconstruct this  the homepage text appeared in the right column  like this    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 18674205 15814028 dc7d25ae 2bc3 11e6 8d31 7db015c5a3fb png  then i tried to reproduce this  but all worked correct  strange

 psxlover  i can't make other types of facades because when i place a cobble structure pipe on the assembly table i can only make extrabiomesxl block facades  and as you can see in the image  i don't even placed a block in it  so it's definetly a bug   
the app didn't crash but i see this in the logcat  no modifications  1 job   here's the code  https   github com shadowsocks shadowsocks android blob master src main scala com github shadowsocks job aclsyncjob scala  you might want to tweak it to make it return reschedule so that you can try it out 
that is a temporary solution and considered a bad practice  the solution to this problem lies in the concept of handling lifecycle callbacks and is an important concept for all android developers to learn about  solving this issue will help them learn about it and implement it in a project as well  i would not encourage locking the screen orientation   
yes we do same please make sure to add action   _without image  _  also we are testing on 1 2 mybe ur dev build of 1 3 already fixed this 
https   pastebin com h94gf0ud    ps  i used first " afk even drank halen " and right after that also " afk" whitout any text behind it       and not sure when you mean with     ess version and paste its full output    it will just say that the plugin as reloaded and have version   2 0 1 b601
i misunderstood that as well  changing as you suggest would be perfect  a clear way to say you are just interested in the current context 
right  i have no one counter entries    after adding counters the error has disappeared  i think we need zero check and do warnings when trying to get read write information
