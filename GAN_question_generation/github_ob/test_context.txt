one of the main issue i have with this tool is that it never kills its own process when exiting or restarting it restarting it via the gui is almost useless because it never restarts properly and at times i have to just restart my tablet which is an inconvenience not a life threatening issue for surebut it would be nice if restarting is done properlybut then it is not a solution because recurrent restarts of this app ends up in crash at start with some message" syncthing binary crashed the syncthing binary has exited with error code 2 if this error persists  try reinstalling the app and restarting your devicit seems like when a health st restart is needed  the best way is to restart the tablet i hope that the dev could address this issue so that we could test out versions with a nicer setup

basically  it seems that when running in r studio  the gui itself adds a reference count on the variable created you can see the following code  when the new matrix created  it should have reference count 1 throughout this is indeed the case when you run code in a block also  as you can see  the function refs itself does not add reference count however  after the block is finished  rerun refs   function will return 2  see highlighted line in the graph below     note  i notice the problem existence because the ram usage was showing duplication when an entry of matrix x is changing function refs   was an after thought and does not cause the problem

when hosting a game with another client  the event gets replicated to the remote client and also triggeres the hosting player  opening up the renaming dialog on the host  each time a player connects switching the event filter on the client to  remote_client  does not work because this will remove the renaming feature from the hosting player a simple fix would be to skip the local event if the event has been network replicated and was an   ownerevent  but before submitting a pr some feedback for this behavior would be nicethere is also a similar problem when a client sends an   serverevent   the event will trigger on the client too however this is less likely to cause an issue as the serverside event handlers are registered as authority most of the time simple check to reproduce test the issue  checkout the module  host the game with one player

i have encountered this issue several times and it took a long time to finally find where the code was going wrong the issue arises when the effect exit integer sections is used inside of a nested loop when the loop comes around to get executed again it will start from where it was exited rather than from the beginning and will completely ignore its new parameters  if they have changed  if the first player it looped simply had an inventory full of stone it would continue looping that first players inventory and find stone each time and message that stone was found in every players inventory the only way around this glitch is to allow the loop to complete which requires setting up a way to ignore all iterations after you want to exit or find away to escape sections without using the exit effect

my smp world has been progressing a bit  we have several active players and currently i restart the server twice daily to keep the memory leaks to a minimum if three hours pass from the time the server restarts to the time someone logs in  the server will stall upon the next login to the point where i must control+c to get any response and he told me that the mod listed under server thread is usually the mod that has gotten hung up what is unusual is that at my base  i have completely gotten rid of eio conduits and yet still  as soon as i connect after the three hour window from a restart  the server will stall

for some reason  the rcl refuses to enter a tank more than 300mb at a time the smelter uses up 2 ores  then stops  leaving 200 mb in the tank above  then just stops but i have to deal with tiny increments of about 200 mb in a series of tanks separated by fluid conduits from enderio the only way i managed to get 300mb inside is using the creative fluid injector and even that stops at 300 painstakingly getting it all the way through to the end of the process at the crystalizer is possible  but wasting resources at the laser section and very time consuming interestingly  when multiblocked with three tanks and filled up  then broken  each tank section keeps 100mb  then refuses to be filled any further after that amount this leads me to believe that the rcl is refusing to mix with itself

exoplayer has higher latency when starting multicast udp videos compared to mediaplayerwhen you change the video streams on exoplayer  because  it keeps static frames for both previous video and new video  so first it freeze the last video frame  keeps it for 1 2 seconds  then shows the first frame of the new video and keeps it for another 1 2 second until it finally starts the video for the same setup   same box  same streams  same network  same apk  just changing to mediaplayer it has a shorter time  because it only keeps the last frame of previous video and starts immediately with the next video  sot it does not show the first frame and then load buffer  it starts immediately  most probably the android mediaplayer does the buffering during the first stage when it keeps the last frame from previous video when using exoplayer channel changes happen with two freezed frames  last and first video frames  which is not very good experience you can only observe this with multicast videos  when doing hls the start times are so fast that you can see that but you can still see the first frame as static it would be better to do this loading in the first step while it keeps the last frame video and then start immediately with the second next video

my hue bulbs show an endpoint 242   it's always been there  and it's a little frustrating in that every time the stack starts it gives this endpoint a different device type   i want to stop this this is just plane bad news   in the case of the hue  where the device isn't known anyway  it doesn't matter  however it means even if the device is known  if it somehow happens to come up with the same score when the factory is evaluating a match  then next time it might evaluate to a different device if it matches two devices with the same score the other issue is that returning any device type when the score is 0 is wrong   it hasn't matched any clusters  so we can't really say that this is the device  well  not one that we know   so  to resolve this i propose to return null from getbestdeviceproxyfactory which stops the device being constructed

possible nullpointerexception when assigning generated keys to objects with custom hashcode## steps to reproduce  while we request insertbatch  mybatis will throw a 'java lang nullpointerexception' exception because in src main java org apache ibatis executor keygen jdbc3keygenerator java line 174   it uses parammap values   stream   distinct   count      1 to adjust whether the count of params is 1  but the method distinct   of stream in jdk8 uses hashcode of object to do distinct  when the object overrides hashcode method with the hashcode of id  and the insert operation doesn't have any content in field id  the exception then occrupt but in mybatis before version 3 4 6 i have ensured   this never happened  because jdbc3keygenerator in mybatis 3 4 6 didn't use distinct   method  to adjust the count of param anyway  in most cases  we will use  this logic to insert batch datas  hope you can fix this bug in the future

when the dependencies of a dynamic value did not change for a while  it stops updating regularily the heat display was updating as soon as the heat nbt changed  but the result of this comparison was stuck  this cost me my aetherium forge by overheating it explosively  disappointed   #### steps to reproduce the problem     observe the dynamic double value being shown in real time  but the comparison value being stuck to fix the issue  manually extract and replace the comparison value card just before its result will change   since in my scenario this resulted in the heat oscillating around the target heat value  the comparison result was constantly changeing and therefore 'keeping awake' the display when my forge blew up  i had the network set up without any battery attachedit worked fine   though i think i remember noticing the bug once shortly after adding the battery

take action to stop the temporary directory being deleted due to lack of use   since #27609  that deletes files and directories that have not been touched for 10 days   if you read the man page you might think this _doesn't_ delete old files  as the man page says as a result  if someone does not start an ml job on a particular node that is running on rhel or centos 7 then 10 days after es startupif an ml job is run on the node after this then it fails because the temporary directory does not exist due to security manager the es jvm cannot recreate the temporary directory if we created and removed a file every 22 hours then this would keep the directory modification time within the last day  even for days when daylight saving time starting reduces the day length to 23 hours however  this problem could also affect 3rd party  so it would be nicer if the functionality to keep the temporary directory alive was in core elasticsearch the ml team can implement it if we can get some advice on the best place in the code to put it

intellij allows me to specify a dot path to a particular folder in my app structure  while  projectname  restricts to only the base package name the issue i'm having  if you haven't guessed already  is the java debugger appears to be searching for classes and settings from  application yml  via the path  app  which includes classes and settings found in the  test  folder i'm forced to set  projectname  only to  app  which breaks my application in some respects because it applies unwanted settings automatically from the  test  folder also note that i am generally a beginner with respect to some terminology within the java world  so if some explanations seem off that's why i'm very keen to solve this issue

unable to create new native thread" using many nodes per host   while running benchmarks on ec2 it was noticed that having too many proactive nodes running tasks may cause  java lang it is important to notice that the exact same configuration as before using a sleep timeout of _25_ seconds for java tasks prevents the issue to occur the previous observation let me think the issue could be related with _pings_ which are performed periodically  each 20 seconds  although the single jvm feature spawns only one jvm for multiple pa nodes  then one ping is done for each pa node running on the host  more exactly each _one possibility is to increase the ping period to see if the issue comes from that if it is the case  a solution or even general improvement could be to see if the scheduler behaviour could be changed in order to send a single ping request to an host even if it contains several proactive nodes 
 describe the bugsometimes when i do  av reload the votepoint data doesnt load and everyone is on 0 points the issue fixes itself  however if someone gets any votepoints while their data isnt loaded in and then their data gets loaded in they dont have their points restored and are stuck at the new value they received if its now 0 but wasnt before it has happened

jackson databind exception when creating repository sending snapshot to s3
however  while trying to use your library i found it quite hard to figure out how i could access the header and get it to be set correctly in the  recordmetadata  i finally figured out that i should call  parsedheaders    on the  parsingcontext  to trigger reading of the header  but this method is not mentioned in the tutorial at all  however  because  iterate    and  iteraterecords     like  beginparsing     take the input reader as an argument  this makes it seem impossible to both get the headers and use the iterators  at least my tests to call  iter getcontext   parsedheaders    did not succeed    i suppose getting the iterator does not imply  beginparsing     but  iterateresult  also does not expose a  beginparsing  this means i reverted to a simple while loop calling  parser parsenextrecord     but this ends up being verbose because my parsing loop has a few cases of  continue   meaning i have to repeat the  parser parsenextrecord  maybe i'm missing something  but it seems like this situation could be improved

unclosed mysql connections when not using connectiontestqueryhowever  when we run one of our tests   which creates and shutdowns 1 002 different instances of the hikari pool in sequence   with such setup  we observe a growing number of unclosed connections  orange     however  if we run exactly the same test setting having set the  connectiontestquery  property like        this doesn't happen at all  and everything looks fine    the profiler shows to us that our test actually uses and _closes_ the same amount of connections in both cases  29 058   but in the first case many more connections are open and never closed also  the profiler shows that these unclosed connections are not strongly reachable after the test has finished executing all the queries  but that a good number of connections are still weak and or soft reachable  and forcing a gc execution doesn't change things     note that  when we use  connectiontestquery   we also see a comparable number of weak softly reachable connections at the end the difference seems to be that the connections are closed this time      at first we thought this could be some kind of issue at the mysql jdbc driver  but the fact is  we run this same test using commons dbcp with its default configuration  no connection validation query   and we obtained no unclosed connections

write transaction interfering with reads   ### summarywe started seeing an issue in our applications where data was sometimes not returned from api calls while investigating  it appeared to be an issue where write transactions happening in one application that destroys and recreates a node in the database interfere with the read transactions from the apis this seems to violate the expectation that the write transaction should be self contained and not affect the read of the same node we then continually run a write transaction that first deletes the node and then recreates the node with a configurable delay in between those two steps  however  the same transaction is still used in both steps      runs in read mode with a constant read of the same node and reports when the node is either found or not found these two commands should be run at the same time in two different terminals  better to kick off the write first  but should be very little delay between starting the read  with no or very little delay     10ms   the read intermittently fails to find the node

when a player tries to use a piston to move a track to an empty square with another track next to the empty square  multiple tracks will fall  and the console will report an error  which will not be logged then when players cooperate with some of the module's automated placement pickup devices and cycle through them  the console will keep reporting errors that are difficult to use  even if it is not automated  players can brush the rails indefinitely by right clicking the mouse  causing the console to keep reporting errors in addition  this problem seems to lead to the probability that the game thread is stuck in the background  and the player will disconnect  but the server can still be searched  and the server will show that the player is online  even if the plug in is automatically restarted  there will be no response  it is not 100  certain at the moment  but when the rail brush machine is turned off  there has never been any jam phenomenon   当玩家试图使用活塞将一个轨道移动到一个空的方块上，而在这个空方块旁边存在另外一个铁轨，就会掉落多个铁轨，同时后台报错，并且这个报错不会被记入日志。 然后，当玩家使用一些模组的自动放置 拾取设备的设备并循环使用这些设备时，控制台将不断地报错，并难以使用。 即使不是自动的，玩家也可以通过右键鼠标无限刷铁轨，从而导致控制台不断报告错误  而且这个问题貌似会导致后台出现概率游戏线程卡死，玩家将断开连接，但是依旧可以搜寻到服务器，服务器会显示玩家在线，即使是自动重启插件工作，也无反应。 暂时不能100 确定，但是在刷铁轨机器关闭的时，从来没有出现过卡死现象

aerial interface preventing functionality of rightclick hold items   first discovered this while trying to shoot a bow this was affecting vanilla and all modded bows i tested this also affected the horn of the wild from botania which uses the right mouse hold to break plants in an area around the player holding the mouse would start to play the animation and sound  but the sound would end without producing the plant break effect even though the right mouse button was never released it also affected eating the eating animation and sound would play  the food item would disappear from your inventory  and your hunger bar would fill  but shortly after the hunger would drop back down to the level it was before eating and you would find  if you sort your inventory with the invtweaks function i dismantled my entire base trying to find the problem and realized that when i removed the aerial interface the problem went away i can place the aerial interface and there is no problem  but once it reaches the 10 0 working pressure the right click problem comes back breaking the interface immediately fixes it unfortunately if i create a fresh world and attempt to reproduce the problem  i can not everything seems to work  but i can consistently reproduce this in my main play world with the exact same mod set  not sure if they will help  if there is any other testing i can do to help figure this out i will after additional testing  i am even able to add a new aerial interface in the main play world and apply pressure with a creative compressor and the problem does not occur i am stumped as to why just placing and pressurizing this particular interface causes the problem

perform more startup consistency checks before writing anything to disk   today when a node starts up after an upgrade it might write upgraded versions of at least these separate structures to disk     the keystore   the node metadata file    some portion of this can potentially get a node completely stuck in an upgrade     if the node metadata file is invalid  e g  comes from a version that is too old to support an in place upgrade then we do not discover this until after upgrading the keystore to the latest version this version of the node cannot start up due to the invalid node metadata file  but an attempt to downgrade to the previous working version will also fail because of the upgraded keystore   if the cluster metadata is invalid  e g  contains an index from an unsupported version then we do not discover this until after upgrading the keystore and the node metadata files to the latest versions again  this version of the node cannot start up due to the invalid cluster metadata  but an attempt to downgrade to the previous working version will also fail because of the upgraded keystore and node metadata files we can make this experience better by performing more consistency checks before writing anything to disk at startup  to avoid blocking a subsequent downgrade in cases where the upgrade is obviously infeasible

elasticsearch does not indicate retryability when flood stage is exceeded   today if a node exceeds the disk flood stage watermark  the disk threshold monitor will apply a special read only index block to any indices that have a shard allocated to the node that exceeded the watermark this block carries with it a forbidden status code so that if an attempt is made to index into such an index  the client receives a http 403 status code this situation is retryable though  as once the disk threshold monitor observes the free disk space go above the appropriate threshold  the index block is automatically removed while 429 is often translated as "too many requests"  the  http specification is liberal  https   tools ietf org html rfc6585#section 4 by making this change  all of our clients can start retrying when faced with an index that was marked read only due to a flood stage watermark exceeded event

the problem is that when saving a projects back to webdav with a lock still enabled in ganttproject  padlock locked i get the error response code 423 which means the resource is locked this happens because ganttproject does not send its own lock token in an "if" header according to webdav  rfc4918  rfc4918   section 7 5 when saving so this is not about locking other users out  but about one instance of ganttproject locking itself out ganttproject has to send the "if" header because this is the only way to avoid race conditions i have checked using the nd command line tool that my webdav instance reacts properly when requesting to overwrite a locked resource it denies it if there is no "if" header in the request and allows it when there is an appropriate "if" header in the request  matching the lock token as returned by propfind

if you pass in a filename with a  cram extension  makesamorbamwriter will create a bam file with a  cram extension and return a bamfilewriter  which is probably not what was intended using makewriter instead will remedy this  as it will create a real  cram file  but makesamorbamwriter should check the extension and either redirect to makecramwriter or reject the request

on right click of  does not support offhand  and cancelling events is broken         this is just a recommended template  but you should follow it       ### description   for one  "on right click of" does not include offhand the second bug is even worse because it completely breaks all cancel events and requires a server restart  just ruins the server completely 2  when cancelling 2 events at the same time that are on the same script  then skript breaks and cancels the event continuously without a trigger     steps to reproduce the problem if applicable  add a script or code snippet here     on rightclick holding a egg      cancel event  will not cancel event when right clicking on offhand 2  to reproduce second bug  have these 2 things for example   on rightclick holding a egg      if player does not have permission "egg use"          send "no 1 "if player does not have permission "bow use"          send "no 2"cancel event   try rightclicking them both at the same time  or put one item in your offhand and right click twice and it will break immedietly  and then it will stop checking the permission and will not send a message  but will rather just cancel the event forever and u cant use the items in any way  cant even break blocks with them and i expected cancelling events to not leak and break the server completely by ruining the items  ### errors   screenshots       if applicable  add errors and screenshots to help explain your problem      will do if necessary  the bugs are clear         if you get a console error  you should send the full error also if the error contains a stack trace  you can remove the server information section below

### actual behaviour    i reinstall the app and it creates auto upload folder connections to instant upload despite the fact that i have deleted instant upload folder and have reinstalled the app so that i could start with fresh auto upload folder connectionsit asked me if i wanted to auto upload to a folder called "instant upload"and when i tried adding things to the instant upload folder through the web ui  i didn't see the changes reflected on my phone i deleted the instant upload folder from my browser web ui 6 but i can see no way to delete them in the process of taking screenshots on my phone in order to explain the issue it actually kickstarted the system and made it recreate the instant upload folder i however  still can't delete those connections  and as you can see from the screenshots  it means that i have duplicates of the auto upload folder connections junking stuff up if there's a way to get rid of these excess connections
