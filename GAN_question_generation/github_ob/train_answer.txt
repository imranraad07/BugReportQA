i just took the latest soot trunk jar from github  the transformation now runs out of memory with 3g heap  it worked with 2g before   4g crashed my computer  so i don't know how to check that  besides getting a stronger machine     any ideas why this happens  shall i try a different build 
saw the advice to try 3 0rc3  is this working better  i was earlier at the "official" google play version  2 x i think  and that also had the same issue     uploads from my sailfish phone and from my desktop clients have no issues  account created for testing and info emailed to the requested address   tried to find something with catlog  but it told me i need to be root and these phones are not rooted 
as agreed at the last overture core nm the examples and the documentation in general has been moved to the overture documentation git repository 
no i do not have antivirus stuff installed  can reproduce the bug consistenly  performance monitor only shows "system" proccess accessing the file   i'm using administrator user profile and i have full control rights to the file  i tried opening full control rights to all users for the file and the folder  and the only thing that did  surprisingly  is deny the deleting of the original  jar file   i think windows won't let you rename the file that is open at the moment  maybe you need to make a small batch or command file to cleanup and run it after updating 
these are  currently  necessary  because the file import has to continue even when the app is not shown  and there would be no other way to see the progress  a batch import of more files can take a long time  and runs in background  what other way would there be to see the progress  suggestions

you can see the failed executions there  however  you can try any instance yourself  just try debug from  it fails

i'll attempt to reproduce it when i get home  it's happened to me on all servers

unfortunately i haven't had time to look into again  hopefully i have this week 
i am using the class path "com alee laf weblookandfeel" to set the look and feel dynamically at runtime  this is testing on the program lateralgm   it only occurs on restart where the look and feel is set and then setfocustraversalpolicyprovider is called with true at the end of main      lgm web l f  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3212801 11094577 723536b8 885e 11e5 9e2a a201063266f8 png   here's a full stack trace with java version printed by the error dialog 
i believe the issue is because i'm using spring boot   they must register the protocol  classpath   somewhere  so  new url "classpath     "   is actually a valid url  causing  urlurilocator isvalid  to be true     i checked the tests in  testimageurlrewriter   and that is correctly returning false for  urlurilocator isvalid  for classpath urls

when the power goes out that activates which allows for the inductor to loop with itself  it's used to preserve the current so it can hold on to its charge for a little while   the main purpose it to prevent power draw drops from draining the inductor instantly   i've re created the circuit in an electronics simulator to give a better idea of how it's supposed to run  http   www falstad com circuit circuitjs html cct  +1+0 000005+10 20027730826997+50+5+50 0ag+448+112+448+64+0 0ad+448+112+448+160+1+0 805904783 0aw+480+160+448+160+0 0aw+448+160+448+192+0 0ag+240+160+208+160+0 0ar+240+160+288+160+0+100 0al+448+160+368+160+0+100+0 04877957630304366 0aw+368+160+368+192+0 0as+368+192+416+192+0+0+false+1+2 0aw+448+192+416+208+0 0as+368+160+304+160+0+0+false+1+2 0aw+288+160+304+176+0 0as+480+160+512+160+0+1+false 0ar+512+160+560+160+0+0+40+50+0+0+0 5 0a  click either of the switches on the left to switch draw mode  and switch the one on the far right to activate and deactivate the voltage source  in game  deactivating the voltage source kills the entire circuit

ok  i have made some progress in better characterizing this issue   it appears that the upgrade process doesn't result in a "proper" boot loop but  instead  the tablet simply takes 2 3 times as long to boot   the short version of what i did is as follows  1  i attempted the same upgrade  1 8 3    1 8 7  after a fresh boot and got the same result  i force rebooted after being stuck on the boot screen "too long"     2  i performed the same reset procedure outlined above except that i didn't import my settings   i then repeated the upgrade process and got a successful boot in the normal timeframe for this device  3  just to further nail things down  i then imported my settings and rebooted   after it looked like the same "hung boot" results  i started to write this post   it took long enough that  when i glanced back at my device  i noticed that it did in fact eventually boot to the home lock screen  i then had to re compose this post         it did take significantly longer than normal  though  4   from there  i performed a standard upgrade to 1 8 10   interestingly  the reboot time for that upgrade seemed pretty normal   since this is an easily reproducible issue  on my device   i am more than happy to go a few more rounds if you would like me to gather some specific data for you   otherwise  the underlying issue seems far less serious than i originally outlined and i am content to just move on   let me know your thoughts   i think the squarely point to a problem in my settings  and or possibly some room for improved error checking imported settings within xprivacy    regardless  based on the changes made in xprivacy btwn 1 8 3 and 1 8 7  can you suggest some settings  i e  apps and or hooks     i could look into to determine what is causing the problem   thanks in advance 
i think discarding the mouse buttons seems to be the best idea  since buttons with high indices are not likely to be used playing opsu  due to their inconvenient position  practically all players will use l r mouse buttons or keyboard input  i temporarily fixed the issue on my system by disabling the buttons completely 
yes  appears to be fixed 
michael   i have an index on  document document_id   that is my only "entry point" to the data   unfortunately  i can't run anything on my end any more in 2 3 1  for my project i had to revert to 2 2 7 and so i created two neo4j ce installations  2 2 7 and 2 3 1  and two databases of the corresponding versions  for some reason the 2 3 1 installation gives me trouble now  when i have two versions of software installed on the same machine  this was not the case when 2 3 1 was installed alone  below are some screenshots of what's going on  i don't see any error messages in messages log     neo4j_browser_err_1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9038701 11811547 2556ee16 a304 11e5 8135 0b072d87a8d6 png    neo4j_browser_err_2  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9038701 11811554 2c574300 a304 11e5 8840 50e3e57e14e6 png    neo4j_browser_err_3  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9038701 11811563 33ed6cde a304 11e5 95df 0fdeffbe70e3 png   here's the zip of the test database that i'm working with  hope you can identify the problem with the provided query on your end   i had to append the  txt extension because the zip was not being uploaded   remora graph_2 3 1_test zip txt  https   github com neo4j neo4j files 62496 remora graph_2 3 1_test zip txt   in general  out of dozens of queries that i have as a part of my application  there are four that just halt  i initially provided one of them  and one that is borderline acceptable  running for 30 seconds now   but the rest are not really ok either  putting these five aside  migrating from 2 2 to 2 3 made things slower for me 2 3 times across the board  i did not do any tuning and did not use any hints  this is just out of the box   thanks  gene 
android 7 0 can you reproduce this crash 
i do not have habmin installed at the moment  but i will try and get to that tonight and see if i can still reproduce the issue  are there any logs beyond the log for openhab that i should pull 
the caches are not accessible  only the images are kept stored  for consistency  they should be purged at the same time as the caches   what you are asking is something else  do not expunge old caches  that should be raised in another issue  maybe an option could be used to set clear this behaviour  but most people will expect the data to be cleared  they don't even know the data is here as it is in a hidden folder  
hi thboileau   thanks for your promptly reply   the jars of restlet framework that we are using are    org restlet jars  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 12999827 8322130 16c655be 1a63 11e5 8f37 e6351ff4ebe0 png   and classes that we utilized are    genericclient import  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 12999827 8322166 a87ecb80 1a63 11e5 9da5 fb8aab8bcf9a png   we did not test the last stable release  2 3 3  yet since we are doing platform migration test from windows to ibm aix and the result will be applied to production environment too   we may try the last stable release but also want to identify the root cause of this issue so that we can fine tune the system or server environment to avoid similar issue happen again   i would like to provide more details if needed   thanks

 dariuszaniszewski the delay is not used in "production"  it's more when i have to debug stuff with the actual device   here the core of the packet writer i usually use     the operation goes farther  i'm able to write about between 6 and 14 lines but at some point  operation hangs and transfer stops hitting the timeout exception   i know the transfer is happening since there is a led blinking on the peripheral when transfer is in progress   just not sure why the operation hangs like this 
hi and thank you for your quick reply  dertobsch  the configuration is very simple 
sorry for the late reply—other projects intervened         renyuneyun  in the "additional info" section above  i compared my problem to issue #154 and described in some detail my attempts to find an applicable permission to grant as described in the comment you linked to   did i miss something  is there anywhere else i should look for such a permission  beyond what i have already listed 
yes  i tried building it in different ways  and changing the position of the structure tower and the rocket assembling machine  finally i found that the problem is when the rocket is built with a structure pipe from buildcraft   if you put a structure pipe in a external side of a rocket and after the building you place a block next to the rocket  it can rises to the level of the new blocks  depending on the side you place the new block   also depending on where you place the structure pipe it can rises just after the building without new blocks     2016 06 08_12 52 47  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 19404111 15892634 0b2a5832 2d7b 11e6 9220 11c7d5081f5e png   edit  it also happens with other buildcraft blocks like the refinery  or external mods  like carpenter´s blocks  architecturecraft  galacticraft  ic2 or mekanism 
 sourabh joshi this fix should go out monday   yes  i believe so 
yes  i also think that i'm using 1 0 8   below is the code that creates the animateddrawable  or if that does not work  creates a normal bitmapdrawable assuming it is a non animated image   unfortunately i cannot reproduce this issue on my device by myself  but a friend of mine gets it from time to time  samsung galaxy s3   also  in google developer console  i get many of these native crash report  the devices are mostly galaxy s3  nexus 5  galaxy s4  galaxy note 3  galaxy s5  xperia z1  looks like it happens only on android 4 3 and 4 4  but that might be a coincidence  
i will try to make a patch  i'm not sure of the appropriate fix  my first thought was to throw exception when end of stream is detected in the decodenext method  but i have not looked back at all the callers to see how everyone handles the null response it currently emits  if that's not the right place  then providing a specific fix for the decodeinfinitivelength method seems straightforward enough     c rack if you have any insight as to where i should focus the fix  please advise  otherwise i will fork  fix  and send you a pull request as my work schedule allows

not the notified http header  but the header within flume events  remember  a notified ngsi event is transformed into an internal flume event that is composed of a body and a set of headers  most of the headers are copied from the http notification  but many others are proprietary by cygnus  and  even  others are altered from the origianl one  as is the case of fiware servicepath  
it does  sorry about my poor testing

sure  be happy to open a pr  we're currently using version 1 7  working on upgrading   after a node restarted  one of the shards failed to initialize with the error message i listed above  i'm guessing that a write was dropped on the replica at some earlier point  even though the overall operation reported success  if this is a known issue that is fixed in later versions  i'd be very interested to hear it   to fix this  we removed the shard files from the node reporting the wrong doc count and let it recover from the primary   when checking doc counts with  _cat shards  i noticed that the doc count didn't match up with the error message  checked on the source code to see where the number was coming from and found the bug 
yes  it works perfectly  better than just use obtainnohistory because fling keep working always 
execution  http   192 168 134 197 cerberusqa executiondetail jsp id_tc 32251196 note that this tests uses a static data library for the login  it is ok  and a sql query for the product  not working    let me know if you need more information 
here is an example 
normally i don't have any problems with using iex pry though not all parts are as easy to debug because of the supervisors  but even if i disable the entire supervisor tree in the start function it gives those errors  it looks like when it's trying to  int ni all the modules in the project   and that is probably also causing another problem when i increase the ets tables limit and succeed starting it  because everything is bound in the debugger including the libraries it slows down the project so much i get problems with our supervisors timing out  though with increasing the timeouts i can get the project to work with the debugger though startup takes about 50 seconds on the first request    when i manually use the  int ni i don't have that problem but it's probably because everything is being debugged now

is that it is just a suggestion not required at all for compiling  at least for the intellij plugin  that could be used for other ides including the   display   the meta is to enable completions without adding explicitly an "using" clause  without the metadata  it would be slow and displaying zillions of static public methods that probably are not meant to be used as extensions  with the metadata  it should be faster limiting the classes you are searching and would avoid suggesting lots of garbage

this helps a lot  i confirmed that it is os related  it only happens in miui 9 6 5  android 7 1 nougat  i tried in a samsung with android 5 1 and it works just fine  and i found this explanation on stackoverflow  link  https   stackoverflow com questions 5018545 getapplication vs getapplicationcontext  seems legit  and when i fixed the process  a thing that you can make in miui  it worked fine  seems like it optimizes the process killing something important  no clue about what exactly happens but now i know how to fix it  thank you

hi kevin  the point is to edit the text within the richeditor  in your video you are setting the content by the method "sethtml"  but as an user of an input form you would like to edit your html text with the rich editor  type texts  set your text bold  underlined  take another font etc    if you do that and call then "gethtml  " you will not get your changed text  but only your original text you set at the beginning  i will try to take a video too  d  kind regards  david
ah  there is a difference  i totally did not notice that   firstly  i though that if there is a difference in that topic  then it should be related with  retryclient   what you said is difference between  clientbuilder  and  httpclientbuilder   i am not sure still about on it   anyway  i will happily prepare for that pr

hello again     sorry for bringing poor information about the bug  i was a little busy  today i have been 2 entire hours making a deep investigation on this bug on a new empty server  and i figure it out a lot of things    the first thing i have to noticed  is that the bug doesn't actually comes entirely from essentials  and now i'm confused about considering this a bug or not  maybe it is likely more a conflict problem that was actually fixed by essentials  but not fully fixed  you will understand it after reading the how to reproduce the bug     how to reproduce the bug  step by step     you will need the following 6 plugins  vault  essentialsx  essentialsxchat  chatinyector and its dependencies  placeholderapi and protocollib   forget about luckperms  i used it for letting "test" shout a message to demostrate you that the format  shout  is already fixed    2020 03 05_11 17 36  https   user images githubusercontent com 43190931 75990759 1e246200 5ed4 11ea 8910 ed90d028469b png    after having the 6 plugins downloaded  you must download player expansion for placeholderapi with _ papi ecloud download player_  then  the only thing you need to change on the config yml of essentials is on the essentialschat section  you must enable the radius chat  changing it from 0 to any number higher than it  in my case  100 blocks     on the "format " you must change it from "  displayname    message " to "  player_name    message " and here it comes the big question  "why would you change the displayname variable with player_name " well  first of all  remember this is the fastest way to reproduce the bug  but on my detailed server i use it for avoiding players who used to be vip group with their nickname changed  to show their realname whenever their vip group would expire  or also to obligate players with staff groups inherited  to always show their real name  even if before becoming staff they had a custom nickname defined  there are a lot more reasons about this  but i won't be splashing much more on this  as it's not the topic    you can now restart the server  and after you do  you will need to join the server with two differrent accounts for obviously reasons  one of them will need to have op so that way you can "spy" the messages sent by the other account when it is out of the chat radius     so  after following those steps  you will notice this results      2020 03 05_11 17 28  https   user images githubusercontent com 43190931 75992507 d6eba080 5ed6 11ea 9719 070f65bdb94c png   the name i used for the one that is op and will spy the messages is "tomi010817"  and for the one that will send the messages  is "test"    as you can see  when "test" sent a raw message as local  and "tomi010817" was out of his chat radius  "tomi010817" didn't have other alternative of spying the local message  so you can clearly see that the placeholder on the spy local format " l  spy " gets bugged  showing the name of the one who spies it  in this case tomi010817   this also happens with other placeholders intended to show stuff owned by "test" instead of "tomi010817"  for example his rank  i will attach an extra example image of the bug including group ranks also  at the end of the reply   i think that this should be fixed by essentials and not by other plugin author  because essentials has already fixed this problem with the local format " l " and with the shout format " shout "  you can see on the image above that the bug doesn't occur with those chat formats  so i will guess that essentials only forgot to also fix this problem with the  l  spy  chat format     below this  i will also bring you the same example but also using group ranks    2020 03 05_11 09 25  https   user images githubusercontent com 43190931 75994040 23d07680 5ed9 11ea 922f b60e2d35df90 png    the last message sent by "test" on both example images  is the same message but "tomi010817" is inside the chat radius of "test"  so "tomi010817" doesn't have any need to spy the message  and you can see that that format is fixed    in short words  essentials maybe forgot to also fix the compatibility with chatinyector  on the local spy " l  spy " chat format   hope you can read this  and if you could  thank you very much for taking the time of reading this long text  💜 if you want more detailed info about the problem  or even join the server and see the bug with me  you can add me on discord  tomi010817#8699

still the same using  compile 'org springframework cloud spring cloud starter sleuth 1 0 0 build snapshot'  compile 'org springframework cloud spring cloud starter zipkin 1 0 0 build snapshot'   are they the correct ones  and am i correct that this is a bug  meaning that the intention is to never report if the span says "no"   the reason why i'm asking is that i'm confused about how the filtering is meant to be used  as far as i can see  the only effect the sampler has is to set span exportable to false in defaulttracer starttrace     this exportable flag is then only used when determining if zipkinspanlistener release   should trigger a reporter report    causing the span http report call   zipkinspanlistener serversend   however  never checks the "exportable" field and therefore calls reporter report    which is probably why i'm seeing http reports 
hi notcarl  thanks for your reply  sorry for not being clear   i did not intend to use any sort of idle mode  and setting  idletimeout  on the channel builder does not appear to affect the issue i'm describing   indeed  from looking at the source code it seems that this is because a newly created channel queues up outgoing requests while some initial name resolution work occurs  the name resolution work happens on the same  scheduledexecutor  as the idle timer  which we cannot replace with a direct executor   and when the name resolution is done the queued requests are dispatched  i e  though we try to use a direct executor  the channel still uses a non direct executor for important work    i don't believe the problem is related to the idle timer  it just happens to use the same executor as the idle timer  which seems to be the mistake as far as i can see    here is a minimal example     the reason that  onnext  is called on a different thread is due to the details i provided in the original comment  and it's fixed by the pull request i created   edit  updated to use non streaming rpc in example  since it turns out it does not matter 
dbeaver provides an editor like the picture i post binary view shows hex mode but if swich to text view i think there should provider the ability to customize the text encoding just like any text editor run in windows editplus notepad++ etc

hi   vpavic thanks for looking into this issue    i can't reproduce the issue on spring security core 5 0 12  however the 5 0 x release does not contain a csrf filter for webflux  therefore only one savedelta call is executed   i'll try to create an unit test to reproduce the issue in an isolated environment

i have created https   bazel review googlesource com # c 11931   but it's currently under review and have some problems to discuss  i guess 0 5 x is possible but not 0 5 2 
it seem to work  regarding your pr   isn't it simpler to move  cipherin flip     outside of the  if   like this     and re the test   my test involves a remote broker  i am not sure it is reproducible with localhost because timing is completely different in that case  also  my message is not large as yours   a json body of 4224 bytes is being sent + some headers  dunno  probably less than 256 bytes   maybe for a better coverage it makes sense to run test multiple times with different message sizes  cheers
the bi directional edge based algorithms would not work properly with the behavior in querygraph due to different edge ids for same edges when using different edge filters  node based algorithms do not have a problem with this behavior since they use ids of nodes to store costs which are still the same  edge based algorithms would use the edge id to store costs and therefore the ids should be the same as long as it is functionally the same edge  in my pull request #158 there are tests for bi directional dijkstra and a   which do not pass due to this behavior  i turned off the tests temporary  e g  see  dijkstrabidirectionreftest#testviaedges_fromequalsto     
no and i think because maybe nothing is dropped into the world  that i can see   the xp goes straight into your bar

i could not find a similar case where colors are not parsed correctly  so i quoted it on here  but since this is just an addon  bbox might be the root cause 
these are my settings     thanks for the hint   i'll have another view on the samples 
when i remove the  setstring  for the jdbc case i have an exception 
thanks  using the fully qualified path fixes it  hadn't realised it needs fully qualified paths  an error message about missing import s  would be good 
stop  let's not get into any new triangulation schemes  these location problems have already been seriously thought about before  i am sorry i have not had time to catch up on all these old docs as of today  but hope to do this within next week  if you are interested in this  please have a deeper look in the various documents provided by  he3556 
 tsmaeder it is just a display problem  the workaround is to view the keys via user preferences api

if picocli doesn't support us in this event  i suggest we update the documentation to show that the framework doesn't support trailing back slashes and ensure that they do not appear   we should check if this is a product of the shell or java picocli itself  i e  running  java  jar      "c  temp "  in the windows command prompt vs via intellij

items flowing through water works correctly   passive mobs are not moving at all  i tested cows and sheep   aggressive mobs have the same behavior  while in survival i spawned a creeper and even when i punch it it refuses to move or explode   edit  both passive and aggressive mobs refuse to be moved by water  they fling themselves like when i punch them and then teleport back to the initial point of water entry 
last time i tried it  the cause and context weren’t filled with the same things  some of which was required

 tsmaeder in both variants the editor displays wrong content  after saving the devfile you will not be able to run the command 
no its not working     after the last item is removed  it still shows the item on the side  no number above  and pulling "fake stacks" out

that's what i've been forced to do  but when something doesn't work  i like to understand why  not just write it off as bad luck 😃   the  content length  returned is correct  i know that because i can download the file using curl or browser  and it is the said size on disk  also  like you said  i've tried without  content length  header as well    i've collected exactly that using netty  i've been trying multiple clients to rule out a potential okhttp bug   i can post that  or if you tell me how to collect what's left in the buffer using okhttp  i will do that 
liach  just what i saw in jei  it will be a bit before i can provide full details about forge version  loaded mods  etc  finals week is busy   note that ic2 is loaded  and these loaders were separate from the rf loader and unloader

what's the purpose of alpha  moving the alpha slider in the rgb preview changes the luminosity  but if it actually does nothing  shouldn't it be removed 
which  a  are you referring to  i'm confused   if you have imported module a  the common keyword  int y   0  has been defined on x  so in a module that imported a  anything of type x should return a value for the  y  field   if a is not imported  then i agree  makes no sense so still support the access of field  y  
i tried it with that app as well right after i made my last comment  it failed  it said the qr code was invalid  i don't remember the exact message  but i can get that if necessary  and gave numbers the plugin rejected when i attempted to manually enter the code  with 6 digits  sha256 settings  
 snicoll thanks for the quick explanations  i see what you meant and i just noticed this on the upgrade instructions    we wanted to put the our service bean together with its configuration  and use   enableconfigurationproperties  to conditional switch on off the bean initialization in a consistent way 
so    question 0  perhaps this is the simplest solution   as this is all i've done to get it to work and it now works like a champ  question 1  aapt is the only tool that can't be found upon update  i do like the idea of defensively checking that the required tools are available before launch  the error message only told me that aapt was missing  i wouldnt have known to look at my path without realizing that android has moved the locations of it's tools in the past and this cluing me in  question 2  i had both of these in there  my path now looks like   path  android_home platform tools  android_home tools  android_home build tools 17 0 0

i still have the problem  for sure it come from the gis file  that i did not control and that was made "by hand"  but it used to work like one month ago  there is one specific building that gives a problem    run andorraabm gaml and display experiment  note 1  no problem to open this gis in qgis note 2   please don't share those data
 skabashnyuk i'm trying to figure out why we need to call bash sometimes  docker other times  and docker maven plugin other times    surely we could achieve both building and testing with a single approach    benoitf i'm not trying to solve the chicken egg issue  i'm asking why we use     maven mojo to call docker 4 times     maven exec to call bash to call docker exe 2 times  and    maven exec to call docker exe directly  no bash  2 times    why do the same thing 3 different ways    you're right  my comment about portability was misleading  i've removed it

 ronblum after spending some more time on this  i noticed the following more straightforward example better reflects on the issue  please go through the following steps to reproduce the issue     run the following code    it will create a data frame where the type of the first column is logical  and the type of the remaining columns is double     adjust indices of columns to see only columns 50 51  a total of two columns   then apply "filter"  you will notice that the type of column 50  the first column in the new two column display  will be logical  while it should be double 
yes  i can provide an example  unfortunally this issue tracker won't let me add a pom xml or pom txt as attachment      so i have to add the pom content directly      xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"    project xmlns "http   maven apache org pom 4 0 0" xmlns xsi "http   www w3 org 2001 xmlschema instance" xsi schemalocation "http   maven apache org pom 4 0 0 http   maven apache org maven v4_0_0 xsd"       modelversion 4 0 0  modelversion       project   the problem is caused by the dependency declaration   if it is removed all runs fine   if it is defined  the rule execution crash with a npe     probably because a pom artifact hasn't "real" dependencies   but we need use such declarations in our parent pom to force all projects to rely on some basic dependencies

testing team use live executions very frequently to debug had to spot issues from cerberus screenshots and also as helper when there's complex scenarios and several steps prior to the step where the issue happen   it's not blocking but the possibility to view a live execution  makes the debug process a lot faster an efficient  our testing team use it all the time   screenshot still displayed   as you mentioned  i would suggest to make it headless by default  because it should reduce resource consumption and the complexity on robot host  but with possibility to overwrite it for some robots  if you predict the development will be long we surely appreciate to remove it temporarily  otherwise  we can wait for it a couple of days for it  no problem

hi  mrniko here is the exception that occur during deserialization of an object from tomcat session  using latest redisson snapshot    the best thing for this was to be able to override readobject for customobjectinputstream but the method is declared as final  so for my test i end up changing 2 classes that uses currently customobjectinputstream   seriazliationcodec and tasksrunnerservice   i'm attaching both classes that i have modified and are up to date with the latest in git so you could compare and see the difference  probably the best thing is to make customobjectinputsteam private class and use helper method class that will read the object out of the input stream and set the correct class loader and after that set it back to what it was   redisson zip  https   github com redisson redisson files 3233687 redisson zip 
from a client perspective though  if it is not explicitly in the schema  you can ignore it exists  in the above example  i can do everything i need to do without ever using  read or write  the _id field  save update without _id is fine   i would think it could be hidden from the client if there is another field in schema for identity

 nik9000  i will get that once it returns to a failed state again 
i agree  but sometimes is does not for some reason  prefix broken  bad user manipulation  etc      in this case  we should handle it properly so that the user can at least delete or repair the prefix

there are two cycles shown there   starting from  com impossibl postgres system procs autoconvertingtextdecoder convertoutput basedecoders java 247    this is happening before any queries  after we initialize the c3p0 connection pool   we've seen another intermittent error on startup that caused a  java lang illegalstateexception  type has no supported parameter format  timestamp 1114   exception to be thrown when trying to run a query early in our app startup that involves a timestamp object  our best guess is an issue with the shared registry  i mention this as we are wondering if some kind of race condition on startup is the culprit for both   one other complication to note is that we are using a c3p0 pool for the majority of our connections  but create a single direct connection in order to attach a pgnotificationlistener  again  i'm wondering if there is some kind of registry conflict happening

uhm    not really   at the moment there is only one debug configuration called "rust" which allows to run an executable which is the output of a build process      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 889291 51439677 8b1b6f00 1cb5 11e9 8ee2 e930e89f9f5d png   this doesn't work if you want to debug a  # test      using "test" as the build command does not work as the build command is executed  before  launching gdb   using the "normal" executable doesn't work as  cargo test  gives the executable a different  random  name for the test executable   the profile i'm talking about could be just the same  just made more clever so it figures out what the name of the test executable is     build command could be  test   no run  which will create the debug executable    use default" should figure out somehow that we don't want to run the main executable but query cargo  how  perhaps something that we need to ask the cargo team   to find out what the name of the test executable is   this is how it looks if i fill the fields by hand  and it works too      image  https   user images githubusercontent com 889291 51439794 5f00ed80 1cb7 11e9 8171 194ddbdde4a8 png     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 889291 51439860 0847e380 1cb8 11e9 925b 5df731e34afc png     to be fair  the whole debug launch is a bit clunky  if i had an option  i would like it the same as java  where pretty much every configuration can be either "run as   " or "debug as   " although i think we're hitting the limits of the cdt debug framework here

hi  nonews   i mean  scenario  the app is showing the permission request dialog to the user and  in this moment  the user clicks the button in the middle  https   i stack imgur com rpdka png  to move the app to background  if the user moves the app back to foreground  by clicking the third button   the dialog does not show again  as would be expected  and the onresume executes method onrequestpermissionsresult passing an empty array  current nopermission code moves the flow to the onsuccess runnable and allows the user to pass without having accepted the permission   later i paste some code at home 
you're right  even the new link is wrong  and now when looked at it again i see the problem  the leading  http   a deviantart net avatars   part is static and the rest is completely predictable but depends on the username   for example  suppose your name is    higglytownhero      http   a deviantart net avatars h i higglytownhero gif 6     rautamiekka      http   a deviantart net avatars r a rautamiekka gif 5   it takes your first letter for the first folder  then the second letter for the second folder  and your whole username with the   gif  extension for the filename  in the case of  higglytownhero  his name is capitalized as  higglytownhero   so the   usernames in links are always lower case but the case matters in only filenames     notice that the trailing integer parts are different from the links in the op  and quickly checking around  opening up many avatars in succession  it appears the integer is an avatar type indicator since the integer is same across users with similar avatars

 qwerty4030 the parsing happens on the coordinating node  the node that receives the request from the client  but  aggregator s are created on the shard so we can't create the  aggregator s during the parsing phase and perform the validation with them  i think we will need to create code to do the validation using the  aggregatorbuilder  objects instead since this is what we have available on the coordinating node at parse time   as for the discrepancy between order in the terms aggregation and the histogram aggregations  it would be nice to have them consistent  maybe we could have both use the same  order  classes rather than having separate implementations but i fear that this will be fairly tricky

yes  indeed it is the issue with symlinks    moving the project to a non symlinked location fixes it 
thanks  if i can relate the other issue to the this plugin  i will reopen a new issue with more details 
basically anything will cause this to happen  i have been trying to figure out what is happening  what is going wrong but i'm not sure  when i uninstall disable the plugin the issue goes away  also when this does happen  which is often  it will keep happening until you stop mining breaking the block  once you stop it stops and goes away

hi cp    thanks for the quick response   here are the requested screenshots     in the first  i have connected the reactor rednet ports via the rednet insulated conduits and set both to channel "pink"   the second and third image is the gui for the big reactors rednet port which allows it to emit a redstone signal upon certain events   in my case i have set the reactor control rods to automatically be the same   as whatever the internal battery level is thus shutting down the reactor   starting it up depending on the drain  going into your very cool capacitor bank    this also happens when i connect the power monitor to the the reactor rednet port via the rednet insulated conduits and tell it to emit a redstone signal is the power drops below a certain level  interestingly  in this setup it does seem to emit a signal  seen by attaching a redstone light  but does not "go into" the rednet port   this is a very good tutorial on what big reactors are and can do if you wish to find out more about them    https   www youtube com watch v sev05vjkgay  btw just a personal thank you for making such a great mod  you keep a 43 yo tinkerer very happy       2014 10 16_09 12 45  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9249158 4659442 1d424a86 550d 11e4 90d5 f21f2fa84453 png    2014 10 16_09 12 51  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9249158 4659443 1d47d03c 550d 11e4 85a8 0582974f6de7 png    2014 10 16_09 12 55  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 9249158 4659444 1d490998 550d 11e4 8a0a e15836c9cbd6 png

hi  laa good to hear from you  and yes it seems you've got it bingo    after replacing the dots with an underscore it seems to work as before  i should have asked you earlier   it would have saved me some hours     now my question is it a bug or feature  anyway i leave the underscore  thank you very much and best regards from graz airport  eric
stefano   yes  we’re using the serverless java container   jersey    its been working great since the first release  but we’ve just noticed this happening  well its the first time we’ve put a space in to be fair     we’ve been able to use the container library with jetty which allows us to run the framework locally  where we don’t see the error   it only seems to happen when we deploy the lambda to aws 
yes  most of the working videos has multiple of 16 height  1080  720  480   but some of them has resolution 640x360 and works too   360   16   22 5   so i don't know could it be the reason or not 
i'll work on a repro for this soon  i wish i hadn't found it in the midst of "jam code" so it was easier to extract   
hi  oliverralbertini  the error occurs earlier than pxf gets any data  even without connected hdfs  just deploy any gp cluster  install and run pxf and create external table

 nosark sure  go for it  thanks for your help  please note that this is likely to be a high priority issue so if it's not fixed quickly  one of the core maintainers may need to take it over from you  our next release to get this issue in is in january  v4 1  see  the calendar  https   wiki mozilla org mobile focus android train_schedule   though so you've got a bit of time      unfortunately  i'm not sure what could be the matter here but you could start investigating by     from pocmo's suggestion  looking at the git log for  browserfragment    does anything look suspicious  perhaps back out a changeset and see if it fixes the problem   bisecting  check out different changesets on master to find out which reproduce and which don't to narrow down which changeset could have caused the regression  this is less viable because the issue isn't consistently reproducible yet    just reading the code      let us know if you need any assistance and don't forget you can find us at #focus on irc generally during pst working hours 
umm  i think i described the bug badly  i wasn't referring to the searching of numbers  let's say i have a number saved  e g    101#  which allows me to check my prepaid balance  i then search for it  e g   bal  and it shows result  account balance  101#  along with two icons  one for direct message and one for direct dial  i click the direct dial  and instead of dialling   101#   it instead dials   101  without the trailing hash   ps  i'm from south africa  and yes i can compile from source here   
there is no official date yet  probably sometime around september 
ok   super thanks   we will try that   we have been trying to test a target production like config and conscious of the overhead of vm creation  it was simpler to use a smaller number of vm's with a couple of stroom's per node    the test data set sizes are tiny compared to production  so even with a non performance optimised environment  we were not expecting any problems 
hey   thanks for replying  actually the test case on which i am working is as follows  1  i have created a server which is able to handle requests for file upload  2  of course one client can upload many files using single channel  but i am considering a test case in which i want to create multiple clients and to do so i should create multiple bootstraps  eventloopgroup and channel that means    if creating multiple eventloopgroups is not advisable then how to replicate above scenario  because at real time there will be millions of clients and each client will have its own bootstrap  eventloopgroup and channel and the server should serve all those clients   and if test app is necessary to understand the problem then i'll surely upload the code snippet of test case

thanks for the feedback  my main concern is when we release a new version and we update the metadata to point to the new version  this potential window where we'd show the old version is the critical aspect of it  and quite frustrating since the metadata is immutable the rest of the time really  if that's the only option we need to figure how an acceptable windows for the upgrade use case 
yes of course

to test your suggestion i made  wallpaperengine sketch  package private and modified  pwallpaper ondestroy    to this    when 'select wallpaper' is tapped for the first time  the app crashes  the crash begins with a  nosuchargumentexeption  thrown by  android view display  looking for a  getrawwidth  method  that escalates into an  illegalargument  exception  not sure what throws it  that then stops the app  restarting the app from the 'has stopped' dialog then starts the wallpaper as soon as the desktop becomes visible  with the live instance running  opening the selector anew and setting wallpapers no longer crashes the app  i also never got more than three animation threads existing at the same time this way  which is an improvement   crashing while starting the live engine implies that  ondestroy    gets called before the live instance is set up and that at least some parts of the preview sketch are required to do this  that it only happens the first time a wallpaper is selected implies  that this is a special occasion  i may be fixated on this  but i couldn't fail to observe that this is the only time where  mactiveengines size    is below two

need to think about this a bit more  i think the difference might be that we call loginsilent on each api call  allowing the underlying auth client to decide whether to get from cache or make a network call  in your example you call getsession   which i think would always be static   the pattern we use is based on the pattern for adal recommended by  vibronet   call acquiretokensilent every time and let the lib decide what to do   relevant source   baseodatacontainer  https   github com officedev office 365 sdk for android blob master sdk odata engine core src main java com microsoft services odata baseodatacontainer java#l77   liveauthdependencyresolver  https   github com officedev office 365 sdk for android blob master sdk odata engine android impl src main java com microsoft services odata impl liveauthdependencyresolver java#l75   adaldependencyresolver  https   github com officedev office 365 sdk for android blob master sdk odata engine android impl src main java com microsoft services odata impl adaldependencyresolver java#l49

thanks for the quick response   svenjacobs    as you suggested  i created a simple button group using plain html bootstrap javascript to try to reproduce the issue   in my example  i used the glyphicons instead of font awesome  since i was trying to follow the basic example found at http   getbootstrap com getting started    but i don't think this would make a difference   here is my example html     this example works as expected  and i was not able to reproduce the issue of the buttons shifting and jiggling as the tooltips are displayed   please let me know if you have any questions  and thanks again 
i have sent the log via message at the openhab community 
 fullwall arm_swing is so fast you can't necessarily see the effect  try  start_use_offhand_item  while its holding a shield in offhand  that lasts varyingly between 0 seconds and half a second 
 misaochan so actually the crash was obtained initially when i built from an outdated master  so i pulled fresh changes and built it and tried it again  and the crash persists and happens every time i hit the deny button on the run time permission dialog    replacing the fragment with a dialog would be simple enough but yeah lets hear from the others as well

sorry  currently i can't reproduce the issue any more  maybe because of the recent change in maxsearchmultiplier 50 to maxsearchmultiplier 100  i'll need to do some more tests  but his may take a while 
good news  neither of us are laymen  but  per the but report  the trigger is that the linux system running the client is being suspended put to sleep while the client is still active  so the server is probably ending up with a half open connection   maptool in this case is being used to manage the maps for a pbp game  so these aren't real time game sessions  i recognize that is not the typical usage model  though it is interesting that the 1 5 4 server did not exhibit this behavior while 1 5 5 does 
we don't modify manifest mf  i will confirm what the actual value is when i go to office tomorrow   because i can not access the server from my home 
i will try  though i don't have a great environment to do this since i can't disrupt our production setup more than it has been disrupted this week already  also  we've been holding out on upgrading to 2 2 or newer due to #697   i should have mentioned that i did update asynchbase jar from 1 6 0 to 1 7 1 and that didn't make any difference

in reading docs yesterday i understand better the intent of this field and still want to centralize management of the datasource configurations   but  this kind of feels like getting into the association aggregation feature which is coming in a future milestone   what is the use case for when separate datasources will be needed to access data within a single entity   with correct permissions  everything could be accessed in a single datasource   if it spans databases i would argue it's a separate entity  joins would be handled at software layer  so that should be part of association   my recommendation is remove the per statement  datasource  property and allow a single datasource per entity  unless a clear use case for keeping it is identified 
these are the apps where i started seeing it quite frequently   https   github com kdvolder chatter   that may very well be true  i don't know  but the issue is not whether the app is listening on the port  but whether asking what the port is from the admin bean returns the number of the port rather than 'null'   is it possible that the app starts listening first and then makes that port known to the admin bean asyncly 
 squiddev sorry i didn't see you asked me to show my setup they are using a modified cc jar on that server which may be the issue so i don't feel it would be appropriate for me to post an issue here
i have implemented the plugin in my server  and i have these problems  the people can go through blocks  there is no damage from falls when you're riding your pet  finally  if you die  the pet appears again next to you  i like this plugin  but users have told me this  thanks for working on this project 
after copying from a previous version the following 5 binaries    extractor evaluator kbmira mert pro   mmt tune starts correctly and executes til step  3 o 4  where it fails with error    file not found   tmp tmp02ju54  interpreted as  tmp tmp02ju54   at  home ubuntu modernmt cli opt mert moses perl line 494    the error persists even after adding  with symbolic link  all the remaining binaries 
i'm not so sure if i understand the structure    the problem is  if one poi already exists in one category  like the example above  it's not possible to find it in the other category  both categories are defined in poi mapping xml  and one would suspect that if a poi fits a category  it would be contained  but only one category you can select in the ui  "restaurant" or "alpine_hut"  gets the poi as result   one could work around by moving tags which are often combined in child categories  but this works only in a few cases 
yeah  authme email exists  i think it had this bug a long time ago – i must have tested with an old version once and confused the commands
this problem occurs only when there are enabled such modules as "override"  "harvestleveltweaks"  i apologise       i tried to change harvest level of some blocks using this modules  but i found much simplier way to do this   only with "override" module enabled  when "harvestleveltweaks" is disabled  i haven't this bug   i noticed  that in config file i have only   _one_   variant of each material  that registered by tcon and tgreg  in other words  2 _real_ materials transforms into one material in config  because itt uses name of material instead of id    i can say  that itt exactly overrides durability and mining speed of material  other stats of materials are result of mixing tcon's stats and tgreg's stats 
we need to solve that generics problems one for all time
no anr  no crash  i'm fully unable to unlock screen so maybe something pops up after a while however that is just thinking out loud without any proof   i'm not able to compile kiss  i'm user tester so i gathered no knowledge to set up android studio plus my os is freebsd so i believe there would be extra troubles   i will try to put catlog into some use  maybe i could get some info from the device  maybe i can also use adb in this case to retrieve some logs 
i have missed the fact  that an exception will be thrown automatically if it wasn't cleared  so some things in the rust bindings still should be updated   smile 
no  the 'ask me' option does not even appear in the menu when i right click  but the surprising part is that  when run  the program has no errors and opens an instance of eclipse successfully

sure this would work and be thread safe  my thought at initial look was that these classes were not intended to be threadsafe to begin with  and that it would be a requirement of the callers of pause     resume   to ensure thread safety  on further review  the "compareandset" operation was making it thread safe to do  if maintaining thread safety of the terminal implementations is the goal then we should merge in your change instead  while rare  i can think of cases an application would require multiple threads to handle the pause   resume   methods

what i ment was adding new conditional flow step inside of one condition in existing conditional flow step  so it would look something like this   webhook    conditional flow 1    log  conditional flow 1  condition1  condition2  condition3  condition1  flow start    conditional flow 2    flow end        conditional flow 2  condition 4  condition 5 condition 6   in current ui implementation you would get lost pretty quickly and navigation between those conditions would be really hard  i agree that some special selection columns for conditions needs to exist and your suggested solution with simple ui changes may solve the issue 
i presume you don't need system details anymore 
we're on version 3 0 5c of boilerplate and b3 5c of steamcraft  the error doesn't show up in single player  this is indeed on a server   going through any other portal doesn't cause this error except with the portal to inner earth  from the steamcraft mod   which got me the error and then i think killed the server when i logged back in   
there might be legitimate reasons why a user might keep a property unselected in their map  maybe the current source documents don’t have all the data to fit the canonical model   we can call attention to the unselected properties in the map if we think the user really might not want this  perhaps before they harmonize   if we think users may prefer the system making default mapping choices for them  we can give them the opportunity to choose that behavior  or at a minimum make it clear that it is happening in the generated code   right now the user is making one choice in the ui  don’t map these properties  and the system is doing another  we’re going to map these unmapped properties automatically   that doesn’t seem right    bsrikan  i assumed the "unassigned or unmatched mappings" section was for mappings that  for whatever reason  were disconnected from an entity 
i have tested with the latested  however i haven't reset my config as the server is in production right now  so resetting the config would require some downtime

yes  of course  three reasons this makes sense    it's currently guessing invalid credentials and hurting the user experience    using the provided root credentials is what the orientdb console does when you create a new database  see the resolution of #6564     it's consistent with the existing behavior    the existing behavior was to log the user in as an admin  and the root credentials have admin level access to the database 
i am using slf4j 1 7 21 + logback 1 1 7  i am only using a message formatter from spf4j to do some custom message formatting   the important things are   when running in debug log mode  1  jetty somewhere logs a httpchannel object instance   2      lots of other logs  enough to fill the logback async logger queue 3  jetty logs a debug message in httpchannelstate 111 since queue is full this log statement blocks while holding onto the monitor of the httpchannelstate object  4  the asynclogger tries to log the log message from 1  and as part of formatting the message  calls httpchannel tostring which calls httpchannelstate getstate which will try to acquire the monitor of httpchannelstate  unfortunately this monitor is hold onto at step 3  forever   the asynclogger is stuck now and it is the only guy who concumes messages from the queue      hope it is a but clearer now

turned out to be a generally rare circumstance that wouldn't affect a server operating "normally"  if you loaded the plugin while the server is up and you are logged in at the time the plugin is loaded  you are not added to the actors internal database  and any database insertions that require a non null actor throw an exception  logging out and back in again fixes the issue

cool  this looks  little bit easier than the  customresourcedefinitionbuilder   but it doesn't support the openapiv3schema at all  so i guess it's less expressive than before  and the  customresourcedefinitionbuilder  is gone in the newest version   does that mean that you are not going to support the open api v3 schemas at all or am i missing something     sure  i want to create crds that have the openapi schema inside and make the validation for crs working  https   kubernetes io docs tasks access kubernetes api custom resources custom resource definitions #validation   the issue is  or at least with the previous version  where  customresourcedefinitionbuilder  was still there  that when using  customresourcedefinitionbuilder withnewopenapiv3schemalike jsonschemaprops item    from some strange reason it didn't copied the  item  correctly to the  crddef spec validation schema   if the original  jsonschemaprops item  had the  item dependencies  set to null  then after calling     this works  but it doesn't seem right 
actually  i may have jumped the gun with this issue   i'm not exactly sure how i managed to fix this issue  but it actually works fine   i did recently update my android studio  maybe somehow this is related   i will post again if the issue reoccurs    sorry about that

i'm using version 1 15 0 0 from the f droid store  problems which i encounter with the system app are that it just displays a message and has no functionallity at all  i attached a screenshot of the message   or didn't i understand how it's working     screenshot_2014 12 11 10 30 56  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8419137 5391957 6139f49c 8121 11e4 96cf 49470f6b8c70 png 
yes  it works now  thanks vlad   if i click out of interpreted modules and back in  the entries are all cleared  i e  it doesn't remember them   is this expected behaviour 
this is the example  if there is only one record  the export will fine  but if there two  it error  i'm running ubuntu 14 04   test bib txt  https   github com jabref jabref files 99150 test bib txt 
basically it just felt like something was not right   i banged my head against this for a while  and it would only work if i wrap the timertask run   call in its own thread   if i wrap any larger unit  e g  the whole contents of the ontimer    it would tend to block at the first call of synchronized code   even though that should have worked   it is also possible  i suppose  that there was just a standard race condition that was causing it and didn't have anything to do with the generated code 
 krharsh17  i was able to fix it  the issue was with  constants java  file in that the colour resource was not preceded by '#' 
could it be to do with ebs file storage

well  i went through the process of making  adb  work only to find out it show immediately now too  as with #820 i am not able to reproduce it now  inbetween the phone was rebooted a few times and some stuff installed  probably some rare condition  but i was fiddling with it for quite some time  did numerous syncthing restarts etc     for the record  i had one more issue in the yesterday's state   when the battery saving was on for syncthing and i got the popup dialog in syncthing and tapped 'later'  i was unable to change system settings  disabling the relaying to be precise   it would come back on after a restart  after i turned off battery saving  i was able to change the option  i wanted to reproduce it again before reporting  but now it works

hi coda   i saw you have already made a fix for this so maybe this comes a bit late   anyway the way the problem manifests itself is simply that data does not appear in graphite  i couldn't find any errors in graphite logs so it just silently fails   thanks for the fix and thanks for a great library   andre on 15 jul 2013 23 40  "coda hale" notifications github com wrote

yeah it does seem similar to that  the code i use is part of a larger code base   the csv code is here  https   github com 51zero eel sdk blob master eel core src main scala io eels component csv csvpublisher scala#l25 l52  which then shows up in the csv tests here  https   github com 51zero eel sdk blob master eel core src test scala io eels component csv csvsourcetest scala  and also here  https   github com 51zero eel sdk blob master eel core src test scala io eels datastream datastreamtest scala#l14 l16  i've played about locally with extra logging to print out the record before my codebase fails the tests because the rows are malformed   i think it might be concurrency related because when i use the debugger i cannot re produce the error  indicating that the slowness of the debugger is giving the parsers extra time to do something   a logging example     in this one  the values array contains only a single quote mark  but should contain a row   this then happened for 4 out of the 47 tests

i am not sure what you are asking  annotations have been implemented for all the repositories  it is part of the repository interface  it is supposed to show the 'blame' data on the file page  the problem seems to be somewhere in the generation of the web page  i cannot figure out where this is handled in the  jsp files  the very first time the annotate link is poked generates the call to the individual repository interface to get the data  subsequent selections do nothing more that hide show  via html class addition removal

we're using the default forge for ftb infinity evolved  let me go see    forge 10 13 4 1614  by the looks of the debug screen  oh  right  fastcraft is installed too  i know that can cause abnormalities  totally forgot to mention that last time  my apologies   also  i wasn't overloaded  the ability itself was functioning  reflecting both damage and projectiles  but it would fail to negate damage to me  hitting me with it on would still hurt the other  and would use some of my cp and give me some overload  but i'd take the full damage of the attack  i was wearing quantum armor from industrialcraft2  which negates a good bit of damage  when hit by an electon beam with the armor on and reflection off  i'd take half a heart of damage  but if i was hit by that with the armor on and reflection active  i'd take 6 hearts of damage  completely ignoring the fact that i was wearing the armor  damage would only bypass my armor when the skill was active  if it was off the armor would function like normal  that being said  we've since removed kcauldron  and reflection is working once again  so its not a pressing issue for me anymore  but it does further incline me to believe kcauldron was the culprit

didn't help  the reason seems to be that the error output shows a ' ' instead of the unicode escape  when i replace the  asserttrue t getmessage   startswith        with  assertequals      t getmessage     to see the differences  i get   maybe  just remove the character from the  startswith    argument  comparing messages meant for humans is anyway a bit fragile  they tend to change without warning

maybe  do you know if this leads to a crash  or "only" some output in the logcat   edit  "auto upload" preview from https   cloud nextcloud com s ftzratrurqjte0r cannot be installed in parallel with fdroid dev nor with manual downloaded dev version as of apk signature problems  so an user always have to uninstall the previous dev version   so it can only conflict with the 1 4 3 and a dev version  either "official" dev or "auto upload" dev"   but this i tested as said in the original post

the cache is stored on my device  i want to drop it  and i expect it to get dropped just as every where else  where that function is available  i guess  when a cache is stored on my device and in some cases  when i view it  "drop" is available and in other cases not  just as a matter from where i started to view this cache  this would be irritating  anyway  more important for me would be a solution of #5758 instead of a fix for this issue 
 tobiaskaminsky thank you for your reply  i use swift as my owncloud primary back end storage while demo account uses database  i test it works when using database 
sorry  my mac was about to reboot itself so was trying to get the issue done as quickly as possible  so     this is an ionic project  on android  and basically if i load the app for the first time and close it immediately  what i assume is happening is it tries to download as many assets  in this case js files  as it can before i close the app  when i close it quickly  i'm assuming that it's not getting them all  next time i load the app up  i get stack trace errors in chrome   inspect basically about how it could _not_ load angular because it doesn't have those script files  they don't appear in the sources tab either    so my guess is i just haven't given it time to get all the files  when i leave the app open  about 30 seconds to a minute later it hits a breakpoint i set up in the function block where it gets events from the native side  saying it's downloaded all the files  then it works fine on each new reload    does this sound like what you'd expect to happen  i figure if it knows when it has downloaded all the files  it should also know when it hasn't  and it shouldn't look for them in local storage until it knows they exist there   granted  i'm closing the app a lot quicker than a regular user would because i'm just testing out hot code push  which otherwise works great

 yegor256 in general  yes  but it would be the best to have this behavior completely transparant for the library user

left more info in your discord about this  but shadows said   "its a crash on rft's end from a failure to properly handle the wildcard meta to convert from an oredict entry back to a "real" thing you have to get a state from the item when the item has the meta wildcard  32767  and the state doesn't handle it properly  stuff like that happens specifically he's accessing an array without clamping a value"  i don't know what any of that means but maybe you'll find it useful

it's a geniatech set top box  here's the build fingerprint 
sure  when you launch an sl model in console mode  one of the modules gets set as the default  this is the one that you can operations on directly  there is no way to control what module gets set  there must be some rule for it  maybe it's the last to be edited     after launching the console  this default module can be changed using  default  module name    this feature would add a selection box  similar to the one for entry point launch configurations  to select the default module 
hi steven   sent you details by email 
my recommendation is we fix this upstream in logstash  comments  votes  design discussion on http   jira qos ch browse logback 1097 very welcome     personally i like leaving this 'downstream' issue open  with an appropriate tag  until the problem is solved 'upstream'  that way we can keep track of 'external' work that will improve the experience of working with logstash logback encoder  and perhaps see if we can find another workaround when the problem remains unresolved upstream  but that might be a matter of personal preference    
i'm still digging  but the following logs show an example where my dropped message for partition key   2a2rog   49584571934843771141903627621785355615208059945070100482 has a larger sequence number than the checkpointed value 49584571934843771141903627621784146689388445315895394306  but it's getting dropped regardless   lining the numbers up in ascending order  49584571934843771141903627621780519911929601359651799042  a message at 14 03 31 027  49584571934843771141903627621784146689388445315895394306  final checkpoint value  49584571934843771141903627621785355615208059945070100482  the dropped message   the first log item shows when 49584571934843771141903627621780519911929601359651799042 is received  the second is a log entry i added to record the result of replace      when it returns false  the third log item shows us skipping the records and the checkpoint value at that point     this behaviour would be fine if my other instance subsequently picked up this message  but it also skips it with similar behaviour  i suspect what's happening is each instance has pulled batches of messages that overlap in their content but aren't the same  i'm still lining up the logs between instances  maybe this issue could be mitigated by trying again until "this checkpointer filterrecords recordstoprocess  " returns an empty list and we're sure we can skip the items   i realise some changes were made to limit the number of duplicates  but application developers in this kind of environment need to develop idempotent consumers   kinesis itself is 'at least once' delivery  so duplicates are always a possibility  obviously we want to limit the number of dupes as much as possible  but not at the expense of dropping messages altogether 
as a test i changed to the default cookie spec providers and had no substantive change in my one test case  changing the version solved my issue  i don't know what the more wideranging side effects of changing that will be  i think a check to see if a cookie value contains whitespace and then setting it to version 1 might help some future compatibility issues   on mar 22  2017 11 17 pm  "d  hollingsworth"  notifications github com  wrote   does this need to be hardcoded  can the cookiespec implementations not figure out when cookies need to be sent as version 0 or version 1   not sure on this  we do set the httpcomponents cookie handling policy to a custom one defined in the project by the class laxcookiespecprovider  i figured that was mostly responsible for how cookies are parsed but it might also be affecting how cookies get sent too  apache does allow for cookies to be explicitly set too rather than rely on these manager spec classes   — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  https   github com machinepublishers jbrowserdriver issues 266#issuecomment 288606025   or mute the thread  https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth art1req3rceu9_tbim_2qzdqifte4jlpks5roerhgajpzm4ml9dz

this is with a fairly sizeable modpack  but the only change was adding the api enhancer   smart moving   without   the api enhancer has no discernable performance impact   i can throw up a minimal test server tomorrow and retest with just vanilla plus smart moving plus the api enhancer and see if the same thing happens

indeed  on my windows machine  it doesn't happen   as a matter of fact  after switching the tab  my search term is always selected  and the search field never has focus   my first idea was  this could be related to the highlighting function  that marks the search term in the preview windows and the entry editor and somehow applies its highlighting also to the search field  but than it shouldn't be linux only 
i will try lavaplayer tomorrow  thanks for the hint      nonetheless i think the built in player should be free of critical bugs  even if i decide to use another player i think this bug is worth fixing   edit  tried lavaplayer today  feels very counter intuitive to me and adds whopping 10 mb to the final jar file

 shawnieboy that wiki page really needs some editing and does not have enough info     lodici i guess our opinions are different about readmes  i think a readme is something that helps you if you read it  not only somewhere to put release notes  i think stuff like the definition of in game words and shortcut keys  should definitely be there   that f1 mechanism is neat  will check it out    melvinzhang  lodici will test the memory parameter along with the existence of a "time to think bug" 
well i can't seem to even replicate my issue in the dw20 pack anymore  after a few server restarts the labels are working fine  i'll be messing around a lot with the mod still  see if i can figure out what i did

 yegor256 for the release notes  that would be good enough i guess   it's a shame that  git log   oneline  will still look bad though  but if it was fixed  it could drive the release notes  fixing up  git log  is more for blame analysis later on to work out why something changed  or _what_ _else_ changed with it

when i try to use the previous scoreboard  i get a problem with bungeecord  at the player's respawn  he is thrown from the server  i also tested version 1 11 and found the same bug there   this  plugin  https   forums spongepowered org t easy scoreboards v2 3 12746  uses a static scoreboard  but updates its values  the problem is the same as for my code

since movement from jabref 9 10 to 3 4 resulted in massive loss of information  i reverted to the former and recovered the jabref meta  groupstree for each database  while i lack any expertise  it seems that the hierarchical structure of group names could be readily preserved  for example  here is a hierarchical group tree     1     a        a  2   b    a  3    c     b  so a bibliographic entry that is associated only the first "a"  and with "c" and "b" would have the field     groups    1 a a  3 c  3 c b    if this could be done  i recommend it

i also figured out that everything   1 8 does not work  it works fine with openjdk 8    however the version check and the statement in the readme is misleading   the version check in start sh say "mycontroller org server required java version 1 7 or later"  the  readme  https   github com mycontroller org mycontroller blob development readme adoc  says "java   1 8 or later"  and it seems like the actual requirement is java 1 8 and nothing else works   my os is manjaro  but that's probably irrelevant 
not sure haven't tested those i updated from build 18 to build 22
no  every time i've opened the app since  my wishlist was still blank  i tried adding a few random cards and repeatedly opening and closing the app  but i can't seem to replicate the deletion or the sudden app crash  the crash happened during an update of the database  it that helps any

you mean  ref   not implementation  right  so the second example  yes  i just tried it again and got the following  first example  directly specified   requestbody      also note that the second one says content type       instead of  application json   this changes to  application json  after you annotate the method with   consumes mediatype application_json 
i tested 6 7 4  and it has problems transcoding the same file  the ps4 logos just spin and spin     five minutes later  i canceled playback and immediately tried playing it again  this time it started playing right away  but english subtitles were displayed   in the directory listing  the file name had changed from  xxxxxx mkv  ffmpeg   to  xxxxxx mkv  ffmpeg   sub subrip english  english     i've seen similar behavior with 7 x x  fwiw  if it fails to play the file once  subsequent attempts will inexplicably play with subtitles turned on  the problem does seem worse in 7 4 0 though  i think 
yes  this is possible    no  i am on 4 2 2
it will wait forever i tried to play around with the kill parameter already  the container itself is stopped at this time so just the feedback seems not to work

hm  i thought about it and i thing its our bot that creates the problem  i´ll try to find it and maybe i´ll be able to fix it by myself because at the fact that we uptaded the api version  our bot uses maybe old commands i guess  so thank you for your quick support

because if you want to support java 9+ too  then you need to depend on  org eclipse jetty jetty alpn java server   which brings  org eclipse jetty alpn alpn api  as a dependency  which contains that same class 😉
okay  i tried again today and huh  it is working now   no idea what went wrong before  your question came in quite late  during these 2 weeks an update must have fixed it  i see no errors in the logs which is good

yes  other symptom of the same root cause 
putting it in quotes does seem to work     it could also explain why https   github com phoenix616 resourcepacksplugins issues 16 doesn't work  so any setting changes not in quotes just sticks to the default   you don't seem to have a catch case for false without quotes

this exception was actually not from the testfx unit tests  but from another application  i am about to migrate this application to javafx 8 0 and i will check if everything works 
 serge rider   oracle
it's ok now  thank you   
i pushed the repo on my account  https   github com pixelomatic flixel demo i've also included all dependencies for your convenience   after running  just use arrow keys to move around  just for info  the left block is flxtilemap and the right one is a flxtileblock  try moving down until camera is moving  then start moving up and down  you should notice that there is a 1px gap appearing and disappearing in a pattern on left example  also  at certain points while you are not moving at all  the object usually has a small gap underneath it so it looks like it's hovering in air  it's obvious that tilemap is vibrating so that's why i think the problem is with tilemap  not other objects  the one at right side stays rock solid and i guess it should be the right behavior   here's a screenshot  the tilemap is rendered 1 pixel off from it's real position    problem  https   f cloud github com assets 811932 1236588 cfbdc728 29c4 11e3 97d6 831f169b83e8 png 
it had the milestone set  therefore i added it here without looking at the content 
i have attached the crash logs also 
1  using latest commit on branch master  2  commit f2f6bdd3 says  "full in+out  tank  reservoir  xp obelisk  soul binder"  since "in" is not working  i think it's better to mention it regardless of the reservoir common usage  3  the multiblock is formed correctly  hard to do it wrong since the visual changes when it's complete   i have tried all 3 possible setups  2x2x1  2x1x2  1x2x2  same issue on all 
 evant i'm on android studio 3 2 rc2 that just came out so using the matching   classpath 'com android tools build gradle 3 2 0 rc02 
yes those many empty folders are created in c  cache  it's just the jar file that can't be saved there
nope that doesnt work either 
for the moment i try to repoduce this bug on the actual server      but i did not know too much the technical side of minecraft      how long should i wait to be sure that chunk is discharge   like not charged because of me     juste charged by ftbutilities       my physical server have a big load in day  maybe a little lag     is possible     sorry but for the moment i don't have enought ressource for setup a new server only for testing and i can't force all player to update their minecraft  some guy's is realy dumb  _ '  
no
thank you for your answer but as i told you with interface gui is working without any problem i have already add this c   program files  java  jre1 8 0_201  lib also exist in the config file
crosstools are here  https   github com bazelbuild bazel toolchains tree master configs debian8_clang 0 3 0 bazel_0 13 0
yea  but i have stacktrace only 
i am accessing cloudfoundry through a proxy server so i am using a  proxyconfiguration  as well 
thank you    
yes  i tried to convert another file  another error occurs  "jpg2dcm  mpeg 4 avc profile_idc level_idc  66 40 not supported"   screen2  https   user images githubusercontent com 53606528 71670558 46330000 2d81 11ea 86c0 46b507e0a2cd jpg   of course  here are 2 examples of videos that cause errors  1  https   drive google com open id 1uhk kgfspn6zi6zc9uwcwv9hlesjbruu 2  https   drive google com open id 1vtcp_a6utw2dlnjtfaupng8w5enef8nj
i was checking #3162 and it references about  reshare options only in files  so maybe it is a regression because folders are showing too 
i am normally keeping files in source folder  files can be seen in web ui  in app removing them locally and re downloading helped  but there are lot of images which doesn't show up in android app and i don't want to remove and re download them it will take lots of time  can you please find a way to detect those files and automatically re download them  
i'm sorry about that  it's hard to catch this issue as it is not happen oftenly  will update you once i have this issue again

i can provide a pull request for that problem  i just have to investigate another method in this class  because "knxcoretypemapper totypeclass  " is called from two different locations   maybe it's best to log a warning message  that the given dpt is not supported  unfortunately  it is not mentioned in the documentation of the binding that only some specific dpts are working  a link in the wiki to https   github com openhab openhab blob master bundles binding org openhab binding knx src main java org openhab binding knx internal dpt knxcoretypemapper java would already be a good hint 
the db is postgresql  and we have no error when launching a dump this error only happens when we make a sparql request on the organization uri  here is the full trace  
sadly  no  i tested it only with his account   i mean this count 
i'm running mac os 10 11  sorry for the delay
oh sh t  _   i'm sorry      so  why does the logs show a default persistence unit   building jpa container entitymanagerfactory for persistence unit 'default'   why don't we have  ordersds  or  customerds  depending on the entitymanager we are working with  
i worked around it by simply entering my server’s  thankfully static  ip address 
i uploaded it from a windows client on my laptop  my server is ubuntu 
it seems to be connected to "global settings" in "sql formatting" in "preferences"  if i select the specific datasource formatting settings then for this datasource formatting works  when i deselect datasource specific box  switching back to "global settings"  formatting cease to work  a click on "global settings" link doesn't do anything  i have done several upgrades on dbeaver from previous versions  and i have played with external formatters  may be in old version i have switched to external formatter in "global settings"  now it's unavailable and that's why i can't switch to "global settings"   so to me formatter works with the connection specific settings but it doesn't work with "global settings" and i can't modify "global settings" 
i have now resetted the preferences and restarted jabref afterwards  then i created a new   biblatex   library with a new "misc" entry type  the "editor" field still does not show up   i have then closed jabref once again and removed the whole settings directory located in     java  userprefs org jabref  and subsequently started jabref  i created a new   biblatex   library with a new "misc" entry type  no "editor" field appeared   for both aforementioned cases  jabref shows the following     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3658393 72987285 5ec79080 3dea 11ea 827c 8b29395372d4 png     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3658393 72987309 6b4be900 3dea 11ea 9c30 02a133c2838b png     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3658393 72987372 8dde0200 3dea 11ea 9b84 13c5ed4f6b4f png   then i created a new   bibtex   library with a new "book" entry type  no "editor" field could be found either  assuming there should be one  as stated in the bibtex documentation  attached below    jabref shows the following     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3658393 72987174 21630300 3dea 11ea 9e05 5c34093b716b png     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3658393 72987466 bf56cd80 3dea 11ea 9ad6 b7c688e6d329 png     bibtex   http   mirror kumi systems ctan biblio bibtex base btxdoc pdf  http   mirror kumi systems ctan biblio bibtex base btxdoc pdf   states for entry type "book     "book"    a book with an explicit publisher    required fields  author or   editor    title  publisher  year    optional fields  volume or number  series  address  edition  month  note

hi michail   i am facing this on the code base of large project  i've  prepared the simplified version of the classes  https   gist github com orange buffalo 327073f3b238643fcd42   jaxb and mapping annotations removed   cpu profiling from ticket's description was taken during  addressimpl  analysis   i hope this will be enough to check the issue  if not  apparently it means that the reason of performance degradation is the combination of huge source code base and annotation processing  we are using lombok very intensively    
works
 monsieurtanuki not able to test #849 right now  but the scroll bug occured to me already some time back on several occasions  just now was able to finally track it down  latest use of snapshot a few days ago  above happens without scroll limits set and as far as i can see on any zoom level  though it's rare  you get to the 3x3 grid border on high zoom levels at all   basically it means that you are always imprisoned in this 3x3 map grid illustrated above with only the center middle map working as expected  as soon as you zoom and have been in an edge map  you get to the center middle map again

not sure  i'll try preparing a simple application in a separate project   it seems that the copying error is thrown each time the text area has larger height than the total text width and you try to select with with your cursor  starting from the bottom  i don't think you need any specific data set to reproduce this  just make sure it's multiline

i've confirmed that we do have a full text index in the graph that is presenting the problem while none of the other graphs have a full text index and are not failing in the same way
 andersekdahl well  it _should_ call eslint without specifying   eslintrc  since then eslint chooses the proper file itself  in a project one can have multiple   eslintrc  files for different parts of the code

 yegor256 it seems that using an isolated repository for the integration tests  as far as i understand  this is the case  is the main concept of maven invoker plugin  but i see here an option to set  localrepositorypath  outside of the project build directory  e g     in this case  maven  downloads  actually copies from the local repository  all the artifacts only once and reuse this new isolated repository in future even after  mvn clean

the general question here is  shouldn't dataview support primitive type arrays  i can query for a list byte  so that would probably be the correct translation  but this is a horribly inefficient way to store this data  also  if i translate a list byte  to nbt  i will get a nbttaglist containing nbttagbytes

they were wearing various armor pieces from twilight forest  the thing is that they didn’t even turn red and make the noise as if they got hit  they just stood there with red potion particle effects  meaning the bleed did apply  and their armor rapidly lost durability  since it works on mobs  the correct potion effect is being applied  i also tested it on another player wearing iron  diamond  and darksteel from enderio  same thing happened

thanks for proposing this solution  since i'm already preparing the release  to simplify the workflow i can apply your suggested change myself    but perhaps it is a non final workaround in that these scripts are not really tests  so i can imagine someone moving them back some day and causing another maven deployment failure  i'll add some comments into the scripts themselves to explain why they're located where they are

 serge rider oracle does indeed have auto generated columns  as of 12c    see  https   oracle base com articles 12c identity columns in oracle 12cr1  also  see my ddl above   notice the id column is  number generated as identity   when i run that ddl  and then use dbeaver to try to re generate the ddl  it generates the following   i believe dbeaver should always skip columns that are marked as  generated always     or maybe just  generated

here ya go  edit  suspecting it's an issue with minecraft itself  i just did 3 hours of testing  mcedit  worldedit  mod and server plugin  won't save the schematic properl    floor zip  https   github com lunatrius schematica files 1348266 floor zip 
correct  too many active segments  issue is unrelated 
yes it appears with duplicated content 
 stefanomorson i was able to reproduce it following the steps described above   try this   0  browser should be full sized before test   1  go to child accounts  select one of them and go to _  settings  _ tab 2  select _  role service  _ and verticlly resize bottom window  the _  settings  _ window  and shrink  horizontally resize  the whole browser window  _  now all the unnecessary sliders should appear   _
meaning that it behaves like it is waiting for me to advance past a breakpoint  but there is no ui for me to do so   example  i start up the app  when there are breakpoints  and the first output for the app is   listening for transport dt_socket at address  8000  once i connect the debugger  codenvy switches the perspective to show my breakpoints  etc  but nothing more happens  it doesn't reach my breakpoint  if i try and send a curl command to my application in another terminal window  the command hangs   then  if i click "run    end debug session"  then  the rest of the startup output for my application is displayed  and my command on the other terminal window completes   another example with this same setup is  while the debugger is connected  i run a kill  3 in another terminal window and the output is not shown in my app  however  once i do "run    end debug session"  i subsequently see all the thread dump output to my app   i will get you a screenshot shortly

this is a segment from logcat last week  our app is com bynd looper   which doesn't give a lot of info yet   i'll try to get a longer segment and some stats on how long it takes etc  note that it's excessive cpu use  not battery use   one thing is that it could be that our app does quite a bit of custom processing which is done in the activity  not the navigation service  although we need that  we might need to look into pushing that into a second service  which would also need to be a foreground service  so will require a second icon in the status bar  which is mildly annoying

deadly world generates a lot more spawners that do a bunch of things  one of them  for instance  will shot tons of arrows all around the place  and another one has got a "ghost zombie" standing on it  when you get near enough  the zombie "comes alive" and gets a primed tnt head to blow you up  that's how i died the second time ç_ç it also adds a crapton of silverfish nests everywhere  and that's how i died the first time   the pro to all this is that you get a reward  usually there's an interesting block in every silverfish nest and a chest under every spawner  maybe i lost it in the darkness of the cavern  or in an adiacent cavern hidden by a wall  i'll test this further  although i'd rather not die  lol

thank you for giving me a chance to explain this more clearly  i'm genuinely bad at communicating with people   what i was really trying to say is  i strongly believe flyway should never ever touch the session state  _nor should migrations_  nor should other application code  session state should be considered all set up and read only once the application obtains some jdbc connection instance from a datasource    i actually don't want flyway to compensate for any problems caused by altered session state   current_schema  just being a subset of that state   if i'm not mistaken  flyway setting  current_schema  was introduced for #1108  i disagree with its author about the part where flyway should be responsible for reversing a session state change it didn't make   if some migration really needs to temporarily alter session state because there's no equivalent to postgres'  set local   it should do so in a try   finally block   those documentation "ideas" otoh are probably just me trying to make the other option   flyway taking responsibility for session state  look bad  sorry about that 
i didn't disable anything from evilcraft   i have a mod that lets you change the vanilla ender chest into a color coded ender chest  but it changes nothing of the recipe  and is done by shift right clicking with an item on the chest   i think i have no mod  which changes potions  but i'm not 100  sure of that

yes  i lose it   to make it clearer  a z sorting is the default  but for me  it realizes in this strange "clustered" ordering i described in #2303  when i explicitly set a z ascending sorting  it becomes somewhat better  the folders in the folder become truly alphabetically ordered  and the files take up an order that resembles an alphabetical one more  but there is still a degree of this quirky clustering  if i leave the folder and come back to it  it reverts to the first version of the "clustered" ordering 
this commit is the one that i believe fixes the pendingtrace cleanup  https   github com datadog dd trace java commit e51708023437b168b42e8592e4c12680016126b4#diff 28ebab7e0711a0924cd60c0e28ab0f06r253   if i've read and understood the code correctly  prior to this there were two span cleaners  one that was a static member of the pendingtraces class and another that was instanced in with the start of the scheduled thread  as pendingtraces were created  they were getting pushed into the class static member but  since that wasn't the one running in the thread  the traces were never getting cleaned up    i see that it's built up using weakreferences  i can't explain why it's holding the memory or how exactly the jvm decides to clean those up  what we've found in practice is that we have a large number of pendingtraces on some of our production servers and it's not getting cleaned up even when forcing a gc via visualvm  on a smaller scale  i see the same thing with the steps to reproduce i described before  i see the pendingtrace in visualvm and forcing a gc run doesn't seem to clean it up    ddd integration jax rs client enabled false  i'm looking at switching to httpurlconnection instead of disabling this  there's other advantages for us to make this switch as well

is there any way to test this without building a new release of dialogos  if i just do "gradlew run"  there is no german recognizer model  right 
your test needs an assert that tries to reference the value you just captured  which will cause the nullpointerexception

i can see people wanting both behaviors but my instinct is to use the current value for the  cyclecount  if the parameter is omitted   after all  what is the point of using  editstream  to set the values if you just have to repeat the values again when you call  playstream  
because this has been a recent change in this release  what we are going to do in this version is allow users write   password without raising an exception  however  if that's the case we will print a warning message saying that they should not do it and that it will be forbidden in future releases   regarding adding   password automatically to the other command lines  that will be probably added in a future release

 srkukarni some schedulers might support different features than others w r t  the ability to support profiling  heap thread dumping  etc  ideally they would all support these things but we don't require that they all do currently   that's a separate issue though than what i was referring to  i want to be able to step through code in a debugger in my ide  which means being able to insert jvm args like   agentlib jdwp transport dt_socket server y suspend y address 5005  into the java command for example   here's how i've manually hacked into the  heron_executor py   _get_java_instance_cmd  method  in my working branch  to make a java instance start with these args  https   github com twitter heron pull 1807 files#diff 2a669e084143b86b5766a49245f8e357  being able to pass an argument or probably to set an environment variable when submitting a topology to have this effect would be really helpful when developing debugging in localmode

that's the example i'm trying to run  don't you have any integration tests in your project  why don't you put examples as integration tests into it and make sure they actually work  i couldn't find anything meaningful that's actually working regarding javacpp yet  you can run your github project in the travis integration test system for free simply by putting a one line  travis yml file at the top of your github project and activating the project on the travis service  see https   github com jjybdx4il example maven project setups

 krzysztofjozefowicz thanks for the quick reply  i'm using the zoom option because i sometimes give demo's  the zoom option is a very powerfull help  it would very helpfull if at least in source this is working 
hm  one could hack it even more by only considering begin end when found as whole words surrounded by whitespace equivalent   but i think  it might be worth biting the bullet and use some simple parser  generated with antlr or something  
 hhclam apologies  should have added that before   repro requires setting up a cache server  and then introducing an error in a c++ file  then attempting to build   callstack here 
the dialog does appear and is disposed  the issue occurs on the second or third dialog created by the test class  add a breakpoint and the issue goes away  add the code above in onteardown and it seems to go away too   so it would appear to be a timing issue  i'm guessing something uses a class finaliser in swing   so what we expect to be disposed may not be yet     maybe adding the second cleanup causes it to be synchronised   it's very odd and is repeatable on both linux and windows 8 1  so the issue is in the java rather than the native libraries 
yes  we'll fix this after fosdem in the next release  whatever version that is  sorry about the breakage  we didn't have test coverage for from source bootstrapping on windows

yes  it works perfectly without enum  it is not about class path  i have all classes  listenermethod is just another annotation   it's about synthetic methods in enum  this class doesn't compile at all  i would like to get listenermethod   method   default     and string remover   default ""  but without enum  because mistakes inside enum  can spoon help me with it  or he just says illegalargument and that's all  
yes i checked the remember me box  if i'd not select  the package manager does not open at all       this is a second serious issue

yes  i can access the web ui through my phone  i can even access qbittorrent through your app but only if i specify the local ip address of my server through the standard settings  not the advanced settings   as you can see i have gotten your app working     working app  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4989354 18768401 35651e0e 8125 11e6 9d53 168e0ee5b377 png   the problem i have is i keep having to change the ip address setting here between my external internet ip address when i am not at home  and my local ip address when i am at home     settings  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4989354 18768427 5864551e 8125 11e6 882a 008f11a34e32 png   what i would like is for the app to correctly use the advanced settings i have specified here so that when i am connected via my wifi network it uses the local ip address i have specified     advanced settings  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 4989354 18768432 5e582900 8125 11e6 8b43 fda3d7abd6b3 png   currently v4 4 0 of qbittorrent controller pro ignores the advanced settings for a local ip address  🙁

nodes should be self contained   lustre does not have a concept of "global" variables   in this case  the node foo   refers to a variable outside of its scope   when we translate into jkind  this triggers an error because the node foo   is translated as a separate node from the "main" node that contains the definitions for system a and system implementation a impl 
no  it doesn't  middle layer is volley with explicit zero numbers of retries set for each request  top application layer doesn't do retries as well without user's consent  i'm still investigating issue   for now i can only stable reproduce the retry in a "controlled environment" with mocked server  where i see fall backs to sslv3 for second call invocation  the behavior makes sense from one point of view   it's reasonable to try another transport if first one fails  but not in case when the server is actually busy processing first request and the call changes a state on backend  i e  it's not a get request  
vampirisim's entity "vampire hunter" is attacking ancientwarfare2's npcs  e g  npc workers farmers    as far as i can tell the responsible ai task is added by aw2 here  https   github com p3pp3rf1y ancientwarfare2 blob 6daddb2b1d5da793ff5c3c47bb909e16d6294e05 src main java net shadowmage ancientwarfare npc event eventhandler java#l103  however  the actual hostile target task only selects vampire players and it does not make much sense for them to attack npcs

it might be my client  which makes no sense since i can spawn giants and my client won't crash and my computer is quite strong  i will reinstall the jar 
another possibility might be to permanently show a "notes pane" on the right side of the screen  as seen in e g  todolist application   on this side pane the notes of the currently selected item would be displayed   but as a quick solution a wraplenght of maybe 80 characters would do the job nicely  if the wrap would occur between words and not characters 
yes  it works again  thanks 
maybe we should remove the timeout  increasing the timeout just sets the amount of data threshold higher  it doesn't solve the problem   ideally  we would remove the timeout and interrogate es to find out what is going on  if just synchronising  then leave it alone  if failure  kill it

i thought about the charging station being already taken so i made sure it was not the case  the farming drones are two  and they have two stations  each one is close to its assigned drone  and both drones are in range for both stations if one of them fails     the drone placing block was alone and i was nearby so i can confirm the station was full  empty and not blocked in any way    as for the digging drones  they were two for a single station  it was a short work sequence  but i was nearby as well and neither of them even tried flying back to the station  as stated above it's hard to replicate  it definitely doesn't happen in a regular way  so far i noticed it once a day  though i'll do more tries with my block placing drone  i remove it with the pneumatic wrench when he runs out of blocks to place as i'm short on blocks  
 vsiva sure  i think this is the relevant bits of the log 
my only idea is looking at the way it is done when the project get's executed locals    there has to be some difference in determining the classpath and jars getting loaded during execution

the files are mac icon files from a born digital collection that we're processing   apparently  it's  fairly common  http   superuser com a 298798  for their file names to end with  r although from the sample we're looking at  it's not consistent  since it's a problem with the file name and not the content  i've been creating test files through bash   touch "icon m" 
sure thing  let me test it
the code sample includes comments for what output i get  i would maybe expect both system out println datastore find testentityb class  "entitya"  a  get      and system out println datastore find testentityb class  "entitya"  a id  get      to return the correct result  rather than no results and the correct results with a warning  respectively

hi  thanks a lot for responding to my issue  i really appreciate this  the issue does not surround around the db object not returned  but the issue surrounds when the same db object is returned to 2 threads at same time  then one thread errors out when trying to do the db operations  i will try to modify your junit test case and send you a sample program or so  which you can test it out  fyi  i am using your spring data project from orient db with spring boot and it submits the requests to rest controller and rest controller in turn uses the repository from spring data with shared connection pool to do the updates  this is the time when same db connection object is returned to both threads it errors out as the last thread which gets the object works fine  but earlier threads error out  please hold on for a week or so and i will build a sample project and send to you for testing purpose using orient db spring data module  thanks  likesh

of course these indexes can be created manually  but having  index and supporting it for raw types and not for collections is not really fair  as the secondary index performance issue is there for both collection and raw types  i can do it manually  but i was relying on achilles generated ddl for validating my schema integrity  and in case there is a need for explicitly making the developer choose  there could be a configuration parameter where indexes for collections can be enabled  disabled by default  along side indexes for raw types

missed this first line when i quoted it  19 11 21 20 52 54 4 fatal nzbdroneerrorpipeline request failed   just confirmed   arr will error before or after hydra db deletion   the download history in hydra seems to work for some time before internal server error  if i manually trigger  arr to download something  it will show correctly in hydra  i'm not sure at what point it locks up 
 zfi            matzelectronics    the problem is a bit more serious  when i correct and save the project   exit to the home page and my projects and reopen the program   the error  time corrected from seconds to milliseconds  has returned and is present in the newly opened code
only a few where showing though there should have been more  there were some edge errors in log  so i'm pretty sure there was some corruption and something got stuck in a loop over it  i ended up rebuilding my db so i don't have access to that data anymore   i'll try these queries again on non corrupt data and see if i still have problems 
ok great   was just about to upload the build log  but i guess not necessary now 
dunno  it finally finished  i will be doing another big upload and i will find out 
i reached out to the original developer when creating the issue but have yet to hear back  i will try to incorporate his changes and test it out if i don't hear anything  on apr 14  2012 12 14 pm  "timo reimann"   reply reply github com  wrote 
below is an example that reproduces the problem  when calculating a mincut with s  1 and t  2  edge and vertex sets    1   2  0  1      1 0    0  2     1 1    1  2    0 1    1 0    directed edges with weights  1 0 1 0 0  2 0 9999999999999999  1 1 1 0 1  2 1 66498 0 1 0 66498 1 0 0 66498  my input graphs almost certainly will have a cycle  so i need to use weighted directed graphs   so that might be the problem as stated here https   jgrapht org javadoc org jgrapht alg flow pushrelabelmfimpl html
 cvance sorry  it is all info  that i received  i can't reproduce it  it occurred only one time only on that device 
yes  can handle that in python  will make sure  "clazz"  comes first 
yes i see there are no rules to ignore all files  this is my work project so i can't share it  this  gitignore file wasn't changed for a while  but today i updated plugin and problem happend  restarted phpstorm 2 times and had to disable plugin becuase of this issue 
now i've got the same issue in parser  shall i write another bug 
in the benchmark repo  run    mvn clean install  dbuild native image  pl ' testingframework'   run the insurance service      insurance service target insurance service 1 0 0 alpha1 snapshot runner   you don't need a db running  it doesn't get that far

 jamessmartcell had a similar problem in ios and it was fixed by dropping the 0x  which caused the fail import on ios   i think the problem might be the opposite on android
yes  please

yes  some plugins utilize scoreboard teams 
no  i am temporary using edittext instead of materialedittext exactly because of this problem  with edittext everything is ok 
i know that quoting the path is possible  this fix here is just an alternative to it i wanted to try   in the end i don’t like both of them  both solutions are considerably worse than how this command was implemented in mc 1 12 2  i feel that we have to redesign this completely  especially to get back the autocompletion  i am thinking about removing the “wol file” and “wol shared file” commands and instead making a new command  something like “wol editor” or “wol browser open”  that just opens the browser showing some kind of file chooser or some text field with autocompletion implemented with java script  this text field could also be added to every editor page to make it easier to open another file  “move” and “delete” could be implemented as buttons

yes  we have another issue for that #135

 jexp i didn't catch it before  but you are right   running the first explain is just as slow as actually running the query  and adding  cypher planner rule  makes it fast   i realize these are pretty atypical queries   i noticed the issue and came up w  them while writing benchmarks to evaluate neo4j as the database for a graphql schema defined server framework 
hi    thank you for responding   looking forward to getting this resolved    i'm assuming i should update with all the changes since 1 0 0 since graphmldemo references componentnameprovider and componentattributeprovider  not present in 1 0 0  
i can see it in the steps on the left  but this is the step that is not possible to jump too  so no i can't see this step 
i could not fully confirm one way or the other  but cursory review showed only the clicked item  whether or not the check mark changed  was the only thing changed in the order book 
actually sorry  i had made a mistake on ios it does indeed work there   but still on android i'm not getting the new assets  building for android 2 2 the same issue when running on 2 2 and 4 something   i can confirm that it executes these lines in storagemanager java when i increase the version number     but that doesn't result in the new assets   maybe i will have to upgrade to v3  but it will be a lot of work and i think the code here is similar

matthijskooijman   thank you for such a quick reply   after searching for hours  ha  i was just able to use the find tool in the 'folders' section of the operating sys to locate the preference txt and adjust the height to 400px     the arduino team might consider adding the suggestion to the intro that lists the various locations for the file  preferences txt  for windows  mac   linux  because it saves a lot of time to search the pi directory in the find files section 
the actual output looks like this     i am not sure why there has to be the exception stack trace at all  for this specific case

 findepi  it is the same for unpartitioned table    there is no  connectortablelayout#getnodepartitioning  so i'm a bit confused   actualproperties#getnodepartitioning  is not empty  and  connectortablelayout#gettablepartitioning  is not empty either  hope i'm looking at the right method   looks like the remote exchange is added here  https   github com prestodb presto blob 7dfbe1be3c61455047827335c5dadd94125e0c48 presto main src main java com facebook presto sql planner optimizations addexchanges java#l309 l311    after we checked  isstreampartitionedon   yet in  visitaggregation    https   github com prestodb presto blob 7dfbe1be3c61455047827335c5dadd94125e0c48 presto main src main java com facebook presto sql planner optimizations addexchanges java#l232  i do see that we also checked  isnodepartitionedon    in addition to  isstreampartitionon      for window function  if  partition by  columns include columns the node is partitioned on  i think a local exchange should suffice

i was looking into and can propose two solution  if you like any of them please let me know i will write the code  unit tests and create pull request    the fix could be implemented in   org mockito internal creation cglibclassimposterizer   class     my first suggestion is to try again class creation in catch block using different class loader    when creation of requested class fails  code could try again using class loader of the requested type  so something like     i investigated other possibility  searchingclassloader   but unfortunately i don't see solution using it  the problem is creation of searchingclassloader already causes the access issues and defineclass is final in java    if it wouldn't we could pass the call to parent and everything would be working   to be fair i think the proper solution should be implemented in cglib library   they should not use reflection to hack the defineclass in my opinion they should ask for class creation interface  where we could simply proxy our call to different class loaders  defineclass is protected     but i guess noone expended those can of issues at the point of library creation      what do you think about it  is any of my solution viable  or would you like me to try something else

i guess the owner of one of the downstream projects would have to decide that they wanted the fix  and then request it  at which point we could think about helping them    
it seems that there's been a redirect in place at rcsb that did    so it looks like biojava wasn't handling url redirects correctly for this case  that'd be another fix we need to correct the caching problems

 philwebb  this is for actuator endpoints  please find sample code here https   github com jagmohansharma springboot2issues  i added custom content negotiation configuration but disabled it  now it is a plain spring boot configured and have set  spring mvc contentnegotiation favor path extension true  with spring boot 2 0 1  so here test  contentnegotiationtest  is getting failed where i am executing info endpoint   this works fine if we use spring boot 2 0 0 or set  spring mvc contentnegotiation favor path extension false  with 2 0 1 itself 
i think the easiest path would be to ensure that we use a random temporal file by getting one with  files createtempfile     i'd try that before trying more complicated stuff   
i don't see the behavior on the demo and i don't see it in previous versions of glowroot   after some additional testing i have to assume the problem is on my side    we use an apache webserver to proxy in https connections to localhost and if i bypass that it works as it should  hard to see how a proxy setup would be responsible for this kind of issue but that's what it looks like 
 homersimpsons yeah  this is exactly how i plan to implement it  right now the app will only scroll down if you're at the very bottom message  but this doesn't always work   i plan to add a threshold to this  like 10 as you suggested  and add an indication that new messages were received if you're scrolled up too high  any thoughts on scrolling down no matter what  if a message was sent instead of received  or do you think they should both behave the same way 
now it's fine
as i said in bug description  just use an command for example that spawns a panda at your location  ask for the type of the latest spawned entity and print it in a message  it should return something like 'panda'  but it just returns nothing  also when you spawn a cat at your location and ask for the type of latest spawned entity  it should return 'cat'   but it returns 'damageable mob'    sorry that i cannot send a code snippet  i am on my mobile  here's an example but without tabs    command  test  trigger  spawn a cat at player set  v  to type of latest spawned entity message "  v  "   that same thing for a panda and see what it returns  i think  you dont really need "type of" but   test it on your own  for me in both ways for panda the message returns just nothing and following code under it isnt gonna to be executed as i found out  and for the cat the message returns 'damageable mob'
it does  but even when i do a 10 x 10 to do a single tree the problem remains  and that was between 2 different drones  but it was after the first drone tried with the big area  as in 10 mins apart  maybe the problem persists

hi dennis  good hint  here are the values     however  i am using your official plain docker image without any modification  so this is _wrong_ out of the box  in my opinion this would have to be adjusted by the  graylog ctl reconfigure    script 
will do  btw  isn't the french support mail you answered about the same topic maybe 
i have sent in crash reports when it has allowed me  often kills everything  so no opportunity  i'll see what i can find next time it crashes 
unzipping here is just for reproducing this error  i propose to use any post install xq or pre install xq  it doesnt matter  you just have to include a line like stated in the test  my question is not about how to do it  but why i can not do it in this way  why sm passwd throws an error when used during autodeploy

i was testing the teleport turret and used nei to obtain a turret base and a teleport turret  i placed the teleport turret on the bottom and would get the error  if i took that same turret and placed it on the top  it would not error out  i was hoping the teleport turret would teleport the mobs to under itself when in the bottom position  i was hoping to use it in a mob farm  however i found the turret would still bring them in above itself  this would cause them to get suffocation damage  but it is not what i was hoping for 
it was set to false   ill try the new build now

hi  cbellone   i've checked and it seems that now the vat mechanism does not fail  so the user can continue asking for their ticket while paying and requesting the invoice    the only problem that i've seen is that what will happen if the lambda does not return proper information  for example  i've tried with an existing company with a confirmed valid vat number  and the result we received it is not correct  because it is retrieved an empty address         here you can see an screenshot     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 2370634 36175156 d4aee54c 110e 11e8 9ee8 413319177fd4 png   of course the invoice created does not include info about the company  so from the legal point of view it is not correct     do you think it make more sense to have the field of the retrieved information enabled just in case if the user wants to change some data received from the lambda function   best 
it had something to do with trying to start successive scripts  either after the last script run threw an error or some other trigger

personally  i'd consider this a p1 or higher  as it turns bazel's tagline into  "  correct      reproducible    fast builds for everyone"   or  alternatively  "  fast  "  as incremental builds cannot be used  and this unsafety isn't documented   however  i don't know how prevalent  includes  usage is   in our builds  it's used extensively  not only for third party builds  but to prevent extremely long include paths in our own code

even with no custom authenticationmanager  still seeing the same behavior of a nulleventpublisher and no events being published through   a minimal spring boot starter web + spring boot starter actuator + spring boot starter security example with no custom globalauthenticationconfigureradapter at all shows the issue off as you don't see badcredentials audit events when logging in with known bad credentials  as soon as you stick a custom auth in and auth authenticationeventpublisher you get the appropriate events being published 
probably not before the release

umm well it kinda fixed it the first round   ish  the player came back with no inventory  and then waits   when the game ends the players ingame inventory get set properly but the one that left + came back was then put into creative mode  when the next game starts all players keep their inventory as well as get gm 1 for the game  when the game ends  all players lose their inventory  hope this helps

it is the default  to match all    must match all of the 2 configured stream rule s     testing one message that was wrongly routed in this streams says that "it will not be routed to this stream" and that only the facility rule matches  if it makes any difference  those messages were also routed in another stream based on the source  and this is correct

 nezihyigitbasi i'm pretty sure that  c  does not precede  À   at least for a decent number of languages  if i'm not mistaken  the "naive" sorting will always put special characters after the "normal" ones due to the order on the utf 8 table  to have proper ordering of text  you need to use a collator    i don't necessarily agree that the min max statistics should have the correct alphabetic ordering  but if more writers have the same default behaviour as the spark one  presto should at least have an option to deal with it  i'll check if hive also generates that same statistics for my data and i'll report back  thanks for the quick answers

we have encountered the same problem in a project before  and finally solved it like this    if  e instanceof sockettimeoutexception               okhttp getinstance   okhttpclient dispatcher   cancelall                okhttp getinstance   okhttpclient connectionpool   evictall            but there is a downside to this  the app must fail once and the next visit will succeed   based on the results of our current tests  this may be a bug in the okhttp connection pool module  which is very easy to appear on a particular machine  the step is to open the application  wait a few minutes  and then trigger the event to access the network  to be sure  the network on the machine is normal at this time  other applications can access the network normally  and a new okhttpclient can be created in the current application to access the network

 leonard84 thanks for the explanation  that's what i thought as well  and i strongly agree with this should be mentioned somewhere in the documentation  also the exception here should be clearer in reflecting what the real problem is  right now saying  is very misleading
i've updated the full back trace   i originally managed to remove some of the helpful parts of the exception   i'm also struggling to build the 8 1 2 docker client source code on windows java 8   the compresseddirectorytest testfilewithignore test fails saying "java nio file invalidpathexception  illegal char     at index 10   subdir3    keep"   i apologise as i appreciate that isn't very helpful   i'm running my development code using the 8 1 2 jar binary against a remote azure  docker for azure  hosted docker host   using "docker service ls" does appear to work fine     my guess from the exception is that the docker client doesn't deserialize the driver section properly   using the docker engine api directly this looks to be typically    my fix was to make driver java look more like mount java which seemed to fix the issue i was seeing

thanks for your answers   i've tried to build 1 6 1 from sources without success  problems with my competence on ant  but i've remarked that from 1 6 to head  sole maven plugin and doc have changed not the jflex jar lib   as a result  i give you all the materials i can   here is a simple test snippet  the input tested is a valid ada program from acats

actually  i changed the namespace to 'test' manually to paste it here  sorry   
of course  here they are      img width "1415" alt "conf" src "https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 14962879 22243999 18beaf70 e22a 11e6 98a6 2884efd000a8 png" 
here is my log from the issue    log txt  https   github com ripmeapp ripme files 1713730 log txt 
yes  when i tried    dtools_jar_location "tools jar"  the  jar was on the root so that was the correct path   if i try to run the plugin without tools jar manual injection 
i will try that later then  currently at school 
hi  i think it might have been a problem on my end    i ended up deleting and recreating the  pgd  works great so far  but i'll reopen if i run into problems again 
yes to 1 0 4b  and yes i do have the logs   i unfortunately don't know exactly when the problem happened  because i didn't notice the problem at first  so my apologies for that   here is a  2000 line gist of the logs  from startup until a time where i know the problem should have already happened by  https   gist github com gth828r 1ddb13ed89ba57de8015  i suspect the problem occurred toward the latter half of the logs   i am working within the "samevlan" slice  and the "diffvlan" slice intentionally doesn't have a controller for the duration of this test   here is my fsfw config file as well  in case it is useful  https   gist github com gth828r 126827c92cd3c34a2bc0  this was one stress test against the various tests against fsfw in a series of them   if you want to know more about the steps leading up to this test  i can describe it   fyi  i have not been able to reproduce this again  but i'll be trying many times  and i'll report back if i see it again  hopefully with a more narrow log snippet  
setting  use scoreboards  false  allows the health to be shown over the players' heads  so definitely a help to the healers   it's a trade off though  since many players love to see that scoreboard on the side showing waves and kills   maybe eventually showing both could be filed under "feature requests"    love the plugin  in the mob fighting genre  yours is the best 
please find attached sample test sh in the test zip   i put 2 symlinks   one is  src test branch src and another is  src test branch mtx src   when i index and deploy  both are listed in the directory list in the browser but i can not see the file contents   it says 'failed to get xref file'   under  data xref  there is no entries for these 2 directories    test zip  https   github com oracle opengrok files 2700028 test zip

thanks for looking into this  adamretter  i've given it a try with https   github com exist db exist pull 1864  which does indeed reduce the amount of information in the logs  but does not fix the problem     perhaps i hadn't stated clearly enough in my original report that the problem isn't just the logging  but the fact that retrieval of the binary files with  http send request    actually fails with the same error message   after your commit  behaviour remains the same  in exide  a first call to  http send request  http request href "http   localhost 8080 exist apps dashboard resources

i'll check that next time it happens but if it isn't a bug with chromecast discovery then why would a chromecast have both services one minute and only dial a minute later  and why would two phones on the same network get different services at the same time  and why would calling stop   start   on the discovery manager make this happen every time

thank you for investing your time into this ivan  my fault totally  i didn't read the instructions of how to use the plugin  it turned out that i didn't have java installed on my computer  after installing java everything seem to work great 
now it's working fine  thanks for fixing it   still  when building the client  the following trace appeared    at the first glance  it doesn't seem to affect the running project though 
interestingly  mvn dependency tree  on linux does not show  com sun jna native     this contains  net java dev jna   not  com sun jna    this is explained in https   stackoverflow com questions 26175771 difference between com sun jna and net java dev jna

dear ron  1  same windows 7 build as you 2  i'm actually using the french  canada  keyboard  i see the same expected behavior as you  press twice to have the "hat" accent in french  in any other application  but rstudio ide    actually  i found that the bug is happening more cleanly when i switched from english to french keyboard   1  using windows language bar  i've mapped the sequence "ctrl + 1" to get english keyboard  and "ctrl + 2" to get french  canada  keyboard  quick way to change between language when programming   2  the freeze happened systematically when i pressed the "hat" key after switching from english to french keyboard using the ctrl keys  3  if i switched between keyboards using the mouse  there is no freeze when typing the hat key   i've downgraded to rstudio 1 1 463 and everything working as expected  there is no interference between switching keyboard using ctrl keys and the hat key   thanks for your help   hans
1  yes and no  the form on my page will always crash  but at different spots  2  pixel  1st gen  8 0  3  i haven't tried reproducing it in another app yet   it seems like the issue is coming from the auto fill service added in android 8 0  when auto fill is turned on the app will crash  when auto fill is turned off i can complete the form with no issue  as mentioned previously it seems like it only happens with the 8 0 auto fill  so something in the newer versions of android is probably fixed with it   is there anyway to disable the auto fill service in a cordova app  or is this issue not related   cant be fixed via cordova   related   https   stackoverflow com questions 45731372 disabling android o auto fill service for an application 46698028

yes  i think so  as its flaky and we will  hopefully  build only a few times on 1 4 x  master alone is ok 
sure  i save list position like this    override     public void onscroll abslistview view  int firstvisibleitem  int visibleitemcount  int totalitemcount            this firstvisible   firstvisibleitem          override     public void onsaveinstancestate bundle outstate            super onsaveinstancestate outstate           outstate putint key_list_position  firstvisible            override     public void onactivitycreated bundle savedinstancestate            super onactivitycreated savedinstancestate           getlistview   setonscrolllistener this           if  savedinstancestate    null                firstvisible   savedinstancestate getint key_list_position                     private void renewlistposition             getlistview   setselection firstvisible        
it's more that while i'm scrolling  the popup opens and prevents me from scrolling more  so i have to wiggle the mouse to continue scrolling for another second before the popup reappears  and prevents me from scrolling again  
of course i killed the apps   
 nimrodda thank you for the quick response   it works fine with swiping the pages   in fact i've also observed that it doesn't notify about all of the subpages when you go back with back button    onstepchanged    is called for the  5  element even if you press back button 4 times and finally you are on the  2  element  after a delay and pressing back button once again  it logs  1  
 alexejk i don't know what you mean exactly with refresh  but if i synchronize the project  the problem remains
ok  i will try 5 14  because there is endless external file modification notification after 5 11  i have to use 5 10 
the all jar as in the one that has them all in one 
definitely the latter   i had a 'wound slaver' with 28 burn who just wasn't taking damage or having it tick down
the snapshot fixed the issue  thank you

you didn't understand me correctly in the point 2  i was thinking about yokes and sidesticks in the cockpit of the aircraft  but i was not thinking about yokes for controlling the aircraft  😊  as about #4 of my list  the best way to reailse this is to move separate engines' controls to the u panel  and when the user is using the keyboard to manage throttles  he manages all the engines' power in one time as usual     also i would like to suggest point 5    a feature for adding instruments with different sizes  for example  modern aircraft have large screens as instruments  so it will be great to have an abitity to add thicc screens to the cockpit 😏

 furmigahumana that could be that 
i am running the server of direwolf20 1 10 pack version 1 2 2  and then i added mekanism myself  built from latest master as of a couple weeks ago   so it's just forge  i think  not any of the things you listed as far as i know  i downloaded  the server files  https   www feed the beast com projects ftb presents direwolf20 1 10 files 2361694#additional files   unzipped them and ran  serverstart sh   it looks like fml is doing the unloading     it might be ok to turn unloading off  might eventually cause memory issues   but i have not yet found how to tweak this  there is a  forgechunkloading cfg  but it only sets limits on number of chunks loaded by a mod 
i considered that before posting but since we are only using forge 1291  rather than 1355+  i posted first before updating   updated to latest and just tested   tanks and buckets work fine now   but the tconstruct error still occurs    will update tconstruct and see if thats the issue

i would like to run tensorflow on my mobile device   it looks like  aarch64  architecture is supported  at least according to get_cpu_value in tools cpp lib_cc_configure bzl    do you have any suggestions about workaround or fix this problem  or may be a bazel aarch64 version is available to download   thank you 
it s just spam logs  i will try the newer version later  thanks

actually i don't think that this po is necessary at all since it should always be of the right type as far as i can see  but it would probably be a good idea also to try this example in vdmtools as well 
hey there turbo   i looked up last nights logs and it just shows the launching messages and some chat   it seems the crashes didnt generate a report  it seemned to me that they were memory errors   today  because i have the fusion reactor chunkloaded  i could log in to a base without power  and without graphical lag    here is my setup  https   imgur com a 4epof   the advanced powercells output 20k rf t   and they were fully charged  i have the electrolysers equipped with 30 speed upgrades and unlimited water from the sink    hope this helps  building the fusion reactor was great fun  i think it's an amazing mod  great work

after getting your response i continued to test and found it was only one group of chickens that had this nature  i created another group of chickens and it worked fine  i went back and it refused to breed that group of chickens  the hearts would go above the head but not split  when i killed that group  only one set of items dropped from it  i have yet to reproduce the bug    if i can find a way to reproduce it  i will let you know  but as of now  it may have just been a server hiccup    thank you for all the hard work 
i have one query subscribed  it occurs on databasesource and sqlitexdatabasesource   i thought that you could be right about thread pool but when i use schedulers from executors newsinglethreadexecutor    for all queries it doesn't work too  when i debug it i noticed that observable query is called on pool 1 thread 1 but update query is called on pool 2 thread 1 
 laa i reran the scenario and there is not much else in the logs   i then increased the disk cache size   oglobalconfiguration disk_cache_size setvalue 16384    and  the issue went away  but the problem is that our application cannot be shipped with such a high value for cache    i am attaching the full relevant logs      orientlogs log  https   github com orientechnologies orientdb files 1908204 orientlogs log 
well  the website said that the proxy is still alive  but it seems like i cannot connect into it  so  this is prob caused by the proxy  not the program  i'll find another proxy then  ty for helping btw

yes  it might be the case that this was an issue due to old cached assets  it seems to have gone away for now  i will keep this issue for a while  if anyone sees another case  please report here  with reproduction steps  i will close the issue in a few weeks if all seems clear  it used to be a sporadic issue that would pop up every now and then

well i dont know much about the key modifiers used in windows ubuntu  but the whole seemed quite consistent for me on mac  now  i barely use the arrow keys    of course we need to rationalize them  so that the same modifiers have the same effect on both mouse and arrows    no problem for me  if it is documented  to remove the menu for switching between rotate translate with the mouse   the roi is quite ugly at the moment  but potentially very useful  i will probably open a whole new issue  or we stay on this one   it works like in the movie below  i think this possibility to have a way to draw an area  in 2d or maybe 3d     to measure its size  and to select a whole set of agents is really interesting    now  its limitations are mainly that it only works in 2d  having the same in 3d would be awesome  but clearly too much work  not on the opengl side  but on the logic side of the display of agents  we dont record in opengl where each agent is drawn and so the roi bases its calculation on the shape of the agents  which is not always true      screencast 2016 04 02 12 58 15  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 579256 14224808 92fa1acc f8d3 11e5 99a4 340889e74b1f gif

we are using this api to implement a web feature for voice mozilla org   full story  our website downloads audio clips with some important metadata in response headers  this api  createobjecturl  allows us to pass the audio data from an xmlhttprequest object to an audio element src  which means we still have access to the response headers  if we were instead to just set the audio src  without using xmlhttprequest   we don't have access to reponse headers there are workarounds for this  multiple requests for one   but this method is extremely convenient for this use case

i don't know if a specific resolution thing would be beneficial as it would probably be quite complicated to take into account in the code  at the minute i just have it where if the maximum radius of the isochrone is smaller than a specific value  then the buffer size is decreased  so if the maximum radius is less than 2000m  then the buffer is 0 00018  and anything more it is 0 0018  i am not sure where that initial 0 0018 came from as it is hard coded

to me  the most convenient would be the long wait support  but it's no big deal if there isn't  in my case i can workaround it easily by scaling the values   the bigger problem was the time it took me to realize this was the source of my problems  hence the exception suggestion

we are using default helm chart that configures basic auth  the command i tried was  app default processor app name   version  the new default version to set   also  some additional info  i have setup cd to always do   force  on installation of new version of the app  this might be causing some problem when existing streams deployed are using current version and new version is installed and forced to become default but it cant since existing stream using current version and etc  
it took me awfully long  but i can finally reproduce the issue   if 2 threads share the same redisson instance  and both are using the same lock  it's possible for the following situation to happen  1    thread a   got the lock  and is within the  redissonlock  release  method  it has successfully released the  redissonlockentry  and removed it from the  entries  map  and is sitting on line 132 to unsubcribe the channel from the collection  and potentially release the connection  2    thread b   gets into  redissonlock  subscribe   finding no matching entry in  entries  creates a new one  and calls  connectionmanager subscribe listener  getchannelname      3    thread b    within the connection manager finds a valid pubsubconnection for the channel at  masterslaveconnectionmanager  subscribe   line 466  and will therefore use that connection 4    thread a   resumes  and calls  masterslaveconnectionmanager  unsubscribe   which removes the connection from  name2pubsubconnection   unsubscribes from the channel and remove all listeners for that channel  this effectively makes thread b wait forever on a notification that just will never arrive   this can be easily forced with well placed breakpoints   notice redisson 1 1 6 alleviates the problem by reducing the usage of pubsub connections by using optimistic locking  but is not free of this problem   i haven't cheked  but this very same problem may also affect other parts of redisson that depends on pubsub  such as  redissontopic

inside the createstatefulcontract  there is a         transactionreceipt contractreceipt   contracttxid getreceipt client   in line 80  that call generates an uncaught error  same process happens inside the get record  since the  waitforconsensus client  null     includes a getreceipt that fails

what i think is that you use the ondeathevent  i had issues with that in my own mod  spmodapi   weird name but deal with it   and when i switcht over to playerdropsevent and set the player capturedrops to true while my logic ran  that seems to have it fixed on my side  because they get then spawned properly 
moved issue to main project 
i meant p2  sorry   but definitely a bug 
i'm going to regenerate the export file  just to be safe  and then retry both remote and plocal and see what happens  i'll let you know in the next few days 
i make this tomorrow
 tylerjewell thanks for the explanation  i am trying to run che behind https using nginx reverse proxy  i have adjusted the che server tomcat server xml to have the proxy port and scheme to https    and configured another system as nginx reverse proxy to do the ssl termination and forward to 8080 and other websocket ports on the che server  so i have to start the che sever with che_host public host name  but just before the project creation the che server application tries to connect to the wsagent on http   che_host randomport   i am not sure why it is http  but nevertheless i needed that ping to pass so the project creation can pass  so i had to add a dummy hosts entry to the che container for che_host with the ip of the host machine  and ping passes 
 overheadhunter not 100 percent sure how you mean that  but i've tried the following    clients used  cyberduck and carotdav   server used  webdav server of box com online storage   transfered the mentioned files to box com via each of the above clients    the end result is the same as with cryptomator    only difference is that cyberduck doesn't even ask if the file should be overwritten  carotdav does   one unrelated curious thing i've just experienced is that cryptomator opened one of my vaults twice at the same time  i  e  it has been displayed as 2 separate drives in windows explorer  until locking   after unmounting locking the vault in cryptomator  there's still one instance left that i can still use  i'll leave it there until i shut down the computer tonight  so if this is of any interest to you  let me know   edit  dang   too late  somehow managed to accidentally quit the cryptomator client  now the second instance is also gone  sorry  
ha  i figured it was more likely to be a bit random vs having "nested"  in the name  my steps were    upgrade index from 0 17 9 to 0 18 5   delete random indexes from previous debug  different names    run above test  "nested" fails  "test_type" works    delete indexes   rerun above test  same result  so on a sample of 2  yes  i'll fire up my vm and try a few more samples deleting es and rebuilding from scratch

sorry for the late reply   i'm using the latest version  1 4 0  and i'm sure that the process is associated with lsml  it appears in the task manager list as soon as the program starts  and usually disappears when it closes  but not always  i'm not sure what causes it to stay  but it seems to happen more often when i've had lsml open for a longer time 
c geo   2014 02 27 android   4 4 2  i've been running this version of android for about a month and c geo was working fine with it on a prior version and the one above   up until a couple of days ago  i had also updated c geo about 3 weeks ago  but as i said above  it eas fine up until a couple of days ago   i can use maps  navigation and all other functions of c geo  its just the compass that is locked up  the distance from target still works but with no direction to show me the way  the compass is all hut impossible to use   sent from yahoo mail on android
this should now be fixed in master  please reopen if you are still seeing issues 
thank you emanuele  understood  so i'll close this issue  do we have something in documentation about this  if not  it would be better to have this point described 
whatever you did fixed it for me  thanks  nice work on the quick turnaround

no  i just checked  same problem in google chrome    sucks   
iirc  snowy coniferous forest from bop
the problem is that we lock wrong keys  copying wont help here  if we insert a record  which contains a "temporary" rid as a value  we lock this temporary rid key and the corresponding index  after that we convert the rid into a persistent one  that's ok in most cases since the index is wholly locked as a component  but for auto sharded indexes we may lock the wrong shard corresponding to the old rid value and this will lead to data inconsistency   in  micro tx  branch there are no more key locks  so obviously there is no such problem any more  but we still need to select the right shard  so we must assign the rid before index locking 
it works 
hi leah  i've tried it with the 14 111 1 version  but unfortunately it doesn't help

hello  icbaker and thanks for the help  i am upgrading from 2 10 4    2 11 0  i did not have any issues creating signed apks before  so those messages are new to me  i am only adding the ui and core to my project    implementation 'com google android exoplayer exoplayer core 2 11 0'   implementation 'com google android exoplayer exoplayer ui 2 11 0'   i have just tried enabling r8 instead of proguard  and i was able to create a signed apk without issues  though  i favor proguard because it handles one aspect better  note that i am only playing offline files on my app   does the demo app use r8 or proguard 
i use the recent beta 17   there is no error message  dna just deletes not all selected documents 
i'm not sure about it as it's not happening to me  i'll post additional information if i get any

  the following occurs when i start jmxtrans and delete a config file  this happens when the start command doesn't contain a path to a config file  when it contains a path to a different config file  and when it contains a path to the deleted file   for the most part  this is probably easily avoidable     there may be other similar scenarios  this is just what i have run into

 rbygrave thanks for the workaround  but a workaround isn't a fix  i would expect a stateless update to work with  cascadetype all   this bug is the reason why we are stuck with an older version of ebeans  the newer versions are unusable for production due to this issue   note that a fix for this and another issue was proposed in https   github com ebean orm ebean pull 1403  but was rejected due to refactoring work  the provided unit test shows that a proper solution never made it to  master  
i would prefer that font and size were separate  i may not want a monospaced font in the chat  as i would definitely want a monospace for the macro editor   same goes for the sizes  i realize that it may not be practical at this point in the process  in which case i would be able to accept that the font size was shared for now 
yeah  not able to load the content  editor without restarting dbeaver  the npe above is the only thing i see when attempting to reopen    i've switched back to 4 3 0 as i haven't seen this on that version  we'll see what happens   feel free to close if you think it's an eclipse issue    
so the first sample below  is my way of searching through the fields of a pdf given an input stream   i'm checking to see if the name of the edittexts and other ui elements match the ones in the pdf  if they do then i write onto the pdf fields what is written from the android ui   there are a lot of commented lines i should have removed  these are just things i was trying out    note  i may be missing curly brackets near the end by accident  i cut out some of the other "if statements" as i am trying to transition from another library to pdfbox     if i am missing a call of a function or if there is anything that stands out that shouldn't be done  please let me know

thank you for the quick reply    i’ve inherited the use of a persistent database from when  simple monitor exporter  was used  we want simple monitor to retain state when restarted  our processes can take quite long  hours or even days  and we have preference for postgresql when it comes to relational databases 
i have tried in different file types  same issue  also found someone that seems to have the same issue  reported  here  https   support rstudio com hc en us community posts 115009228428 problem with surround selection on text insertion

imho it is necessary to fix all layers of this  if a service requires more than the meta type service provides  then it is the responsibility of the service to validate  but this is not about "on top" validation   however if kura provides an api then the consumer of this api should be able trust the contract of it  i don't think that consumers should be required to enforce those contracts   of course a good start is to this the ui layer and sync it with the current behavior of single item fields

the problem occurs when document tobytearray   length   256    0
thanks  works great now 
2 12 0  but seems that 3 7 0 also has this problem 
this is strange because for me laggoogle add the color automatically and everithing work fine for me      what version of java are you using  i use personnally 1 8 0_201 64 bit  and start my modpack with multimc    after that i really can't help you because i never get any issue with that mod     somes mods can have problem with really old version of java  but  that you possibly know  because you are java developper   
problem is i do not have steps  it happens from time to time  i did not be able to reproduce it by unittest  i assume that some other thread is doing on those verticies i am trying to remove 
i made a experimental firmware update which i havent tested  if you want to take the  risk i can send it to you  it shows as 1 04 but is 1 03 with a unified config  all language config copied over the chinese  european  us etc  one

ok   following is whole dump file       dump zip  https   github com square okhttp files 1276495 dump zip 
yes  can try that  i can reproduce this in both computers  may be it is a windows thing  the dropdown drops down momentarily before the sync starts 
cool   bgogetap thanks for the tip 
will look into that  strange thing is it's completely intermittent  and syncany will run for several hours  then suddenly drop everything without apparent reason  and certainly without any ports or firewalls reconfigured   yesterday upgraded to snapshot 2015 06 24  which seems to have helped  still the occasional miss on boot  but now i can just close and restart the gui  and everything's fine  prviously required reboot    everythin else is roses  beautiful software

this problem happens after migration authme database to mysql  i trying to resolve my problem with database editing  in the database was one empty name  and cirka 20 without "last login " i delete this  is "real name" important 
just attempted with      http   10 17 36 12 mjpg video mjpg   same behavior  attempted to just enter "10 17 36 12"   http    was automatically prepended within the dialog box  but still same behavior

thanks  jimczi  i was confused  nothing to see here    
damn   i stopped reading at  traceresttemplatebuilderbpp     but wait   what if resttemplates found in the context were created by a resttemplatebuilder you already instrumented  is that possible at all   just asking here    
 andreasschroth sure that would work in this case  but it's still a bug isn't it  if you for example want to make one of the parts conditional with an if statement there is no clean way to do that    for example 
hi mahmoud   i've done almost the same thing here  and it worked fine 
i'm using 1080p  don't know about the other launchers  it does not always happen so it's hard to reproduce
"oll" works   
i think it found out what the problem is     the current implementation does not support multicast or multiple responses   once one of the multicast response is received by the client  the client simply ignores all other responses due to the same values of the mid and the token   in the meantime  i do have a fix for matcher   please close this issue   on mon  aug 22  2016 at 3 07 am  kai hudalla notifications github com wrote    ##   james nguyen email  james huy nguyen gmail com

 mswertz in the future using exception logger  but right now  no real measure  i encounter it occasionally myself in docker and i sometimes hear data managers complaining about missing bootstrap 4 styles in the vms 
this is the output
it certainly solves my use case  awesome    
i am currently running in eclipse  but i believe this issue would happen in any osgi container   if i do something as simple as    this is because flyway is expecting "org flywaydb core internal version txt" to exist within the custom classloader   if i instead have flyway use its own classloader  then of course flyway can find "org flywaydb core internal version txt" within the flyway jar  but it will never find my sql scripts in a different bundle

ubuntu 16 10  unity desktop  unity 7 comes with that afaik   i wasn't having this issue until a while ago  in recent times it has started  can be due to ubuntu 16 10 upgrade  but i am not sure  so i wanted to report it here 
it's overworld  superflat  redstone ready and i also got this once at a another normal world though i think it may has something to do with forgotton nature too  forgotton nature seems override the worldprovider or something of overworld and didn't register it correctly  it always cause dimention door got crashed and make biosphere can't generate any world if i install forgotton nature after biosphere the exist biosphere world will not generate any new area   and sometimes it say that it can't find a spawn biome for unknown reason  especilly start a new myscraft dim  but didn't affect anything else  but i didn't found anything with forggon nature  so i am not sure about that 
exactly    i have about 5 minutes  and i see that all containers are started   i get two messages the first is   502 bad gateway    and the second is    cannot get        
actually the engine tests bit was originally split out from  also  intellij not handling it too well either  something about the mixture of source and test compilation dependencies and getting the order right      will have to look at it more closely when an opportunity presents itself   thanks for the intel    
got a lot of errors like that 
sonarqube 4 5 2  plugin 0 3 3

i found the problem was not in the test project itself  there was another project in my workspace which was causing this problem   it took me awhile to figure out which one  as soon as i closed this project eclemma ran flawlessly   what is peculiar about this offending project it is a plugin project with no output directory defined in build properties  i guess this causes the error above   thank you 
my phone is a nexus 5 with a 1920x1080 screen on which i changed the dpi setting to 360 dpi  which means the virtual size of the screen 6 12 inches  the real size  though i don't think it matters here  is 4 95 inches   the tablet is a lenovo a3000 which does not have any fancy setting  it has a resolution of 600x1024 and a size of 7 inches 
i'm test it  no error message  but why 2 equal folders are created 
simply take the examples  there is no form in a form  i've even tried it with b form  but the error still is the same   i want to have a form inside of multiple tabs  therefore  a h form outside of the tabview is no solution

hi peter   yes   i did   2014 10 13 14 56、peter jørgensen notifications github com のメール：
it takes the same time regardless if i let it sit to do the caching  about 6 9 seconds on average with the new version and 18 20 with the old one for me    select photos from the drawer  then open the drawer and go back to "all files"  the "photos" section will stay selected even if its no longer active    the app will crash if you select "photos" from the drawer again     all files photos all files photos crash    are those exact the same images  are they generated faster when you browse within the app to the folder containing these images   i found out they will eventually load one by one very slowly  yes  thumbnails are generated faster from the "files" section than from the gallery  also the non qa version is faster at loading the thumbs in the gallery  as mentioned earlier    another important issue i discovered was that some photos will refuse to fully load and instead are displayed by its thumbnail resolution  see below  only way to be able to load images from gallery properly is to go to "files" section  find in which folder the picture is and let the app load the thumbnails  once thumbnails are visible for that folder  it signalizes that the gallery will load the picture  in other words  user must visit the "files" section before heading to the gallery for it to load images properly     pic  https   user images githubusercontent com 36133540 61531074 18057200 aa26 11e9 9ccf 59a586b4b1d0 jpg          another highly important issue is that the folders will display images that are in fact not in those folders  talking about files section now  not photos   go to one of the folders where the pictures are and let it load  then  manually update that file by swiping your finger down  the "no files bug" will emerge for a second and  then random pictures that do not belong in the folder will appear in that folder   this problem is not present in the non qa version of the app  
sure  can i just 'delete' the null check 
just checked it out  seems to be working fine now 
i must admit i missed the point that the maven plugin can use a newer release of the core  that will be sufficient  even though it means maintaining 2 version properties instead of 1 in the pom      regarding coupled versions  i do know other software with multiple integrations  where this is solved by always releasing a new x y version together for core changes  but to allow totally independent x y z  x y  z+1  etc  releases of the different parts  i'm aware that this may falsify the meaning of semantical versioning for the non core parts  if they add huge unrelated features in z+1  it's somewhat of a compromise between exact versioning and more easy to recognize for end users

yes   pulquero i can use constructors instead   indeed  it appears that i should  i remain puzzled that a single instantiation  one triple in the sparql update query above  could results in a wildly variable number of rule executions    i re ran the experiment this morning and got hundreds of time stamps  screen capture below      it seems as though my rule is in some sort of loop and reaches some sort of limit  probably resource driven   i'm curious as to what the source of the loop is   could it be as simple as adding the first time stamp generates another run of the rules because it alters this instance  and that subsequent time stamps likewise generate subsequent rule runs   i guess my question then is  what prevents any rule that alters the state of the instance from running repeatedly   i'm not seeing this behavior when i'm running rules that generate error messages  but the error messages  datatype properties  are the same from run to run whereas the timestamp is not   hmmm  maybe i do have multiple instances of the datatype property  but the workbench filters them out as in select distinct making it appear that i don't have duplicates   that's probably it     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 20132242 16847104 ee605d36 49b4 11e6 8efd d51653942140 png

if the jar file is smaller  it probably doesn't contain the compiled java code for dna  only the pre compiled libraries that are packaged along with dna  like jdom etc   the    release  argument was introduced in jdk 9  is it possible to specify  install    openjdk 9 jdk    openjdk 10 jdk   or  openjdk 11 jdk   they are all backward compatible and can compile java 8 code   we need java 8  on the one hand  if we compile with jdk 7  some code will not work because we use language features that were introduced with java 8  on the other hand  if we don't provide compatibility with java 8 and instead let it compile with a higher version  many users will not be able to use dna because they have java 8 installed  so the ideal solution would be to get jdk 9  10  or 11 to work on travis 
yes  i do 
 maggiolo00   i'm talking about the web front end to orient db  which you call studio  in studio there's a "graph" tab  which allows one to visualize a graph returned by a query and also to manipulate it  in that view you can click on an verticy and get then click on a "link" icon which then allows you to connect an arrow  edge  to another verticy on the graph and by clicking on it  once you click on the second verticy you get a dialog to choose the type of edge you want to create  then it asks you to enter rids for verticies  but it should already know which verticies i clicked on  this si not a question  its a bug in the ui

i did not have any other mods installed  however during the time i started using it  there seems to have been a "sneaky" update to spigot to fix a exploid bug  this seems to have altered some things so in the end it appears that it was indeed the server it self even though they kept claiming it was not them  they just did not realise there had been an update that altered permission stuff  it works fine now although i feel that the 1 11 version was a lot more stable and reliable on the printer function  it now produces a lot of ghost placing that when you move away dissappear  however that is something entirely different  sorry to have wasted a little of your time today  i know you are busy and i do hope you will continue making this awesome mod even better
thanks  gsantner   yes  vanitasvitae  this resolved the problem  it has been a couple of days since i posted a comment 
the purpose is achieved on the second case as i'm getting ok on overall execution  although is not really user friendly and can lead to doubts if the user is looking to the execution for the first time  i wouldn't reach this solution honestly but it was suggested by filipe and made the trick  in my modest opinion my suggestion would be simpler to understand  when a property is not calculated following some condition it should be considered as it wouldn't exist   although i understand that fa should be generated on the second case because it fails to get a certain element i wouldn't know how to work around this type of case  so maybe can be useful to leave it like this 
the solution you provided worked perfectly   thank you serge rider

it is indeed different than i first thought  i have just seen that on repeated refresh of the same list of caches still some pictures are loaded  which made me think they are loaded multiple times   i retested it today and from what i can see  the first refresh loads quite a lot of images and on the sedond refresh also images are loaded  but these have not been contained in the first refresh as far as i checked   why is that   both refreshes have been done a few minutes apart  here are the logs   first refresh  https   www dropbox com s joo7hp9byiy2nnw firstrefresh_89caches_issues4578 txt dl 0  seond refresh  https   www dropbox com s bmugewj5ynwn39j secondrefresh_89caches_issues4578 txt dl 0  please kindly have a look 
maybe we could think about a openstreetmap alternative 
the issue i'm seeing is that valid sessions are getting erroneously invalidated    currentsession  can be  null  if  request getsession    was never called by application code during the lifetime of the request  which is a perfectly valid scenario    in this case   isrequestedsessionidvalid    still returns true because the sessionid is still valid   however  this triggers spring session to invalidate the session  thereby removing the cookie   why would we want to invalidate the client session if the sessionid _is_ valid 
### to fix   to avoid loading chunks  any time you check a tile entity or block in the world that is not at your position  you should check  world#isblockloaded  or  world#isarealoaded  first   the way i would solve it in your case would be to have  setside    check that the area around it is loaded and return a boolean like this   https   gist github com mezz c9569dafd5c11d30b3a6316faaaf3b20 in the  update    logic you can return right away if  setside    returned false  when your turret is on chunk boundaries next to an unloaded chunk  entities and other things are inactive so it will not need to handle updating when it's there    ### to detect   the way i found that the turrets are loading chunks was by using player's sampler mod  it's a utility mod that's available on  the same page as fastcraft  https   forum industrial craft net thread 10820 wip 1 7 10 fastcraft 1 25 note all posts of new members need to be approved firs    it has a command    sampler loads show  to start and   sampler loads hide  to stop  which create console logs with stack traces any time a chunk gets loaded by something   the server i tried it on has some turrets right on chunk boundaries  so they are loading each other in some situations  along with some other mods with similar issues  i reported a few    it is not very easy to detect in development because it often involves multiple mods  the best way i've found is to look through the code for places where you are looking at tile entities or blocks in the world

i don't think so  because this is not the behavior in a standard text field  and i've not seen it on other text fields  which of course rtf field ui developers have to wrap with javascript to make the magic happen    indeed i just checked here on github by clicking edit on my original post above  and if it were an overall browser env issue  one might expect it to occur here as well  but it did not   mac el capitan 10 11 6   chrome version 61 0 3163 100  official build   64 bit   i could try another browser os some time  but in the meantime  i just wanted to call it to someone's attention that this is the behavior i observed 
for me the crash has been fixed  the scoreboard team name is still existent as of the 21th  both fixed  thanks

i prompted this error when i imported the project  i don't know why can you help me   error execution failed for task ' transformclasseswithandroidgradleclassshrinkerforfreedebug' 
thanks for looking into this   it was failing very reliably for me and i've rarely seen object wait      go twice as long before  but it certainly can be unreliable   you'd think in this day and age we would have computers and software that could count reliably      thanks again for looking into it

i'm not sure what's being proposed so i thought i'd try to clarify a bit   i'm using the primary file directory feature as a way to avoid a bibtex file that contains a full  machine specific path the files directory    a full path doesn't work when the bibtex file is checked out on different machines or by different users   #2930    specifying a primary file directory does get around that problem but it causes the one i'm mentioning in this issue     so  as the beta stands right now  jabref 4 0 is considerably more annoying to use  in this regard  than jabref 3 x     it doesn't seem to me that there's a documentation fix for this   but maybe there's something i don't understand 
the issue occurs at any amount of time spent sleeping   yes  i just tested this  it does only occur when rstudio is focussed before sleeping    i tested a few themes light and dark  it occured with all i tried and is more visible with dark themes    yes

ok thats weird  ill share a sample project asap
manual transmissions currently in do not work the same way that a tractors would at least in my playing with manual transmissions that the trin packs have added into the game  or maybe i just misunderstand how manual transmissions for cars work currently  it might be due to them using gas pedals instead of throttles  which i will be using on my tractors since that is realistic    as far as breaking goes when i drove the unu groundhog i didn't believe it turned sharp enough  while i understand that an updated physics system for just this would be too much to ask for really  i'd be happy if you just pondered on it  maybe look into it whenever you work on other physics parts  in the case of keybinding there would technically need to be three keys or a switch in some way  i do agree that differential brakes are non intuitive  i believe that 100  as i have seen people not realize that the two pedals next to each other are both brakes in real life  but as i said there would need to be three keys for braking with a differential braking system as most tractors and all modern tractors have a function to connect both brakes for use on the road  that is so you don't swing around throwing your tractor over while braking cause of someone in their car  i believe this can be done with the three keys we already have and have differentials be a toggle able thing that comes turned on by default under the u menu  then for differential braking have it default to the keybinding such as s+d to use your right differential brake and make you turn right sharper  and s+a for left turning  obviously keybinding is the easiest part in this case   a final addition that i see i did not talk about is a pto  i can't seem to find how ground effects are "started"  from the video you posted it seemed as though they just need to be low enough to scrap the ground  obviously rotatable objects are possible but i am curious as to how that would be made functional with the ground effects allowing us to "turn off" or lift up our equipment for transport  i currently dont have any examples to look at until seagull finishes his industrial pack  i am sorry if this too is possible like you said the manual transmission can act in the same way as a tractors  i just cant seem to find it in the manual anywhere

i doubt that because the fragment list is inside a singleton class  maybe the fragmentmanager are not cleared up correctly 
 ryanjbaxter sure  is there a  snapshot   version of spring cloud gateway that is already using that  if not  how can i override the spring cloud version

do you mean specifying a different port for server explicitly in machine configuration  if yes  then my answer is no  there two reasons why it won't work   when machine configuration has specified server that has the same name as installer's one but with different configuration then an exception will be thrown  see https   github com eclipse che blob 148fe48c1e116301d46cc40204856089cd419329 wsmaster che core api workspace src main java org eclipse che api workspace server spi provision installerconfigprovisioner java#l97 l103   ports for agents are hardcoded in installers scripts or in packaged agents  see  https   github com eclipse che blob 8ad7973a80eaf1ec9ed2d1f594907a54737d299d agents exec src main resources installers 1 0 0 org eclipse che exec script sh#l228 https   github com eclipse che blob e67979d3379eaa435f7ffb6b5bcc673bd23a60ac agents terminal src main resources installers 1 0 0 org eclipse che terminal script sh#l224 https   github com eclipse che blob b0dfd90f8c10e8561a8b3ff5e1c51b70e14ca015 assembly assembly wsagent server src assembly server xml#l72

scheduling code    the scheduling method started on the start of the application  i experienced the crash accidentally when starting the application at midnight 00 08  on the other time of the day it's working perfectly fine    createextras method is for passing the start and end time for the daily job  since without this  dailyjob does not reschedule for the next day 
it does not seem to update for me at all until the map is triggered an update through clicking   painting it 
there's no more logs for the null pointer entry  there's a ton of logs for the headers and each of the 2k requests do you want me to post those  all of those responded with 200 ok though 
well "listen to events" can only be understood by technical persons imho  replace it by "connected" or anything simple like that  a color could be good either  but i'm not sure android allows that  and  most importantly  having at least a notification in the system tray informing the user when it's disconnecting  with some tolerance  so that user isn't spammed   you can take as example how does conversations im works as a xmpp client 
works fine  it works in hb if element is created not via hb api  see https   github com vaadin hummingbird demo pull 206
no  extension point is not needed  we can start debug session by just configuring appropriate launch config  that does not require any dependency between plugins and extension points  so in eclipse nodejs core there will be a single "configurer" for each type of debug session  those configurers will turn on  if installation has appropriate launch config type and will display in the ui    what happens right now  is that for each project a new tern server is started  the same will happen if debug mode is on  but all of those servers will start in debug mode

 meincs the specific cron specification  quartz  etc   doesn't matter as i believe all of the cron dialects supported by cron utils do not support nanosecond precision  thus  comparing cron schedules with nanosecond precision would be wrong  which fortunately  was easy to catch   here is the link for the quartz cron trigger  http   www quartz scheduler org documentation quartz 2 x tutorials crontrigger html

i backed up the config folder  deleted the instance  and rebuilt the pack from scratch with a fresh install of minecraft and forge  then added a few mods at a time till all the original mods were all running concurrently  and the crash didn't happen again  so either a problem with minecraft forge install  or i had a corrupted jar file somehow  a mod that maybe didn't fully download properly    or something else entirely  but its fine now i suppose

 secupwn  he he  i was thinking the same thing  about the alignment   but was afraid to say anything  as i could come across as very    you know  anyway  i agree with all your comments    regarding the ciphering indicator as shown on slide window  in all honesty  i have little frekkin clue to what it is actually telling us  i posted about it in the xda thread  but never had any constructive response to my speculations  thus that functionality is still purely speculation  but has something to do with the current enciphering status  which surely probably depend on the current network you're connected to   i started a  new thread  http   forum xda developers com showthread php t 2744850   to properly map out sm     what we would also need is the ci that is set in the sim by your service provider   this require us to use either    a  the at command entry  my preferred way   as we had in the first versions or  b  the internal sim related api ipc commands  for reading the sim ef files    xlambchopsx  would it be a problem to re implement the at command entry possibility as we had in the earlier versions   before i was able to test   if so  we could use another slide page for this type of entry  i really promote the atcop entry  over the api stuff  because it give you complete and direct control without weirdness   i know people probably think i'm a pain in the    for always talking obsessively about the at access  but few people know that it allows for close to full control of the baseband  including completely reprogramming most rf related main functions  as i have tried to document elsewhere     secupwn i forgot to mention that the persistence bug is an old one where the logic is reversed  just check it and it will close down nicely

 timtay microsoft i was using 1 3 30  which is the version one currently gets when following the quickstart from here  https   docs microsoft com en us azure iot hub quickstart send telemetry java    you might want to upgrade those samples   then i upgraded to 1 15 0 and the problem still repros  digging further  i found i spelled "gatewayhostname" instead of "gatewayhostname"  turns out that the java sdk requires this exact capitalization  for any other spelling the sdk will just ignores the gatewayhostname segment and instead of providing an error it will connect straight to the iothub  for reference  the  net sdk works with any capitalization of "gatewayhostname"   btw  with the correct spelling i am hitting another error that i now need to investigate on my end first   for this bug it seems like there are two things to fix  1  update your samples to a current sdk 2  allow any capitalization of "gatewayhostname"   or fail if the spelling is not correct  instead of silently connecting to iothub  which clearly isn't what the user has intended

 stevehu  i think implementing all 3 options is a good idea to keep it generic and satisfying various security refresh flow requirements of different customers  perhaps implementation option should be configurable via some sort of factory   pluggable implementation   i suggest to have defined an interface for "a refresh flow plugin" and provide all 3 implementations "out of the box"  therefore users of the framework can select desired implementation and in some cases even provide its own implementation for the interface that satisfies their unique custom logic  in case its required   also regarding 3 rd solution to modify light oauth2 service behaviour    this might open up some concerns for some of the customers it security who don't want deviations from oauth2 standard flow rule   "refresh token can be used only once"

so the issue is that our library is grabbing all of our owned repositories and putting them in a mapping of repository name    repository object  originally we assumed this would only grab in my case  agduncan94   repositories  we had another function to grab repositories from organisations you belong to   turns out "owned" repositories is not only those in your namespace  ex  agduncan94   but also include others  so if you had a repository agduncan94 foo and another one you "owned" called dockstore foo  only one would show up in the mapping   the function returns all repos according to the following   what we actually want is is just the first point  repositories owned by the authenticated user

yes  that's exactly it  something like "removed 17 500 old storage entries from the database"  i can get my exact logs for you if you want   i did go into settings and shut off the "archive old data" since these lines of text really make no dent in the storage  so no reason to erase data from players who have not played in a while  but that did not make a difference with this   any way to stop this from happening  it would be a huge help to us and finally solve our headache of players never having their times

the best way to explain the issue is to use a unit test  you need to modify the unit test the way you can grab mongo and datastore instances    public class mongodbcontainertest           here's the output   indexoptioncoll index after drop    depindexcoll index after drop    indexoptioncoll index after ensure    "v"   1   "key"     "_id"   1    "name"   "_id_"   "ns"   "ut_base testwithindexoption"     "v"   1   "key"     "name"   1    "name"   "name_1"   "ns"   "ut_base testwithindexoption"   jul 06  2015 12 34 03 pm org mongodb morphia datastoreimpl processclassannotations warning  this index on 'estalea base setup springframework mongo mongodbcontainertest testwithdeprecatedindex' is using deprecated configuration options   please update to use the fields value on  index   org mongodb morphia annotations index expireafterseconds  1  dropdups false  sparse false  background false  unique false  disablevalidation false  name   options  org mongodb morphia annotations indexoptions expireafterseconds  1  dropdups false  languageoverride   sparse false  background false  unique false  disablevalidation false  userdefined false  name   language    fields     value name  depindexcoll index after ensure    "v"   1   "key"     "_id"   1    "name"   "_id_"   "ns"   "ut_base testwithdeprecatedindex"     "v"   1   "key"     "name"   1    "name"   "name_1"   "ns"   "ut_base testwithdeprecatedindex"   "background"   true    as you can see  the deprecated usage of index generates a "background"  true  whereas the indexoptions does not

yeah  i know what you mean  chat events tend to get a bit messy when you have formatters and filters all listening and acting on them  in my case   chatcontrol  https   www spigotmc org resources chatcontrol 271   is the main incompatibility  i have to set its "formatter" listener priority to "monitor" in the config  which then breaks my punishment plugin's mute command   edit  scratch the mute thing  that seems to have broken with a recent update of chatcontrol

i don't think a reproducer is warranted  given that it is clear by inspection of the following code  taken from  vertximpl internaltimerhandler   that  canceltimer  is not linearized with respect to  handle      as written  the  compareandset  in  cancel  might as well be an ordinary load and store  since there is no other atomic operation on the  cancelled  flag to establish a linearization  another way of explaining the issue is that there is a possible interleaving where  handle  sees  cancelled  is false  then  cancel  is called  the cas succeeds in setting   cancelled  to true and thus the function returns true  and then the handler proceeds to execute   sorry if this is an over explanantion  i don't mean to insult anybody's intelligence  let me know if i am missing something 
this is the sample dockerfile given in the eclipse che doc     it is stated in the document to start the language server in the entrypoint  this is where i'm confused  if i am to implement a new language server  for a new language   where do i direct the entrypoint to  can i add my language server to github and build an image from it to be included as the entrypoint  or is there any other way to do it 
you're right  i fixed the title  sorry for the confusion 
there is nothing wrong with these cards  they expose bugs in the game engine  we should fix the game engine  not remove the cards   an analogy is say if attacking with first strike causes the program to crash  do we remove all cards with the first strike ability or fix the implementation of first strike  replace "first strike" with "cycling and madness" and that is the situation here

hi  yes in htop i can see that it's filled all 8g of memory i told it to use   we're running it on a large volume  probably a few million files   perhaps it's legitimately filling the memory   i was just assuming there's a memory leak somewhere 
sorry  # 1858 from yesterday
it works  thanks

well  document   is an xslt function  http   www w3 org tr xslt20 #function document   doc   is an xpath xquery function  http   www w3 org tr xpath functions #func doc   both are supported by saxon  http   saxonica com documentation index html# functions fn  the documentation for doc   documents the uri argument as      http   saxonica com documentation index html# functions fn doc   actually  _loading_ the document with the relative uri in exist doesn't seem the problem  see style3 xsl   only when that document is processed directly  without first copying it into a fresh xslt variable  note  when the files are run from the file system  not from the db   no errors occur   indeed  replacing the relative uri with  http   localhost 8080        makes it work everywhere

false alarm  indeed problem was on our side  api was setting db encoding to  utf8  instead of  utf8mb4   just deployed a fix  should be good now 
yep its fixed now
 tylerjewell well  i read it in the che docs at https   eclipse che readme io docs machines#section machine snapshot  this is probably the wrong place to look at    eivantsov thanks for pointing out that snapshotting is possible in the operations perspective  i was not aware of that    tylerjewell and  eivantsov however  it seems to me that both ways  manual snapshot in operations and the implied automatic snapshot  do not work for me  if i install a package in the machine  e g   sudo apt get install cmake    the package is gone after restarting the workspace  am i missing something fundamental here 
i think i figured it out though i'm not sure if this is your problem brayferd  i really like this mod a lot and wanted it to work so i re downloaded it and switched over to the new file  and then tried it worked  come to find out though if your looking at a block even if its right outside your range it will try to place to backpack  try looking at something really far or in the sky  how ever i had some problems with taking the backpack from the "toomanyitems" nei and i could not craft with them  but for reference i was using  too many items    marglyph craftguide    uristqwerty minions mod    atomicstryker balkon’s weaponmod    balkondeuralpha  i did uninstall tmi and everything is working wonderfully  its an awesome mod 
 timusus i could replicate it on all lists  albums playlists 
curious   i'm starting it via this very boring marathon config     i think i've fixed it purely by accident  however   some other docker using jobs were failing to start following my upgrade to mesos 0 23 0   marathon 0 10 0   and i traced that down to mesos slave now requiring    docker  usr bin docker   previously the unqualified    docker docker  default worked just fine    fixing that  or perhaps the churn from rolling it out   appears to have also made the above go away   but i confess i don't really understand why   i'm going to close this as "unreproducible" for now   unless you want to morph it into a lower priority bug to actually address the multiple slf4j bindings 
using java 8 works better  interestingly enough  since the pom file specifies java 8 to be used    but generates other errors as below 
obfuscated or not most flow users won't care about flow statetree or other internal logic most of the time  but that's just my feeling  having a non obfuscated version could be helpful for reporting issues 
so i was able to verify the pass created with pkinmemorysigningutil using the preview on mac but not with the pkfilebasedsigningutil  its not a blocker for me as i can just use the pkinmemorysigningutil  just thought i should raise the issue for clarity 
submitted at pr 1642 
the reason i'm removing   adding back the scrollbar from the viewgroup is because i never was able to just hide it  neither setvisibility gone  nor setscrollbarhidden false  works for me   so the crash occurs after i removed the view once  then simply try to add it back to the same parent  simple call to view remove   and view add    nothing fancy here 
the player was unable to replicate when recording  and i was not able to replicate  if anything changes i’ll let you know  but i’ll close it for now 
to test whether they were fixed some errors
 roytmana a similar method could be applied indeed  but i'm not fully happy with the way per field boosting works for the _all field so i would like that we consider improving it before applying the same logic to other places  in particular  this doesn't work with all queries  eg  phrase queries  and is quite wasteful storage wise  4 bytes per occurrence of a term whose field has a boost which is not 1  i wouldn't be surprised to see that it sometimes almost doubles the size of the inverted index for the _all field

 jmmv it's very hard to say  we upgraded the production fleet to macos catalina on 2020 01 29  but on testing ci already much earlier  i think since the beta   and the test worked fine until yesterday  i remember seeing the same failure occasionally during a presubmit of my cl in the testing org  but that was a completely unrelated change  then it went away a few days later and i was able to submit it   maybe it's a bug in macos catalina  but it's not clear what triggers it   
thanks for the speedy response  we are using oracle jdk v1 7 0_80 with seam 2 2 2 final  i can't see anything strange in the jboss config so i'll try and reproduce in a vagrant box with a fresh copy and one of the seam examples  i'll let you know how i get on 
regarding the implementaion  have a look at  https   github com danielpetisme golosa blob master src main golo golosa util augment util golo  i definitively prefer the default collections approach  to be more flexible i use a kind of container  very very basic      you register the default mappings  could be externailized    the functions try to invoke the sametype constructor   if it fails  use the default collection associated  it works pretty well  have a look at the test   https   github com danielpetisme golosa blob master src test golo golosa util testutil golo

i'm not setup to build the project  could you package a jar up for me 
side note   apparently  https   github com dokan dev dokany releases tag v1 2 1 2000  the dokany library can return the version number  so perhaps cryptomator could display it under its own version number    dokan1 sys  is at  1 2 0 1000  and hence outdated  i assume that this is the version that got installed alongside cryptomator  1 4 15   which required a reboot by the way  so plausibly dokany was updated then  however  cryptomator's  dokan1 dll  is at  1 3 0 1000   so weirdly that one is up to date   i uninstalled everything  dokany + cryptomator  of which there were two entries in the control panel   restarted as dokany asked for  installed cryptomator  1 4 15   which now installed dokany  1 3 1000   so i don't really understand how i ended up with  1 2 1000  yesterday despite having to reboot yesterday too   with the newer dokany version  the   issue is resolved    thanks  so i guess if anything  the remaining question is how to get dokany to update properly along with cryptomator 
i press "add to home screen"  get the dialog asking what to call the shortcut  press add  and nothing happens   i see the same with the chrome browser   neither work with either the stock google now launcher  or the kiss launcher   strangely  both browsers did make shortcuts ok before i started alternating between the launchers   the phone's a google lg nexus 5x if that makes any difference  maybe i should close this issue and raise one with google for android

upgraded to springboot 1 5 16 
it's version 0 3 7
see singletonbeanfactorylocator docs  i admit it's not so simple   i haven't cracked it yet  try a simple main   app that creates an annotations based application context  then try integrating it into your provider lookup machinery  http   www tutorialspoint com spring spring_java_based_configuration htm   i think it will all come down to finding a way to tell togglz what the id or name of the context is  some apps use multiple contexts we want to bind togglz to a specific context avoiding any  java  singletons 
thanks for the info  we added a workaround to fix the issue  let me have a try with the new version  thanks
sorry was having issues uploading the whole config file but i can give you an example of what i changed  i just copy pasted a small section straight from the config and everything else is default  i thought changing the enable disable effect  default false  would add it to each individual piece and enable disable the full armor effect  default true  would change the tooltip to reflect that  i did look for the tinker armors in the config but i just assumed there wasn't an option to change them  i just wanted to change the less expensive ones like coal or redstone armor as an example   # enable disable the coal effect  boots  leggings  chestplate  helmet              b enablecoaleffect                   true                 true                 true                 true              # enable disable the potion effect the coal weapons will have             b enablecoalweaponseffects true              # enable disable the full coal armor effect             b enablefullcoalarmoreffect false

we receive our data from a third party that supplies versions  starting with 0   for one of our indexes  we only care about the most recent version of a given resource  but need to be able to support reloading old data  mapping changes  etc    in order to ensure we're only keeping the latest  regardless of order received  we've gone with indexing using  external_gte    our process simply ignores the versionconflictexception that gets returned when attempting to add an older version   it has worked rather well for us   periodically  we'll need to delete data  for a variety of reasons   these are one off deletes  usually related to expiring license agreements and such  and are separate from any versioning scheme   historically we've just manually done a delete by query to handle these cases  which has served us well until recently

edit  the name of the file originally was  pm pu 1027 t a1 fastq  rather than  sample fastq   i've posted here differently because i didn't think it would be relevant 
i mean that when service_a call service_b  service_a create a span named span_ab as a bridge between service_a  and service_b  then service_b has a parent span named span_ab and a local span span_b  when the request is over   service_b record the last log at methed below       because span_b has a parent span sanp_ab it always goes to the branch 'if  parent    null   ' and mdc remain it until gc yet  it does't matter at most time but i think  it will be better if we can clear mdc by hand it's just my advise 
 nedtwigg when i run    gradlew spotlesscheck  straight after running    gradlew clean  and thoroughly cleaning all build folders  it doesn't seem to produce  build spotless diagnose java  at all  the most it generates is  lib build    and  lib extra build    subfolders which just contain the usual suspects   classes     dependency cache     libs   and  tmp     interestingly  cleaning all the build folders and then running    gradlew spotlessapply  runs without problems  it seems that it's just  spotlesscheck  that has a problem

jade is a typo  supposed to be "jadx"  i learned about this bug due to the following situation  i had classes in the same package  one is called z and one is called z  only difference is lower upper case   when running jadx decompiler  not jadx gui  on the apk file on a case insensitive file system  i found out that only the file z java exists  and it holds the content that the file z java should have held  i tried to do the same thing using a case sensitive file system  and found out that neither of the files exist in the package  instead appeared files calle c001 java and c002 java  when i opened the files there was a comment at the beggining      renamed from  package name  z  reason  case insensitive file system      the only way i could make jadx decompile the apk successfully is to run it on a case insensitive system  but have the output folder be mounted on a case sensitive volume

 paolitaclo i was able to resolve this  the reason might be this  for rn v59 x  it is given that we install the latest lottie react native  which might have the referenced libraries that have migrated to androidx  i upgraded the rn to v60 2 and then followed documentation  also  automatic linking didn't work for me   i had to do it manually   be sure read the  upgrade help docs  https   facebook github io react native docs upgrading  before upgrading 
i installed it after  is possible add a check if the playstore is present  and if not show a warning about it  and maybe a link to download a safe apk   not all have installed the playstore   
nice  
no there should be no reason why it's null that i can see    setting adapter code

i assumed it was because while we now clean at most once  it is only if you use either pinning  or access the cleaned certs  we didn't previously clean if it was enough that the ssl handshake code  android or jvm  found a valid chain to the known root ca   and the root ca doesn't need to be in the list provided by the server iiuc   i'll try to prove we use the same certs for verifying   i hope it's not a new bug  prefer it to a broken assumption with self signed certs

from docu  "concave triangle meshes for static world environment  a very efficient way to represent static triangle meshes is to use a btbvhtrianglemeshshape  this collision shape builds an internal acceleration structure from a bttrianglemesh or btstridingmeshinterface  instead of building the tree at run time  it is also possible to serialize the binary tree to disc  see examples concavedemo how to save and load this btoptimizedbvh tree acceleration structure  when you have several instances of the same triangle mesh  but with different scaling  you can instance a btbvhtrianglemeshshape multiple times using the btscaledbvhtrianglemeshshape  the btbvhtrianglemeshshape can store multiple mesh parts  it keeps a triangle index and part index in a 32bit structure  reserving 10 bits for the part id and the remaining 22 bits for triangle index  if you need more than 2 million triangles  either split the the triangle mesh into multiple sub meshes  or change the default in #define max_num_parts_in_bits in the file src bulletcollision broadphasecollision btquantizedbvh h"  i made a thread in their forum  http   www bulletphysics org bullet phpbb3 viewtopic php f 9 t 10547

thank you very much for your fast comment   well  what type of client will be the right one to get both the header information and the bytes  the low level one or the declarative one according to the docs   can you perhaps pass a short example   something like this        client " documents"       public interface documentclient            get "  id "        single httpresponse byte     getdocument long id       
no  i am using 2 0alpha6  
i could do that  but it most likely depends heavily on client's machine  slower computer   bigger lag   bigger detection      so the value that is right for me might be bad for someone else 
ok nice ty   i will try this tomorow morning   did you update the docker container in consequence too

when we do not use a  turnweighting  u turns will not have any cost  because instead of using manual u turn checks the u turn costs are now applied in  turnweighting     is there a need for edge based routing when there are no turn costs   if yes should "no turn costs" also mean "u turns are allowed  and free "   we can probably support this when we remove  turnweighting     #1520   #1820

ok you are correct it is not reproducable all the time   maybe you can try this  it seems to work for me most of the time  1  go to android home screen 2  swipe kontalk away from recent apps history 3  turn your phone into landscape 4  open kontalk 5  open the first conversation in the threads list 6  go back to the threads list 7  again open the first conversation in the threads list 8  press power button to turn display off 9  unlock phone 10  if there is no message that kontalk stopped  repeat steps 6  till 9  until kontalk crashes   all the steps from 3 above should be made in landscape mode  on my phone i have slide to unlock set  maybe this does influence something  so maybe you set slide to unlock when testing 
can't seem to find that option  googling for a setting or something only results in people suggesting to use a custom launcher   when clicking through the settings i did get a notification that i could update from 5 0 2 to 6 0 1  as i said  replacement phone from the shop       so hopefully it'll be fixed after the update   keep you posted   downloading the update over slow work wifi now

definitely a duplicate  sorry guys  i reproduced it on my windows 10 1903 vm after stumbling across this behavior on my production machine 
we are running tests right now   but in fact that it is quite "random" for us   because we are not familiar with jetty's guts  it will take a while confirming the fix   then we will manage the pr

this is crashing when i access a folder on the server  i don't see any logs at  settings admin logging or in  var www nextcloud or in  var log  but i would expect to for a server side problem  since re uploading one of the folders the problem has gone away for that folder  so now the problem is specific to just one certain folder   creating a test account would only work if you had access to this folder  wouldn't it 
hi   my use case is this   1  start request 2  get db connection 3  do some work 4  log something to db on an auxiliary thread  with it's own connection 5  close db connection from 2 6  finish request   log that an auxiliary thread is still running   the db connection from 4 is not closed  the issue is that the db connection will  eventually  get closed when the auxiliary thread ends   my proposed solution is to simply not track connections from auxiliary threads  an option to completely disable db connection leaks would also be fine

hmm  i've tried refreshing f5ing after the "failed to run" message several times today  as well as deleting and recreating an entirely new workspace with the same stack and repeatedly launching that as well  no luck so far  same failure mode every time   is there anywhere else i can look for error logs than that bottom pane that appears while the workspace is starting 
it's related to this issue  which has come up again  https   github com square okhttp issues 869
i am using plugin version 1 4 2 in cordova 5 3 3   i have checked  each scenario by removing all the plugin etc  today  i also have tested it to create separate new fresh app and installed the plugin in both apps  the same issue occurs if we try to install both apps in the same device 
no authentication  i tested this on the website hurl it and was able to make it work there by just putting the discord url in the post line and your template from the json compact notification into the body  didn't change anything on the header and no authentication required 
i'd rather we go with a similar value as ethereum 
the status is that they will not be moved until we have decided how to build them   1  manifest first  tycho pde  2  pom first  maven bundle plugin   how to include them in the user workspace zip archive  if this still makes sense   as all the examples are still in eclipse kura i'd prefer if they all built the same 
my map is a full resolution map using the same procedure as the mapsforge mapcreator  the difference is just that i build the pieces of the map in small chunks and then stitch them together using a c++ program that i wrote to build the world map  the c++ program does not modify any of the coordinates  it only copies the binary data 
   no   why would we do that  it should be made to work properly 
in showcase and in my application  note  i don't use any css of showcase in my application  the problem can be simulated with the code below  tested in firefox 12  internet explorer 9 and chrome    public class testpage implements com google gwt core client entrypoint         the problem appear when the browser width is less than 980px

im not sure as it was another player that did it but im guessing it was 2 or 3 guardians i don't think it was 1
i told my member today that everybody should respect the chunk boundries and i will also give it a last test tomorrow  after deleting the tanks in sp  testwise  it did work  so it should be ok for the update hopefully       the server update is from agricraft 1 7 10 1 3 1  €  i added agricraft in the first weeks of july and most people only use vanilla logs  there was also no mod removed 
i think it changes the javascript too   doesn't appear to be a treeshaking issue 
sorry  i cannot understand your question  explain  please  and  please  note that i found the solution  written in a comment   i cannot change the status  but  it's ok thank you     alessandro   2017 07 15 14 40 gmt+02 00 andrey lomakin  notifications github com

no  unfortunately restarting device or the app didn't make any difference    also i cannot give you logs since it has been deleted after i reinstalled everything from scratch to make things work again  couldn't you reproduce the issue  if there's no other way i still have my backup which i can restore  and thus break my configuration 
hm ok  it's only the steamgameserverapi part that is not working for him  he has "ubuntu mate 1 16 2" installed
yeah  it is still running  i am not able to connect in remote mode using yourkit  can you tell me the steps 
actually  i should have said that the favorites get emptied  after that  there's no other way then to manually add every favorite again   this happened two times  each time at the start of the app  when the app queries the server for station data updates  the first time i  thought it could have been a memory error  device related issue   now i'm trying to understand if it has happened to anybody else  the second time i could actually see the favorites there for half a second  but then  after the update  the tab blanked out saying "no favorites"  il 17 mar 2016 19 05  bruno parmentier notifications github com ha scritto can you provide more details  does it appear and then disappear or does it just never appear  is this only for the favorite stations and not the other tabs   —you are receiving this because you authored the thread reply to this email directly or view it on github

still no fix  c'mon it cant be that hard 
 akarnokd thank you  this was a test to make sure we buffer a lot of data and thought of informing the team  we want to buffer in case of back pressure and not lose data  would the default onbackpressurebuffer   do that  the documentation doesn't mentioning about dropping beyond capacity but in the code it looks like the capacity is 128 and will drop after that 
i tested without ds and sf  and still happened  i'll do some more tests to see what mod is breaking things  the odd thing is that it worked correctly in a similar setup  that had ds and sf   so i'll run a diff between the modlists and see what's different 
the content pack is wwii  the vehicle is su 1 12  this is the line  the date was may 3 2019   and i'll keep it in mind for the future to report bugs separately  in terms of the crash  again  it wasn't i who caught it  my staff reported it to me  i'll eventually go back to check the logs and find the error when it happened and paste it in full  using the teams command to set despawn timer to 0  never  fixed the issue 
yes  that's where we found the bug

when reading  viewcolumn   from view  declared in 312  i see  row        table varchar    when view is defined in 323+  it's  row        "table" varchar    this makes a big difference when we use parser to get the type 
by that i meant we dont have respawnwithclass enabled  thanks again 
ok downloaded 0 17 4     going to try it later when i get home  i was using the previous version
hi joakime  thank for your help so far   we do not use  war files for deployment  our apps are dropped into the webapps folder manually as entire folders  e g     jetty base  webapps examplewebapp    jetty notices the new folder and starts up the webapp as we are used to happening  with jetty 7  removing the  examplewebapp  folder would stop the app as in your video    no  we do have something similar like     jetty base  webapps examplewebapp web inf web xml   is this the same    i'm not sure what that is  sorry    we deploy manually by untarring an app into webapps as a folder and not a  war package   we do have one war file always deployed called root war  which is just a small app to redirect htpp requests to the various webapps we currently have deployed depending on requested hostname 
we do not _need_ it  but since we already have git mirrors on sourceforge  e g  for fiji  we might just as well keep them up to date  no  should be relatively easy  too 
when i am using tracker on my cell phone  if i click on the device that i am trying to track than it saysthe error and it's not moving
oh i see  the resource is responsible for throwing an exception   we were use a textfilereader with an sftp resource   the user we were using to connect to the landing was "locked out"  we were unable to sftp in 
 yegor256 i think there's some kind of intermittency or environmental factors that cause it to fail sometimes  i uploaded the jacoco zip report after having the coverage check fail when solving some conflicts due to updated  master   still  i pushed solved conflicts and saw that travis build did not fail  weird   closing this  will open new issue in case it happens again
if it is of interest i think i have it replicated in a smaller way that you could try it out  the repo is over at  https   github com lukebutters conscrypt jetty basically you need to start that web server send non stop http 1 0 requests to it and very very very slowly the memory just keeps growing   flooey this is the best reproducible case i have so far  i don't know how to make it leak faster sorry   here is a graph of it growing over ten days    leak  https   user images githubusercontent com 7076477 65667175 81d37500 e082 11e9 86ae c0892f870b80 png   i also mentioned this to the jetty users mailing list over at https   www eclipse org lists jetty users msg09100 html

 benas  pascalschumacher thank you  guys  for a quick fix   i tried it and it works very well  closing the issue 
1  singleplayer 2  very accurate 3  sky odyssey  well  i did a restart and it has been good for nearly an hour  not sure if it is fixed  but it seems a bit random  i didn't change anything 
i do not see any errors in the console  no 
aw  hell  i thought i'd edited it with more information   shift clicking a bauble out of its slot is the time it doesn't fire 
i did some quick tests and my assumptions that pmd checkstyle lint would be faster if run alone is incorrect 
yes  as long as i move around the stuttering is pretty much constant and occasionally you can hear the sound cackling or popping 
no matter 
thanks  piotrtomiak  its working now  
that is for "no fill" i think 
please see the usfm or usx reference manual for examples  in ts  psalm 1 1 has this 
thanks   adamretter  i don't think the extra text node is an issue  i have a hard time thinking up a real life scenario in which one would access text nodes by position  and get the wrong one because of this  or count text nodes inside the document element  and get the wrong count   my example is contrived 
i think perhaps an artifact per major findbugs release  so perhaps a new tdd4b2 to support findbugs 2 x  most new minor or bug fix versions of findbugs will not require changes to the testing framework  on jul 4  2013 3 25 am  "graham allan" notifications github com wrote

 vijay murali i have the issue with model 1 9 11  trained on oct  2    and the code i use branched 3 4 days ago from the the master  it shouldn't be too old  right  my code captured the error which was led by 'class0'  this not only makes a bug in core evidence api_calls from_call but also in core evidence types from_call  any more ideas  i can investigate into it more given you're quite busy now  btw  could you direct me to our best javadoc dataset  thanks  
dear lodici    i was actually trying them simultaneously  however  i did try relaunching 1 60 770 and only downloading the playable cards and it still crashed out  i just retried it with the same result   the crash logs are below  in both cases it seem to be the " azorius  thermage”   the playable cards “downloads remaining" counter is at 8610     thanks    ted lorance  crash report for

sure     springhealth zip  https   github com spring projects spring boot files 2686778 springhealth zip     springhealth_2 zip  https   github com spring projects spring boot files 2693773 springhealth zip   just start the application  call  http   localhost 8080 actuator metrics rabbitmq consumed  and u will see the following     the second output is the one i would've expected    
i would say 99  of the time  till now  the story pulled back just once of the many attempts i made     after quite some time that the app was loaded     i get some visual artifact after swiping for refresh  by the story never shows up again  i need to then do a full refresh by swiping down    this is what i see      2016_11_05_08_45_56_08_51_18  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3578197 20030172 ded0d32a a335 11e6 8d58 7a6120acade7 gif 
well  this can be seen as a small subset of #66  but this one is easy to fix  something like if class_name startswith "android support v"    deobfuscate false 
i have done some testing in between my rick and morty binge and set up a new environment with only hqm and found that it may be the mudpack environment that i'm running  ill post logs    fml client latest txt  https   github com lorddusk hqm files 999079 fml client latest txt    that's the log file  too bad most of its enderio failing at finding its translations      running 1 10 2  forge 12 18 3 2185 lwjgl 2 9 1  not that that matters    the only thing that i did right before it started acting up was install veinminer  ill continue testing  maybe there's an incompatibility issue that i cant explain 
the problem seems unique to cyanogenmod  on android 6 0 1 the app functions correctly  i'll post on the cyanogenmod forum   dennis
it's cyaonogenmod 10 1 on the old nexus s from samsung  but as said i don't think anything on the system side is responsible for that  it's only happening the very first time  afterward the application successfully requests the gps fix 
win7 the problem disappears when i close rbtray
i am using the latest version from  here  https   sourceforge net projects javacardopenpgp    i e  revision 13   i also tried the  ykneo opengpg applet  https   github com yubico ykneo openpgp   which resulted in the same problem  as you can see  here  https   github com yubico ykneo openpgp blob master applet src openpgpcard openpgpapplet java#l631   an object called "cipher" is used to compute the signature  this object is initialized  here  https   github com yubico ykneo openpgp blob master applet src openpgpcard openpgpapplet java#l203   using the  cipher  https   jcardsim org jcardsim javacardx crypto cipher html  class  which in my case is implemented by jcardsim    my guess is  that this cipher class behaves differently  concerning the pkcs1 padding  in jcardsim than in the original java card

yes et no i haven't this column  argh    so the databaseversioningservice is bugged 
the only setting box clicked in the gui was to travel east   i have tried with both the directional carriage engine  and by spawning in a carriage engine and trying that to no avail  this is on a template carriage 
yes  but in the latest forge version you get 5 shield icons for botania armor pieces with +5 armor  and you are pretty much invincible with a full botania armor set of any kind

i'm not sure what you mean  call pitest with any non zip file as part of the    classpath  option and it should reproduce 
it's almost like the cpu is being bogged down at consistent intervals  so if a video is playing the video playback will stutter slightly and resume  audio is not affected  same thing with gifs  in which they will stutter slightly  i'll test it tomorrow and give you the timing  the problem is solved by ending the program with task manager 
i'll have to ask my boss next week but i think the answer will be "no"  until then  is there any other information i can provide you with in order to reproduce 
maybe  the code that deals with populating the  gateway_home temp  with the bridge is in ce   i would think that the same bridge would work for both 4 x and 5 x clients  if that is the case  then there wouldn't be any need for separate bridges for ce and ee 
 fickludd here is the consistencty checker report     how can i fix this   
 jandresakis   no  simplecache stays the same    but you will need to clone downloadmanager with changes that will 1  create a new simplecache folder for every download 2  delete cache folder  related to the specific download  from disk when necessary  and you will have to clone downloadservice to make it work with cloned downloadmanager 
yea  i beleive you commited the fix to master

i have intellij 13 1  at the moment i don't have access to plugin version 1 0 2  and in version 1 1 i see the correct error now in "antlr tool output"  didn't know about this before   so the main problem seems to be solved now  the npe appears in event log when i move the slider in "antlr parse tree"   the grammar is following  the problematic label is in rule "avaldis0"  
yes i fully agree with that  we are handling this now outside rah already  however white rabbit should not crash  in this case we use usagi to map a column to a concept_id using the overview table of white rabbit     i do not have the message myself  it was reported to me 
 javanna you are right   this is a perl issue   it silently converts  23 0  in the json into an integer  which is why it logged the integer in the trace logs    apologies for the noise   i'll probably have to work around this with a range check 
thanks a lot i will synchronize this pr later 
 tobiaskaminsky i've sent you a mail
tested this  removing the style xml file makes the map visible again   so it is the map style files which are not working   to test this i changed the style file name so that it did not match the openandromaps  map file name  the map became visible  i changed the name so that it did match the  map file name  the map vanished  i changed the name again  and added a new different style file with a filename which matched the  map file name  the map vanished  i changed the name of the map style file and the map reappeared  during this process i did a full exit of geopaparazzi often    these are map style files   xml  which i use currently in oruxmaps  i tested them again today and they are working in oruxmaps  i believe that previously they were working in geopaparazzi too  but i didn't use geopaparazzi properly yet so i may be mistaken 
ok  so removing fastcraft fixed the problem   which is a problem  because fastcraft has done wonders for helping to improve my server performance especially with terrain gen   is removing fastcraft going to be the only way i can use forge essentials moving forward 
it's pretty random  but i have it again today  it only happens when someone joins   meanwhile  placeholderapi is updated in this error  https   hastebin com lapurotozo sql

yes  the plane was able to move outside of the hangar  i had even thought that an aircraft can't move when standing on steel scaffolding slabs  i had replaced them with a vanilla wool  but this did not help 
workaround is already provided in the original message
i just cloned the repo and ran mvn clean install  5 22 1  on che plugin git ext plugin on  a windows machine  but if you cannot confirm that behaviour  i will try again on a linux with a fresh setup  there are no exceptions just most of the tests are ignored   all those that derive from basetests which uses the mockitojunitrunner   
thank you  it worked   good question which version it is  how do i check this 
i got the debug build working for ubuntu 16 docker instance  host   ubuntu 14 04     thanks for quick help from babneet 
to reproduce it is if you have another mod installed with a tank  like extra utilities drums  try rightclicking the drum with the oil bucket  or if there is oil in there because of pump  it can't find the bucket for the fluid 
yes  content and apps were installed    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 3184018 75188077 5bcd0200 5700 11ea 998d 655f4108a196 png

natively   the steps are  1  open a workspace   maybe do some work  2  in the dashboard  close the workspace   often  it will not close  and you have to forcibly stop che    the cli will show something like    1  restart che if needed  and re open workspace  2  sometimes  the issue will occur   if not  stop the workspace again and restart it   the issue can usually be reproduced consistently   after i successfully reproduce the issue  simply stopping the workspace again and restarting it will fix it 
hi  for those fonts i explained above  any string with japanese characters fails  so i think it is a problem of the metadata of the fonts or something  you can take as an example  私はたろうです。 as i said  a couple of very heavy fonts such as takaopgothic can do the job  but they are big and i am afraid of outofmemoryerror  actually at this moment i am programming a kind of music editor and with your framework i can only export the music file to pdf with the music file closed  if it is open  and the editor is showing many visual components  i get the outofmemoryerror the second or 3rd time i export the file to pdf 
yep  works fine now  thanks for the quick response 
deegree version is 3 3 18  i would rather have a fix for 3 3 x than wait around for 3 4 since we are planning to make use of deegree for our national public delivery of datasets with wfs 2 0 and gml 3 2 1
hmm  it's not happening anymore  that means it's more complicated than i thought   i'll see if i can reproduce it and get back to you   edit  i think this may have already been fixed 
i thought that would be clear by    as this is an issue which sporadically appears  at least i haven't found a pattern yet  i cannot give you a set of instructions to replicate this with with 100  certainty 
it's for a little demo i'm doing  it allows listing the instances of a given app on a local gui  the workaround is to use  api eureka applications  and the filter per application name  it works 
i am on the latest  15 8 7
hey  edmundoa  i sent you the dump over email  looking forward for a fix  upgrading production is on hold because of this  thank you 
confirmed firefox 70 0 1   after further investigation  i've observed that prior to upgrading linux webdriver to v13  a process called _geckodriver_ opens on a random high order port when you use the launch browser button  and zap makes the connection to it  then the browser starts   however after upgrading linux webdriver to 13  geckodriver does not start and does not start a random listening tcp port   then zap times out trying to connect to the non existent port and the logs show a connection timeout   zap log below showing timeout

ok seems like i was a bit hasty when pinning down the issue and creating an example this morning   there is a reproducable issue but it is has nothing to do with slices but with maps  assignment to struct fields of map entries is legal if the entry is referred to by a pointer   code ro reproduce  for real this time      apologies for leading you in thr wrong direction and thanks in advance for the fast responses and the   awesome   plugin   edit  plaground link  https   play golang org p uucu_on98l
good question  maybe an "open file as new tab in current project" option is missing  too 
the block was placed about a day before any issues were noticed  but probably closer to 20 hours before it would actually happen  the version was 1 7 0 72  also there were 548 072 light entries in that tag  so 255 seems like a more  ah  reasonable number   thank you for the quick fix   
it should    closing this one  will reopen it in lightblue rest 
i'm just kinda newbie with git repos and all  but i could give it a try

hi cesar  thats happen in react native 0 55 0   and also happen with '  variant release'  is there a suggestion of compatibility with some version of react native  thanks
 ingmargoudt  i've had it happen twice during two different edh games 
it's m_product_bom_id varchar 40 
because it could be problematic in the future for servers that are taking longer to update  it would prevent players from playing entirely for a period of time  so i prefer to still inform  in case the bug isn't fixed by the update itself   
yeah  i have the same version of the helper extensions  i must be doing something wrong  also re sideloaded a new version of the release apk  re enabled dev tools  and still getting the timeout  hrm  i'll look more tomorrow   also  cc  joshmarinacci for discussions on using dev tools w  fxr
thanks for the quick reply   it's a work project  and it has happened on two unrelated projects   let me see if i can get a minimal working reproduction

 danielleberre sorry for the confusion  let me explain a little bit more with an example   assume we have the following folder   gopath  └── src     └──  test_project          ├── a go         ├── b go         ├── coverage xml         ├── report xml         ├── sonar project properties         ├── sonar scanner properties         └── test xml  and a go is    package main  import   	"fmt"    func main     	foo   	fmt println "vim go"      while b go is   package main  import   	"fmt"    func foo     	fmt println "in foo"      after we generated the coverage xml  report xml and test xml  and then run sonar runner successfully  we will see the uncovered lines is unexpected       coverage   uncovered lines   uncovered conditions                   a go   0 0    10   – b go   0 0    9   –   as we can see  uncovered lines in a go should be 2  and b go should be 1   so  when a certain package contains no test files  each lines of the packages will calculated as uncovered lines  and that is not corrected

the key problem is unexpected filtering by 'order by' clause  if it filters null value with 'ignorenullvalues  true'  i can say it doesn't fix the issue  maybe i can accept it as a work around   anyway i'll test this in 2 2 and feedback

 msand unfortunately since i cannot reproduce locally  i'm not very keen on deploying a non stable version of this lib to them to validate the fix  i'm downgrading to  6 5 2  for now  hopefully we'll find a way to reproduce with the version 7
currently i don't have a code sample  the problem occurs in our code which has too many dependencies to easily create a code example    anyway  i think the following problem happens      we get an event and determine  that the queue is full   we call subscripiton unsubscribe   https   github com msemys esjc blob master src main java com github msemys esjc catchupsubscription java#l176   the closed "event" was already enqeued in the queue   the queue processes the close "event"  sets the atomic boolean and returns  closing the queue processing thread  https   github com msemys esjc blob master src main java com github msemys esjc catchupsubscription java#l250   the queue is now empty  i e  not full anymore    the atomic boolean guarding the queue is not set to false   now  a new event appears on the volatile queue   why this happens is the interesting part  it might be that the unsubscribe   call has not completed  yet  or that the volatile subscription has a similar issues that a close does not prevent events from being delivered      the queue is empty  so the event can be added     the processing queue is restarted by line https   github com msemys esjc blob master src main java com github msemys esjc catchupsubscription java#l180  i think the last line might be the underlying cause of the bug  why is it there in the first place  processing should already have been started on line https   github com msemys esjc blob master src main java com github msemys esjc catchupsubscription java#l215 so line 180 seems redundant to me  maybe there is a border case i cannot see right now which requires this line    tell me  if you can agree with this reasoning

you've described that correctly  but for example even if the report "every 7 " does not hit exactly 100   i think that the framework should always report 100  status in the end of measurement  when it terminates executor   in my case the most often used measurement is just the last measurement  which is used for comparisons  if this will be fixed  i think i would get a bit more consistent numbers

e g     then i replaced  camelcase  named properties with  snake_case  named  e g   requestcontext  with  request_context   and came a step further in the code   but just from reading the code  with very basic knowledge of micronaut  it seems  that the global  objectmapper  is used for parsing json into  awsproxyrequest  which then lead to errors when i change the jackson config in  application yml

apologies  i wasn't clear  in the example code i sent  the lunch break is given a small  20 minute  window in which it can be "delivered"  this would  at least i think  make it more likely that routes are generated with the lunch break unassigned  thus causing the cost penalty override to be applied  you could give the lunch break a wider window in which it can be taken and the problem still occurs  though   in practical terms  it is more important to insert a break than a job for legal compliance  the cost of a break not being in the route should be  and i think is in the current code  disproportionately high   with the random component to the problem appearing  i'm trying to identify "special" measures the code takes which then gives the break location an identity  in localactivityinsertioncostscalculator  you appear to have initially added some provision for breaks being handled differently  perhaps you had something in mind here as a problem

that reasoning is correct  but the behaviour does not follow that exactly  sometimes the ui shows a panel as selected  e g  the focus is in the filter box  but ctrl+w wont close it unless an issue is selected in that panel  yes  closing a panel should move focus to another panel

no  it did not resolve the issue  i'll contact slack support see what they have to say  maybe they have a test account you can use 
no  i don't have any ideas on how to check this    it might be fine if the exception is just wrapped with another internalerror with a different message though  if the filename of the offending class is included in the message it is trivial to diagnose the problem  that will already help tremendously

oh  indeed  double checked and googled   found this answer https   stackoverflow com questions 14318921 toast is not shown on samsung galaxy s3 latest update 4 1 2 and for some reason in settings i had "blocked" for c geo notifications  when i changed it toasts appeared again  so now it looks fine   then i would suggest to reformulate this issue to kind of feature request "inform user that there will be no toasts if notifications are blocked"  probably you could check this value from the app and notify user somehow  on the main screen or additional dialog maybe   because it was not obvious that i need to go to notification settings for that

hi  janpio  i appreciate your responsiveness   i have yet to actually experiment with using alternative jdk implementations for cordova android development  i thought i would ask here first to see if there was already official guidance because i thought that this topic may have already been discussed given its legal financial implications       i'm not certain if a version of openjdk would work for cordova android or if there's an implicit dependency on the oracle implementation  if an openjdk version will work  what distribution will work the best  i wonder if we could somehow use the openjdk that comes with android studio  if it's jdk 8  or if it would need to be installed separately or require a different distribution  perhaps desirable for decoupling android studio from being a cordova android requirement    i may not get much time to investigate this for the next couple of months given higher priorities  however  if anyone else who comes across this thread has insight to share  please don't be afraid to comment

hi francisco   those changes to work with the new api are in our code  we read ckan contents to show them in a browser   not in cygnus ckan  i am sorry about the noise   we are using cygnus ckan without any changes and configure to publish in demo ckan org  i have tested 0 8 2 and develop branches  and both have the same issues   thanks for the quick response 
this is my whole adapter code    for testing purpose i directly use false in is enable method       private class myadapter extends swipeadapter  
having the code    when button is clicked the dataprovider filters the items and all items except  a  are available to select  but combobox lose the value  selecteditems  
video i would could do  but render + uploading video on youtube is too long   so here's step by step guide   1  go to   survival   mode 2  take _"bound blood drop"_ in your   left   hand 3  go to any source of blood  for example  blood infuser  4  take blood from this source  shift + right mouse button   if that doesn't work  try to turn on auto filling mode in bound blood drop

note  that i have some of  gitignore in nested folders     1st file   
 tonihei thanks for the update  i'd really appreciate  ojw28 input as this freeze causes failures in some of my unit tests 
 dizzzz use the jar installer  then launch exist via the start menu  using the launcher    i have no idea if 32 bit is relevant here  but shutting down the machine definitely used to work on this very same machine with existdb 2 2  same java8  same setup 
that works fine   great work 
coolpad 5560s  i use it for tinkering with android  mostly

 eivantsov and  sleshchenko thank you for pointing me in the right direction   i have been able to dig deeper over the past couple of days into this and been able to achieve some progress   the pods were not being created by the infra provider even though the che logs stated the workspaces were being created  i found that this whole issue was mainly due to this  method  https   github com eclipse che blob a2473aee7545392eaeab4b3b0e3d8f1e464db110 wsmaster che core api workspace src main java org eclipse che api workspace server workspacesharedpool java#l42  which uses the the value  che workspace pool exact_size  https   github com eclipse che blob a2473aee7545392eaeab4b3b0e3d8f1e464db110 assembly assembly wsmaster war src main webapp web inf classes che che properties#l58  to determine how many threads are created for asynchronous workspaces tasks  eg  starting stopping   by default this value is set to number of cores 2   if a lot of workspaces are created  they sort of pile up since the no  of workspaces is larger than the number of threads that can be created  and before the pods are even created and the workspace start is actually carried out  a lot of them exceed the  che infra kubernetes workspace_start_timeout_min  https   github com eclipse che blob a2473aee7545392eaeab4b3b0e3d8f1e464db110 assembly assembly wsmaster war src main webapp web inf classes che che properties#l352  causing the above errors and workspace start failures    the logs on the other hand do not reflect this internal queuing up and workspaces and only say  starting workspace 'admin workspace name' with id 'workspace id' by user 'admin'  before proceeding to throw the error  failed to start kubernetes runtime of workspace workspace id  cause  waiting for kubernetes environment 'default' of the workspace'workspace id' reached timeout    not sure if the logs can be made more verbose and accurate but that would probably help 
  yes it is   
forgot  of course i have the messagelisteneradapter beans configured as well in my  redisconfiguration      sorry but i cannot really provide a reproducible test case now as this error takes weeks  sometimes months to happen and this project is not open source  if i reduce it to a just the redis part i'd not know if the error is still in there as it would have run months in production before that and even after months it would not be clear that the error will never happen again  but the redis pub sub part is basically not more than i just posted here   would it make sense to provide some state of the  messagelisteneradapter  beans as soon as this happens  what would be useful info 
i updated it anyway  i know some of these may be duplicates but it's a chore to try and search each one when minecraft and chrome are lagging your computer as it is 😆
unfortunately  i did not notice a certain pattern  i got a new phone about 2 weeks ago  during this time  this appeared 4 times  this happened both when using the "nextcloud" application itself  and while using other applications  once this error report arose simply when i looked at the screen without launching any applications  in the phone settings  the application is allowed to work in the background 
yes  the installation on my server runs fine since months  i am using oc 5 0 7 and the app is 1 4  i get messages like this in the apache log while verifying the url  get  owncloud status php http 1 1" 200 77 propfind  owncloud remote php webdav http 1 1" 401 291
i am sorry that i reply so late  this phenomenon does not only occur in time_12  it also happens in the repair process of math_85  the buggy program from defects4j  i am not sure but personally i think that math_85 is fully deterministic   the details are as follow  i set the   maxtimetype as 30 seconds  it is originally 5 minutes but i think it is kind of long so i set this to 30 seconds   however  the it costs more than twice the 30 seconds to repair the faulty statement  and unexpectedly  it doesn't generate plausible patch when repair the faulty statement    the output information is as follow   "the repaired suspicious statement  org apache commons math analysis solvers univariaterealsolverutils   198 suspiciousvalue  0 058823529411764705 the repair time for this statement is  64688ms"  another failed repair output is   "the repaired suspicious statement  org apache commons math analysis solvers univariaterealsolverutils   198 suspiciousvalue  0 058823529411764705 the repair time for this statement is  19794ms"  the repair time is less than 30s in this case   but these failed repair trails  where nopol repair the faulty statement but do not generate the expected patch  just account for a very small percentage  for instance 2 out of 100 in math_85   so this strange phenomenon about the nopol repair still puzzles me  can these failed trails be interpreted as a small bug of nopol   thank you for your answer and guidance 
for persistent queries   so it deletes all the repartition topics and changelogs  this is racy  which might explain why we don't hit this in dev environments  adding some details now 
a quick chat with  wilkinsona indicates that the problem is likely to be around the dependency on a   snapshot    our guess is that aether is trying to resolve a newer version of the dependency using the _entire_ repository chain   since trying to run a  grab   offline  against   snapshot s  that have been populated into     m2   but nowhere else is probably an edge case  i'm going to close out the issue   at some point you guys are going to have to deal with the on prem case  access to internal repositories  but not external   but there's no need for that to be today

no cache  and of course i waited  apps like side bars  home flip  side bar etc    for those apps it's not a big deal since they need to know which apps are installed in order to do their work  but if they can do it even if they have been restricted some others can as well 
one character of my password is the   symbol  i already assumed that this may influence the problem  so i ran some test  i created a new vault and set the password to 123 1 then i could reproduce the same behaviour as i mentioned before  i'm running cryptomator under macos 10 11 6  15g1217   i tried the same on a windows 7 machine and could not reproduce this problem    i tested a second case where i set the password to 123  so that the   symbol was the last character  this time i didn't have any problem unlocking the vault  the only weird thing was that some time i need to press the space key to get the   symbol and some times cryptomator added it without pressing the space key  this behaviour wasn't changing after a restart of cryptomator

unfortunately we can't remove it since we have other code that depends in this library which doesn't compile if we remove it from the classpath  what version _should_ we use 
i haven't gotten this error with mapdb   doing some investigation  having removed all the records from mongodb_ crawler  data base and deleted previously the  work  folder where the  progress latest status mongodb_32__40_crawler_41___mongodb_32__40_crawler_41_ job  file will be created   a  i run the crawler with     i got the result  reference s  processed  94 document_committed_add  50 read timed out  37 rejected_canonical  7 documents in mongodb  94  so it only seems to fail with the first url  finally i have deleted the mongodb_ crawler  data base and run the crawler with    url http   www federacionpiraguismodeextremadura com  url   but still get the status file error  don't know what the problem is with this url 
i don't know about develop  as i don't currently have my environment up  but i can reproduce this on dvn build  dataverse internal  and demo  hopefully that's enough to conclude we have a problem somewhere

i'm not quite sure what it should be  but i feel like it should be atom only   this is a part of my grammar     there is a method call atom in ufqparser class  not anything like setatom  expratom or phraseatom   thanks
i don't think it happens every time for her  when we get a new beta build out i can ask her to try and reproduce it

i am using "pi4j core 1 0 jar"  let me try 1 1 snapshot  thanks again for quick response 
no we can not do that  at least not so easy   but cant we catch illegal characters  

i will check those test cases  in the mean time here is the link  if you want to check my class which throws these errors  https   github com ssatguru vishva blob master src main java org ssatguru babylonjs vishva java#l2356  https   github com ssatguru vishva blob master src main java org ssatguru babylonjs vishva java#l2356  if your run "mvn generate sources" on this project you will see exactly where the errors are happening   https   github com ssatguru vishva  https   github com ssatguru vishva 
we didn't convert from jax rs to spring  but we do use spring quite extensively for run time configuration  disabling the spring web module fixed the issue for us  thank you 
it was multiplayer  i havent been able to test it again after a server restart though
fixed by merge in 2 2 0
i'm using ro as a test file since it has a handful of imports  this is all in clojure  but it shouldn't make a difference since it's using the same methods    i threw in a quick  save ontology  method  and converted the obo format to rdf xml  and there are no import statements   here's what i'm starting with

10000 consumers leads to the oom happening quite quickly for standard configuration and one topic   no partitions  messages were about 200 bytes and rate is "as fast as possible"  we did not use pulsar perf  with each producer sending 1000 messages 
you are right    the following error is repeated several times in  stdout zalenium hub log     i am running docker for mac 1 12 1   this error is most likely due to us not using the "latest"  docker selenium  release  we are using "2 53 1z" instead  which is the last selenium 2 release 
no errors on startup or  zh reload further testing has show no issues with new horse spawns on 1 11 2  it only seems to happen to horses that were previously spawned with version 1 6 1 on 1 10 2 with " zh spawn horse tamed" i cant even remove them from the database with  zh admin 
looks like it part of the problem  myhandlercache seems to be binding correctly at startup  and deadbolthandler is there  but when it encounters  subjectpresent in the controller  deadbolthandler is now null

sadly no  it happens in our own project  i will look into it and come back to you 
the only way we could balance the preassure was to run lines of redstone dust all about  and even then it seemed that the pressure guage tube addon seems to cap out at 15 redstone power when it hits 8 psi     which when you need ideally 15 for chargers its better to have it just vent lol to the mod author  please re think easter eggs that cause performance hits as bad as this  your mod is awsome but i spent nearly 2 hours last night trying to find what mod was causing the error with yours  i mean no offense by this    and im kicking myself i didnt think to look through the code for easter eggs
as an investor in both mycelium and steem  i'd like to insist on this feature to be fixed and not have those coins ignored 
hi  sengsational   some phones can have dark mode during the evening   with the new q release you can turn dark mode on for all uses and apps  i don't know if all have this beta installed  if not then i can look into it     best regards daniel
no  the  autocorrect  feature is disabled  just installing and enabling the detekt plugin is enough to break save actions 
sorry  it was my fault  i thought it's not the connection because another signal user told me he has the same problem  but this router blocks voip  this was the problem  i still didn't get a debug report 
oh sorry  my description is wrong  this is the correct  placing the ores above a stair  or any half block  the mcmmo plugin has the chance to dupe the block  instead of the player has placed it  it was suposed to happen just with natural ores found  not placed by players

i have tried testing the issue again but i can't seem to reproduce the issue   the steps i took were  1  launch app 2  select any novel chapter 3  move the page a bit 4  open running app page  my zenfone has a dedicated button to it  5  close baka tsuki  6  launch app 7  open to previous chapter with "resume novel" or manually  at the time this issue was happening every time but now it doesn't  i am still using the same android and app version  let me know if you need more details 
 gsmet    just updated  its v1 2 0 final
without a shader it is not completely gone but it also happensjust occasionally  i also strangely had the stack overflow error without a shader for the first time during this test  so it might still correlate with that opengl thing

the problem was i think because i changed the id of the bundle when i updated the modpack  but not sure  the logs with the mods are in here http   pastebin com zmaiijdy  now i cant confirm that the issue is still happening because i replaced all bundles in that base and i updated the mod since then   so the issue i think is outdated

it's not quite clear to me atm   we're experiencing that documents are randomly not being released by some stages   that might be a bigger issue though   to mitigate this we're resetting their states by modifying their state in mongo if they have been stuck too long  this is done in a rather naive way  so unfortunate reset can lead to this  but i'm not sure

hi  laserson   yes  it is working now   thank you very much for your help 
what i wanted is a behavior as an e g  when you have gdb or firefox or any program running from the console or command prompt  unlike say torbrowser launcher which detaches the window and doesn't allow any sort of debugging  the command prompt allows for knowing what is happening  something like this      this is a partial thread from a gdb instance running some program  i am more comfortable when things are attached to the command prompt rather than having a swing terminal window  it just feels more natural and probably is more easier to understand debug  does that make sense  
oh indeed   i wondered why i had been finding it more annoying than usual  but it's just because i've been working more in   rmd 
 davideas first of all  thanks a lot for looking into this   what we would like to do with this list is that after loading the requested set of items  page  on screen startup  load the previous page as well automatically and add to the top  so user can start scrolling upwards if they liked to  it's currently disabled  but you can enable it in our app by uncommenting this line   link  https   github com schedjoules android event discovery sdk blob f143950f9decad808a5e493a0a217bc3647ea17f eventdiscovery sdk src main java com schedjoules eventdiscovery eventlist itemsprovider eventlistitemsproviderimpl java#l317 l317   and then use "event discovery 10 days from now" button on main screen  so in this case it's independent from scrolling  we would like to add those items without any user interaction  using a progress item on top and bottom is already in our backlog to implement  not sure if that would solve this though  maybe i will try   looking at your example to reproduce it in your demo app i realized that the header is not added to the list  which i also found in bold in the wiki afterwards  i totally missed it  it says  _"  the header item doesn't have to be added directly to the list  "_  does it mean that it must not be added  they are currently added in our app  i tried to remove them now but then they are not shown   tried to play with setdisplayheadersatstartup   enablestickyheaders   showallheaders    maybe i just miss some order  if you say it's better not to add them  i will try to update after comparing with your demo   maybe i will also try to build from your branch with the partially fix commit to see if that simply fixes our issue 
testing without ar is too impacting  would be easier if sponge booted in single player 
yup  verified fixed  haven't pinpointed the change that did it  but good enough for me 
hi twillouer   thanks a lot  it works great   i will live with this patched version for now  when do you plan to release a new version including this patch  
i deployed rc5 back  on rc5 there is no gray bar and it is not auto scrolling down    i have tried both internet explorer and chrome  same behaviour     edit  description was vague 
 ncorai i think so 
i have downgraded thermal  v  5 2 4 8   forge  v  13 20 0 2345  and codechikenlib  v  2 7 0 268   and i removed draconic and now everything works again   i think the problem is releated to codechikenlib 3 0 0 274  it's required by draconic and thermal 
it's start sucessfull
sure  the output is        +  no known vulnerabilities found

the thing is i cannot recreate the failure in a sample case  i was hoping on you giving me an advice on when one would get this problem so i can fix it  do you think this could be jmockit bug or rather my own code issue

yep  removed all mods to check again  issue is still present  could it be the version of forge or codechickenlib  edit  it's not the codechickenlib version  issue's still there  also noticed https   gyazo com 0e74fa8eb854c9ed21a1d7cd91af503d arms are  a bit wonky  edit 2  not the forge version either  it's solely the mod itself

yes forcing doesn't really change anything  something odd going on    i eventually manage to open things and create a project to work on but sometimes it requires several attempts of closing the software and opening it again   bit random  i've tried the same files on 0 2 0 m2 and m3  this happens only in m3   regarding the projects  would it not be possible for qupath to create some sort of temporary project automatically when it requires it  which would be deleted if the image gets closed

so in other words  the ticket title should go back to "503 should be retriable"  but without all the jazz about load balancers  separately  do we want to give advice about _how_ to run atlas in an ha configuration  e g  don't use load balancers

i've retested with the most recent version  115  and that fixes the item duplication problem   
i'll support as much i can  sure 👍   will have a look into    
well primarily  i am looking to pass all read writes to the disklrucache through encryption decryption streams   facebook has made a surprisingly efficient library called conceal that must have had an enormous amount of manpower to develop  it is extremely fast and i have successfully implemented and integrated a file encryption class that utilizes conceal to wrap disklrucache   it is fast and works on every device i've seen   so if there is an opportunity to expose the raw input output streams to disklrucache in your new implementation  it should be possible to hook in libraries like these   i would gladly contribute if you all think this is possible 
i have the widget on my home screen  sometime it needs to be re added because it is no longer there 
 timtay microsoft yes  messages are delivered correctly to the hub  only thing was it was not showing it on the metrics for storage but when i dug deep into the db directly i could see those messages    but sometimes it goes to infinite loop and i couldnot see those messages in the hub then    protocol  mqtt authentication  x509  apologies i couldnot check the logs on using the different protocol but yes  will surely do when time permits  thanks shubanker

i haven't tried an uninstall by running any kind of official uninstalled  just deleted the arduino app  and redownloaded  is there a more in depth uninstall process i am missing  i could try removing the resource folder that is created in documents  and seeing if that helps    they are clones  but they are exact hardware duplicates as far as the micro processors are included  so not sure why that would be an issue  but i'll check with some official copies as well   the other user reported that he successfully flashed some of his and i tried on multiple copies  with the same result   but i will verify on official non clone boards    thanks 
 zacblanco thanks for the answer  # the case is not necessarily recurring  and it only happens on alluxio 2 0 0 snapshot  after alluxio runs for a while  produces files on s3 or oss  then alluxio ls  f to update the alluxio meta 
updated to latest 0 4 9 5 still default java coffee cup  no bitsquare icon
that would be one possible approach however given how the code is structured in  exec    i am not sure this is the best way

i fixed it  bridge blocks can now only place blocks that endermen can place  which unfortunately includes tnt  so i added a config option to ban tnt from bridge blocks 
it is very desirable to allow multiple loads to support components that must consume messages from multiple schemas   that is why we are using otf decoder in that case  so we don't need to deploy multiple sets of generated code   it would seem that header would always have to be the same for otf to work  in summary  i think it is okay to only store one header  but just don't leak when the same header definition is loaded from multiple files 
here is a pastbin file of the config   http   pastebin com hkd3ezuq  if is definitely not working properly  whenever i attempt to fix it by removing the duplicate spaces and text it reverts to this upon restart  then on the next restart another copy of the top is added  so every time the server restarts it duplicates everything in the config file

my bad  the problem was caused by having both redhat vscode xml and gorkem vscode xml extensions installed  vscode couldn't know one was the evolution of the other  closing
no  please not  keywords should describe the content of the document and not some state in jabref  they are understood  although often not printed  by biblatex  so i would even vote against making keyword synchronization the default option  special fields can be easily filtered out by biblatex  but modifying the keyword field to not contain "prio3" etc  is very difficult  what was the reason to introduce the sync with the keyword field

yes its still got some bugs for me  when ever someone issues the command  tictactoe accept  playername  by pressing the words in the chat  it will work but it will seed them an unknown command message for some reason  also if player 2 who received an invite to play from player 1 accepts then leaves mid game     if player 2 then invites player 1 to a game  when player 1 presses accept  it will say that he doesn't have a pending request from player 2   this is really hard to explain  i tried to show in the video  im now running the latest version  14 and its still having issues  even if both players are op'ed with all privileges    im happy to arrange a time for you to come on my server and see for yourself if that helps

dear marc   i can gladly share the fasta  it's a mix of uniprot entries from various species and entries from homd  human oral microbiome database   i've created custom headers a la searchgui style  e g  " generic 001r_frg3g"  since they were not uniform  there are some redundant amino acid sequences in the fasta  but unique accession numbers  the file is 1 3 gb in size  i can send you a "wetransfer" unless you have a better way    i've also been having trouble with searchgui  which might be due to the file storage solution on the server   but i double checked and used an mgf   comet pep xml file that had no issues completing   thank you for your support    best  david

dubbo作为一个严谨的框架，既然hessian1未废弃，就应当保持一致性，因为其他人可能在使用。  这是我第3次看到dubbo的master，合并到主干时未考虑兼容性。  建议先完成：功能性审核，再讨论代码样式和规范。
maybe yes

this is what the user sees in 7 3  i'm sure we can do better in the time remaining     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 25067106 54539614 d88e2280 496c 11e9 9ea0 e89ba6fe6aff png 
seems to have used 2000 lp when i tested just now  but the op from the sevtech issue states it used 1000  so not a dupe on my end  but still annoying 
source here   and with my test this source can run in btrace 1 3 8 3 no exception    package com sun btrace samples   import com sun btrace annotations    import static com sun btrace btraceutils      btrace unsafe true  public class allmethods        onmethod          clazz "com bt pjg game backpack backpackservice"          method "    "  		location  location value kind sync_entry            public static void m             print "entered sync"         	 	 onmethod          clazz "com bt pjg game backpack backpackservice"          method "    "  		location  location value kind entry            public static void m2             print "entered run"          
well  my guess would be that it makes the underlying assumption for the parametric checking  no changes in graph structure due to parameter changes  the result of inserting the parameter values result in a dtmc  i e   outgoing transitions sum to 1  easier to enforce  i e   if you have     it would implicitly treat that as  p  p+q   and  q  p+q   which maintains the second assumption automatically  the first assumption  no graph changes  would not hold for   p+q    0  but that is currently not checked   reported   however  arguably  the solution would not actually be a solution in the sense that you could plug in any value in the valid region as a constant into the prism model file and obtain a working model that satisfies the property    i guess that should be documented  or we could have two modes  one with normalization and one without and then actually determine the constraints on the parameters where both assumptions are actually valid 
 modwizcode yes  similar to what i would consider damage in the sense of a minecart  player punches which could possibly cause destruction of the object  except with armor stands  destruction is guarenteed  
 mauvecloud  that whole loop from line 122 makes that  and if you want  try it out yourself  i built 15   15   15 cleanroom  and on start it wasn't working  altough everything was correct  then placed cables from bottom  where my engraver is to the top  where filter casings are and it magically started working   p s  if exactly  check this condition  it checks if it is tile entity  https   github com blood asp gt5 unofficial blob unstable src main java gregtech common tileentities machines multi gt_metatileentity_cleanroom java#l128
so i did try out your image  installing the rpm packages you mentioned and during the startup it already lost the network connectivity   however i did not try with the oracle jvm  i will install it and re try 
i've tried the new release  and the issue remains unresolved  please see the attached asciidoc file that exhibits this issue  again  when publishing from the toolbar to html  the plantuml diagrams are not displayed in the html output  but publishing to pdf does what is expected  i'm also not setting imagesdir in the document    getting started with asciidoc txt  https   github com asciidoctor asciidoctor intellij plugin files 4255281 getting started with asciidoc txt 
i  would love to  but i am swamped   i barely had enough time to diagnose this problem  furthermore  i am not sure how the new method that handles it should behave     should it store the data     if so   where   how   when will it be read    i did not check if s3browser asks for it    
that's a good question  i didn't test that yet  it's used in an android app currently  i might try to make a basic java project to test that 
the sdk version is 19 i just change linearlayout to scrollview and here my code thank you 
sent you pr with test and bug fix
very simple example  test it on desktop and ipad ipad simulator  resolution is the same  but on ipad it's filled on the screen and on desktop it has black bars on top and the bottom  also try to tap the screen and check the logs  you will quickly see that touches work only on area  which stage should be drawn  but somehow it's stretched  ipad ofc  desktop is all right    here's a link  http   www69 zippyshare com v 82635937 file html using last nightly robovm and the same for libgdx 
define "latest build" for me  in version 2 0 21 evokers revert to evoker_fangs upon reload    i downloaded another of the latest version and i can't reproduce this "freaking out glitch" anymore  it must have been corrupted    but i can confirm that evokers disappear on reload     edit  i recreated the freaking out glitch    i will have a video later on how to reproduce this for you    it does not show any data in console when this happens either   
 geoand  right    some of the examples include integration tests  there are other cases  that might not justify an example and those cases are handled directly inside the the annotation module  see #66    i guess that similar to #66 we could use the invoker plugin to simulate the command line experience 
i made a fresh mvn clean    mvn package on master of spring boot  used it with my app and now it works as expected  great    i am   was using rc3 before 
hi samuel  i tried to implement such new support  but for me  i’m not an expert of filtering  re sampling     it is not so easy  if you want i can send you the work i’ve done so far  hoping it could be useful   anyway i think i found a bug on the ffmpegframerecorder record   method  it seems to ignore final samples in the last frame  so i think to add a record avframe  call in the stop   method if needed   in this way all samples are written in the output file and it is no more truncated  this solved for me   let me now if you are interested in my work and how you prefer to manage it   thank you  regards 
ok i'm sorry  i need to clarify this issue  apparently   it's not that  back isn't doing the correct thing  it is   what's doing the wrong thing is the respawn location when you have backondeath permission   i'm being told the respawn location after death is somewhat random   not sure why that would be  https   pastebin com j8bzr7yu  my recent experience has been to respawn in the last location i had tped to before i'd died last instead of the death location  that    is not very helpful   i don't know if my configuration needs to be updated for changes in a later build to deal with a change or what    death doesn't have to happen  i'm having similar issues just logging back on    and being taken back to the last place i tped to instead of the place i logged out from   this didn't used to happen so    thinking it may be a recent thing 
there is only " the application consulo could not be opened"   i've reinstall os and it worked till i closed the app  when i want to open it the second  situation reapeats 
 aounhaider1  web fonts roboto lightitalic woff  is included in build properties bin excludes  therefore it is not available in the binary build  this was done to reduce the size of the paper ui and this font has not been used before  if we now need it  please remove it from the exclusion list  if we can live without that font  please adapt the code

couldn’t find any logs related to this and i think it’s not happening anymore  closing issue and will come back if it returns  thanks
 lixinchengdu in your example  yes  but you can't do it vice versa
sure   here you go 
i am playing on 1 10 2 and the latest version is from june 6th  2k17 and it's the 2 1 24  and it seems like you can select 2 filters after some restarts and then this bug appears again 
it is ok now  thank you   
oh this could actually be it  i will test it at differently signed coordinates 
i have created a simple test project in https   github com ismakc issue1125  it must be executed twice to get the concurrentmodificationexception  the application creates a peristent hsqldb in the target folder 
the sample code in a new dataflow project is not indented per google code style  it should be     or something close to that 
node version is 6 9 1
test version still shows the same error  i am running on an lg v10  t mobile  usa   stock rom 
it looks to me like it's only making a call to the connection  https   syndesis 192 168 64 28 nip io api v1 connections 5 actions sql stored connector  i think it needs to call the integration endpoint  https   syndesis 192 168 64 28 nip io api v1 integrations  id   and you're right that the 'procedurename' property is coming back encoded      looking into that 
i use gftextureview and it works fine but i still hope to use imageview because i don't want to use different weight in listview item  thanks a lot 
hi   yfuks  i didn't override reactactivity oncreate  so i think the problem is related with rn  my code is below    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7940552 12816443 83221cae cb87 11e5 9487 6c31a3839ffd png    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7940552 12816456 98091b2c cb87 11e5 9f4b 453f545c1efb png  i set two breakpoints in mainactivity onactivityresult function  but the program did not go to there    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7940552 12816511 d5a5293a cb87 11e5 8ef3 9084b6f04823 png  so the showimagepicker has no log   but i test several times  sometimes it works well  the showimagepicker can get the uri

forgot to check that  yeah it does  how can it do that on runelite and mobile  but not on the vanilla client 
it's almost certainly a bug in the code which is directly using the unsafe methods 
  the link to edict is outdated  when the temporary redirection page will be removed  this will result in a broken link   the link to the kanji recognized javadict is broken   the link to the verb inflection is broken   heisig  kanji index page points that the information is copyrighted but no explicit licences granted and the copyright cover frame numbers and the index    kotowaza org don't have any information about open  license   file choser  dialog is under mpl which  may  require source sharing   ianal    furiganaview is cc by sa    the "share alike" is described as "if you remix  transform  or build upon the material  you must distribute your contribution under the same license as the original"   no explicit license on nhk pronunciation  which means that  standard copyright rules apply
in a very basic test i could not reproduce it  but having a bit more complex model i could  here is a model which will cause this issue     the last test fails     the error is related with the map having a entry which is an object    when is a map string string  for example  it works 
oh yes  i was testing the 'add account' option in 'my accounts' around the time we were chatting  how can i delete remove the second account  now that i look back at the 'me' page  the second account has replaced the first one  shouldn't the first account be the default one 
yeah  from 2 2 29 to 2 2 30 few days back 
which means that the test is totally broken now     i would consider to fix it asap   and yes  it would be good to add some regression logic to the test as well  but may be it should be a different ticket

 vahdat ab here's a screenshot showing which tests failed  i haven't looked into all of them  but i think they're due to empty files     image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8980400 22496678 a377db92 e800 11e6 95f0 1197652ab6cf png   i started looking into the javainheritencetemplate test cases  it doesn't look like the interface methods are showing up in the classes that implement them  i tried adding a class that extends isecondchild and didn't see any methods in class body   it also looks like at least one of the interfaces in the  ump file associated with that test contain attributes  which i believe is invalid syntax

the issue happens on mobile  i ve got 5 tabs and it happens on the fifth tab so when the fifth tab is clicked the badge is hidden and if i click the forth tab the badge comes back in the same place it was suppose to be if it was visible when the fifth tab was clicked  i m using shifting behavior so the selected tab get a bit bigger  so the badge is cut in half
i have just build the qksms 3 and i noticed that the design changed and the search works differently  no need to go back to the parent anymore   however  i have also noticed that the keyboard newer closes if i switch from chat list view to new chat view and vise versa  the keyboard is always there  is that expected behavior  it looks like you want the keyboard to be always visible in the chat list view and the search onfocus  but when i decide to close the keyboard than switch the views the keyboard is there again  not sure if that's a bug or something you have consciously decided to implement 
i see  at this point  the specific episodes aren't known  just the titles  so titleregex is the only choice   but how does a title that contains characters from the regex set get matched   since the encoding of    's works  it appears that they're decoded before the regex is used  that's why putting a   in front of them worked for the original case here  i thought that would apply to all of the regex characters that were part of the actual title  that should be matched without any expression    i found that this works     that is  all of the regex characters in the title were replaced with periods  the  20 above were actually spaces when testing from my browser  plus signs work too  as expected  
yup  the moment i change the talon mode to velocity  for some odd reason  it freezes lags and eats up the cpu of the driverstation through    shuffleboard 
 sjudd this problem is caused by the mobile phone system  the mobile phone manufacturer has solved this problem 
good point  i didn't tried with only the two mods  my gut feeling is that is not related to bop as this should not affect the betweenlands dimension  however this was indeed a world generated by bop and not a vanilla world    give me some time to do a new fresh forge profile in a different directory  i'll use it for testing so i can do some test without all the noise from the other mods   thank you for the help

 tobiaskaminsky it's not clear what you are proposing for me to do     it looks like  atomspring did the same thing mentioned in the original post to _temporarily fix the symptom_     that is  after some unknown and intermittent issue causes the nextcloud account on a device to be removed  for me  this only happens intermittently to my nextcloud app account   no other accounts have this issue  _and_ i discover that i cannot add the nextcloud app account back again on my device  this _also_ is intermittent and not necessary correlated with the nextcloud account on my device mysteriously being removed     then i will   1  put the device into recovery  i use twrp  2  pull  data system_ce 0 accounts_ce db to my computer via adb 3  edit the "accounts" table and the "extras" table by deleting all entries referring to the nextcloud account in the file accounts_ce db by using a sqlite editor  "db editor for sqlite" is my poison of choice for this  4  after saving the edits in step 3   push the modified accounts_ce db back to  data system_ce 0  on the device via adb  5  use "adb shell chown system system  data system_ce 0 accounts_ce db" to make sure this file's user   group ownership is something android expects 6  reboot the device  delete any now defunct nextcloud app accounts _on my nextcloud server_  and readd the nextcloud app account on my device   fwiw  i continue to have this problem intermittently  so far i have not been fortunate enough to get a logcat of the events otherwise i'd share it      updated environment data additional info   android version 7 1 2 lineageos 14 1 20171020  device model  surnia  i also have update a falcon and a hammerhead device both using lineageos and a similar app mix but so far have not run into this issue    nextcloud server version 12 0 3  ubuntu 16 04 3 lts  gnu linux 4 4 0 97 generic x86_64   topt enabled  https only  redirected from a ddns service at a high port that is redirected to port 443 by my router   while this problem has affected me over the past month when using versions of 2 0 0rc and the "stable" 2 0 0 both from fdroid  i cannot provide reliable info to reproduce this problem   it occurs unexpectedly  intermittently  and  as far as my recollection goes  not always due to events related to using the nextcloud app   if i can get a logcat before after this event happens  i'll share it     hth
 jexp  this is a log of an embedded neo4j application  i did some traversal via the traversal framework  the whole enclosing transaction is read only   i don't have the storage files  but this very query succeeded the next time  so i believe  the storage was consistent 
the issue persists with a maven project  same error as well   i'm opening projects i created in eclipse as they are generated 
 saezchristopher it was intentional because it's part of the merging process made by jcenter  i've sent them an email to see how to fix it and or how long it takes  last case  i'll deploy it again as soon as i get an answer   this was done because when people were searching for  io sentry  on jcenter  they were finding 2  sentry android  artifacts and the newest one  2 0 0  was at the 2nd page  and most people don't even go next page  we decided to merge it so one could see all versions in one package from 1 x to 2 0 0

hi  sanzinger   thanks for your additional comment  then i will create a pr to fix it  thank you 
i have not yet checked why exactly the cxf servlet is reading after the exception  it is used to provide a soap webservice and wants to convert all exceptions into a soap fault to send to the client   as to reproducing   the first read throws the illegalstateexception for me as well but i do not get the following ones you posted  i use putty in raw mode as "http client" in my tests and there is one more detail i did not realize   if i just paste the short invalid post request and do nothing more i get a timeout after 30sec and all is fine  however if i send some more content afterwards  eg pressing enter  the threads starts looping and there is no more timeout  even when the socket is closed there are no more exceptions   i can also trigger this by sending a larger amount of data  my guess is that there has to be more data than some internal buffer size  8k   so that there is still something to read for the second call 
yes  i just updated from 0 1 to 0 4  now i uninstalled the 0 4 version and reinstalled it and everything works fine  maybe some issues with the settings  thanks a lot   great app

i had this plugin on my server previously  and it worked fine  i had an npc going from one city to another  it has to be a recent change 
yes  sure i have  and it does work with https  but i it is not "clean" to write "http   " in the route configuration  because i also configure the ssl parameters for client cert authentication on this endpoint   if i have a "classic" webservice based on servlet with web xml i can put  transport guarantee confidential  transport guarantee    or if i use switchyard in fuseoneap   i can ensure confidentiality like that  sca service sy security "default" name "loancontractws_ws_in" requires "clientauthentication propagatestransaction confidentiality"    so what i want is to enforce https for a cxfconsumer endpoint  because a http endpoint makes no sense with client certificate authentication 
i'm sorry i can't  it's quite a big project and i don't even know where to begin to isolate the problematic code   but i suppose it's some bean unable to be instantiated  maybe because it can't configure itself from config application yml  if you have some hints on how to proceed i'm all hears  for the time being i just develop using rc1

appologies for not including a version  this was on roots 3 0 7   the server i play on has just updated to roots 3 0 10  which fixes at least the aqueous soil bug  as what was once fully grown nether wart just sitting there  unlike the auto dropping wheat right next to it  is now never fully grown and my nether wart collection is growing   caelic seems to work faster now  magmatic has not grown and terran gave me 1 or 3  so i can't tell yet if it's doing anything  still investigating whether sugarcane works as expected on aqueous soil   i will report back and possibly close the issue if i can't find anything weird

sure  1  at 30 hz  things run okay but once in a while you'll notice erroneous values come through  for example a variable that has the same value written to it all the time  zero   will once in a while have 15  23 or some random number written to it  at 50   80 hz it becomes more common  the value set to zero will spike in value every 5 seconds or so  and above 80 hz  the connection will break and data will cease to be sent to the phone  2  the gibberish in the serial monitor only happens when the connection never initialized  or after it breaks  so at 1   80 hz  the serial monitor is accurate  but there will be random inaccuracies in the data transmitted  3  altsoftserial is the current choice as it uses the high resolution 16 bit timer  there's another one out there  but it isn't packaged as a library  but as a sketch and it uses an 8 bit timer  it will have the same issues altsoftserial will have with no clear advantages       https   s3 amazonaws com pushbullet uploads ujze3q5ouqw zqgrlpgh9emvqkjaiwsmgbgrkpw7fvct screenshot_2014 10 12 15 11 53 png     75 hz  the gold spike to the left is at the value that 0 is supposed to be written to all the time       https   s3 amazonaws com pushbullet uploads ujze3q5ouqw bhksvdwzkeirbbnxk10rb1ujfirbpnes screenshot_2014 10 12 15 11 29 png    50 hz  random spikes

i have write fanart and poster  overwrite fanart and poster  write actor images  and write extra fan art when writing data       and rename movie file  i already have most of my stuff scraped from data18 with the xbmc data 18 scraper  your scraper brings in a much better poster image  higher resolution  and i use it to rename the folder to movie name with year  so if i scrape a movie with the standalone scraper it pulls in the better image but when i click write it doesn't overwrite the old image  it does everything else  like change the folder name and overwrites the  nfo and the actor images  other than it being the old crapy poster when i go back to the movie  i notice that the file size is still very small and the modified date is from the previous xbmc scraping

okay  i made a fork and cleaned up the workaround for a pull request   first time actually using github or git for that matter  so i hope everything went okay   it is of course just a workaround  since it  in order to not get slowed down during import  requires that users have the project property set before even starting the import  which may be a bit much to ask if they don't use gradle to generate those setting files automatically  nonetheless there is also a text box to enter the string in the project properties page  so it can be changed via ui if people don't want to mess with the bare files   if you want to come up with a cleaner solution  feel free

hi saudet   sorry for my incomprehensible question  the problem is when i used typedef like this     there is an error when i compile    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10292378 9294710 9ca96858 4455 11e5 9755 ac47ac7983e6 png  which tells that javacpp  cannot convert from vector_p_double to std  vector double   std  allocator _ty       it seems that javacpp does not understand the new type vector_p_double defined by the typedef command   without using  typedef std  vector double          vector_p_double    or more exactly using directly  std  vector double    it works fine like in https   github com bytedeco javacpp issues 22  so the question is how could i use  typedef std  vector double          vector_p_double    hope that you understand my question now   thank you for your help  thanh liem 
generally  what would be needed in the case of those bridleways would be for people to tag them on osm with the relavent information  so when they are bare earth  they should be tagged using the surface earth or similar  in general  the way type just says whether the way "could" be used  but then the other information is used to actually determine if it is useful for that particular user   i think we could do yhat you suggested and limit the bridleways to be only if they have been tagged as wheelchair    but i believe that tehre are very few that would be tagged that way
works now

ews java has two base64 classes  base64encoderstream and base64  for reasons unknown  base64 seems to work just fine  but a third party library may do the trick as well  i haven't used guava  but i've heard good things  apache commons would be a candidate as well  i don't think java 8 is viable  it's too new and isn't widely used

apologies for the delay  i will see what i can do  what i'm thinking should happen in this case  where a single "word" is larger than the column's maximum width  is that the output should fall back to naive splitting and breaking in the middle of the word  what do you think

i guess we need to add something like this  somewhere     ps  i have no idea what the correct exceptions should be there     i'm trying to track down where the download is done  and have reached an enigma  there are two places where i think this can happen  either in  1   helpers java  https   github com secupwn android imsi catcher detector blob 3a5039efb6f4c7e13627e422d972657179d0de2e app src main java com secupwn aimsicd utils helpers java#l117 136  or 2   in  requesttask java  https   github com secupwn android imsi catcher detector blob b06b791d049e74ac7163b18dce14028886ea3c63 app src main java com secupwn aimsicd utils requesttask java#l63 174     but in  2   and at first sight  it seem that it is used for uploading data to ocid  but then it is immediately followed by a download from their servers         if that is what is actually happening  then that is another bug  as we should not attempt to download data we just uploaded  also  ocid take at least  a few minutes before adding new data to their servers  and by even attempting to do this  we're corrupting our own data with potential fake bts data  any upload should be done by careful user control  if at all      i would appreciate some enlightenment and a few code comments

i was using the modern warfare and simple parts packs  version 4 9 0 of each  as for forge  i think at the time of this report i was using 1291  sorry i forgot to include it in the op   but now i'm on 1343   i've been assembling an update and had moved up to forge 1352  latest that doesn't change the fluid registry stuff and crash some mods   and updated to flan's 4 10 0 to see if it'd still give me the error at some point  and it did  it's the exact same crash but i'm dumb and didn't bother to look at the full log to see the erroring entity id  though i was able to once again log into the world after disabling flan's  so that tells me it's still something to do with flan's  i would try the absolute latest forge builds but it doesn't work with a number of the mods that i have  at least not until they update   i dunno though  it just seems to happen when something spawns  could it be a strange mod interaction messing with entity id registry  i'm unsure of how entity stuff works in minecraft's code so i probably don't know what i'm talking about here

we could spawn threads and use sync clients  a bit less efficient but would be ok    what we see is that with retries enabled this bug is less common but still appears quite often  e g  every 250 files instead of every 100    even if retries did work we can't use them though  our use case is to create a zip file containing all the data from all of these photos in a streaming way without holding it all in ram  so retries aren't an option for us  they'd cause a corrupt file because the zip archive would contain part of the file  the part that failed part way through  and then on retry that part of the file would be repeated 
when typing in "rivier"  there is the autosuggestion "aankomsttijden water vanuit de rivier"  which is the title of a dataset   when selecting this autosuggestion  so the search term becomes "aankomsttijden water vanuit de rivier"  and pressing the search button  there are no results  when searching on just "rivier"  the dataset does show up in the results   i think these are all the language settings    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 8331091 7838230 15c37742 048c 11e5 83f0 b3c24eade6ea png

well  i will have to test it first  but i think  i’m fine with this solution  if i’ll get a sudden inspiration i will tell you   regards frank  from  serge rider  sent  saturday  july 23  2016 10 34 pm to  serge rider dbeaver  cc  frankhsimon   author  subject  re   serge rider dbeaver  keywords and table names quoted in dbeaver 3 7 1  #594   informix is special  looks like it has some non standard rules for reserved keywords quoting  as a workaround i've added a special config  in driver properties    here you can disable keywords quote at all  however this is not a final solution  could you suggest anything better   — you are receiving this because you authored the thread  reply to this email directly  view it on github  or mute the thread 
i have made a minimal project to reproduce the problem here  https   github com gsurrel orange boot liquibase dev tools  on the first launch everything works fine but when the app is restarted by the dev tool module  there is a problem re running the import script 
it looks like github already cross linked this for us   thanks for addressing it 
 shivam tripathi  regarding this issue i think  this  #96  solves the problem and i can confirm that the re downloaded files are exported successfully  regarding the file tampering issue that you described above a new issue could be filled so that we could get a detail discussion regarding how to solve that   yanokwa   rclakmal  lognaturel what do you think 
on my emulator i am only doing fresh installations and there it works   the problem is that the column is also added in db scheme 16  with createsyncedfolderstable   so if you upgrade from 15 to 23  newest     16    add type column         23    add type column   same for wifi and charging column

 rsmckinney the issue is with the idea plugin  it compiles fine  it's just the ide telling me something untrue   i am on 0 55 now  https   i imgur com nvj0orj png

i just verified  and yes  the subcommand now works like expected

ideal transformers shouldn't act as pictures demonstrate  in general  not zeroing the currents and voltages on reset causes loads of issues with the simulator

whoa  that was fast  i've already tried the modified branch and works like a charm  thanks  persapiens for your awesome job  i'll contribute in whatever a can 
thanks for looking into this  the build command for tools even fails for me when i built the whole project before    i run maven 3 3 9  installed via apt on ubuntu 16 04  i tried this on multiple machines with the same setup  it fails on all machines

1  that's fine for me  i don't care about renames  the only thing i care about is that when something has changed in git  it reports in svn as changed as well  the underlying reason is that i use git as svn as a shim for a system that has no git support built in  we came from svn   i actually don't even need the full history  just the  x  number of revisions  i don’t even need all files in the history  just certain types   4  i will come back to you on that   new thread dump  now almost 99  cpu consumption at rev 6561  no noticable difference in the stack dump for me at least   git as svn threaddump rev 6561of9538 txt  https   github com bozaro git as svn files 3807395 git as svn threaddump rev 6561of9538 txt

sure ill will download developers latest and compile it  although build # 77 isnt that old 24 oct 2014 3 09 00  here is a zip with my current permission  but as i said before they are the default ones   https   www dropbox com s pkc5fq6mlizrtj1 permissions zip dl 0 
that's a quick response  i forgot to say that multi column search should be true  multi column search "true" creates the filter fields for each column    what i understood is a specific column is filtered  there is now showcase for this on your page  they all have multi column search not set so basically default value false   you just need to have one row  my previous example col1  john and col2  dow   enter dow in the second column and the filter will exclude the row   thanks for having a look at this 
we try without parameters and we catch the exception above  we don't try it with valid args  only with null args   csokol told us that this was working without parameters

actually the boards are old freeduinos  diecimila atmega328    using a ftdi chip  1 year ago  when i started with arduinos from the scratch  i had to install the ftdi drivers  and then it worked  ide 0 9 and or 1 05   diecimila board   win xp32     but then i started to use megas und dues and the freeduinos  were sort of forgotten   now i reactivated them in order to make a uart to i2c converter  but it didn't work no more  ide 1 6 3  still win xp32  i even installed a new ftdi driver manually from http   www arexx com downloads cdmv2 10 00__pid_fix zip   but no changes   when i target diecimila  i get the error as shown above  when i target unos  then it says the avrdude is out of sync   so what should i do   how can i try this  f thing

thanks a lot this is fixed
thanks for taking a look at this  that makes sense in terms of precedence but i'm admittedly am not an expert   i bumped to  3 5 4  in my  pom xml  file and realized the difference is that this works     now that i know that  i can just change our imports to have      to keep prototyping  but it'd also be nice to have parity with node  although the      prefix is admittedly more explicit   thanks 
now it works  thanks 
because those are the most recently built versions of both mods    if it still happens in the most recent alphas  then it's also going to happen in the stable version which were built   before   the alphas 
that's correct "double click in the task name cell clears task name" 
yes
will check
resonant satchel with holding iv  in the satchel i do have a  dank null with stuff in it  but i am not using those materials to my knowledge 
this happens if i just type the name of the class and then a period  once it starts  autocomplete starts breaking for everything in the script  i'm just seeing the error in the workspace log so i'm not sure how to get a stack frame 
every night  and i don't know any astral sorcery discord 
yes  on my develop system i used this statements in  c3p0 properties  file but only with  c3p0 unreturnedconnectiontimeout  with value  800  instead of  32768   the defined stacktrace  c3p0 debugunreturnedconnectionstacktraces true  was never be shown or logged in any log file 
see the build logs on travis for master   https   travis ci org corfudb corfudb branches  it doesn't seem consistent  but usually somewhere inside smrmaptest  on my local machine addnodeit consistently fails due to a file error  i've verified that tests pass locally after reverting to head 1 on master 
thanks for your input    that's a very good pointer  this really could be the case  i already wondered why i still get so relatively many crashes from version 1 3 0 although 1 3 1 is already released for quite some time  of course  it could be that user's simply didn't update  but the weirdness of this crash hints at a bot  maybe it send touch events so early in the activity lifecycle that the view hierarchy was not properly initialized yet or something  i don't know but i guess the crash is an anomaly  i'm going to push a "proper" fix anyway like you suggested 
 omehegan here you go edit  noticed the job had triggeropenmergerequestonpush  "never"  but after changing the setting to "both" the builds are still not triggering

it is working for me now as well 
thx for pointing me to the calculation function  i'll try hunting the bug     it's somehow strange only on the nvidia shield k1  7"   2015   7 0  there is this problem   i'll send you a merge request or a sample project if i can't find the issue   thx 
hi  it works fine    many thanks for the quick response   shay
hi lars   the test also works with postgresql but it fails if the comment contains only one single quote e g  using     it's a comment   instead of     and 'exciting' comment   this is the exception i'm getting  it doesn't look like it's from the jdbc driver 
i am importing the library like this
hi  janpio  thanks for looking into it  i contacted the company too and they should be looking into it  however  in their defense  the plugin was working until a couple of days ago  i started encountering the issue around 16th november  give and take a day or too  used to work with the latest cordova and and plugin version up till then  i believe being cordova 8  cordova android 7 1 1 and and plugin version 6 1 0   re your error being different  the difference is induced when adding the  cordova android support gradle release plugin and forcing a dependency of support libraries version 27 and upwards 
yea  oprisnik that's still happening with v14 0 1  i updated yesterday to check and seems like that's still the case 
no problem  i am using visualvm  what specifically would you like from the memory dump as aware this could contain sensitive information or private keys        sss
a modal would be better than the current behavior  but i think it'd be much better to be able to edit the form while viewing the definition  that's why a frame feels better to me 
 marcingrzejszczak still no luck using those snapshots 
you mean i should remove conditional compilation symbols from the haxelibs  i can try that with the    as for the errors  here they are    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 757150 23013671 f7f844cc f42b 11e6 8b95 4b4e6cba4147 png    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 757150 23013695 0edd400c f42c 11e6 9208 da1fdfcc6861 png    image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 757150 23013747 4036b246 f42c 11e6 86c7 dc8ff2eda162 png 
 mattmoor   do you need more information  i was going to assign this bug to someone who maintains https   github com bazelbuild rules_docker but i see you are one    
i see  waiting for the fix

nope  i use now version 2 0 and its work 3 0 doesnt work
ya  looks like refreshing works 
here it is  http   paste ubuntu com 24100013 
sorry for the wait   i'm using sybase   sybase jtds driver   adaptive server enterprise 15 5  the workaround works but that's not ideal 
yes  i just need open app  and press refresh button  if you need i can send you some logs  пн  28 мая 2018 г   21 26 abhinav singh  notifications github com  
hello  i suspect that you mean the logcat output of the crash  i'll do that in a separate issue because it seems to me that this is not related to the non updated location signal values  https   github com secupwn android imsi catcher detector issues 300  here i could give you my output  csv if you want  but i'd rather send that privately because of all the geodata included 
right now  nuummite powder is used in one of the me related brews
the second part of my example shows 'escape' format   val c   cp queryawait """set bytea_output to 'escape'  select e'  001  007'  bytea as b"""  next   first   getbuffer 0  bytes  it changes format of select to 'escape' and tries to read it  this causes errors   in my opinion best way is to give option to execute custom sql on connection creation or option to handle event of connection creation  aftercreateevent 
the version you made available for me for jdk6   0 0 8 
i have checked  this change resolves this issue 
i've tried to clean and rebuild with no luck  i've tried the latest build 17 as well as the previous 16   the test device that i'm using is nexus 6
the version of resisson is 2 8 1

hi  thanks for the prompt response  i've been trying to connect for dozens of minutes without success   the thing is that  autoconnect  flag works perfectly fine on the same device when    using android bluetoothlegatt sample from google   reflection based method in the library is replaced with the regular api  i know this issue is weird especially because    it happens only on one device among many i have used   the reflection based implementation seems to be identical to the inner android implementation  anyways i've changed my app implementation so that  autoconnect false  but still it would be cool if you could address the last part of my comment regarding why the reflection based workaround is used in the first place and which android versions   devices are affected   thanks 
mmm i just compiled with mvn on cli and the error was different and related to the eis interface  tostring   which seems it was deprecated  and somehow worked with sarl 0 6 1 but not with 0 7 0  but it is about the eis not sarl  i changed the code to a different method and it compiles well   the error message on the eclipse ide was not indicating that  it was giving an error at the level of the whole event class   so  i think this is not per se related to sarl  gallandarakhneorg   sorry  thanks and i am closing it  seems to compile now well

first example  if you host jetty directly on an ipv6 address and you use an ipv6 client  the request log says  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1      25 apr 2017 08 27 20 +0000  "get   http 1 1" 200 2802   if you however enable the http forwarded module and send a request using curl like    curl  h 'forwarded  for " 2001 db8 cafe  17 "  for 192 0 2 43'  g "http      1  8080 "    2001 db8 cafe  17       25 apr 2017 14 16 50 +0000  "get   http 1 1" 200 2802   so the behaviour is different  with ipv4 it's the same   second example  our application uses the iprangepredicate  1  from opensaml   they pull the ip address from the request and check via com google common net inetaddresses to see if its a valid address  which it isn't because of the brackets    final string address   httprequest    null   httprequest getremoteaddr     null  if  address    null     inetaddresses isinetaddress address        return false     i was wondering where it should be normalized    but since rfc7239 states that it must be enclosed by brackets in the forwarded header  i think it's up to the consumer  jetty in this case  of this header to normalize this into an parsable ip as if jetty was approached directly and not via a proxy    1  https   git shibboleth net view  p java opensaml git a blob f opensaml profile api src main java org opensaml profile logic iprangepredicate java h 0161ce469a7d8531ca5f96c909cc14f79fde705a hb head#l100

thanks for quick response   there is a prompt before doing any downloading  and after that the data is cached  so it then behaves like any other data frame  this strikes me as the sort of thing active bindings were meant for  but i could be wrong   writing r extensions mentions wrapping c pointers and database access as examples  either could cause problems if done without the users intent 
thanks for your answer james   i've got a front end web page containing a paging list of some resource  in which add and delete operation can be performed  add or delete operation will reload the current page  i'm considering how to design this  for example  when i'm in the 2nd page  delete all the resources in that page making the page empty  then i go to the 3rd  then turn back to the 2nd  the page is still empty  this is what i met  but it's not a matter now  i've got a plan to deal with it  your answer really helps me  tks   btw  a search data cleanup every 10s by hapi would lock the search tables frequently  any possibility this will result in a performance problem when it faces an influx of a large number of search requests 
i am not sure there is a bug here at all  we are just a bit stuck on why we can't hear the user   we don't have an android q device handy atm to test with   the audio is definitely making it out of the user's device as we get it in the recording on the web js side   the bandwidth on the audio stream is good and the level is not 0   we do client side recording there by grabbing the streams and merging them using  https   github com t mullen video stream merger  it is possible that the recorder is interfering with playing the audio  but we don't see this show up other times  many  many calls    i could certainly share our code  but i am not sure it is relevant here   these were the rooms  rm309040c6fa19193b61e671d2f8b11966 rmdf681fe71dd64dbb6c202b4dba0e3a68  since this happens on a user device we don't have logs   if you add the ability for a custom logger we could provide lower level twilio logs  i mentioned this in an ios github issue as well  
i think i introduced the problem as a side effect of bug #458  it affects models that make repeated updates to the same areas of state data  like the shmem model   these accumulate longer and longer listener lists  which mean that invariants get checked over and over again  making the model slower and slower  but giving correct behaviour    you could try your model with vdmj  which has the fix   https   github com nickbattle vdmj releases download 3 1 1 1 vdmj 3 1 1 jar

thanks for your response   i answered you on the stackoverflow     alternatively if you prefer i continue the conversation here 
the initial install on my g3 was early to mid january while my tab 2 install was very recent so that could explain the difference  those higher rookie teams may not have been available when i initially installed   i understand the need to minimize the server load and data traffic  unfortunately for me this has resulted in incomplete data   when i check the team list for 5000 5999 i find i have a gap in my data   i see team 5573 followed immediately by 5785  the shield    5785 only appears because i explicitly opened them from the rookie all star award at some regional while testing my bug report   the typical expectation for a "refresh" action is that the app will get new data and update existing data   if the refresh action from the team view  not the event teams list  isn't going to make sure i get all the currently known teams then perhaps it should removed to avoid user confusion   i will try flushing the app data and reinstalling after this weekend is over to see if that resolves this issue

unfortunately  oracle makes this very difficult because of the way it  implements remote links   oracle will only create remote links in the  logged in user's schema   there is a very nasty workaround which involves creating the link from a  dynamic sql statement inside a stored procedure in the correct schema    this only works because the stored procedure executes as the schema  owner  meaning the link is created in the correct schema   my workaround is to implement a flywaycallback that alters the current  schema in the beforemigrate method   i understand the need to change the session inside the connection that  manages the metadata table  however  it seems more logical to keep the  default schema in the connection that performs the actual migration    perhaps a property in the flyway class would allow this to be configured  by the user of flyway   on 09 16 2014 04 38 am  axel fontaine wrote

i spent the afternoon running some tests and profiling the impact of a few ways to handle this  i wanted to share the options i came up with to get some feedback from others who may have encountered this in the past or have thought about it for more than a few hours   ### use concurrent data structures replace all data structures with their concurrent options  arraylist    copyonwritearraylist   hashmap    concurrenthashmap  this will fix the immediate problem by ensuring that during iteration a change in the underlying data structure won't cause an exception  but  there are two issues to consider   first   copyonwritearrayset  is only efficient for read heavy workloads  since there is typically one write per read  iterating and persist  there would be a costly performance penalty when the cowal has to copy the array on write update remove  this may be a non issue because the data sets are so small  but something to consider   second  the real problem is that the filemanager is running arbitrary methods   toprotomessage     from non userthread without any synchronization or safety from the  storage  classes  even if we fix up all these current issues they will just reappear in a different form if it isn't fixed in a more sustainable way  it is really non obvious which class members need to be thread safe and which ones don't   ### create protobuf objects on the userthread instead of the filemanager writer thread this seems like the cleanest design moving forward  current and future  store  objects don't need to care about thread safety   the  filemanager  is easier to reason about as well since the work queue  atomicreference  would just store the immutable protobuf object instead of a class instance that can change   but  the overhead for building the protobuf message on each save is pretty significant  on average  it takes around 1500ms for  daostatestore  toprotomessage    to complete  this negates a lot of the batching work that the filemanager hoped to accomplish and can cause the initial dao rebuild to take quite a while     on_user_thread_after  https   user images githubusercontent com 8082291 70292605 7b086300 1793 11ea 985a 34fab20a361f jpg    on_user_thread_after2  https   user images githubusercontent com 8082291 70292606 7b086300 1793 11ea 95c0 a61d567c83a8 jpg   ### hybrid solution there may be a hybrid solution where we don't generate protobuf messages on the  userthread  unless we are immediately shipping it off to the work queue  i think this would bring back some of the batching gains  but i don't have that data yet   additionally  it might make sense to just whitelist the really expensive persistent objects  roll our own synchronization  and find a way for "most" users to not care which would guarantee correctness and allow profiling to determine where to optimize instead of bugs

my thinking was to allow a continuous acceleration deceleration of the robot  however  without comparing the two results on an actual robot it will be hard to decide  the situation i was thinking of is the one volt jump from +0 5 to  0 5 
i wanted to use a token as a service to service authentication mechanism  more or less like an api key but  for that to work  the token shouldn't expire   for now  i  define the expiration date as the long max value as its required but  since the spec doesn't require any field  i was curious about the implementation   on mon  13 jan 2020  18 12 sberyozkin   notifications github com  wrote

hi  renyuneyun the application is the  sms backup +  application  and the intent is the action that triggers a backup   note that the "run commands" profile "am broadcast  a com zegoggles smssync backup" makes the job  while the "send broadcast" with the corresponding parameters does nothing at all  this makes me think that the problem is in easer and not the other app  since a command is able to run the intent  but i may have missed some mechanisms  please tell me if i can be of any help

interesting  switching the look and feeling to plastic3d seems to have changed the behavior by a lot  however  there is still some instability happening to me  the tabs become blank after i pasted another bibtex entry  screenshot    screenshot from 2017 11 06 14 54 31  https   user images githubusercontent com 3915003 32466774 550dcbfc c305 11e7 8bd8 b9dbdb2d051c png   here is what i did  i changed the look and feel to windows plastic  and then restarted jabref  i found it doesn't work and the program automatically reversed to the default look and feeling  then i changed the look and feeling to the jgoodies plastic3d one  and saved everything  it seems working ok  but there are some errors on the prompts  you can find the full log of output  here  https   paste ubuntu com 25906162     then i restarted the program  and the failure happens in a strange way  first  i added a bibtex entry by pasting a bibtex code to the table  downloaded the pdf using the automatic search and download button  it worked well until then  and i saved the database  i thought it wouldn't have any problems  so i opened the preference window and exported the settings to the saved file as you can see from my linked commit to this issue  there seem to be some errors or maybe just warnings in the terminal  and i didn't think they are really causing anything fatal  then i pasted another bibtex entry to the table  saved it  and tried to generate the bibtex key  i look down to the tabs  they are all blank now as you can see from the screenshot attached  i clicked a few buttons  including generate bibtex key  save  quality     generate bibtex key and maybe a few other buttons  it didn't return to normal  so  i closed jabref  the full terminal record for these steps can be found  here  https   paste ubuntu com 25906123      but this issue didn't reoccur if i just use the program normally  like adding multiple entries in a row  auto downloading pdf files and so on  i only have 3 look and feeling profiles and have tried all of them  2 didn't work at all  the plastic3d one caused this blank window issue to me  let me know if i can provide further information  or  maybe it should be a separate non crucial issue to discuss for this update   thanks   qi

thanks for the   regex  tip   i am not familiar with the internals of your plugin  but would it be possible to support some sort of regex  either javascript or java   i guess for most common database queries  any regex format would be similar  i guess the differences are noticeable only for very advanced queries

yeah  it does seem like aedict reader is the faulty one  it didn't occur to me there was an almost identical verb to 没す  though on the example tab for ぼっする  it still only shows 1 of the examples even though tatoeba examples has 3 instances  technically 4 but one is a duplicate     screenshot_20180704 173320  https   user images githubusercontent com 40373139 42296674 e9400192 7fb5 11e8 9a75 cc37e6af3639 jpg    screenshot_20180704 173328  https   user images githubusercontent com 40373139 42296685 fb73cdb2 7fb5 11e8 86f2 d6f247a9f06f jpg   my guess is the remaining sentences don't show up because they're not exactly ぼっする but would appear if there was an entry for ぼっす   if possible  maybe examples for verbs like 愛す 愛する should show identical example tabs  since they are the same verb  assuming they have the same reading  i do think you're right that もっす shouldn't display examples of ぼっす る   after all  the tatoeba search does allow for exact matches so if somebody wants specifically あいする instead of あいす、あいした or the like  they could use that  thanks for your time and your efforts in developing this great app

actually  ignoring of sitemaps plays wery well  so stopping happens immideately  i guess the issue may be when such gigants  as g  or y  appears in the crawling list  they have huge xml maps  and parsing them is an issue itself   you may create a kind of recommendation for collector's users to 'reject at url filters section' very big and popular sites  if there is no actual need in crawling it

it's a 16 core cpu  c4 4xlarge   i think it was one of the recent syncronization changes to org bytedeco javacpp pointer java  https   github com bytedeco javacpp commits d666a119cf858e0df663e486c08973d19bcb670b src main java org bytedeco javacpp pointer java  which leads to the problem   down grading to 1 23  the sync stuff appears to be 1 24  seemed to resolve the problem   the problem maybe in that code instead of dl4j   the performance problem comes from the lock serialization  reducing parallelization rather than from a more 'traditional' performance problem

sorry about that  it has been tested on ios version 11 4 1 but on more recent versions as well  so it does not seem related to the ios version  it has not been tested on android since adding a token from an otpauth url does not work on android anyway  i can't seem to find the google authenticator app version but it is up to date since it does not appear there is an update available in my app store  to reproduce it  you need to have 0 token in your app  so the "begin setup" screen is the one that appears when opening the app   then you can open a text editor and write a url similar to this one to generate a fake token   otpauth   totp cedric secret 123456789 issuer test digits 6 period 30 when you click on it  it will open google auth app automatically  since the otpauth url scheme is associated to that app on ios  and prompt you to add a token  when you click yes  the token will be added in the background but not visible  the app will stay on the same begin setup screen as if you had no token  only when closing and re opening it  you will see your token

i've done some more testing and these are my conclusions   i can't reproduce the bug in singleplayer it only happens for me in multiplayer  i've tested all the botania rods and found that only the following three rods have the duping bug     rod of the lands   rod of the highlands   rod of the terrafirma  furthermore the rod of the depths makes it so that the builder's wand doesn't work at all   i suspect that the bug is due to all three rods abillity to create dirt out of mana and the interaction of this mechanic with your mod  i've tested with some other random botania items but none of them seemed to exhibit the duping bug 
i can reproduce it on 2 9 1 with the same steps  i'm hosting it on my computer   rpi3

clearing the data for google play services  which is already latest version  causes all google services to flat out stop working  and does absolutely nothing to help with this bug   as already mentioned in my second comment above  i have already tested with just one route selected  after clearing data for pat realtime tracker    i have no idea what "logcats" are  i am more familiar with "desktop linux" where "logcats" don't exist      have you guys considered using openstreetmaps instead of google maps google play services  their api hasn't changes in ages and is already in use by several desktop and mobile apps  including on android   using an api that rarely changes might make things easier for you guys than relying on things provided by corporations that like to frequently changes stuff    believe me  i've already been there

ah whoops  forgot the attachment  i'll take a look when i get home and provide info  plus the attachment itself   philipwhiuk  
there are two places where info is recorded  there are the  sets of iris  one for classes  one for restrictions  one for each kind of property  etc    these are only kept for the duration of the parsing  then there is a multimap  which records guessed at types  removing them if an explicit type is seen  this is stored in the format that is kept in the ontology manager   the hack of  pretending that the cons cell is really a class or a datatype does not need the multimap   this class and the triple handlers should be refactored  i believe it will have precisely two    
setting the properties is not the problem i think  it is more like once  spring cloud task batch failonjobfailure  true   is set  jobs will be autostarted  even when  spring batch job enabled  false  is set  maybe there should be a way to get the monitoring of the jobs without automatically starting them 
lets keep it separated   just posted a pr          i can look at #231 as well later this evening 
currently looking through the blocks  looks like it does not work with at least with   both io ports   grindstone   interface   drive   vibration chamber  cannot really test the me chest   it looks like it is related to ae2 automation  simple setup with an interface as buffer and a storage bus facing one of the ae2 blocks  if i use a hopper to insert any items it works just fine   already found out  that calling  tileentity markdirty    in  onchangeinventory    it will solve it  the question is more  how could this affect the performance  it is probably fine for things like the io ports or grindstone  but chaning it for an interface might have a huge impact

the issue persists 
i updated to the latest commit   7b106923e078ac2435e8c8ce9d615f9903106ed8  however  i cannot test whether the bug is fixed since i hit the following exception in a code path that is precursor to where i can reproduce the bug      this is why i didn't directly file a new bug  however i don't think these modifications have anything to do with the sslexception exception above since i've only removed unused java 7 apis and an annotation  but i might be wrong   also  thank you for being so responsive

isn't that basically what the current implementation is doing   thinking   i think  for these degenerate polygons  when using an algorithm intended for regular areas  you'll by definition end up with a point that can be  anywhere  since you're basically at some point dividinging zero by zero for the weighted average    i was wondering that as well  but as far as i know  me not being an expert in this field at all   when working with floating point numbers  the best one can do is to minimize such rounding truncation errors  e g  by using more clever  summation  https   en wikipedia org wiki kahan_summation_algorithm

hi kay   i checked it now  and the problem remains  the browser in use is firefox  and the page is reachable when i put the address direct in the browser url field   so no firewall rules stop the access   how does structorizer calls the browser in linux  did you try "xdg open http   help structorizer fisch lu index php"  which is the current method to call the configured default browser with the given url  i tested the call in a shell window  hth fine regards rolf

well we have 200+ mods and this happens on a specific schematic   it also crashes the host machine if the same schematic is used and the materials button is pressed   same crash log   should i be looking for the block of liquid somewhere in the schematic 
yes  i could  but i am not sure how  messageidimpl  and  batchmessageidimpl  should compare   it seems to me that the asymmetry was introduced by purpose with #1285  the code reads as  but as it is now  it breaks the  comparable  contract  and that makes it confusing for user of the client api 
i can not even assign a name to a flow  not sure if it is what we wanted 
i'm much more familiar with bukkit than forge so forgive me if i sound like a raving lunatic   the event in question is the playerinteractevent    which occurs when a person right clicks on a gui capable block  http   jd minecraftforge net net minecraftforge event entity player playerinteractevent html  within that is an iscanceled   method   to properly support this  i believe you need to add an if statement to you gui opening code to check for this iscanceled   method to be true   if it is then skip openning the gui   does that make some sense to you or am i on crack 
great  thanks for looking into this

after running the "clean" scenario  it has been successfully built  wow   and another newbie question here  don't know where to ask elsewhere  please  is it hard to make it run with  minsdkversion 25

i did use the link you provided and it seems to be working now   the number on the file name is the same version i had  but i assumed it just needed to be renamed   that does fix it though   good work 
why do you think it has to do with the dosetup   i cannot really understand the exception yet  it occurs when the ruleengineimpl is activated  as ruleengine depends on scriptengine and scriptengine depends on scriptserviceutil  i would have assumed that ssu activate   has already been executed at that point  do you have an explanation  why this isn't the case 
 skabashnyuk from above it's  operating system  debian gnu linux 8  jessie     the workspace is ready to go java stack

with the new version of the analysis  the analysis correctly reports the finding for the method  decryptaes      in total  the detected violations increased by three  one violation for the secret key  one violation for the iv  and one follow violation as the key used in  cipher init  isn't generated properly   one question  johspaeth   kruegers   shouldn't it be "same" violation for the third parameter as the iv isn't generated correctly as well  at least  that would make sense for me    details in the  report  https   github com crossingtud cryptoanalysis files 2317410 cognicrypt report txt

thanks for the follow up and questions   before deciding how the tccl should be used   it would be useful  to me anyway  to understand why it was introduced in the first place  especially for the logging case   is there any brief write up  other than in the following linked issues    history   featuredetector  and  classutils ispresent  first learnt to be passed a  classloader  in https   github com flyway flyway commit 8c800dfcb954840d52ab7c6c271e049162c301a7 and it seems issues #626 and #696 were drivers   before that the normal classloader was used   i figured logging in flyway code  and location configuration of logging apis  would be mostly an internal affair  but i do notice that at one point logging was moved from the internal to public api   maybe to support extension and plugins  i'm not familiar enough with flyway to know    note that  logcreator  and all of  logfactory  is static   if it is allowed to be deployed to a shared classloader and called by multiple applications modules with their context classloaders  we could end up with a race where the first caller to  getlog  brings their available logging api   so in summary  i'm interested in knowing what the tccl provides here   maybe it is access to resource configuration files for the logging api that only exist in the child context classloader   just seems like for something as fundamental as logging  flyway should be self sufficient within its own classloader 
the numbers i mentioned above comes from taiwan diabetes association at  1   their whole site is in chinese  however i can find different suggestions from many local hospital associations doctors over the internet  some just take ada's suggestion while some takes from epidemiology researches    so maybe we could check if this standard range would be different for people from place to place  if not  we can simply use ada+aace+nice+custom  and ask users to consult their physician for their optimal ranges  would this way better    1  http   homepage vghtpe gov tw  meta hospital teach1 htm

i think reported issue is my wrong usage  so enunciate should do one of  1  throw exception in such a case and shut down with message telling exactly what is wrong  2  provide general support for generated sourcesets so dev do not experiment to find working combo     as you might guess i needed to include generated sources for mappers dto  query beans  as they reside in a different folder  i think there should be support for it natively  thank you for a wonderful tool

now it seems to be able to keep sending messages after reconnecting  but there's some things to notice with the new reconnection process     the retry policies apply to both operations  reconnection and messages sending  it would be more sensible to either separate both into two different retry policies  so we can set noretry for messages and a different one for reconnection  or just apply the retry policies to messages and keep the reconnection operations running indefinitely as i'm sure it would fit more "real world" use cases     the reconnection process seems to stop after "operationtimeout"  default to 4 minutes   so unless we set it to long max_value  we cannot have a permanent reconnection logic  i'm not sure if this applies also to other operations that are not reconnect  same reasoning as above could be applied

i think it is a bug     think about the following request flow   you make a request for adding an user and expects that it forwards to users listing adding an user uses the post method  and listing users uses the get method     it doesn't work  you have to accept post method in listing in order to fix it   in redirections it works    but i think that redirections work only to get methods

i tested the behaviour like this     see  "exit code  2"  wagon gets the exit code  it just handles it wrong  so please improve the plugin  would you  thank you  the correct behaviour would be to ignore output on standard error and look at the exit code instead  this is true both on linux and windows  it is the canonic way to handle errors in shell scripts or other executables

we don't use guava  in the projects that i care about for this  mostly api projects that need to be broadly available  hence 1 6  and have minimal dependencies   up until now  immutables has been generating 1 6 compatible code without guava  at least with the features i care about  
only other mod i have at this time that may cause an issue is extrautilities2  i agree with your diagnosis on psymatics' thread    as far as i'm aware all my mods are up to date  i'm just going with a different setup using multiple smeltery drains each with its own output table  this seems to solve the issue as they're drawing directly from the smeltery and not an external reservoir

i tried to debug this "caused by  java lang illegalstateexception  current vaadinsession is not open" exception  it seems to be somehow linked to spring session fixation and might be a corner case timing problem  we will get this exception if there is vaadinsession that is still alive and being killed by spring session fixation and at the same time we are logging in and new vaadinsession is being created  spring will throw this exception  since the the session being killed is closed and now uiscoped bean can be instantiated to that context  the application works since soon after this new vaadinsession is alive and uiscoped bean is instantiated with it

 jbduncan   1  test was written before the new parallel test support of junit 5 was released  so i thought using assertall gives me a handy way to run my tests in parallel  2  the performance impact is virtually zero as only in case of an assertion error an element is added to the synchronized list of failures   3  non deterministic is ok   if an api supports streams it should also work if used with parallel streams   or  if for some reason it does not support parallel streams  it should be stated in the documentation of the api

just tried again  but i am unable to reproduce the issue  what i had done before was  1  try to backup   io error  utility 'pg_dump exe' not found in client home 'postgresql x64 10' 2  checked the directory that the postgresql binaries resolves to and found it was empty  3  attempt to download drivers   successful with version 9 6 4  checked the directory  and it had contents including pg_dump and pg_restore  5  attempt to restore again   io error  utility 'pg_dump exe' not found in client home 'postgresql x64 10'  so i uninstallled and reinstalled version 9 6  saw my previous directory options  home   selected the home for 10  and tested with success   i later reinstalled 5 1 6 and tested again  checked the postgresql binaries folder again  it had contents   downloaded drivers again  just to be sure   checked folder  contents still there   tried to backup   still gave me same error  so i manually added a new home  been working since  i have just switched the home folder to postgresql binaries and it works   i have no clue why it works now vs before  i am pretty sure i followed these exact steps   hope it helps

 navbarheight  is 144  48dp   thus the resource does exist   the  hassoftkeys  from the stackoverflow issue seems to works fine  but i might be a bit hacky to just measure the window imo 
yes  i believe you are correct   the schema  in the picture above  does not show all the properties because it is schemaless as the properties were created by the etl process   one fix could be to check existing schema  or data  and use the case of the imported data and not the case of the supplied "indexes" field   another fix could be to force schemaless properties to use the case of any indexes if indexes are already defined with the same name   finally  what would happen if you had a schema for your class and imported  via etl  some other data that had the same name but a different case than the property name    i don't know that i exercised this but i would assume that it works by finding the correct property to shove the data into   either way  it's not a huge issue but it's still a bug that could cause someone to lose time  and hair

works in vscode for me    i was able to isolate this issue    made a fresh install of eclipse 2019 06   installed only wwd   created a  xx yaml  file and pasted the following    after looking around the codebase of wwd i noticed this  https   github com eclipse wildwebdeveloper blob master org eclipse wildwebdeveloper src org eclipse wildwebdeveloper yaml yamllanguageserver java#l55 might be related  as it seems like the  validate  field is always set to true  instead wwd should check if the file opened has a schema registered   also the _kubernetes_ schema is registered for all   yaml  files  shouldn't it only apply to kubernetes config files  though i'm not sure if they are identifiable   
the other settings  background colors  text color  selected calendars  app to open on tap  are unaffected  as far as i can see  it is just the 24h format

the crux of the issue is that we provide an imap service to certain clients and while we haven't made explicit changes to the encoding they are asserting that the version update has caused this to start occurring with "all" of their incoming mails

seems to be impersonation issue  i was able to resolve the issue by adding these to my  alluxio properties 
seems fixed in 0 6 2  can't reproduce 
 pmlopes no problem  in my app i use my own auth class since i need digest authentication with database users and i fixed this issue  using a global static hash map of nonces with synchronized getter setter   i'm curious to see your implementation to learn how to proper use vertx shared data when concurrent access is needed  think about two different verticles threads that add a nonce to the global map at the same time   thanks 
will update tomorrow  
yes  of course  i though the client log might be useless  since the mod works fine in singleplayer  so it must have to do something with the server  d  i hope this is the right file  at least the time matches   https   gist github com accurexx 9346c76526b8d54f119fd3f6123c5d47  there are 2 regions within the log where thinks go weird  at least when i open the log with the notepad   if it's the right file  the first one should be the clay soldier placement  the second one the reconnection 
that's not what i meant   my idea is that only price of a single block of forest depends on the percentage of area that is free  arable   total   hence  using your example  planting trees on 1  of the area would cost different amounts  while the average price for a single block in the transaction  which we can calculate and use easily if it is a linear function  would be the same for both countries  country b would have to pay for 1000 times more blocks than country a  which is sensible  as it would get 1000 times higher absorption boost

what field type did you have on the data in es   most are keyword  but the source field is  "type" "text" "analyzer" "analyzer_keyword" "fielddata" true       does that happen always on all fields or only on that single one   i'm seeing it with every field i try  i first saw it with my top hosts widget  which is using source  if i do a 5 minute search and try doing quickvalues on various fields  all that i try will have random duplicate entries and the majority won't be sorted correctly       is this reproducible at any time   so far it is

i still haven't fixed it since it was low priority and i was working on other things such as deployment and documentation  i will try to finish it this week 
i don't see the value of it being a mandatory configuration value  a default value would be enough i think  i'll have a quick look to add a default value 
it may  but still depends on setup  i need to rewrite this bug description when i have some time   the basic issue is that the application being developed should  only  be run in the main workspace container  the only mode of debugging supported by che in any sustainable way is remote debugging in the main container  in my eyes  all "launch" configs should be hidden in theia unless absolutely necessary  since end users should not have to worry about what's running in sidecars 
i'm using  code master  code   maybe problem is too old version of intellij idea  fortunately i use windows not every day  i will check this later
 dakrone thanks for working on this bug  i am using es 1 4 4 on ubuntu 14 04 using the official es deb package   here is the config file with which i can reproduce the problem   https   gist github com setaou 7a65a242251f897aab35    after testing on a vanilla install with this config file and a very simple index  the example at https   github com elasticsearch elasticsearch#indexing   i discovered that the problem seems to affect more than just translogs  here is the listing of files after the indexing  https   gist github com setaou 7ca4f2b8abdcae55b8de   i suppose this did not appear on my previous setup because  data  partitions had a lot more free space than  var lib  so segments were only stored on  data  
i know its completely identical and thats the reason im confused too  i replace it woth the new that looks completely the same but the new one is fine    the modpe showtipmessage doesnt show up when its called  is it becaise of the color codes  if yes then ill retry if its really the colors since im using § instead of the chat    code
tablet dead  will test tomorrow morning when it is fully charged again 
usability wise  the event field is customizable meaning it can keyword or numeric  even if we restrict it to being a keyword   event where condition  is querydsl is essentially   event_field    "event" and      event is a value  we just happen to escape it automatically  so whether it's only letter or numbers should not matter since both are valid values    is problematic since it means  42  is a field not a value  which is not the case   implementation wise  i think reusing identifiers is problematic and having a dedicated token for eventtype  essentially an unescaped string  would work better 
i also observed this issue  +  a few seconds wallclock time accuracy with nitz synchronization   i solved this by implementing an sntp client using several ntp servers from http   www pool ntp org en   this way  the accuracy improved to  50ms at worst  which is good enough i guess  i didn't look into utctiming elements so far  maybe that's a better approach

thank you for the update to the pgt definition in the gatkvcfheaderlines    if the possible discordance of the gt and pgt in at least 1 genotype in  7   of the phased variants  is a feature and not a bug then i am not understanding the pgt field correct    for example why is gt and pgt concordant for the genotypes of  93  of the phased variants  anf if pgt  will only ever be heterozygous  then why are there pgt fields with the value 1 1  both concordant and discordant with the gt field   thank you for the extra clarification  a link to documentation describing the pgt whould also be very helpful     pgt 1 1 concordant with the genotype field

unfortunately i have been unable to reproduce this in a smaller test class  i also cannot make my full source available  i have never seen it take more than 2 waits  of 40ms each  to resolve the property  and i have only once seen it take 2 waits  so it is an incredibly narrow timing issue as far as i can tell  i also only see it when my disk i o  cpu  and ram are all at very high usage  i've never seen it occur without over 40 mb s in disk writes  95 + cpu usage  90 + ram usage  and creating destroying hundreds of mb worth of objects second   my hard drive is an ssd if that is relevant at all  i also made my transactions smaller to increase throughput and since doing so this issue has become much more rare  i now get it once every  10 hours of runtime at full load

npc doesn't detect you at all when chase range is anything higher than 0  however  we tried putting it at 0 so it attacks and follows the player  than put it at 30  and when the player left the chase range of 30 it indeed went back home  so the only problem here seems to be an absence of detection when chase range is higher than 0

 tthuem  i removed the entry in the legend    there is still missing an explanation of void feature model    also are constraint that are not satisfiable not highlighted     1  so should i highlight the unsatisfiable constraints or not  with the current implementation of the explanation it is not possible to recognize a unsatisfiable constraint   2  should i highlight the constraint that causes the void model or should we implement an explanation for the void model  that is currently not implemented     in the end the unsatisfiable constraint causes the feature model to be void aswell  so an explanation of the void model would be perfect

just got a crazy idea while reading this  chocobo "armour" for the player  made from chocobo feathers  doesn't have any protection value  but will make the player "look" like a chocobo and prevent chocobos from running away  d this will need 24 feathers     right now that's a hell lot of feathers  but if we increase the feather drop after all and include untamed chocobos in the feather drop routine  feather drops should be sufficient   
i'm gonna make a new issue with the new problems
 zackm0571 i've managed to reproduce this by modifying the quickstart example with some code from the screencapturer example  i've got it on a branch of this repo  i don't have permissions to push to the remote so i've just zipped up the modified videoactivity java file     videoactivity java zip  https   github com twilio video quickstart android files 2388718 videoactivity java zip   to reproduce with this code  after accepting the screen share permission  two devices can connect to the same room in the same way as the standard quickstart and their screens will be shown to each other  one device can then turn off sending their screen by tapping the video floating action button so one device is just viewing the other screen  the bug is illustrated if both devices then rotate to landscape and you can see that the transmitted screen contents are only a small slice within the video   let me know if it's not clear  cheers

i did somewhat similar to what you suggested but without the annotations  the final design i came up with that i'm currently trying to implement is the following     an entity view class hierarchy might have multiple usages  when a type of the hierarchy is used statically attribute type   it becomes an _inheritancebase_  the effect is  that every subtype of that _inheritancebase_ class gets a specific class generated that is bound to that _inheritancebase_  the next concept that is interesting is about _subtype configurations_  in jpa you only have a single subtype configuration i e  every entity subtype of an inheritance enabled entity is part of that subtype configuration  in blaze persistence entity views  we allow to have multiple subtype configurations by specifying the interesting subtypes at the use site attribute declaration   at runtime  every subtype configuration needs an appropriate _factory_ method that is used to construct subtype instances uniformly  previously  we tried to generate constructors for every configuration which doesn't work out  the new idea is  to construct an overall configuration that contains all subtypes for which only a single constructor is created  every other subtype configuration has a mapping to that overall configuration  for each subtype configuration  we now generate a _static create_ method that maps the configuration specific attributes to the overall constructor  that way  we avoid clashing constructors when having multiple configurations  the _static create_ methods are suffixed with their subtype configuration index

i am sorry  but i needed to take a little pause from mc  let's go for details   i originally had fe build 1146  where it worked  but then i updated for later builds and it stopped working  i had my spawn position in other dimension than basic overworld  but first it took the coords where i setted it up and then teleported me to overworld on those coords  totally ignoring that i was setting it up in another dimension  dunno if i updated or so after that  but it did not worked with more versions  i tried those ones  1187  1234  1256  1265   for checks if it is not just by messing in perms  i also deleted it all and recreated  but nothing worked  only reverting back to  quite a lot  old version   still i might have messed something really badly  but i don't know what would be a thing that would overwrite fe's spawn thingie for good until downgrade   ps  i actually in that bad times did some amateur video  https   www dropbox com s jv9yod5zz8fbdmy 2016 08 29 1901 49 flv i had suspicions for that i messed dimensions  but then i deleted all fe datas and it was still there  even when i tried only fe command and even when i tried it just in overworld few blocks away     that was really bad time heh

my hope is that intellij is smart enough to honor the  version  attribute on the  xsl stylesheet  element but yeah it's something to watch out for    i can't see any way of manually choosing the xslt version   an example issue it detects is the "undeclared template parameter  space " in  wc ui text text_space xsl  https   github com bordertech wcomponents blob 799c9f17db64cb1a617003b9308e75c44db2a203 wcomponents theme src main xslt wc ui text text_space xsl#l22  which calls the template  wc ui text n wstyledtextcontent xsl  https   github com bordertech wcomponents blob 799c9f17db64cb1a617003b9308e75c44db2a203 wcomponents theme src main xslt wc ui text n wstyledtextcontent xsl#l9  that seriously looks to me like it doesn't have a  space  parameter     there are over one hundred other such issues detected on this analysis alone

yes  that's the issue i was referring to  sorry for the bad wording     i am using dash content  and i agree that it is usually not a good idea  however  it is necessary when you want to get down the latency by shortening the segment duration  fractional seconds in my case   while avoiding a bad compression efficiency through frequent usage of keyframes  this way you can end up starting with a number of consecutive segments without keyframes when tuning into a live stream

ok  this is strange  i try on my home computer  ubuntu  and it works as expected  i used "fresh" pref and also the same pref than my other computer  it was the same database   i will try again on my work computer  windows  tomorrow 
it's a phonegap application so it uses the listener for crud operations with the local database 
i can't seem to reproduce it any more  but also intellij seems to be remembering the sdk location now and i can't work out how to make it forget previously it had serious issues remembering the sdk path   of course that might be an unrelated issue   there are several  threaddumps freeze  logs that seem to show bad stuff happening  i've attached them all here   log zip  https   github com flutter flutter intellij files 1005781 log zip   there's a nice 180 line stack trace in there  yeay java  that seems to suggest it is some deadlock deep inside the file browser dialog  i think when i click cancel   could be an intellij issue  if i uninstall the dart and flutter plugins  and reinstall them will that reset their settings to a blank state  might be worth a try if so

hello   i think i found the problem  i tried the quickstart and it works and then return to my code and it didn't  then to cut some testing time i hard coded the twilio token which is generated from the online generator and suddenly  it works   i think for some reason there is some inconsistency between android and other clients on parsing the access token   our backend generates the access token with video grant and conversation because we are currently supporting both till we have a stable version   our python library is 5 6

i didn't know that  thank you for clarification  but my following lines of code still work fine  so it's look like the rightclick events are correctly detected  only the event cancelling doesn't work     however it was working fine with the dev20b  just before i update to the dev22f    in this example  the player always receives the message and the five dirts  however the cancelling doesn't fail occasionally but on each try

yes spring retry is on the class path and  enableretry annotation is in place  i do see a retry if i introduce a network failure  however do not see a retry for the status codes that i define in my configuration   dependencies is setup in maven as follows 
 oscerd can you guide me on what 'from' and 'to' patterns mean  i would expect that the get event would be an initiation step of a flow like  1  i get a specific event 2  i do something with the info what is the use case when 'get event' is an end action  can i do sth with the result that it returns 
must have done something wrong when i tried code fences   thanks for edit   yes it is similar i need to install on a test box to test one more time and capture details   i remember lots of java error issues though   i am ok if you want to close mine referencing the other as i am fairly confident that once you guys dive into the code it will all be resolved   i can follow the other one and even test builds since they sound similiar 
sure  https   youtu be ue0_57qgzd8  i think the event fires twice for no good reason in this case    maybe it fires the crafting event here for each of the 2 axes      since the regular shapeformed fires only once for the diamond axe  as shown in the video   
 vegegoku agree if they are called in these cases and could be overriden  currently they are final and can't be overriden 
uh  my bad  probably  i updated the script  i indeed omitted the  chmod u+w  part and single quotes around  eof s  and i can't reproduce it anymore  it's probably an id10t issue on my side  sorry for wasting your time

thanks for explaining the presentation    no error appears on the errorlog    after a bit more digging  it seems that classes that are not inherited  ie class  name    monobehavior  are working as expected and i can access transform  gameobject etc    it's the inherited classes that aren't accessing the monobehavior from the parent   ie class  name    parentclass   does that help

that's amazing  i did not know that  let's do that for starters  set the canvas background to use the dynamic system background color   i think doing that will remove the mismatch between the canvas and richtext  but i think we can make this bullet proof for the aforementioned examples by removing the background fill altogether from richtext

thanks  please do not misunderstand  i've been happily using antlr  including previous versions  for years  to create parsers in java  i've been testing antlr's limits lately trying to implement a poorly designed grammar  too many ambiguities   produced by someone else  while modifying the grammar as little as possible   regarding rule parameters and return values   i would have expected a full description as a section under "parser rules" in the grammar reference your example of getting rid of left recursion would be better if it also showed the effect on tail recursive rules  one of the harder issues with any parser generator technology  including antlr  is implementing the parser to generate good  from a user's point of view  error messages  i'd like to see a very full discussion of that in the book  with plenty of examples    david     from  terence parr notifications github com   to  antlr antlr4 antlr4 noreply github com    cc  david cok cok frontiernet net    sent  friday  july 10  2015 6 50 pm   subject  re   antlr4  crash on adding an argument to a rule  #953   you will note that the soon to be released version that response to that issue now generates a proper error message what is it about the book that is unclear about parameters   other than left recursive arguments   i'd be happy to add to the next release — reply to this email directly or view it on github

attempting to use the laser to increase the stats of fluid does work  however  it destroys a significant portion of the fluid each time a catalyst is used  this is a serious issue because it makes making decent crystals basically impossible unless i want to spend hours trying to do it  real world hours  the catalyst was nether stars to note 
if all things are equal for all countries  should gdp not increase either    i think the trend prior to kyoto was that for countries who's gdp increased more  their co2 emissions increased more too    i think it might be worth trying to model reality a little closer on this as it's not a particularly tricky issue  and it also shows quite nicely what would've happend without kyoto 
our valkyrie is currently on the master branch for jsc software and the develop branch for ihmc software  however  this hasn't worked for a while now on the real robot  i've never had a problem with it in simulation though and i've been on a few versions

the only way to change my name that i know of is going to mojang's website and i only did that once  my name was not gumball when i created my minecraft account a long time ago  i changed it to gumball a few months ago and never touched it again  is this the only way to get this error  because if it is  then i think there's a bug 
de icing is not a choice  what you meant is de misting  i think it is still simply too cold for the ac mode to kick in  but maybe it is warmer where you are    what the field should indicate is how the coolant circuit is switched  de ice the main radiator  cool  or heat  my advise would be to leave it like this until summer

changed title according to feedback by  rsudev   additional question  which library version are we currently using with the new map  to match the table provided be  swisspopo   
yes  i was surprised to see something that would cause the container to crash exit  hopefully more detailed log info will help    i don't need to mount all of the files  so documentation on how to exclude some folders  like  vendor  would be helpful   however i think we need to learn the cause of the problem to make this more stable for everybody 
uhm for disable i need to change the configuration of my monitors but i think that work
yup this works    thanks for the quick reply  do you have any docs on what info it collects  i may just stay at the old version if there's something useful in there

thanks luis  i'm facing a problem though  the project that contains the  paramfinegraintest  depends on the parser so i can not use the  paramfinegraintest  in the parser without introducing a dependency cycle  now maven is complaining  can we do something about this

_could it be drive related   the reference projects are on another drive than my actual project  in any case  see log below  i have omitted project dirs for clarity   it's working on the first opened project on d  drive  not on the one on c  drive   tested with x y spaces removal _  edit  i tested some more  and it probably has something to do with project settings not yet been read and the default settings being used  because when i reopen projects it works  even if in the default settings everything except save and  ctrl shift s  is unchecked   also fyi  there is a shortcut command to get to the idea logs in the menu help show log in explorer  gets you to the directory  or is this windows only     
 stychu it's not that it doesn't start  it simply hangs in the "initializing hot reload" doesn't always happen but when attached to debugger it happens way more than not 
it could have negative side effects on the integration runtime
 clevertension i opened the issue with no description so i’m not sure why you are asking  mbhave to clarify things rather than me  we opened the issue as madhura and i identified a bug while reviewing another change  it’s a tricky problem and the issue was opened as a reminder to us more than anything else  madhura’s comment means that it’s not as easy to fix as we had hoped   a property source is a spring framework concept that is described in some detail in  its javadoc  https   docs spring io spring framework docs current javadoc api org springframework core env propertysource html

i am using modtweaker to change a few casting and crucible recipes  this file should be the one with most of these recipes removals  but there might a couple of others in the other files in that folder  https   github com thephoenixlodge regrowth stuff blob master scripts earlytech zs it does seem to not like me using the  mt reload command anymore either  usually telling me a modification is stuck  so i have to reboot the game completely 
not too many other details     i attacked with a territorial hammerskull  the opponent had two creatures  one with summoning sickness  i tried clicking on that creature to select it with the hammerskull's effect  i tried multiple times at multiple different places on the card  i was unable to select it  i then clicked the second create  without summoning sickness  and the effect triggered immediately   i will try to re create it locally and see if i can get any other details that may be relevant   thank you   on wed  sep 20  2017 at 4 56 am  theelk801  notifications github com  wrote 
i'm so sorry  i've been out of town  i will try this tomorrow on a fresh project to ensure there was nothing else happening in mine

apologies for the long reply but these are taken form my notes from debugging the differences and i thought they might help you pinpoint the issue         i've further debugged the stacktrace for my app with both the old and new library versions  and with the new libraries tried my parameter type as both  longparam  and  optionallong    combinations tested   1  dropwizard 1 3 16 and  longparam  2  dropwizard 2 0 0 and  longparam  3  dropwizard 2 0 0 and  optionallong    my initial comment that  this line in  singlevalueextractor   https   github com eclipse ee4j jersey blob 2 29 1 core server src main java org glassfish jersey server internal inject singlevalueextractor java#l61  was where the error occurred was wrong    one difference is that in 1  the  1 3 16 version of  abstractparamconverter fromstring   https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob release 1 3 x dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverterprovider java#l49  does an explicit call to  com google common base strings isnullorempty value    and so returns  null  for empty string  this check here seems to be responsible for making it then use the default value   this has changed in  2 0 0  https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob v2 0 0 dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverterprovider java  and it no longer has a check for empty string  however from the traces above it doesn't actually appear to be called called anymore   the trace for 2  calls through to  io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverter t  fromstring  instead   and there's  no empty string checking here  https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob release 2 0 x dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey params abstractparamconverter java#l36    it just blows up with the exception    similarly in case 3    io dropwizard jersey optional optionallongparamconverterprovider optionallongparamconverter fromstring string    https   github com dropwizard dropwizard blob release 2 0 x dropwizard jersey src main java io dropwizard jersey optional optionallongparamconverterprovider java#l30  has no explicit empty string check  the parse error results in an  optionallong empty  as detailed earlier   so there appears to be no equivalent code in 2 0 0  at least with the rest of my config  that does this explicit empty string check for either 2  or 3  that appears needed to get it to then use the deafult value       does that give you any ideas what it might be or how to fix this  or does this differ from your hellow world example if you set breakpoints and debug from here    if not i'll take a look at trying to create a simple reproduceable for this          i've checked the gradle build scan for my application and all dropwizard dependencies are at 2 0 0  for test 2  and 3   
this is for loading just 10 per page   i don't have the specs for our application server but i don't suspect you need much for a simple query like this  perhaps it's a database issue  i'll follow up once i know more

during the sync or the download to my pc via https i have no problems  but it looks like if i share files via https and other users from the internet download them so it could happens too and via my android phone  but i can't find the problem because the server is busy at 100  and it occures no error and i could only reboot my server  my server is running a ubuntu server 12 04 lts on my home pc ubuntu 12 04 lts 
we actually encountered this bug in a workshop where people had empty spacer columns  they would all have the same name  the empty string    people have the weirdest csv files so we can't expect every file to be in the perfect format  it's more a question of how to handle this   to solve this    we could ignore the second column and simply not import them  although that seems rude    we could add suffixes to the column names when we encounter them more than once  e g  "2012a"

varchar 500       my team extend executebatch  method，we set lock_key  longtext ，but to this issue just add log is fine   这个问题，我认为加一行日志就好，方便问题定位，lock_key默认值一般就够了。因为我们扩展实现了executebatch ，所以我们设置这个key为 longtext ，但我不建议其他人这么设置，数据库大字段操作不易优化。
we have created pull request #7106 that resolves the original issue  the pull request to resolve appendix issue has not been created yet  maybe it should be processed in dedicated issue

i've done the backup with the old version  i'm rather sure it did not contain any of the new directory logic  independent of the exact build date  since i wanted to avoid that code before travelling to asia a month ago   then uninstalled manually and installed the new version  i'm not sure if cgeo recognized to migrate anything  i have not seen any ui indicating a migration  i'm fine with closing this 
 andrewlewis thank you for your help  after checking the code and the crash reports  the app doesn't call  imaadsloader stop  directly  is there anything else that might be related that i can check if the app is calling wrong   and we could only find this assertion failure in the reports   not sure if it is related
the fix was provided  i think we can close  thank you
i think this is a rare edge case if you have coordinates resulting in the same node ids  often different coordinates that snap to the same coordinate on the road resulting in the same tower node  but sometimes also pillar node

probably around 50 height  and 80 width  its one of the smaller zones and usually resets fine  the warzone that triggers the out of memory is usually random and not any in particular  i did notice before the server would lag up like crazy and print out tons of null pointers when a warzone would randomly reset and the server would barely recover after them  i am thinking maybe those errors intensified and the server simply crashes without displaying them  ive posted those errors before and could try to dig some up   edit  we have 6 gb of ram allocated to the server and we usually have 2 3 freed up while the server is running  14 07 12 40 41  server  info free allocated memory  3447 0 mb 14 07 12 40 41  server  info jvm allocated memory  6092 0 mb 14 07 12 40 41  server  info available total memory  6092 0 mb
yes i had about 30 40 old merge requests that have already been closed  so it went ahead and parsed 20 30 of them and correctly added the comments but the build failed  not sure 'cuz the branches didn't exit anymore  and then it seemed to have run into some exception and won't parse the rest of the merge requests or any new ones which have the branches available  no comments  no build  just seems to be stuck  restarting jenkins does not help either   i'm using gitlab 5 1 0 e36372e

so that during the compilation of  module info java   the java compiler sees the packages exported by kotlin  otherwise  javac complains on the first  exports  clause  claiming there's no such package    however  in #99 and #101  we've established that we won't be changing the destination dir of  compilejava   or any other task  at all  instead  we'll add the destination dirs to modulepath  for compilation   or produce a special "merged" dir with outputs  for run test

we actually had this come up during some routine maintenance at hubspot  it actually raises another issue  which i'm not sure how to file  we were swapping a master  with the intent to sustain no downtime   the redis docs recommend setting the replacement as a slave to the old master  making it writeable  directing all traffic to the slave  and then once the old master is not serving any traffic  promoting the slave to master  at this time  we found out that  1  when you  slaveof  http   redis io commands slaveof   the hostname is just a fully qualified domain name  so something like  mountain top subdomain1 subdomain2  is just as valid as an ip address  while the master stores slaves as ip addresses  the slaves stores the master as is  this means the topology provider will hit the slave  fail to parse  and die   2  in order to do a master swap with no downtime  you must write to a slave with read only disabled  lettuce _does not_ support this at all  at present  i think it probably needs a write routing option  with either  master  or  write_enabled_slave_preferred    the former makes sense when swaps may incur downtime  but the latter is required for downtime free swaps

hi  vzhukovskii  sure  i would like to invoke a web service in order to store it server side  that log file will contains the workspace  i guess that i can fetch it from appcontext  and the path + file name of the created file 
yes  i mean 'full application restart'  sometimes i need to click many times  but sometimes just two clicks with like half a second in between hits this  i seem to hit it more often when using a physical android device than when using the ios simulator   after that the only remedy is to restart ij  so pretty severe 
no  it's not been reported on  minishift   indeed that let us believe this is caused by resource limits that are set on  fuse ignite  but not locally on our dev environment   investigating in that direction right now
metadata obiuvsly is in the module not in the app that is using library

ps  while zipkin server start  it will create a queue uses it's defaut args  so  conform the target queue is not exists  if exists delete it    and do not start zipkin server  we create the queue use different args manually   and now  start zipkin server  it would raise exception   i think  you should check if the queue exists before create it   my args example                             virtual host  monitor queue name  queue monitor zipkin durability  true auto delete  false arg "x message ttl"  36000000 arg "x max length"  1000000 arg "x max length bytes"  300485760  my startup cmd                              java  jar zipkin server 2 8 4 exec jar  server  xmx128m  xms128m   management endpoints enabled by default true   zipkin collector rabbitmq uri amqp   user_name password hostname port vhost   zipkin collector rabbitmq queue queue monitor zipkin   zipkin collector rabbitmq connection timeout 15000   zipkin collector rabbitmq concurrency 1
sure  for example   目に立つ  actually  as i just noted  the bug also occurs when one doesn't edit anything  when exporting the 目に立つ for example  the kanji   readings field becomes 目 め に立 た つ  which would have to be changed to 目 め に 立 た つ in order to have the furigana centered correctly   but the flashcard only displays 目つ then  which wasn't the case with the older version of aedict   on 11 jul 2017 7 55 pm  "martin vysny"  notifications github com  wrote

nevermind on the   i was wrong again   i found   referenced but it was for some old mach2 documentation  the only thing i've found now are     are valid and so is   but it seems   is for linuxcnc and a few others but    is accepted across the board for all g code  i even found a sample code or 2 on the git site that had some   semicolons in it  we have a machine that uses mach3 and a semicolon is valid as well as the parentheses    comments out everything in that line after the semicolon    can be used to enclose comments in the middle of g code or at the end of a line too   going forward i will only use    to enclose comments   hopefully you can figure out the bug in tgfx

 tora b apologies  first time using github for this purpose  the issue is that after the initial death loop  the server was attempting to synchronize hundreds of times a second with that player  even after a full reboot  and managing to get the player out of the dimension  this persisted from the time the player logged in after a server reboot  until a crash or hard kill command  the server  as a result  was hitting upwards of 200  cpu usage  making it unplayable for all other players     electroblob77 i'm afraid the log was nothing but thousands upon thousands of lines of " server  server thread info  ebwizardry   synchronising spell emitters for playername" with no variation  i honestly wish i had more information for you    a solution was found  however much less than ideal  in deleting the player's playerdata from the server

sorry for forgetting about the vital infos  version is 2013 09 19   does the content of the field gets uploaded to gc com at all when i use the "bearbeiten"  engl  translation  button  but not the upload button  i only use "bearbeiten"  never upload  so there can't be any remote content  as i would understand it  when i observed this behaviour i was surely not visiting the website  with that lousy gprs reception out there i would surely remember    i do not even see a „note“ field on the website for that cache  is that a premium feature  i never used it   some other strange thing  when i just looked at the notes in the app  there was only an "bearbeiten" button  no more upload  i could edit the note fine  removing the doubled portion of the note  when dismissing the pop up edit box for the note with "ok" now i have two buttons again  bearbeiten and upload  does displaying the upload button depend on some condition  may it be connected to the other issue   i now pressed upload  and it tells me about success  but still no sign of my note anywhere in the listing on gc com   enjoy your holidays

hi andy   yes  it's version 3 5 0  the one which was updated on my phone on the 13th    i just did some tests again a few minutes ago  the strange thing is now it seems to be working again  i had these issues the last two days and it was reproducible every time  but it's still the same version and now it's working  weird       well  thanks for your reply  andy      
 quanticc i can no longer reproduce this issue with this commit  thank you a lot 
it's a bug in my configuration  it just happens the other mods are more tolerant with metadata    1 
the model no is gt i8552 android version 4 1 2
tested manually as well  works as expected  closing   cannot duplicate manually or through automation 
again  thanks for the replies guys   henry is correct   the modular upgrades let each storage unit contain 300 stacks each  i run a server for several friends  so i was trying to provide them with plenty of room  i totally understand the lag part  too  i went into creating this issue under the assumption it was likely throttled for performance  i wasn't sure if there was a way to adjust it or not  if there is  fantastic  that would be great  if not  i'll find workarounds  i still love the ender io system   i might need to create a separate "issue" for this  but have you all considered adding any kind of "advanced storage"  i may type that up later

hi  robfrank    yes  you are right  i try to use jdbc in remote with standalone server   about stack trace      i see "error deserializing record to get field names  send this data for debugging" string in log  also i get npe at java site  i insert entity by query  insert into hypothesis content  "pos" 1 "description" "np    p" "id" "1234567890"   i get same error then i execute my query by native orientdb api  i guess that is problem of json parser 
hi  im using the version 4 1 69  here are a screenshot of the loading   https   www spigotmc org threads luckperms an advanced permissions plugin 174259 page 103#post 2983419
hi  damienmg    the last error is solved after i did     thanks again   jian  _note_  edited for formatting
it was mostly simple terms aggs but also one global agg with a filter  iirc the query itself was that same filter being applied to the global agg

the stacktrace is self explanatory  one can see from the flow of the source code that no converter is being employed  here's the markup                b datepicker id "sd" value "# testbean starttime "                           format "dd mm yyyy"                           ajax "true" update " f config"                 f converter converterid "calendarconverter"                 b datepicker     and the converter class      facesconverter value   "calendarconverter"  public class calendarconverter implements converter      private static final logger logger   logger getlogger calendarconverter class getname       private final simpledateformat date_format   new simpledateformat "dd mm yyyy"         and so on    the converter is created but neither of its methods is being called     zhedar  what do you mean by "we didn't implement this use case"  the whole story about converters is that you actually don't need to worry about different use cases  just tell me what your component expects and it's gonna be my responsibility to use proper converter 
 timtay microsoft thanks for feedback  at client side  i defined devicemethodcallback  in java sdk    therefore  the parser  at server  cannot parse this payload due to the backslashes  while the correct message should be         "status"  123       "payload"   "abc"  "xyz"   
yup  it is fixed on 4 0 0 snapshot   i used picasso in this case     thumbsup 
may i send files to you by email 
i am able to replicate with another query without  no  
 concavelenz you might be right  depends on your point of view  for me  import  a  from 'ab'   means i'm only interested in a class from a js and i think this should be equivalent to  import  a  from 'a'    export  b  from 'b'   should be ignored in this case   is es6 import works differently  
i can't reproduce it either on my desktop  so maybe this is some cache issue on my laptop

i downgraded to 3 4 1 to avoid for now  so not seeing this again for now  i am actually seeing this still  it happens occasionally when i just open my app  but not everytime  i am initialising the stream client in my main activity  the log doesn't show me where this error originates from my code  so it makes it difficult to point out the origin from my code  but i'm initialising the stream client in my mainactivity  and other times in my channel list and detail views in case the stream client is destroyed by the system 
it seems partially but not completely fixed   the screen with the sliders still reports the minimum values  and the text output for the battery storage still reports the minimum limit    however  it seems that the battery is charged to the appropriate level  and a plasma cannon seems to actually reflect the settings when used    that is  for the plasma cannon  the tinker screen reports the minimum values  but when fired  max charge plasma damage does actually go up to what it should be when the damage is maxed  and turning up the explosion effect does result in explosions when the plasma balls land  
yep  i'll give that a shot tomorrow  didn't see there was an update 
gregtech 5 was added later to the world as a gregtech 6 replacement when i have found out that gregtech 6 had no tech tree at that moment   in fluid registry only the glue from tinkers' construct was found and deleted  launching the world afterwards changed all unusable gregtech glue to tinkers' construct glue  which successfully was accepted by assembling machine   the problem was solved  the issue can be closed 
yes it is same with the 0 3 2 version  i found the solution  need to change        public boolean canscrollhorizontally             return getchildcount     0        to      public boolean canscrollhorizontally             return getchildcount    1         in taillayoutmanager class
it belongs to root root   btw  i installed using " sudo   bazel 0 1 2 installer linux x86_64 sh   bazelrc  home  bazelrc" because it copied file to  usr local         so  it might be better to initialize the cache when first run bazel but not during the installation 
yes  i agree with your analysis that a fix for https   github com google exoplayer issues 837 would also solve this 
hi   i understand what you mean  but my question is simple  i define an experiment with a seed  i load the model  the seed value is correct in the parameter view  in parameter view  i change a variable and reload the model from parameter view  with the anticlockwise circular arrow   now the seed is changed  i don't want the seed value to change    do you confirm that even in this case  only one experiment  it will change    i do not understand what you mean by seed for experiment and seed for simulation   i have my seed in experiment section as a float  i guess this is experiment seed   what is simulation seed   please could you clarify  regards  srirama

ah all rights  i need to type  kbd space  kbd  after  toreview  before it's actually added in  the  toreview  already appeared on the list of selected labels  in a faded state  before that so i thought it was added in and press  kbd enter  kbd    another behaviour is that while the  toreview  is in the faded state as above  if i click on the  toreview  label  it will show as being removed  crossed out state  although it's correctly applied after confirmation 
i do not have docker on my path  and i'm not sure i ever did    i thought it worked last week  but i still have this breakage when i reset back to the beginning of last week   i arbitrarily reset to 5d72d4ea54fdcb6e963cacb7181fda847e01bc50  commit from late june  and retried  and ran into no issues   do we require that users download docker to contribute to bazel

i think i can do that  but i do not like this idea  because now the rules will depend on the content of listitem a   if other rules match the whole listitem a k  block and do something else  then it will be very bad  because it is very hard for me to detect whether or not the c semantics want to include mathing the listitem next  case or exclude the listitem next  case in other contexts

i was also thinking that jrebel relies on specific patterns in class file  i disabled aspectj plugin for jrebel  as class under the test in from aspectj framework    this should have prevented instrumentation  but the result was the same  although jrebel log stated plugin was disabled  we do not know how jrebel is implemented  maybe some other code of the tool instruments the class anyway    here is  a dumped class file  https   github com raphw byte buddy files 426627 org aspectj weaver referencetype 1471595599440 zip    i believe there could be other instrumentation libraries that heavily rely on bytecode structure  could it be possible to append the value returned from   onmethodenter  to the end of local variables array to avoid shifting existing variables  with this approach risks of collisions probably would be minimized

hi  pascalav  thanks for looking into this  and for your detailed analysis   first  i don't think we want to change any of the logic around when  isvalid  is called  primarily because the existing  of  and  with  methods have a specific contract  which always returns a valid  interledgeraddress     here's a summary of the current naming conventions       interface of    methods are like a constructor  whereby you supply all of the required fields to construct an object  and you get a fully constructed  valid  immutable object back  typically a static method on the interface      interface from    methods are like a factory method  whereby you supply some "raw materials" that can be used to derive everything necessary to call   of     typically a static method on the interface      interface with    methods are called on an already constructed object  append some information or data  and return a a fully constructed  valid  immutable object  typically a non static or default method on the interface or abstract implementation of an interface   note that most interfaces in quilt do not have a "with" method  because most objects are not appendable in the way  interledgeraddress  is     interface builder    methods return an instance of an immutables project generated builder that can be used to mutate data before actual construction  for example   interledgeraddressbuilder       builder from     this has a specific meaning in immutables project generated builders  see  here  http   immutables github io immutable html#builder     with that in mind   interledgeraddress#of  is  meant to function more like a constructor  and _not_ like a builder  in other words  when you call "of"  you will receive a complete  fully valid  interledgeraddress   likewise  the contract for  interledgeraddress#with  will always start with a valid  interledgeraddress  and result in a new ilp address with an additional suffix   thus  in order to accomplish something closer to the builder pattern that you identified above  where callers can append portions of an ilp address before actual construction  we have several options   1  do nothing  force callers to construct their ilp address as a string before calling  interledgeraddress#of     1  extend the builder generated by immutables to support this functionality  and then just have developers call  interledgeraddress#builder   and use that thing with the new "just append a part of your ilp address" extension method  unfortunately  i don't think  immutables  immutables github io  supports this in the builder out of the box  but it might worth investigating  if you can't easily customize the generated builders  perhaps it would be worth logging an enhancement in the immutables project   1  define our own custom builder that extends the immutables generated builder  and is then returned from the static method  interledgeraddress#builder    overall  i haven't run into a case where i've wanted to gradually assemble an ilp address using the  interledgeraddress  or  interledgeraddressbuilder  classes  instead  a much more common use case i've encountered is where i have an ilp prefix string  already assembled  that might look like   g us foo    and i need to append an account to it  e g   "myaccount"   so i will often only be doing this     with all that said  i vote for option 1 above  since i've never encountered a use case for option 2 or 3 and it's not clear if option 2 is even possible   thoughts 
you're welcome     i forgot to mention the scenario why this is important  if you want to use bootsfaces on a page that's unauthenticated  like a login page   an attacker can run your server out of resources easy ier  by creating millions of sessions  it's best to not let a public facing page modify the state of the server   i'll get a reproducer to you tomorrow or wed  it's pretty easy to reproduce  cheers   jonathan
it looks like the problem is classpath containing " " not quoted   i can reproduce it with following step     create 2 maven projects as a and b   add project b as project a's dependency   add both projects into the same workspace   debug on project a  debugger may produce something likes this   sometimes debugger may decide bundle them all into single jar  in this case everything goes fine

additional library folder  'project  asciidoctor lib'  is currently opened 444 times  i have deleted it just a few minutes ago with all its content  but i see it still as opened  with deletion info   this could be former issue  or new one  deleting lib directory while idea running   i will try to get another too many open files error in next few days  but without  asciidoctor lib folder  can i do something more  edit  it is open directory  so perhaps listing ruby files can be cause

yes it ran when it was 1 8 8 only updated the other day when myz was finally updated to 1 9  i did try last month but server crashed many times  i even deleted the mywarp folder to start all over and it can't write the files error logs below  i thought maybe the database got corrupted that's why i deleted folder  i noticed this morning my backed was for my creative server so path was wrong  when i backed up i must of copied in wrong folder   i corrected the path and now it runs but i lost all my warps not a big deal since it was still under development  just my warps are missing  it still can't create files to do a fresh start 
 ojw28 unfortunately  i can't share that file currently  i'll see if i can share some sample file that has the same issue  so you could investigate mp3extractor  in the meantime  can you please help me with my question  is that safe to do 
the issue we're trying to demonstrate is    1   subscribe to an atmosphere endpoint chatroom 2   unsubscribe from that atmosphere endpoint chatroom 3   subscribe to a different atmosphere endpoint chatroom 4   make an http request to a non atmosphere endpoint   we're finding that step 4 often fails   is there something inherently wrong with the approach we're trying to use  is there something we missed that would cause http requests happening concurrently with atmosphere calls to fail suspend etc

i would just go with giving all the test helper classes versioned names  it keeps things straightforward 
hi there  no the name was  iv  so it's max 12 characters
ok will do   thanks   on 1 8 16  costin leau notifications github com wrote 
doesn't batfish_build_all do that

yes  i use optifine  i'll try immediately 
hi  avurro thanks for the fast response  i do get a exception    com googlecode jmapper exceptions jmapperexception  com googlecode jmapper exceptions conversionbodyillegalcodeexception  there is an error in the generated method  additional information   source error  invalid types for     
the general principle is to start several threads to add the same data    the id of the testdata table is a custom field with a unique index    the graphtemplate is wrapped by myself  and i actually call graphtraversal  addv internally   wolf4ood  thank you reply ，i hope it can be fix as soon as possible
thanks   in tomcat dbthreadsession gets one connection from coreconnectionpool and never be return to coreconnectionpool so the connection will always be held by the tomcat thread and never be validated by the coreconnectionpool   validation is done in the coreconnectionpool 
https   gist github com ciscam f538eb21e40978f10b75463aa23648f4 here's the "logcat  c  logcat  v long" output turning off all providers didn't change the behavior  thanks for pointing that out  though   also  using the app from f droid   i'd try the play store version  but it's still on 2 32 3  which works fine when installed from f droid
oops    i meant client session  signed cookie    initiated by  cookiesession      config 
yeah  the line #70 is called a "diamond route"  where it divides and serves different parts of a neighborhood on alternating trips     btw  i can kinda understand why otp is doing what it's doing with that trip  since it's always trying to transfer you to the 19 at some point  so if you say you'll walk a mile  just put you on the 19 and forgo the 70    the strange thing though is that it's not consistent in telling you to walk to the 19 when you say you're willing to walk 1 mile     same trip with a fairly small change  e g   a trip start point 200' to the east  gives you the 17th   rex routing on the 70   it's inconsistencies like this from otp that make me worry there's not a scale of problems underlying the routing choices  hence the desire to get someone to take a look

i don't really know how to explain this either  but i'll try my best   it seems like essentials only blocks commands by plugins who have registered it  plugins like chatcontrol or other others that lets you "create your own command" technically don't register the command  they just match what you type you chat and execute the command   take chatcontrol for example  you can create your own command  however  those commands aren't registered  therefore essentials can't even pick it up 
it would even be ok if it's always on   but sure  a checkbox is fine     or another idea  if you can see the log level when those messages come across bluetooth  maybe offer a choice of which level to enable   so far i think people typically comment out or disable most log messages before releasing a watch app  to avoid cluttering the log   but maybe if they could be disabled  it would make more sense to leave some of them in  for the sake of spontaneous troubleshooting in the field   otoh they would waste bluetooth bandwidth and battery power  i suppose  so i'm not sure if that's a good practice   it might be better if there was a way to push the log level as a setting to the watch  so that disabled messages aren't sent across  but that's one of those things that we can't change  i guess 
tested and it's working fine  thanks 
i should have provided more background   we had a project which was using ml gradle 3 6 and was deploying conditionally from different directories  for example  in testing environments  we simply added a path to modulepaths to deploy our test source and data to marklogic  we decide to start using dhf and migrate what we could   with dhf  ml gradle modulepaths are ignored so conditional deployment is no longer possible   in the end  we migrated all our code under plugins but have not found a dhf way to deploy code conditionally to marklogic  most likely we will _eval_ something on the server in a post deploy hook to delete files not in use but this is not ideal  i don't know if there is anything on the dhf roadmap but something like a "dhf ignore" list would be great 
webserver onrequest function request          console log 'request is trigger'            for now this is the only code i had  but i always receive a "net  err_connection_refused" and i never pass in my callback function

i didn't do anything different before or after   just opened it as usual   one day the maps showed   the next they did not 
here it is  pastebin couldn't handle the 700'000 lines  paste ee had the same problem  https   drive google com file d 0b35nfaozqlwjzwqtthd5s21myk0 view usp sharing
yes it does  but not hidden 
yeah the quick fix seems to work  thank you very much  i also learned something pretty interesting from this issue about drawables   
marc  thank you for the reply   let me check with my collaborator  as it is his data and i don't want to be sending it out without his consent     it is worth mentioning that the system we are exporting from is running only one instance of peptideshaker  and the one we are trying to open it on is two time zones away and trying to open it in the only running instance of peptideshaker   i have also tried doing this all in our lab  copying the exported file from one system in our lab to another and i get the same error   is there a different method i should use if i start a peptideshaker project on one pc and want to open it on another   this particular project took  36 hours to open the searchgui results  on a system with 12 cores and 60gb of ram  so i'm a bit scared to close peptideshaker on it until i know i have a project that can be opened on another system 
sorry about not specifying the version  just updated the post the random   at the end is a mistake after using markdown   also removed 
done     you can read the result on attached image    mwsnap016 2015 07 25 09_33_19  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 13494003 8888504 53db985a 32b0 11e5 8c20 cf2c9a5a2e07 jpg 
it's part of commercial product  but i can send you a minimal test case if you wish
i tried it again   it doesn't work  both when the app is in the background and in the foreground 
a couple places in the mapping stuff  don't worry not a result of merge or anything
i am using version 0 5 2  the view in xml looks like this 
well according to docker my local image name  is  the repository  however  yes  that is in essence what i'm suggesting 
yea
some more observations   platform nextobjectid   is being generated as async  even though its content is just     the asyncmethodfinder it adding it because it claims it makes a call to string  init  char     which it also considers to be async    perhaps i don't understand exactly how the async generation is supposed to work  it seems as though nearly everything is generated async even if the method clearly is sync  e g  only returns a value    is this how it is supposed to work 
example    this model is the one asking to the user to write a message and display it in the console   the experiment works     normally  we expect the co model to do as the experiment in the micro model  which means that the user interaction contained in the micro model  once the panel appears  will stop the experiment until the value of the user_command is set  however  it just continues to do the step  and doesn't even allow to set the value  as it is updates every cycle  i know that the ask within the reflex in the co model forces the step to pass  but so does the step by step button  but in this case  when launching the experiment in the micro model  even pressing the button doesn't pass to the next step   that's why i was hoping to "stop" all the simulations once a user_panel appears  just like for the micro model 
one of these failing tests is like below     thanks 
i can't run our server without sponge  as it's a live  production  server which people play regularly   also  it is difficult to reproduce the bug on purpose  although the bug was happening multiple times per day  10 on the day i entered this bug    we had to remove astral sorcery to stabilize the server   i'd like to report an issue to  spongeforge's github  https   github com spongepowered spongeforge issues    but was wondering if you guys could give me some insight on what exactly to report 
i just wrote a test like this
yes  only scrobbles from spotify aren't going to my profile  the scrobbles i make from android music player are ok  this is the error message that appear everytime i open spotify  translating from portuguese   "sorry  the application simple last fm scrobbler  process com adam aslfms  stopped unexpectedly  try again"
i tested that with your code  it still removes the item

after reading comments on my other issues i agree with you on your suggestion above  i have amended the original issue and updated the status for android and ios accordingly 
http and webhook for what i can see  webhook is not supported in this release in any case

it was full screen  i have viewed the jad indicator working on the same screen setting on a friend's computer  and this was my reason for getting it myself  the plugin is turned on  so i don t know what's up  the only difference between me and my friend's situation is he has windows and i have mac 
sorry for my confusing description  p5 freeze  75  of time  after i try to run a sketch  the sketch is a complex one  this one i give you a link in the previous post  if you need the other sketches  say me   but this type of freezing is not at the begining of coding session but may be after three or four hours  i need to restart the computer to resolve this freezing  so if i understand your link quit the process is better than force to quit and less hard to restart the system   it's an intermediary solution    i hope is clearer 
i said   timedmessage list  that's the actual command  and i don't see how fastcraft would be causing an issue here since it's related to chatcomponenttranslation  and it crashes the client

how could i get a full stacktrace where the excception occurs 
i haven't been able to  the message "processing " does appear  but around number 540  it simply hangs and stops checking  i've checked the file it hangs on  and the does not seem to have any issues  not corrupt  not 0b etc     the folders are located on a samba share  perhaps that could be the issue  i'll try to check with a local folder some time later today 
sorry for that  i've updated the code accordingly  as i was doing it  i noted that the trace issue has to do with the  ishdragenabled  and  isvdragenabled  restrictioning  because when i write  int dx   x  int dy   y   instead no traces are caused  but i don't know the reason 
i'm on vacation end of week and next   i'll dig into it and see if can isolate the issue   i've also posted it on the packs issue tracker

upon logging into that windows 10 machine directly  i was immediately able to reproduce the issue without remmina being involved   the issue only happens with one of the tabs i have open  as though it was somehow corrupted at the time of tab initialization in manner that persist this behavior for the life of that particular tab   right now  as i create new tabs  they are not exhibiting this behavior  but i have not yet closed that tab shown in the video  and that tab still exhibits the same behavior as shown in the video  even now    logged directly into the workstation with physical mouse  keyboard and monitor    perhaps this is just a rare weirdness  but i thought i'd report it anyway in case you might be able to conceive a cause of this strange behavior

i apologize for the delay  i just got around to re adding  gitignore i did an install of 2 3 2  and the issue persists  i was unable to retrieve a crash log after a force quit 
 shakuzen i'm not entirely clear what the case was before 3 9 but the best reference i could find is that they changed the code off of this pull request and comment explicitly describes a change from nanos to millis being reported https   github com hazelcast hazelcast pull 10930#issuecomment 315681738  they haven't documented it as a breaking change as far as i can tell even though imo it looks like it should merit it 
i want to see database sharepreference data and so on but i just see viewtrees 
due to how the issue appears  it is rather hard to replicate at this point  compared to when it afflicted me on 1 7 10   i wonder  if by any chance if multicraft could somehow cause this though  as i am currently generating the same seed on my own pc  and plan to send it over to a multicraft based server once its finished 
i checked 2 0 9 release as well  and it has the same problem 
not exactly  one of our extension which is available on marketplace  code4z  https   marketplace visualstudio com items itemname broadcommfd code4z extension pack  contains an application called zowe which pulls a file from mainframe and save it under temporary folder which is one level above   projects   this is how we test it if you would like to have a demo about this than we may have a call 
this behavior doesn't exist  nothing is  raise d in the ruby code  i don't see it in python or c# code either   i see the java sdk has error code handling and surfaces it to the coder  perhaps other implementations should follow suit 
the 1 0 2 version have fixed the issue   thanks

maybe i was overthinking it  your idea should work in this case  i was thinking that showing https stuff on http pages as not possible without warnings but it's only the other way around  and in this case  youtube serves the same content over both http and https  so we're not breaking any security practices

i came accross this  while working with the grammar in issue #5 there asking to debug would first give the error message and clicking debug again simply presents the window where you choose text and starting rule and hitting ok then says  preparing    timeout   the timeout of course happens because no classes were generated   i belive the same would happen if you succeed to generate classes with debug  delete them manually and debug again   on the bright side  as long as i really keep modifying the grammar it tries to recompile everytime  it seems

thanks for having a look  so the seed has nothing to do here  and yes i change it for every training   when i said "between run" i meant between epochs   a play until reset   state  and even with the changed configuration the actions taken by the net are very similar from one epoch to another  it could make sense after many epochs  but it doesn't in the beginning as we can expect a3c to randomly discover patterns  except here for example the first few actions have never been changed  even after 10k+ iterations   so the first few epoch action sequences taken are  10100110111110011 1010011011111001101 1010011011111001     and after 11k iterations  1010011011101000100010100110111010011   0110111010011010 1010011011101000100010100100111010011   000111010011010 1010011010101001100010100110101010011   110101010011000  notice how the first   9 actions  '101001101'  have not changed a single time during all training    gut feeling tells me there's something wrong  either in the gym  the initial state is always the same so no need to change the initial pattern  or in the action discovery   otherwise with the tuning changes you suggested the nn now learns correctly    img width "1216" alt "screen shot 2017 11 17 at 11 18 13 am" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 11771531 32932092 0e17004c cb89 11e7 90ab 50def942e94a png"

in a simple answer  because it's not consistent with the rest of the library  i can't think of any other  glide   load       that will crash the whole app  just because an image is not available it shouldn't crash  that's why we have   error    and  onexception   i think the strongest argument is that  null  doesn't crash it  which is a worse value for a resource id than 0   this is actually not a theoretical issue  i ran into it yesterday  i have the images for categories as  res raw   svg   the items in my db can have a category associated to them by a column which refers to the above mentioned svg files by name  the name is then resolved by calling     now  the everyday usage is covered because if the  imageid  is a valid  r raw     it works  but there may be some cases when the resolution may not work and then if you check the   getidentifier  javadoc  file    p  tools android sdk windows docs reference android content res resources html#getidentifier 28java lang string  java lang string  java lang string 29  it says    the current hack is that i check for 0 and replace it with  null   because i know that works as i want it  displays   error      adding little workarounds like this starting to lead to cyclomatic hell around the image loading as  i  for example also have to check for  null  images because it is not handled as should be  #268

i just got the latest code from your master branch   i checked  and it does have the changes for the commit you mention   but it still exhibits the same behavior   seems like one way to fix it would be to have a try catch around the call to client   clientpools borrowclient   in skiptonexthost    then after catching the exception it could try the next host in the list 
 serge rider perfect job  i've already seen the new source code and i'll check it as soon as i back to office next monday

 gavinking sorry for the late response  i missed the email alert    you're correct about this not being a problem in java 8   i only stumbled on this by accident after changing my default jdk in one eclipse jdt project and having it magically apply to all projects

when you re open newpipe  effectively the reproducer is something like   1  start playing an hour long video on popout  2  switch to another app  3  do other actions  lock your phone  etc  4  go back to newpipe  and the popout dies    maybe newpipe should try to re fetch a new stream link and restart playing from the stopped time  instead of dying  i could look into implementing it myself but i'm not really a java developer by trade

the ios app also doesn't do this yet  but its on the list  do you have a strategy  alexshepard   i don't think we need to worry too much here about keeping things up to date or locally generated obs  the main issue is when obs or updates to local obs are coming from the server  does focusing on update s from the server make this any easier

hi  i used your example with no modifications  then modified it with the files i have and the above mentioned modifications i did made no difference to how the app reacted  it works when i first use it even with no modifications to your example code  but when i leave the screen to another screen in the app and come back and try to use it i get the error i wrote out  what i don't understand is how can it work if i have a  lite with 2 possible answers and the example has in one class a definition of numresults   6 and in another numresults   5  yet it still provides me a correct answer when using the app    i could remake the  lite for the project but you could remake it really easy too  i can't unfortunately send you the original as it's proprietary and from a client i'm making this for  but it's a  lite with 2 possible answers as is the accompanying txt file which has the names of the options written out  as i said the example works great  i get a result meaning the file i'm using works and has worked on an android version perfectly  however  here i keep getting this error after using it going to another screen in the app and then coming back    contact me if you need help with making a  lite file  i'll be happy to help you solve this

i'm not sure if you wanted additional info sent as an email or added to this issue  but i'll assume the latter    i've done some additional testing in order to find out what exactly was causing the issue  the resizing issue might be related to some other part of the specific language file  as i encountered it again when i rebuilt the file from scratch  but not in a test file i've been using  maybe the unusual orthography  regardless   i think there may be a fundamental problem with saving files  unless there is simply a major problem with my particular installation   the last entry added to the parts of speech menu before saving and closing always loses all data except the name  the notes  gloss  etc  are all lost  as well as the definition mandatory setting  however  this only happens when i save and close from the parts of speech menu  if i go to another menu and save from there  when i restart the programme and load the file  everything is preserved    while testing this  though  i ran into a much larger problem with saving  i went to the lang properties menu to save for the test  where i first checked "ignore case" to see if it was related  i immediately saved and closed the programme  and only coincidentally noticed when i came back to that menu that ignore case was unchecked  out of curiosity  i checked it again as well as filled in the first three fields with some random data  save  restart and reload  and all of that data was gone  while further testing this save issue  i realised that if i switched to another menu  any at all  and then saved  it would not lose the data    i'm seeing more problems now with the parts of speech menu  as related to the same type population error from above  all of this being in my test file  which only has a few plain characters in the phonology  so i no longer thing orthography is related   i'm going to test them a little more and add another comment  for readability's sake

the login with thunderbird and the aquamail android app works flawlessly  for thunderbird the setting is ssl tls+normal password  for aquamail it's ssl+prefer compatibility   i tried the maildroid android app without success  too   i'm using the latest k 9 app that is available on the google app store  the server only supports ssl so i've always set security in k9 to ssl tls and authentication to "normal password" since that is the setting that also works in thunderbird  "encrytped password" does not work either   but that did not surprise since it also does not work in thunderbird

 brianhks   are you planning to release v1 3 anytime soon   this particular issue is still bugging us  we've reduced the impact somewhat by increasing the limit to 10 mio datapoints  but nevertheless there's always guys querying more datapoints  so disabling the limit completely is not an option for us because this would lead to huge pressure in our c  cluster

this question looks more trick  i made some investigation  add jackson module kotlin is not enough  by default java and kotlin in runtime does not know about field name   you should pass   javac  parameters   for compiler  spring boot 2 in spring boot starter parent set up it by default   here is    no creators  like default construct  exist   cannot deserialize from object value  no delegate  or property based creator    but if i uncoment  objectmapper registermodule parameternamesmodule     that parse perfect   so quarkus by default register this module 
stock rooted galaxy s3 4 1 2 gt i9300 baseband i9300xxemc2   logcat is gonna be a problem    i left it on for the 15s that i needed to reproduce the issue  it's 1 8mb  i need to figure out what's spamming my logs  and maybe get you some relevant information  won't likely be able to do that before i get back  i'll keep looking and update  in the meantime  i wonder if anyone else can logcat this

duplicating these steps on a server on my home network resulted in no error and the successful creation of a workspace   i didn't anticipate ports being blocked over the course of a couple of hours and the only thing that i had seen that had changed was the software version   my apologies and thank you for your time   a follow up question  when you refer to "the ephemeral port range"  are you referring to the port range 32768 to 61000  typical linux kernel range  
ah  ok  i'll upgrade and check  hope it doesn't clobber my files  but if so  oh well  😢
you were right  sorry for bothering 
i use latest version 0 14 1 but before some time ago i had another old release and had same problem
the issue is not that we have to guess what type of sequence we have  that is unavoidable  the problem is that _the type guessed by getsequence   is not neccessarily the type of the hsp returned_  ideally the logic would go something like "if  t extends dnasequence    string looks like dna   new dnasequence string   else if  t extends rnasequence     " however  due to type erasure there is no way to get any information about t at runtime   all the work arounds i can think of would require to changing the api

i don't think it's the problem with ram  i think it is has something to do with running codenvy and che on the same docker daemon  when only che or codenvy at any given time i no longer have this issue  can someone use both che and codenvy on same docker daemon with ws running in each to see if they can reproduce  is there a clean up routing the che codenvy runs on containers with certain names  when there is a ws that it does not know about it auto destroys it  there could also be an issue with multiple che or codenvy servers running on same daemon as well   example docker container name   workspace20dk10jiriqw9qu5_machinesgckw3zwlvoo0rh7_admin_dev machine  and docker image name  eclipse che workspace20dk10jiriqw9qu5_machinesgckw3zwlvoo0rh7_admin_dev machine

i can reproduce it like this  1   create db test  root    2  insert nodes   for  i in 1 to 1000000 return insert node  test   into  root  3  replace values   for  i in  root   return replace value of node  i with "test2"      cancel during execution 4  no more queries can be executed  sometimes it works  i guess it depends on the point of time of the cancellation  it seems that the query is still running cause executing of other database commands isnt possible too

it still doesn't create directories inside my repository nor downloads any artifacts  creating  gem bin manually and copying the cucumber script yielded limited success  after another maven run  further subdirectories of  gem had been created  but no gems had been downloaded

i can confirm  that this error doesn't pop up on my quickly reactivated openhabian running rc1  following up openhab openhab core#903  the error on the docker instance might be related to directories outside of  openhabian and req only a slight modification of the dockerfile 
it was recent changes that caused the bug filed here

i have tested several versions down to 1 6 2  as i said it is also the same on another machine running windows and most probably different version of java  i really want to use the map and not items   i actually posted the full source  only missing the "system out println data  "
 krzyk there are intermittent results   failure success   within unit tests that have something to do with creating files in the  temp  dir in my computer     the same error messages may appear on    apache maven 3 2 1    apache maven 3 2 5  and  apache maven 3 3 3   i also experience a similar problem at  https   github com yegor256 takes issues 506

okay  upon testing it on a server with no other plugins  the error still persists  here is the item i am using  http   pastebin com bdvhnf4d it appears to make the item disappear client side  however not server side when using consume  all i did was  rpgitem testyoyo give and right clicked with it  you can then just press q to drop it even when it's not in your inventory  the error is inconsistent and will occasionally have consume work properly  this also happens when crafting items 
how do you add it to the class path  i'm using eclipse  the file name is correct and it is located in the jar file i'm using  i also moved a copy to the source folder  but its still not working

most recent te tf cofh afaik    pic of my mods folder    mcmods  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6551387 5592914 ae7a4ab8 91a7 11e4 9dda 4a5bcf1c6869 png   thinking more on this issue  didnt notice happening til after i had added quarry+  remain in motion   project red  i know rim is buggy and has caused ctd a few times    in the pictures shown earlier  the far caches by beacon beam have ic2 uranium ore  and the closer resonant caches  under chatbox  have ingots  red alloy  vanilla mc  and te types    beats me wtf is the root cause     at least its just a visual derp and not interfering with critical functions     edit  btw  version checker is frikin sweet    
previously  it reported as following  warning  stripping enabled  but '  copt  g'  or   per_file_copt      g  specified  debug information will be generated and then stripped away  this is probably not what you want  use ' c dbg' for debug mode  or use '  strip never' to disable stripping   then i tried both "bazel build  c dbg source all" and "bazel build   strip never   copt " g" source all"  but it didn't work either 
since the issue report system does not support uploading  json  i change the file extension to  txt for upload  i can only import 9 records  13 rows  of this file  it stopped import at the one with chinese characters in parameter values using google refine v2 5   20160423_210000_shop txt  https   github com openrefine openrefine files 229279 20160423_210000_shop txt 
yes     that's right    like this   authenticator authenticator   new authenticator        builder proxypassword cloudantproxypassword  proxyurl new url cloudantproxyurl   proxyuser cloudantproxyusername   client   builder build   
i did some more testing  here are my results    it's independant of the shaderpack that i'm using  i tested it with seus and have the same issue   it also seems to be independant from the instruments or hud  disabling any of them or both does not help   it occurs in first  and third person mode
hi harald    thanks for your suggestion   it did work and have my data imported into peptideshaker       kind regards   stephanie
yep it still happens after i updated i sent you logs   
updated post with extra info  also this happened under 10 minutes of being logged in at an area with nobody talking for majority of time 
thanks felix  i am using postgres 12 with postgis 3  actually i was following the "hands on tutorial v 4 0  2018  but i will review all these first steps following the official docs you show me  i remember to got an error when running create_db bat  but since the schema was created i thought it was ok  and indeed  i have just citydb  many of my problems will be noob mistakes and not exactly issues on the software  which place you recommend me to ask discuss about installing and running 3d citydb 
im sorry but i dont understand what your asking
 saudet i use ffmpeg instead of ffmpegframegrabber to loading the same swf file（in java program）  and it works  and other video file doesn't have the problem 
it may be the problem of some vendor issue  i also can not reproduce in other devices which version also is 4 4 4
i just updated  it also happens routes with "normal" ids like "itstocep"  but to answer your question  we have many routes that are very similar  but the start or endpoint are different  for all the best approach  in terms of readability  was to include the url in id  the number of routes  with generated name  is known on runtime  by configuration  so we need a way to identify the routes and keep the "readable"   numbering would be not sufficient 
how do we find this out 
it's a very long latest log  you need to view it raw      the server log only shows a normal login followed by a disconnect  but i'll upload it when i get on my pc 
hi jonathan   with these two files you should be able to reproduce the problem  take a look at the last chunk of code in the rmd file   thanks   michael

i think this is what you want    http   pastebin com xrnya22h the problem is that the server doesn't crash itself  neither my client crashes  but the it shows an "internal server error" and kicks me out of the server    let me know if you need anything else
hi  pesse  i get the same error when removing the    not sure if this will make a difference  but the target server i am trying to connect to is defined as  subdomain domain com test test_pwd sub server1 com 1521 service1  thanks  coenraad
i'd already updated to feed the beast 8 1 1  and with it  updated tt to #963  so i'll watch for any new errors 
 banbury i think it's because the game is arbitrarily adding 5px to the height of the window in a lot of its calculations  i cannot confirm this because my swing knowledge is still lacking   happens in every game i try with multiple panels but only when using look and feel settings other than metal  default  and nimbus from my debian system

yep  same issue here  can't pick any videos  was breaking my head over it  thanks for letting me know you've also spotted it and even better to know you're on it   if you have a buy me a coffee page we would be happy to send you some coffees your way    thanks for the great library 
er  it was the duplicate at least  i don't recall checking flips  dunno where that title came from

sorry those logs were collected from users and we are not able to get the images which cause the crash  and it seemed to be indroduced from fresco 1 0 0 
maybe   h2c  is not enabled by default  but if i add  h2c  to the  okhttpclient   every   http   call add  upgrade  to the http header  if the server support it  it will go with  h2c   if the server does not support it  it simply ignore it  and it will go with 'http 1 1'

hi  thanks for answering   nope  i wasn't using notifications 
i'm using latest version 0 9 7  the files are located on cachelocation dir   postprocess   function on fileprocessorthread is called 3 times for each file and generatefilename   function is generating a new name for each one  i think you need to fix generatefilename   function
i was thinking the same thing  i can get a list tomorrow  but i have a feeling the only one that might be causing issues would be 'pull request notifier for bitbucket'  i will try disabling it and see if i can get the triggers working   i am mainly using that plugin until i get the pr triggers working and i can filter pr triggers on to from branches   p  thanks for all the help 
 sapphiretactician no  just keep it here  i want to make this a priority so that games will be playable on worse connections

this is the first time i'm using archi   this plugin  sorry  have no previous experiences 
they are all there when you open the schematic but when you print  it prints everything around them but not the conduits themselves  if i turn off the schematic then all that's left are spaces  so it's replaced by space  same thing for ae2 cables  should they be rendering 
it was the webdav plugin syncing to box com  i'll try deleting this repo and reconnecting 
you can use tests regression java rewrite engine list test1  it's commented out but uncomment it and you'll have an example  although it doesn't print the stack trace unless you turn back on smt solving

 lineflyer it looks indeed very similar to the issues you referenced  bit this time with at least a chance to reproduce 
i agree  it is probably related to the commit  are you able to reproduce  no i don't use the forcelegacy flag 
i'll have to give it a test in a clean environment later tonight  my production environment is quite heavy 
thank you for your attention  jknack  yes  jooby lacks the support of some media type but it could be implemented and easily solved  so here is the response and request headers for both safari and chrome browsers within a   video   tag   ###   safari        so   setting the correct mime type is of course very needed here but i have already tested it to see if it was the reason that made safari sad but   no luck   that was not the issue   the complete list of mime types  https   www sitepoint com web foundations mime types complete list    video and audio files that been used is from w3schools some stranded media files   http   www w3schools com html mov_bbb mp4  http   www w3schools com html mov_bbb mp4   http   www w3schools com html horse mp3  http   www w3schools com html horse mp3 
hi  the right place is in the entry editor  i saw that there is already a paste handler for the the url field in the fieldseditors class    i think it should be sufficient to create a copy of the  removenewlinesformatter which only removes newlines before the first opening brace and the last closing brace and then add this as paste handler to the code area
which snapshot can i use from maven to test this   once you let me know i'll run our integration tests again to see if everything is working as expected with your proposed fix
yes and no how     yes  that's what would be nice to do    how   we expect that the value which is received from the server is written into the  statenode   and that's kind of the reason why do we have the  statetree   statenode s at all   statetree   statenode  is exactly the storage which we use to put the values received from the server  synced with the server   but this scenario breaks that suggestion   so the question is how where we should store server received values  create one more storage which will serve to this purpose   looks like as an overhead   technically my suggestion with the meta implementation  see above  is a variant of this  we put a value into  mapproperty  when request is received from the server side and ignore everything that comes from the client until this value is not applied to the client element  so it's kind of the same approach implemented on the top of existing design

i wasn't clear enough   1  my phone is being displayed first in group a  which is the group that went through the migration and had the trouble initially reported  so this observation might not hold after the fixes you applied   2  after upgrading to 4 10 3  i received a message in group b that got threaded in group a  the most recently used mms group   the only common member is me  that seems like a bug 

we already have the ability in the user interface to force the use of one interface so i don't think we need to worry about that  it would be cool if we supported multiple by default as long as they can restrict it to just one  which they can  our competitors use all interfaces i think  i tested and confirmed serviio 
hey  ilayaperumalg let me clarify a little bit    when viewing the job executions via the ui or via the shell it shows a  step executions count   so when i create a composed task and launch it  for example    the  step executions count  for both job executions will be 4  hope that clarifies it a bit 
at least very similar  i will take another trace when the error occurs

here are my gradle dependencies snippets for applicable libraries     i think there is an incompatibility with how mockmvc handles forwarded requests  i see it's not really suported  but  it generally works from the restdocs perspective when i pass querystring params in the url  and when i pass the form content as body  if i try using  post      params       then i can only make assertions on the  mockmvcresultmatchers forwarded   related parts 
perhaps it was an issue specific to my particular configuration  but when i tried to add abs as a library project  to an existing app  i needed to change all of my styles to not declare ids  but to reference ids defined in ids xml   this is likely an issue related to my particular app  and me simply having an issue that didn't come to light until using abs exposed it  so this is a non issue  i expect

yeah  all of the land is already claimed and assigned to existing towns  when a player steps into the chunks that are already claimed   assigned it generates this error  it does not appear to do that for plots that were claimed using  town claim    in the scenarios where this is occurring it was on previously wilderness claimed plots specifically in the three instances i noticed   two being the default 'admin town' for protecting  then a town that was for a player had some manually claimed by an admin and it was doing it there as well    the only plugin i am aware of on the server that could modify max health would probably be this one  https   www spigotmc org resources worldguard extra flags 4823   i'm not 100  confident on that though  i can send you a list of plugins if that'd be helpful too

hi  davidecaroselli   thanks for the quick reply  i pulled the latest version and the translation seems to work fine  but there is still an issue with the output   original trans units

sorry yes i should have attached screenshots  but the pic you've attached after your fix is identical to what i get if i manually patch the file in  node_modules  to play the old way  with transforms   i'm curious  did you reapply transforms or get the scaling on  imageview  working  that was quick

my driver is set to postgresql 9 4 1211 jre7 jar  default   do i need another one  how can i change it  in postgres you can use any marker for function definition     is used in examples  but you can use any other string   the problem is when you open function definition from dbeaver  f4    source  the marker is  function   from pgadmin it is  body   so if you try to execute this sql you receive an error  also this error is given in some other correct scripts  this one is just an obvious example

i forgot to mention that we use telegraf to pull the http json metrics and write it to cloudwatch   in our case telegraf not able to convert the measurements   which is the bug confirmed by telegraf  so here is what recommened by telegraf team as a quick workaround  so looking for some guidance on what needs to be implemented on server to adjust the values to 0  before they enter in telegraf   recommendations from telegraf  "update the server that your httpjson input uses as its source to adjust the values before they enter telegraf  we will try to get a fix done for this before the next release"    inputs httpjson   servers     "http   localhost 2960 metrics"  
i started down that road yesterday but backed off when i saw the list of existing chars came from the whatwg spec  i shall resurrect the change and see if there are any problems  i think it will result in the unknownhostexception   not following redirect behavior mentioned above  which constitutes a behavior change but not one that i can  currently  see causing too many problems 
 samtstern i call it first thing in oncreate  in my application class   also  before i try to use any firebaseanalytics call  i check that the firebaseapp  the " default " one  exists  but even if i tried to initialize it in some other place  for example when i get a response from my server   even by losing some events  should it be a problem 
yes  i agree with you  misaochan  that check was already present  it was just not checking for whitespaces    before the fix     empty title  eg  ""   title with whitespace eg  " "                                      toast message indicating that empty title is not allowed crash    after the fix      empty title  eg  ""   title with whitespace eg  " "                                      toast message indicating that empty title is not allowed toast message indicating that empty title is not allowed

k9 mail  which is weird  because i remember reporting by mail in former versions and everything working fine
add    cpu x64_windows_msvc   host_cpu x64_windows_msvc  when building bazel  you'll then get an error like this   error  missing input file ' local_jdk   bin jar'    it can be fixed by applying the following change  then build a bazel with this change  use that bazel to run  bazel build src bazel   cpu x64_windows_msvc   host_cpu x64_windows_msvc  again 
oops  i added them now  i think it probably depends on screen size 
yes i did try #5  it did not work out  that is the complete stack trace  i'm trying to figure out how it works so did not try for dse  however  i tried with dse drivers to connect but it did not work out 
unfortunately no  i cannot   after spending some time with  org jaxen test arithmetictest  and digging the docs  jls  java api doc for  double#compareto double   and ieee 754   there are only two cases to consider  1   0     0   or   0    0  respectively  2   nan    x  where  x  is any number   nan  is handled correctly by  org jaxen expr defaultrelationalexpr   what's left is the comparison of zero and negative zero  but this is also determined correctly since the relation says  greater than or equal  and this is the only difference between  double#compareto double    treats 0 greater than  0  and java comparison for the primitive type double  treats 0 equal to  0    long story short  it seems that my suspicion was purely based on the 'partially consistent' implementation   defaultgreaterthanequalexpr  is the only class that uses  double#compareto double   all others fall back to java comparison for double primitive values    hence  you might close this issue as there none  of course  in case you want to re align the implementation of  defaultgreaterthanequalexpr  to have a fully consistent implementation for comparing numbers   just in case anyone else stumbles across this   i won't object   thanks  h
just to clarify  is this really fixed  how was it fixed  did you remove api 17 compatibility or implement reflection  sorry  but it's not clear from the pr info

+1 for the clean interface   no  i don't think there are plans for to have redirects in json dumps  in these dumps redirects seem to be resolved in statements serializations so there are no need to have them if you just work on one dump

sorry  not sure what the ddb range or hash key means here  still learning all the basics   i will try a simpler test case to try to provide expected results vs  actual results  create a simple table with just a few records  should make it easy to test

it is indeed nice that merges will go and fill up disk space for us  provoking nasty disk full bugs that otherwise wouldn't be found  but it would be best if our tests could properly simulate random disk full situations  using the mock filesystems from lucene   maybe  we shouldn't fix this until we have better disk full testing in place 
we use javassist 3 21 0 ga jar  there are no other versions on the class path

this failure consistently occurs

 barbeau i haven't been able to reproduce the error in any emulator
i configured those ip according to the ovh docs  https   docs ovh com es dedicated network ipaliasing  and the error logs are in the spigot servers https   imgur com a 31hud
graphhopper should not produce corrupt shortcuts anymore  as #980 should fix this  but in case of a new bug it would load such broken files without reporting a problem or stopping  to reproduce this  the following should work  create a graph with multiple ch profiles in parallel via an old version and provide too few ram and then some ch preparations will stop with outofmemory errors or similar and then load these files with a recent version 
unfortunately the smartphone is not mine and i can't install the newly updated version on it again  it's android 4 4 2  galaxy s iii   what i can see is that the smartphone doesn't riconnect to the band when it's in proximity with it  and in notification centre the band is displayed as always connected  despite it's actually not  
all servers are specified in connection uri  once no active error is encountered from passive  it is treated as handshake error and connection establisher doesn't try next in the list 
thanks for the reply   i wasn't aware of that 1 256 in concat  and it makes sense that it was removed    but something's still not right on my end   the part where i was saying that transform is expecting non normalized data is in historyprocessor transform indarray raw    this was working prior to normalization   if i do an  imwrite  of cvmat at this point with normalized data  i get a black image  if i don't normalize the observed pixels  it get the full color image i'd expect   from what i've read online  opencv's cv_32f is expecting 0 0 1 0  so i would have expected the opposite results but that appears not to be the case because "record" is now denormalizing the data before writing it to the mpeg   why shouldn't transform also be denormalizing the data when converting to cv_8uc like in record 
sorry  let me rephrase that  that line  which i referenced  is not able to find the  spring jmx default domain  mydomain  property in my bootstrap yml   just did a quick re check  and it's not really a snakeyaml issue  it's that in the  environment getproperty "spring jmx default domain "    the name has an extra dot at the end   the property is found if i use  environment getproperty "spring jmx default domain"  
awesome   i'll wait until tomorrow and test the snapshot   thanks again 
thankyou

i think it is a https problem   when i use the commit 'f4c83e8'  it works  but it does not have the class 'call'   i have send you the sample class 
generally i use kubuntu 17 10 but just try it out with windows  it works with win 7 
thank you for your answer  i tried to play on adt 1  and indeed it's not supported 
yes  the problem occurs every single time  one more observation  i had added a calender widget before and every time i start openlauncher now  it starts with the calendar widget selected and the resizing arrows active  even if i delete the widget and the select "all apps" leading to the crash  the calendar widget will still appear the same way when i restart openlauncher  weird  isn't it

 cypher121   yeah  i'm aware of that    sadly  i was hoping you would have a clue because it was working on the last version flawlessly  to your questions  it crashes by   any   block and item this includes creative and recipe less items  too  any block or item behavior is normal  this error is seemingly restricted on nei and the recipe function   i do not use optifine or a specific texture  resource pack   just some parts of texture replacements for jabba  buildcraft  gravel  lava and a few others  but no texture pack in for your mod and nothing larger than 64x64   access_denied
i'm using 148 mods  i think the problem is within ee3 specifically since everything in the chain has emc and the recipes in question are standard shaped crafting  so the problem is likely within ee3s dynemc system  perhaps something to do with an item belonging to multiple oredics 
yes  i read on the description about the entity desync issue  but it happened with player entities  i'm going to do this test in few hours because i just restarted the server  i wasn't expecting a fast reply  p

hi  sorry for late answer  there is no lsb release files in  etc  on the machine   rw r  r    1 root root  38 aug 30  2017  etc centos release  rw r  r    1 root root  51 aug 30  2017  etc centos release upstream  rw r  r    1 root root 393 aug 30  2017  etc os release lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  14 jan 25  2018  etc redhat release    centos release lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  14 jan 25  2018  etc system release    centos release  rw r  r    1 root root  23 aug 30  2017  etc system release cpe  centos linux release 7 4 1708  core  derived from red hat enterprise linux 7 4  source   as for "care to take a crack at a pr to fix this "   i was also thinking of rearranging possible sources of os version  but i doubt i can test my patch enough to make sure it not only fix my problem but also does not break something else on some other linux  and this stops me  another alternative i see is to get all choises from all possible sources  now it stops after first success   and then select the best one  say  the longest one  or some by other algorithm of choice   or at least do not stop trying to get version from the next source if the one you get now is not good enough  e g  has no minor version 
release early  release often      i found a workaround   so it is not that critical  but feel free to push a release when you see fit containing the fix
i get it from web site  https   mrmad com tw tsschecke web save ios10 shsh
sorry  been busy  hopefully we will get to this today or tomorrow   thanks

i am sorry  i will elaborate a bit more  for context  i am currently building a framework for fuzzing libraries that evaluate xpath expressions   we found that jaxen behaved differently than the rest when evaluating   nonexistent  false      in the framework we pass a sample file  not important in this case  and the xpath   nonexistent  false    as args to the java program below  this then evaluates the xpath expression and return  false  in the aforementioned xpath expression  which is wrong   unfortunately  i currently do not have an example with a unit test 
yes
if you mean an in memory map  then that associated would disappear between overture runs  if the test sequence was held in the results xml  then as long as the results were preserved on file  the individual tests would be re runnable  or we could just use a separate serialised file  as you say  but when would you save it 
sorry i should have provided better detail  poor reporting on my part  the project is just 4 implementations of factorial with associated test  well it will be soon  currently there are just 4 tests to get things started    the project structure is

 kbagchigwc hard here means it didn't happen to all our real end user   i firstly found it in fabric  then we reproduced it during our test   this morning  i reproduced it in the voice quickstart android project   you can reproduce it by simple doing   make a call  hang up  make another call  hang up  and so on 
ok  that was actually hard to replicate that issue  i was able to reproduce it by having a hidden column followed by a combobox column  followed by a non editable column  the issue seems to be that the combobox column is in "disabledcolumns"  but i wasn't able to figure out why it is there   here's a patch to the demo replicating the issue

oh  i think i said it wrong  i don't mean the white space in the code  i mean the 1px high white space between the lines  in the screenshot you can see 1px high white lines which starts at line 9  have a closure look at the line numbers  there you will see the small distance between the lines best   this behavior was not like this in version 0 7 m5

the old custom one i used with 3 7 worked fine  i'm working on upgrading to 4 x to see if that resolves #2453  but i'm having problems with this and gif playback speed   here's a small standalone project that reproduces these glitches  https   github com moxie0 glitchycorners

i'm running latest stock android 6 0 1  april patch  on a n5x   i've never rooted it so i have never enabled run as root  my config syncs all user's folders excluding " android"   i am sure when i installed syncthing  3 or 4 app updates ago and on android 6 0 1  i was able to edit stignore  it is when i excluded " android" folder  
because the newest version of computronics depends on a newer buildcraft than the one bundled with the version of tppi2 that i'm running  and upgrading single mods willy nilly has bitten me in the past  i'll wait for the tppi2 team   as for why i wanted to compile it  there's a particular bug i'm trying to fix  but i wanted to figure out exactly what is happening  extra logging   before submitting a pull request  and  you know  making sure my patch compiles   i'll show you the crash report  though  http   www pastebin ca 3033473  it appears to happen when moving away from lamps  although only some of the time  it affects players with poor internet connections more than ones with fast connections  my current wild ass guess is a race condition between unloading the chunk and stopping tile updates  since the air block is id 0 
hey  gonzalonm  that was not an issue with the code  my antivirus was blocking java from accessing sqlite  thanks for your comment    
i did indeed use imgt reference  these are column 10 and 12 of the full exportclones output     for the rest  it seems to work fine   i didn't notice this until trying to parse it with tcr

i just found out you can bypass the problem by adding commandline to bazel   so apparently the default   where python  doesnt work

using the existing fork would be fine  a new branch with a unique name would allow multiple iterations which usually will happen if the app is actively developed  maybe you can simply number them 1  2  3 or add a date string  so they are easier to distinguish put in order 
sure  two of my set titles were   blood for the blood god     woot       just like that  and it would not save the set  every time i would check the folder or exit the game  i also had one with a   but that title changed so i don't remember what the full set title was

 laszlocsomor prepending  msys2_arg_conv_excl  to the binary call   msys2_arg_conv_excl " " node  e "console log process argv "  something   will disable the path conversion   but that puts the onus on bazel developers to be aware of an implementation detail  usage of msys on windows platforms  inside of bazel  i'm not sure how many are aware of this caveat   are there any cases where the path conversion is desirable  perhaps the flag could be set by bazel when invoking msys   off the top of my head    inside shell scripts proper one is always using win32   any path sent in by the user running bazel on a msys shell will reach bazel already converted
apart from the modifications in the core library's architecture  psurface  etc  nothing changed in pgraphicsandroid2d  and the new architecture should not affect how the renderer handles the canvas  but i may be missing something  so will be looking into it

 jimczi thanks  it works  however it is still a bug and i guess this is only a workaround  i wonder why this was not an issue on 6 2 version previously   thank you very much  it was a real headache   smiley 
there are no errors in the log anymore  all steps to reproduce are as follows     remove all saved data      local share dbeaverdata      install dbeaver   run dbeaver   when asked for a database  just close the window   click  file   properties   if i set up a db connection  it works  so what i'm suspecting this to be  is that the button should not be clickable  if no database is set up

yes it is a combined grammar that should generate a lexer    it has been relatively easy to create this target  dart e java have a close semantic and syntax  yes i'm simply manually translating from java  the idea is to make the translate version work and then cleanup dartfy the code  now i'm working on various grammar tests 
it would be a good idea to switch all of them eventually  at least for the ones that already have their own  toxcontent   unless we find a good reason to do otherwise  omitting sensitive data or something   but we can do one pr for each to split up the work  rather than having to do it all as a single chunk  thanks for finding the other places where we duplicate this logic   for the ones that don't already have a  toxcontent   it might be a good idea to add one and use it in clusterstate  just so that each class owns its own serialization logic  but i think that's a lower priority than the ones that have duplicated logic

i have just seen that there are also statistical code analysis tools available in the github marketplace  all of them are free for open source projects  most also add code coverage and security checks  i have no experience with any of these tools  but maybe it would be also interesting to add one of them     https   github com marketplace codacy   https   github com marketplace codebeat   https   github com marketplace better code hub   https   github com marketplace code climate  they run checks before a pr can be merged  similar to travis    sure  i can try this  but don't you think it would be enough to only run them before merging the pr

yes  both  it's using lucene 7 2 1 and handles the updating of the index fields  for every update index call i try to fetch the already indexed document from lucene and than add the new field to it  for that  i have to store  not only analyse and index  the fields into lucene  creation of the document field will be with  field contentfield   new textfield field  text    field store yes       the main issue is with  indexwriter updatedocument new term content_id  jsonid   document    because updatedocument will by first delete all documents containing the term and then adding the new one   see lucene javadoc on updatedocument   btw   i like nitrite very much   
hi  yes  of course  i do think it very strange     for a   empty   rstudio which just started with no projects  click create new projects——doooon  crash  no reactions  actually you can only "open" a project     when i already have a project working on  click new project  also crash     when it went wrong in running a loop or building packages  if you click the red point which will stop r running manually    dooooon  it crashes          always  i have to stop the session by windows task manager  because clicking the "x" of rstudio on the head right  can only get a waiting circle forever  and never close the program   also  if it crashes  you can not save the file editing  but it just stays there  you can click buttoms of rstudio  but nothing happens   quite strange

 serge rider well  it's starting just fine if i change the workspace  or the data_path   my issue is   how to migrate settings from my previous workspace  and also  even if i start on a fresh workspace or data_path  it seems to get corrupted anyway  i haven't tried since last time  it's really annoying to add manually the connections and see they all got lots with no way to retrieve them   how can i export import these settings so i can easily add a couple of connections  save them somewhere in case my workspace get corrupted again 
the problem i see on ubuntu 16 04 is that our  uic  executable actually ends up linking to the system icu libraries  rather than the ones shipped with qt     so i think that we might want to ensure that we are setting the  runpath  appropriately for these shared objects as well  to ensure that things work in the absence of an  ld_library_path  being set   also worth noting that  patchelf   set rpath  actually attempts to set the  runpath   not the  rpath   if you wanted to set the  rpath   you'd have to use  patchelf   set rpath   force rpath   totally intuitive  i know

okay  swankjesse sorry this came late  my case was this  i'm building this app that respond to shared url  so part of my test was to make sure that all url are return a success respnse of 200  i used okhttp to make sure that i got a succes response of 200  for some reason urls with empty fragment or with frahgments seems to return error even though they where valid 
exactly  and will do  just let me start minecraft from scratch so the log isn't quite as massive xd  this was on a server i set up  but i expect it'll also happen in single player  unless spongeforge is causing an issue somehow  if i can't get it to happen in singleplayer  i'll also give you the server log  obviously
 wangkhc indeed  it means classifying the existing index settings  and writing a test that ensures that every future setting is classified one way or the other 
isn't that the same i said     
very weird bugg  i updated aac to 3 3 4 and it seemed to be fixed

 benjaminp  thanks for the suggestion  that works  although i need    nostart_end_lib  too  i've added this line to tools bazel rc and it seems to work    build   linkopt  fuse ld bfd   nostart_end_lib   if i use a machine with gold 1 14 it seems to work  testing with gcc  not with bazel    do you think it's possible for bazel to detect this case  old gold  fully static  exceptions   and use bfd instead  seems unlikely

yes  in this case it definitely was that action which seemed to trigger this 
 sixdouglas i don't think this is caused by your changes  still  i'm not sure why this has happened  building on travis ci works fine  maybe there is something on my system

hi my problem is solved  it was my fault  in my android settings    accounts and sync     background data was unchecked  i unchecked it to avoid the crashes of 3 1 4  and autosync was unchecked too  when i activated those checkboxes  kontalk began to work again  i'll close this issue because i think what  svrnwnsch reports is a different problem   thanks 
it's default port 29418
much better  would the following code even work  seems like it would only check once   don't want to give the user the wrong idea 
correct  after opening via the widget
 blfrantz indeed  this is a specific issue in sql  if you used an sql query in canvas in your test and still see the issue  it's very likely that you are using a version of elasticsearch that doesn't have the fix  the version labels in this github issue as well as the versions mentioned in my latest comment should be ones that will have the fix 
 costin thanks for responding  this is an issue regarding the actual number of indexed documents in a fresh index in es  0 documents  created just before the indexing job begins  being different than the number of documents that were given to es  by spark  to create index  so spark gives es 929 660 json documents to index  however sometimes only 924 000  roughly  are indexed  i have seen the actual number of documents in es fluctuate between missing up to 5000 or missing as few as 3  on other instances it has had too many documents  up to almost double  still with a fresh index and the same number of documents input  there is no decipherable pattern and the same documents are used for every run  my last run  es reports 1 409 124 documents  but spark submitted only 929 660 for indexing  the index contained 0 documents to start  nothing else is writing to it  it contains 1 shard and 0 replicas  the number of shards and replicas does seem to matter  the trend is with a higher number of shards  a lower number of replicas and a lower number of total documents attempting to be indexed  we will see the exactly correct number of documents under those conditions  but that is very difficult for me to verify and extrapolate those results in any significant way  i have also tried using both the new native rdd format for spark in the beta release  as well as the old output format based format inside of spark in both the beta and the 2 0 1 releases   although i don't think it is related to #268  as a side question  how can i see those metrics when using spark  from the documentation  it looked as if the metrics used the hadoop counter infrastructure  which to my knowledge would be independent of the spark job  is it possible to see these when using the spark api   es version  1 3 0  9 data nodes  3 masters  1 load balancer  spark version  1 0 0  1 master  9 workers  java version  1 8 0_11  spark and es are running on the same nodes  spark on a subset or the es nodes   working on posting some logs   thanks again for your help and response

hi  kosarko what you just described is the behaviour for ufal theme  whereas using mirage  i don't get a javascript dialog  but instead i choose the file using file chooser and fill the name   both on the workflow page and then submit it by pressing "upload and add another" button  the first file uploads successfully and is shown in the list below  but when i upload the second file  the "upload" page refreshes but the list is not containing the newly uploaded  second  file data   the same happens if i continue an abandoned submission   the only way to see that file in the list is to choose the same wortkflow step by pressing "upload" button in top progress menu  or to press either "prev" or "next" and then return to the "upload" section   i tested it with fresh 5 3 build yesterday and in both mirage and ufal themes i get the same faulty behaviour  the  js files updated are ufal specific and don't seem to affect mirage at all 
reindexing  is  a workaround  but i meant that there is no workaround as previous steps to actually use the shrink api with some previous steps

yes  i have  but it is not connected  mongodb plugin creates a bean called mongo and that holds a connection to a mongo  which i overriden to be a connection to fongo  the problem i faced  i know better now  is gorm does not connect via this bean  there is another bean called  mongodatastore   i needed to override that too  my new problem now is fongo does not have the alternative of this on    as far as my research went  the solution is to also override the  mongodatastore  bean  i am working to create a plugin for grails that uses fongo as a data storage for really fast integration tests   fongo for integration tests  https   github com amexsofts fongo for integration test     basically  what i want to achieve is override every call to the mogo process to be to fongo  from what i see now  you have support for unit tests only 
no  the default configs in jed basically do nothing at all  if you want to reproduce this  enable the worldinfo override option in the jed main config  via the in game config menu for example   and then create a config file in  config justenoughdimensions dimensions json   like this  https   pastebin com izmtfawh where the  dim  id is whatever the advanced rocketry dimension uses  this should cause jed to try to find a spawn point for that dimension  when the dimension is loaded for the first time  it doesn't yet have its own  level dat  file   for testing debugging  i'd also recommend enabling the verbose logging option in jed  so you get log messages  at the info level  about when jed does certain things  like tries to find the spawn point 
yes  now it does have an empty constructor    but unfortunatelly  the same exception still occurs   i know about the debug feature  but i'm on the way to production state  so this is no option for me  as i've seen just right now  the exception also occurs  if don't change the data model but only the db version in manifest

thanks for looking into this  i will try to produce a sample project which reproduces the error  but it might take some days   maybe there could be a problem with the order postprocessafterinitialization method is called  if postprocessafterinitialization is called first with a datasource argument  and directly after that with a entitymanagerfactory argument  then properties variable is not yet set and this might lead to npe  just a thought  i might be totally wrong about the inner workings of spring

sorry about that  there's no error message or crash  the potion effects and abilities simply don't work  i've tried the following in the test world i uploaded  dont work     resistance  speed  water breathing  slowness  night vision  absorbtion  saturation  power stare  strength  glowing  levitation  fire resistance  haste  jump boost  wither  poison  regeneration  invisibility  bonemealer   does work    flight  magnetize  step assist   so basically  all potion based abilities have stopped working either on the player or on mobs  some of the ones on mobs are hard to test if they're working besides looking for potion effects  but the ones which should have an easily noticable effect don't seem to work  there's no potion indicator in the inventory  and the effect doesn't happen  speed doesn't speed me up  jump boost doesn't change my jump height  etc  and no potion particles   again  if i start a whole new world everything seems to work fine  but in the world i uploaded  almost nothing does  so it's something in the level dat that i uploaded perhaps something is registered wrong somehow  not sure how that happened unless some other mod did it  but if i don't know what's wrong i can't even try to fix it with an nbt editor  also not sure why the ids or whatever would have changed in an existing world  the test world isn't important  the problem is it happened in my main world too   ok  i think i found something that seems to have fixed it in my test world  though it's rather dangerous i think  i regenerated the world  then copies that level dat into my 'corrupted' world  and now everlasting abilities seems to work  not sure if that might screw up something else  but i might try that with my main world after backing up of course

sorry   zacblanco  i could not find a template  there is no pinned issue showing a template nor could i find an example under https   docs alluxio io os user stable en contributor contributor getting started html    alluxio version    2 0    describe the bug   in file  alluxio_home bin alluxio in line 83 the call ps  aww fails because busybox doesn't know the 'w' flag  busybox is used when the environment is alpine  docker image      additional context   i suggest using pgrep instead of parsing the output of ps like this   replace   for pid in   ps  aww  o pid command   grep  i " j ava"   grep   keyword    awk ' print  1 '   do   with   for pid in   pgrep  f " j ava   keyword"   do     portability of ps   1  if you're providing dockerhub with your own base image you do not have to be portable  the complete idea behind docker is to not rely on the availability of certain tools or certain versions of tools  when writing a dockerfile you are 100  in charge of the environment and it  the container  will run  almost  everywhere  you don't have to care about the difference between gnu  unix  busybox  mac  wintendo  etc   long story short  for your docker image it is irrelevant what is installed on some computer somehere in the world   2  you are right  there are still a lot of local installations and "on premise" installations  you want to use the "least common denominator" between all relevant platforms  but that would not be bash  it should be sh  and as you pointed out  the   w  flag is not part of the unix specification of  ps   and then you have gnu and gnu is not unix     but gnu is a more popular than unix  so why stick with the unix specification  and what about windows  there are a lot more windows installations  why not stick with microsoft's wsl then   you got the picture…  3  it is always a bad idea to parse cli tools which are intended to print out human readable stuff like  ls   use  stat  or  find  instead    ps   use  pgrep  and or  pkill  or pid files    free   etc   because these tools are formatting the output according to the values they print  e g  count the whitespaces in  ls  l  output for different directories     4  disclaimer  i'm  not  here to start a flame war  its your choice completely how to fix the  ps  aww  issue  i don't want to change the way you write code or anything  i don't want to offend you in any way  the points above are just remarks  nothing more  please feel free to not comment everything of my way too long text  i'm sure that your fix  whatever it is  will work just fine

what we see is the che server comes up successfully   we can create a workspace   the problem is the che server kills the workspace after a few minutes  this is due to agent not repsonding in time   if i jump into the workspace pod using oc rsh and perform a curl against the local agent endpoint  http   localhost 4401 i  receive a 404 back from tomcat  i may be wrong but we suspect the workspace is not given enough time to start up and would like to know how to configure the che server to allow the workspace time to come up    i came across these configs in the config map but as far i could tell from the entry point script they are not referenced and the entrypoint always initialize the server on the default vales   che wsagent ping success threshold  "600"   che workspace agent dev ping_conn_timeout_ms  "6000"   che workspace agent dev ping_delay_ms  "6000"   che workspace agent dev ping_success_threshold  "100"

no it doesn't  at least not at work nor at home  one thing i should mention and i believe this is closely related to the following post   https   github com nextcloud android issues 1653  url  one thing was an issue with the certificate  at some point in time  i couldn't even browse the content of my account within the app  eventhough i had files which were already "synchronized"  downloaded   the account i was using was recently created for the purpose of this trip and only a handful of files were present  so no issue with memory limitation in any way  however  all i was getting from this account was absence of every folders and documents  5 folders or so and about 10 files  including default nextcloud default pictures and documents   i should also mention i had automatic upload enabled and i did take a picture at some point  but i believe it was already late in the day and battery was already around 15  and dropping   on my day to day live  my phone will normally drop around 3 7  overnight when phone is left alone  i constantly use gpslogger and the lack of gps coverage shoulnd't really affect the performance  but moving around could have an effect as it accounts for gyro and acceleration interrupts   at the end  i still suspect this is something related to certificate request and managing local and remote files  as mentioned earlier  i am using "nextcloud sms" and i did find peculiar the number of failed events related to sms synchronization but then again i have it set to 15 minutes  so maybe it is just fine  it would just try to update when i start using my phone  accessing the lock screen    this is a lot of unknown and possible feature interaction that are causing such issues  tough one to evaluate and debug 
it does seem to be short articles that get skipped  now that you mention that   it also seems to happen when the current article is long enough that it goes off the length of the browser window   if i can see the article in the window  it doesn't seem to get skipped 
i would prefer the  img  url to be resolved correctly with the help of the framework 
yes its working now    thanks      on thu  oct 24  2013 at 5 39 pm  yegor bugayenko notifications github comwrote

the typical meaning of "export" is "to a file format without all features" following typical current ui practice  you could either rename to "save as" or have separate "save as" and "export" buttons   "export" is an optional notion in user interfaces  which is being slowly obsoleted by more sophisticated save dialogs  "save as" is fundamental functionality

in the demo application  i'm seeing that the seekbar goes to  4 30  270757ms  when i drop it  i hardcoded the seekbar to use that number   this is replicating a seek based on chapter metadata   but then it jumps back to  4 00  240047ms  when playback resumes   in my own app  i've verified the location where playback resumes by polling the current state of the player 
 snicoll i tried with the execution id specific for the "main" artifact  the one without the classifier   but that did not help   what did help however is changing the order to the following and now it works     i'll leave the qualification of this to be a bug or a feature up to you

i do not have console access  i am actually another plugin dev who the server owners contacted about this   it looks like the inventory clone isn't doing the trick  normal horses have a  horseinventory  object that has specific definitions for the saddle and armor slot  and these don't exist in the  inventory  object inherited from  livingentity   i know there is also a  llamainventory  that does the same thing  but all the other horse types  i haven't found a good way to access saddles  type casting the inventory won't do either   i haven't been super pleased with the 1 11 x apis from spigot for these reasons

hi  thanks for the feedback  i finally found out the problem  entries with a tag always appear at the top of the list in the 'float' mode  even if they do not fit the search  in the 'filter' mode they are not visible  which is more consistent  thus it is not a bug but rather an annoying feature  in my view  tagged entries not fulfilling the search may appear first atop the grayed items  however not at the very top 
that fixes the issue  thanks   one thing     since you are rethrowing the exception  there is no need to include the exception stack trace in your log message   i'm using spring's   retryable  annotation and i end up with three of your stack traces  followed by my own stack trace in the logs 
i'll check soon 
changed it and it still doesn't work    even opened it in the debugger and it the uuid is correct there  maybe an android issue as you suggested

must have happened when i extracted the interface via intellij  i removed the annotation from the interface which resulted in the passing test you described while keeping the async behavior in production  i tested the same for spying instead of mocking and the conclusion was the same  i could kick myself for that one  sorry for wasting your time and thank you for the quick response 
disable auto build does not sound like an option  we rather need special treatment and problem markers for these cases 
yeah i tried delete it thats how i got on last time  this time it kept say that almura was offline and could not download the mod pack  what ever they did fixed it again  if it happens again i make sure to get logs n screen shots up straight away

using the query to do the prepopulation will work very well   this resolves my issue  but a couple more thoughts on the original issue   concerning which methods i would recommend being abstract  it appears that all your methods are performing necessary functionality  although if a user were to be implementing their own queryview  i would imagine the points of customization would probably be in initialization  on refresh  adding an item  and removing an item  however with all the functionality the methods that perform these operations contain  i would only want to override them and make sure i called the super method in my implementation   maybe the real issue is that the lazyquerycontainer accepts any implementation of queryview  but it seems that your intent is to enforce the lazyqueryview  maybe it would just be easiest to remove the final modifier on lazyqueryview and tell users it's their own fault if they extend it and don't call the super methods

oh  is it not meant to land you at the other celestial gateway  i assumed it was to land you on top of the other one  i do apologize if this is working as intended  it just seemed very odd to me 
i had opened the hello world example and i wanted to open the gallery example in a second window  but that just happened once and i got the trace for reporting this issue 
i couldn't find the location at that time and it stopped after a server restart and so far it did not reoccur 
it says _unknown command  type " help" for help _ when i write  challenges 
thanks   graphql java 3 0 0  on jun 14  2017 7 18 am  "sergei egorov"  notifications github com  wrote 
tried to replicate on single player  but it doesn't happen there  seems to be an issue only on the server 
i tried to extract something i could post  but failed  then i removed the affected folder from my workspace and re added   and  presto  no problem any more

so basically the problem is with the grpc server that is setup with dagger  client initiating compression works fine   a very basic simple example would be a server  taken from the dagger article  https   dagger dev grpc servers html     but because  dagger grpc server proxyservercallhandler servercalladapter  is not delegating the  setcompression  call  compression never happens  solution is simple   delegate setcompression

you are correct  the coordinates rely to the primary display  as i changed the primary display to the screen with the biggest height  the y coordinates starting on this screen at 0  on the other screens at +120   thank you for your help  i will now write a offset detection in the application code to work around this  maybe this is a feature which should be done in the library directly because i think this will help others too   original settings  https   imgur com a atqifgn

i'm using git version 1 7 9 5 the problem is dirty itself works as a command on git  it doesn't reflect on the properties file using the plugin which is the weird part   what i forgot to mention is that i'm running this inside a docker container don't think it matters though  do you have any other ideas as to why it's happening   any other details i can give you

sadly i don't think i have a simple to reproduce test case for you  you can have a look at the implementation in the linked pr above  but you may not be able to make much sense of it   to reproduce simply  you'd need to rpc invoke a   function where    the function continues to emit on its  flux o   output after the  input  completes  or cancels  for that matter   it could for example disregard its input entirely and use  flux interval      have the  flux i   input complete   and cancel    as is done for example by  fluxgroupby    this will freak out the grpc machinery  which will cancel   the __output__ stream as well

hi   thank you for your fast response  i tried to start the demo without compiling directly from the pre compiled jar with java  jar jnativehook jar  getting the same result   i have to enable the accessibility features  then restart again   the first waring is   jni_setproperties  146   invalid result returned from hook_get_pointer_acceleration_threshold     then i will geh the unhandled darwin event messages for every touchpad movement  i can't see any response to keyboard or touchpad events in the demo  as far as i can see  the logger is set to all   thanks in advance
hmm  i just tried it in single player  since i don't want to restart the server right now  but it doesn't seem to show the error in the log  all i can offer is a screenshot  http   tcp st t01zy png  here's what i did  made a creative computer case  placed it and fitted it with all sorts of thing  i used this to install openos on a hard drive  then put another creative case in an assembler and started assembling a robot  it has all the recommended parts and i also included an inventory upgrade  i then assembled the robot  gave it a pickaxe and put a block in front of it  i booted up the robot  executed  lua  to open a lua repl and tried to do  robot swing     normally  this should destroy the block in front  but it doesn't  instead you get a cryptic error message in game   on the server  i also got the aforementioned  nosuchmethoderror  on the console  though it might not have been every time   you mentioned spongeforge  i honestly have no idea what that is   i don't think i am using that  i simply downloaded the zip file for the modpack and gave it to multimc to work its magic   if you need me to try it on the server to get the actual error message  i can do that tomorrow

hi again   thanks for your analysis efforts  i added some logging to our test environment and this is a stack trace of when a new connection is added to the  nodeconnections  map     so it doesn't seem to originate from the sentinelconnectionmanager really   i thought so because all the connections in the  nodeconnections  map were for the sentinels  but apparently it's just from normal client usage  i guess  then the question would be why the connections are not re used  or rather  why they are never removed after usage

correct  just tried again to confirm   if i have only applecore installed  no other mods  food heals me even with naturalregeneration is off   if i close out minecraft  delete applecore  and run pure vanilla forge minecraft on that same world  the gamerule works properly and i do not heal   note that i used the same save for both tests  so i definitely spelled the gamerule right since i only typed it out once  edit  that is  the gamerule was spelled right because when applecore was removed the rule took effect 
will add more information the next time i see the issue again  i had it several times but it does not seem to be fixed to specific abilities  my cousin had the same issue

hi serge   from our db i cannot say precisely if the table i used to find this bug is a iot table or not    if i execute the following query     the values for iot_name and iot_type are both null  so i suppose the table is an ordinary table   additionally  the reported issue happens with all the tables of our test db  but does not happen with the development db  so maybe this could be related to some oracle instance settings

just realized this is also happening in firefox  tried version 19 0 2   so i guess it doesn't help to try your solution  right   any other suggestions   thanks in advance 
this is just a logic thing in the sampler  not an sdk issue
hi  swankjesse   i can get a test case ready sometimes   but i can give you quick response payload with bunch of set cookie from which i would like to construct a request payload with the same set of cookies from the earlier given response  sample of payload with cookies from which i would like to construct a okhttp request object as mentioned below   ### response payload         at the moment when i use javanetcookiejar to construct the okhttp object it's only adding asp net_sessionid and ignoring other cookies to add to it   in summary  i would like to construct the cookie for the request like   cookie   name   value     name   value        where the each pair on the request being returned from the response with the multiple "set cookie"  i hope it's quite clear 
relevant bits instead of whole thing 
i restarted the phone   i had tried killing the app time ago  but this doesn't work  this is happening since  several days ago  and seems a permanent issue  will try changing the avatar again to see what happens 
example problem with wrong fix  see comments   30e8fec8df9c58e179c28ed4db32a814809ab798  p s  yes   countall  can be marked as safe 
version 0 3 0 i think it happened after loading and i have not been able to reproduce it  but if it happens again i will let you know 
has anyone else been having this issue   if it's just me  i think we can leave it for now  i just needed to run it to make sure evolution works  and it doesn't actively stop me from doing that    prabahy thank you for your quick response and effort 
 kruegers i agree  can we implement it like this 
 chrajeshbabu   i have check the log  balance make the region close 
it seems the code is using  1 to indicate an invalid id for all tablets with walog disabled    when the walog is disabled  tablets get a walog id of  1  as long as the walog is disabled  define tablet events should not be written to the walog   however i think the define tablet events are being written in some situations 
hoan also suggested putting the executable in the top level directory and building  but that resulted in the same error   also hoan rebuilt his project for the first time in "a while" and also had this error

 jsotuyod in regards to the first question  i have tried the cli with both the ant cache file and with its own cache file  the cli command seems to fail on the creation of the cache file resulting in the cache file containing no violations even though there are violations present in the code  the cli command i was using was the following    this is after fixing the error that occurred and it still says the cache was hit  looking at the code it should say   incremental analysis cache miss   file changed     i also attached my very basic sample project which can replicate the issue  i enabled the duplicate imports rule as my rule set to easily see the issue   run the ant pmd task once then remove the duplicate import and run the ant pmd task again you should see the same output    testpmd zip  https   github com pmd pmd files 3408938 testpmd zip   test log  https   github com pmd pmd files 3408917 test log

i am using the lastest version  2 0 0 snapshot   and i am getting the same exception of the past version  at org openstack4j openstack compute domain ext extavailabilityzones extavailabilityzone gethosts extavailabilityzones java 61   and the documentation still says that that the method is not really implemented yet  i realized that in the class extavailabilityzones  the hosts map has a "jsonignore" annotation  and the http call is not the one which returns the information with the details i need  i made two changes and the method started to work for me  i will do a pull request for you with my changes  let me know if i am in a good way 
try to move the map and wait a few seconds  inside a building  without gos connection  it's ok   try it outside with gps connection  if you move the map the text changes to "send selected location" now wait a few seconds without touching the screen   the text changes to "send my current location"

i commit after every object modification  however  so far  i have not been doing so in a finally block  my understanding was that changes would happen in memory and commit would flush to disk  is that incorrect

 michaelwittig  condrestart  would restart the service if it is already running  so it would have the same effect as a  restart    what would be better is a  reload   sighup to reload configuration by a running daemon  but openssh re execs and daemonizes itself on a sighup  which is what gets sent by a  reload    so that wouldn't work  since the way it treats a sighup is equivalent to  restart     this should cover the cloudformation use case    i'm also going to package together a  deb since i'll need to use that for my company  our setup scripts for aws pull down deb packages from a private repo to install and configure our apps   out of curiosity  are you manually packaging the rpm or using an authoring tool like fpm  https   github com jordansissel fpm  
i am running the market release from 5 24 on both htc evo 4g   motorola xoom tablet  the problem occurs on both  i don't believe it is the same problem as #1651  but i think can't say for sure  i am not running the calendar add on on either 
to be honest  no idea    the trace shows a job request but i don't have context  it's one of the client who sent it   the only thing i know    client version 3 182 2281  so svn182    it's a windows   it's a intel r  core tm  i7 4770 cpu   3 40ghz
it doesn't depend on if i use additional subfolders or not  my context menu contains both "send to tablet" and "send to subfolder on tablet"  sic  entries  the latter also contains the name of the target subfolder   what is supposed to happen when two items from different collections are sent to their respective subfolder

thanks sawickil for your response   i have considered the approach that you have mentioned  but i feel that it is bit cumbersome  as you have to index your data and right after the index completed you have to delete and create another river  the specific issue is that if you have any gap between the two  you may have data that is not indexed  because when index completed it was not there and was created before the incremental river was created  assuming the parameter value of last begin will be the current timestamp for the first run    potentially there could be two solutions  1  the easy one is to allow the users of the river to pass on a value to initialize the  river state timestamp variable  that way we can specify e g  jan 1  1970 or any other date that matches our needs to be set as the bootstrap value  it will result in fetching all the data even for the first run  subsequently it will store the actual value of last river run and will automatically move to incremental mode  this could be very straight forward to implement and can be added as an optional parameter to river configuration  there won't be need to for two rivers and also the timing wont affect any results   2  second and more cleaner approach is similar to solr data import handler  where we can specify three queries i e  regular query for full index refresh or first time use  and another query for delta identification and third to retrieve that data  example is     i think it will be great addition to an excellent project and could bring the elasticsearch jdbc importer functionality very close to solr dih   regards  shoaib
first and foremost thank you so much for the prompt replies in trying to help out  the project has been super helpful with learning android concepts  below is a photo of the stacktrace which occurs when clicking on a singular quake fragment    url  various posts state that the nature of the error resides in the fact that the intent needs certain flags declared but when i attempted to do that with the customtabintent without any luck  i have attempted it using an emulator nexus 5x api 29 and a note 9 running api 28  sent with  protonmail  https   protonmail com  secure email   ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ original message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ on sunday  march 1  2020 10 25 am  catalinghita8  notifications github com  wrote

if someone has physical access to your device  the entire directory structure of all connected ownclouds will leak through the upload pane  also  if #674 lands  filenames will leak too  this is why i called it a "security risk"   i should point out that dropbox does this with their upload pane 
wouldn't think so  i've never had this issue from any forgemod or other hack client with multimc
obviously  tooltips sometimes work     but look at my new "tooltips" paragraph of http   www3 bootsfaces net showcase forms selectmultimenu jsf  just above the attributes section  did i define the tooltip in a wrong way

hi  i tried to write a unit test but without success  i never reproduce the problem but it is always existing in my full code  after more investigation  the problem seems to come from one custom constraint  hardactivityconstraint  i added to the vrp  with one additional custom stateupdater for this constraint    in fact  if i always returned fulfilled or always return not_fulfilled  i never have the problem  but if i keep the logic of my constraint i have the arrayindexoutofboundsexception   so i am sure i am doing something wrong but no idea for the moment  thanks for your help

wait you're gonna use c++ dll injections  wouldn't that trigger the game's handle detectors  i mean its not opening any handles and modifying them  but it's certain that its modifying something it's injecting a dll    i'm not exactly sure how to reproduce this problem  but i'm in windows 7 so i think it's an os exclusive problem   i would move to win10 soon just enjoying the 7's company till it ends in 2020  but it's exactly that download a beatmap on an actual browser that osu mer is assigned in and try to exit the browser then play a multiplayer game then download a beatmap then osu mer would download the beatmap but won't import it

 tsmaeder what i mean with "builtins" is the vs code built in extensions as of this  https   github com eclipse che issues 14759   ibuziuk what i mean is that there is more complexity to the theia api and builtin extensions so users may encounter known issues with builtins while trying to add a  vsix extension to the plugin registry   in the case of html language features  which is a built in required by the vuejs extension  it was enough just by adding the html language features vsix prior to the loading of the vuejs extension but there may be cases in which built ins conflict with each other or  vsix versions of the ms vscode builtins are outdated   so this represents a blocker for a user trying to just make a sidecar container  and maybe a cli one too   and some extension's meta yaml to add a ms vscode extension to che  in this case maybe it would be nice to have p1 on this case to get help from che devs around it so users can continue their work
also checked that forge link and it looks like i will have to wait  it's not just jei  it's the sprint key itself that can't be used for anything else  the sneak key also has this problem

when you did the test  your global thru account host had the direct  access to the destination host  so you cannot tell if you get there via  global thru or not  you should try to connect to the host  that cannot  be accessed via global thru account   best regards  frolov g v   on 10 16 2012 03 38 pm  andrey hitrin wrote

hi  rengwuxian   the problem turned out to be less regular than i thought  it might not be related to the base line  it only occurs when the surrounding linearlayout has android gravity "center"        material_edit_text_baseline_problem1  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 11574540 7380059 bea552bc edf9 11e4 9992 6799411be673 png 
based on what i think is the openjdk 7 implementation it seems there is an assignment going on no matter what unless you try to set accessible the constructor of class  see l143 in http   www docjar com html api java lang reflect accessibleobject java html   whether at runtime that assignment is meaningless if obj override is equal to flag  true in our case  or not i don't know  but if it is  then what's the point of isaccessible   existing  or rather  less philosophically  why does this code have the isaccessible wrap  https   github com square moshi blob ee75000c94d20b9b23a98b0d09940ae820635d99 moshi src main java com squareup moshi types java#l230 i understand it could easily be because it's code written by different people  but i'm not confident enough with reflection to assume so

hi   i always run it with redis  here is my code to get the count of registrations   iterators size lwserver getregistrationservice   getallregistrations      however  after registering 200+ devices  after a while  the number became to drop  it might go back to the original number and  then  it will be dropping again      it will give some wrong small number eventually      however  if i get the number of registration directly through redis cli  the number of the connected devices is correct   it means something wrong with the piece of code  iterators size lwserver getregistrationservice   getallregistrations      i also try to use hasnext    next   instead of iterators size  it gives me the same result  hence  i strongly suspect the iterator implementation of leshan has some issue     maybe  it needs to reset the iterator or something   myself  i implement a lua script to get the total count  maybe  leshan should adopt that   thanks   
version 1 4 2  scene json remains unchanged when i run headles mode after rendreing scene in gui  as far as i understand  this is because the scene has already been rendered  therefore  you must delete the dump file or change some property in the scene json  width  height  etc   and then run headless rendering to reproduce this error

i'm afraid i cannot justify the time to further edit videos that are intended for such a small audience   if i am to spend the time cutting down the video  assuming this does not get my bug reports ignored because i could have faked the problem   then i will have to release it to a wider audience to justify the time i spend on it   is that what you would prefer in future   i have a 43 minute video about bins clipping through ceilings when harvested even if the ceiling is many blocks thick   currently it is private  but i would be willing to cut it down  but then i'd have to make it public to justify the extra time spent   on thu  jul 12  2018 at 10 03 pm  xander  notifications github com  wrote

i'll get onto it tomorrow when i find some minutes   another thing i just noticed about the templates are the hardcoded strings  e g  "back to homepage"   which should probably be read from messages for localisation  
yes  thanks for the quick response  here it is  https   pastebin com vcbkuafz
thanks for the quick answer  the fact that you haven't heard this from anyone else certainly points towards an issue in our application   we are using a custom  drmsessionmanager   in our application  rapid zapping between different streams  most of them drm protected with the same init data  is crucial  therefore  we have implemented a  drmsessionmanager  which uses a  defaultdrmsessionmanager  as delegate  when a drm session with a specific uuid is aquired for the first time  our  drmsessionmanager  acquires an additional drm session  using the respective method in defaultdrmsessionmanager   additionally  we have a method to release all of these artificial drm sessions which is called in our activity's  onpause     hence  the stream switching is a lot faster since the key request is made only for the start of the first stream because the artificial drm session is kept open throughout the lifecycle of the app  i'm aware that this is somewhat experimental  but with most devices  except the ones mentioned above   everything works fine   apart from that  we recently also implemented the dummy surface workaround discussed in https   github com google exoplayer issues 3835#issuecomment 390646933  however  we saw the crashes before implementing this workaround  so the issue should not be related to those changes 
merged into develop 
as we see above there is no constructor with no parameters in the keystoneauth class  this may cause some problems when using jackson to handle  it

 rentalhost it was happening in  all  my code yesterday  but today     i tried lots of files and i did not came across the error again  so  not sure what happend yesterday  i did restart my ide but that had no effect    ah well let's blame windows     thanks for this amazing plugin and i will update this if i see the error again 
my configuration is this    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 1606069 27844304 2c4541ba 6152 11e7 9fc0 f23623770514 png   but even i add something in configuration  still the same problem       image  https   user images githubusercontent com 1606069 27844308 64601cfa 6152 11e7 9a1d f899257cf1b6 png 
that's an instance of crossed streams   i tried just that  remembering that i got a different error message when i had that before 
i haven't tried that directly  but i will   the only way i've found so far to clear it is to restart openhab  i assume that's because the thing isn't in the jsondb  and so a fresh start of the systems clears out any internal knowledge that the thing exists 
hi  max dev   thanks for looking into this  we finally realized the problem was our   jsonignore  annotations  we didn't want our regular rest api including the complete referenced object  so we added that annotation  finally we realized this was probably interfering with the reference   can you point me to the code you use to replace the referenced object in the json serialization with just the url  i would like to apply something like that to our rest api as well

every time the grinder kills a zombie horse  the modpack has still enderzoo 1 7 10 1 0 2 7_beta so it is maybe already fixed   i just disabled the fallen mount in the config for a temporary fix 
hi    yes that makes sense  i guess the only scenario i can think of is if if the last modified fetched in a header only request and is ignored because of this strategy 
 gwenneg you´re right  it only happens on dev mode    loicmathieu i tried workaround with  priority without success  thnx for pointing the code      gsmet what about a setting on  application properties  disabling this feature 
3 6  however this was happening with 3 5 and maybe previous versions 
sure i will set this up
you can reproduce it   join to arena  leave arena  join to arena  leave arena  after that  arena start writing "teleport to lobby"
 thboileau yes i can see the payload now in the browser  but just after applying a fix   here    http   www pastekit com lwag6
the issue i have seems to be something totally different from what i initially thought  but there were still errors coming from this skript bizarrely   the issues i'm having all have to do with using "offline player" and join and leave events  here is the message i am receiving that crashes skript  "an error happened when trying to enably resolving offline players  so the feature has been turned off "

android considers the app hanging if the main thread is allocated for more than x seconds  for service mode 5 seconds since android 8+   then it issues warnings in the logcat about this  newer android's halt the process completely forever  see gplay console anr reports   if you stress test the conditions and toggle the "apps decision" fastly from "false" to "true" to "false" and so on  messages got sent via the onprefschangedlistener and queued up  so you end up on permanently starting and ending syncthing on the main service thread  plus delays that has always been in there to allow safe startup  polling and shutdown you get a delay "per on off cycle" from 2 to 3 seconds  more cycles     anr

ok great  they render fine when on crop sticks  i don't know if this is caused by agricraft or rotarycraft or if i should submit it as another bug but when harvested the canola plants drop canola seed husks rather than canola seeds which are the item they are farmed for 
hi  jakubklimek   thank you for your prompt answer    the file i send is used by pipeline input component    i made the changes as you suggested  the lowercase boolean values raised an error in python as was recognised as variables  so i capitalised the first letter to be an eligible python dictionary    then the json payload as long as i undestand serializes this as json data to post with the request    however the pipeline still runs with the debug data on  it seems to somehow been ignored  is there somehow logged what was received as request on lp  maybe this is a python related issue

i am not sure if this will actually work in our approach due to  1  even if the connection is open before sending the batch  the race condition still exists    connection is not established  i send the command without autoflushing disabled  internally  there's a connection promise   and when it's completed  the command is added to a connection buffer   i wait for the connection to be established  i get the same promise  asyncconnectionprovider getconnection          when promise completes  meaning the connection is established   2 actions start at the same moment      1  add command to the command buffer  internally in lettuce     2  flush commands  externally by my code     if for any reason  flush commands  action is quicker  the command would not be flushed  2  in cluster mode connections are stored  by slot  https   github com lettuce io lettuce core blob master src main java io lettuce core cluster pooledclusterconnectionprovider java#l103   iterating over 16384 connection before flushing would be bad from performance point of view

yes  i tried v0 0 5 beta and v0 0 6 beta 
hahaha  sorry ray  i overlooked that the issue is only known to me    we use erxjdbcconnectionbroker and as part of setup   method following code is executed    pre  connection con   getconnection    try       supportstransactions    con gettransactionisolation      0       if supportstransactions            con setautocommit false           catch  sqlexception ex        log error ex  ex     finally       freeconnection con       pre   so  in this case when my connection initially setup was in autocommit   true and because using connection broker  we're reusing the same connection without really closing  connection pooling   and when the connection is in the middle of a transaction and when statement is not yet committed  invoking setautocommit false  throws exception  in my opinion  the check fix the issue  which we've tested with postgresql database 
updated issue with plugins mods  basically sky factory 4 0 5  i did manage to test upto sf 3734 which seemed to work normally on one server  but on another sf4 server ore excavation wouldn't work at all  just had failure errors in the console along with other issues on the server  so it must have been a very recent change   i didn't want to test anything above that as alot of very recent versions seem to have some major issues reverts
apologies for the delayed response  version was beta 4  however can confirm this issue is still present with beta 6  latest version   can you resolve 
version number bumps happens when we release the toolkit  since we have never done a 5 0 release  it does not make sense to bump the version number 
 rhuss maybe we should containerize the syndesis client tool  i want to avoid new users to check out the source code from github to be able to install it 
 scottmitch i've debugged it and found out the reason of the problem  after that i had tracked changes of 4 1 0 beta5 version and i understood  that it is not a bug    apologize for the noise   for the version 4 1 0 beta5  according to #3712  i need to call  client ctx flush    after all writes to the channel  https   github com idelpivnitskiy aerogear webpush server blob 4 1 0 beta6 snapshot server netty src main java org jboss aerogear webpush netty webpushframelistener java#l203 l213 and it solved my problem   for the current version  according to #3860  i also need to call  client encoder flowcontroller   writependingbytes       isn't it  if everything is correct  the issue could be closed 
i used this  https   github com cabaletta baritone issues 797  i used to use this on windows  but as soon as i used it on ubuntu 19 10  it no longer works and crashes like above  i can confirm that it still works on windows 10 as i dual boot  also can you now run baritone on fabric 
build 108 for 1 10 2   i see there is a new build out this morning i will give that a try 
ok maybe that was the issue   the primary group  that is   except that " custom" came back as a 'unknown command   ' even with the files present  so that may be something else or    i just have to do a total server restart every time i add one   i couldn't get it to work before even with the primary groups on info but  it does appear to be working as advertised now  at least on the  einfo command   maybe had been a problem with a previous build i had that got patched along the way  i don't know   there wasn't anything helpful in debug since    it acts like the command was never  even attempted 
thanks for that joacim   i've now updated the ugs software    i had previously done a 'check for updates' which had come back empty    one file attached     tree right final pass nc zip  https   github com winder universal g code sender files 2277572 tree right final pass nc zip

yeah i switched it to   intensity percent   but regardless i can't get it to dim by saying "alexa  dim the arc lamp to 50"  i used hurl it to send http request using all the same stuff i put into habridge and it works fine  so i am not sure what habridge is sending to my homeassistant that it wont work 
no   this would make somehow no sence as it would be out of xprivacys capabilities     i just open up the normal phone app  using cm10 2  and dial a number and establish a call

refreshing the cache did not fix the problem  did it twice  my java version is 1 8 0_51  perhaps add more logging to help us troubleshoot 
was it like that ever since  never experienced that before     however  your change is how i would expect it 
it doesn't  it still doesn't display the colors even if chisel  jei  and ctm are the only mods installed i think

 master  now has the gradle build and all tests are passing in ci   this bug  unable to build without android sdk installed  is also resolved  so i'm closing this issue 
 romannikitenko hello  yesterday we have been trying it with  rhopp on 7 10 0 snapshot and the behavior was flaky  sometimes the exit code was returned and the task terminated correctly  sometimes it didn't but at least in 7 10 0 it didn't prevent me from executing different tasks  or restarting the same task   i am currently implementing a periodic test for go devfile  so i would get back to you once we have more data collected from running the same operation on the go devfile in tests and seeing how often the issue appears 
sure  https   www dropbox com s 9gd97yks5vfb59s f81224bc 0a74 472e 8c8b e66428f9cf5e zip dl 0 i asked the player what he placed last before this timeout issue arrised  he said he placed a "containment chalice"  but he isn't 100  sure if thats the last thing he did   update  now  without doing a thing  the player and others can enter his claim as usual
looks like its not actually finding the component node 
i used firefox version 60 3 0 esr  i just tried with internet explorer version 11 09600  again the incorrect input is accepted but this time without the brief red frame that i see with firefox   by the way   i'd consider the bevaviour you described in your comment  i e  replacing the incorrect value by a valid one  as a serious bug  too  it is as if the application said  "i don't like the value you submitted  so i'll take one i like instead " an incorrect value should neither be accepted nor replaced by a valid one 
i created a pr #52 for this
ah  sorry  i didn't look into where the actual code came from   if it needs to be updated in htsjdk then it should be updated there 
i found this to be true on both the master and develop branches  i pulled them both just now and see the same behavior on both 
that's great  easy fix  do you think it will make 1 6 1

i had updated to 4 1 0 beta 4  now all works fine  thank you 
you probably only need to wrap the logic performed by  servicedestroy  inside a  session accesssynchronously  block  https   github com vaadin spring blob 3 0 vaadin spring src main java com vaadin spring internal uiscopeimpl java#l260  then you'd also have to figure out how this could be automatically tested  with a little luck  it's already covered by a test  but the test isn't run with assertions enabled 
thank you very much for the quick response  sadly not stacktrace is logged by  flowable ui idm app  and the full response returned does not contain more information than what i already posted      "timestamp "  "2019 01 14t15 51 26 473+0000 "  "status " 500  "error "  "internal server error "  "message "  "there is no passwordencoder mapped for the id    "null   " "  "path "  " flowable idm app authentication "  
hrmpf  that’s not the only keyword that es5 reserved… here’s the full list  from the link in the original description     unconditionally       x   class       x   const       x   enum       x   export           extends           import           super    in strict mode       x   implements           interface           let           package       x   private       x   protected       x   public       x   static           yield   the remaining unchecked keywords under “unconditionally” can still be used to reproduce this bug  please add them too   it gets uglier with the ones that are only reserved in strict mode  ideally  we want to support running in strict mode  #2733   for that  we should escape these names too  however  that will be a change to binary compatibility  and unlike the case for  class   this will break compatibility with code  albeit code with weird names  that currently works  so we shouldn’t make this change right now  i think… but it does mean we know for sure that we’ll break binary compatibility at least one more time  unless we’re happy with never ever supporting strict mode 
i don't see that option anywhere 
background   i have seen spring boot applications  which are configured the same way at least in terms of spring logging  but behave completely different  because of dependencies in the classpath  sometimes it is even third party libraries  which "break" the logging contract  i should be possible to debug these situations more easy    in  org springframework boot logging loggingapplicationlistener  the only logging output is in case of exceptions     something like  dlogback debug true would be great

sorry it wasn't clear  i'm referring to the group view  i have several groups and many subgroups  all static  making the list longer than the "view" and giving me a scroll bar  after playing around with it a little  i realized that when i drag an entry from "all entries" into a group  there is no issue  however  if i drag an entry from one group into another  and the group view is scrolled down  it will jump to the top  hope this is clearer  thanks

yes  i just reproduced it  i used the tables of the chromosome 6 questionnaire  i can't reproduce it with small tables  like the phenotype tables of the chromosome 6 questionnaire   i don't have other large tables to check it with   selecting first one table  questionnaire part a_c  in the dataexplorer  then another  questionnaire d_h  and then a third  questionnaire i_l   and pushing previous and next button after that is the easiest way to reproduce  since the error does not occur always    i used google chrome

yeah i got a regular output    i don't think it is an actual bug  it's just how it is intended to work  requirements for merging are too strict    you should probably just check owners  at least one owner in common between the two areas  if you want you could make this configurable     merge    matching_all_owners_required  false   at_least_one_owner_required  true   matching_members_required   false   matching_flags_required   false

 mayankgarg1990 you're right  json is not orderable  in that case  i don't have a good solution except for falling back to a regular checksum  we can still apply array sort to structured type but have a regular checksum as a fallback  this allows to handle the most kinds of scenarios    for array of orderable structured type 
yes  sure  do a  mvn clean install  and then  mvn clean spring boot run   then   1  go to  http   localhost 48080 admin storages storage common proxies group common proxies update  2  reorder the repositories in the  group repositories  tab 3  save  and remember the ordering you did  4   cat strongbox web core strongbox etc conf strongbox xml   grep  i  a 8 'id "group common proxies"'    result will be the old order    i just noticed that if you create a new group repository   it preserves the correct order  however  if you're updating an existing one   it would not update the order of the repos in the xml

 desperatecoder i've tried opening the web deck app  then also logging into and out of the web ui and re opened the web deck app  the three dot menu is still missing in this one case  however  it does display correctly once there is a column in the board  it only seems to be missing when there is no columns yet

yes  at least for godot 2 1  it was "build successful"  i couldn't even export template for godot 2 1 4 even without the module  idk why  but it's a different problem  i haven't tried to use it in a project yet  i need some more time to understand how it works first   is it somehow possible to get it to work with 3 0 2 
 yurishkuro yes  the case i'm concerned about is when  service a  is traced  but something makes a request to  a  with the debug header set    in todays world  unless all services in the chain are instrumented and reporting correctly  it is difficult to ascertain that this debug header originated in  a    peer service  is only set when an inbound request has  x_uber_source  header set  which is something that might not be true all the time  and perhaps none of the time for users that aren't uber  
i am using the zotero addon for firefox  not the standalone version  i have zotfile setup to move all new attachments to a folder in my spideroak from the default zotero location  the steps to reproduce are launching firefox  navigating to a journal article with a pdf that i would like to save  and press the 'save to zotero' icon in the browser toolbar   i tried it more extensively now and notice that the error persists for all articles i download  until i open the zotero pane and right click    manage attachments    rename attachments  this works without error messages and  curiously  makes zotfile work automatically with all subsequently downloaded articles  so after i have done the manual renaming once  i can use the zotero toolbar button to download article pdfs and zotfile will automatically rename them   i do use noscript and some other addons  not sure if that would interfere somehow 
you're right  closing

hi  hideki  i don't use the phonegap plugin  i have a html js frontend running in a webview and some background services written in java that are listening to changes in the database   because most of this code is also used in a desktop environment using apache couchdb the frontend and the java based backend access the database using the rest api  the litelistener is started in my own android service   to reproduce the issue generate many changes in a database and try to request a continuous changes feed  i created a little demo app  https   github com fpum deadlockdemo it basically runs a loop from 1 to 1000 that in each iteration creates and deletes a new document and tries to get the changes using a continuous feed  you would expect it to run till "created change number 1000" and "found 1000 changes" but it gets stuck on the way 
we encounter this issue already since around 15 nov 17 all the time in a gateway which is permanently performing lifecycle tests  so there is a chance that indeed a matching storageservice component is not available at that point in time when the  stream    call is made  which in turn is called indirectly by the  automaticinboxprocessor  activator method  but it might also be the case that the storageservice is present  but its   getvalues    returns  null    trying to gain access to that information  also to which storage provider is used  the commit id the esh bundles are based upon should be 6d32c35f934b6b5a627cc4a32ff91564902bdc2a

yes  it is paired  when i go back to an older version of canze  it still works correctly
i wouldn't give list of my plugins but you can ask me if i have a specific plugin   sgdc3 if i use build 1228 there is no this problem  the problem comes from one of build after this one

yeah  it's my fault   accept my apologies   
due to the second case happening sometimes  this is definitely a blocker

i will try to make up a simple project that reproduces the problem   but generally i think the flow goes like this    initially there is no session created on the server and no session cookies in the browser    the controller servlet creates a new session and sets an attribute  then throw an exception  thus the error in the response above     a custom exception handler forwards request to an error page  a jsp without      page session "false"     
here's how to reproduce the error  i'm using janusgraph 0 2 0 with berkeley db and the bundled version of elasticsearch in this example

not related  this is a problem on the frontend   the same deployment works on chromium

nope  i just had to deal with the issue yesterday and i used the workaround of changing all my sha256s in all my repositories  which works if github doesn't change their code again

please excuse the delayed response  to answer your questions    i have actually attempted many different versions in an attempt to fix this issue but i am positive that i have tried the top three hybrid modems and can confirm that i have restarted the device each time  i have even attempted to manually switch the radio to every option related to my device in terms of what band to use through the "info" screen    to recap   this problem only happens when i have wifi and the cell radio on at the same time  if i place it in airplane mode and or turn off wifi i don't have any issues  further more    when both radios are turned on and any of the top 3 hybrid modems are used my wifi signal will typically show 4 bars and my lte signal will have 0 2 bars  i am in an area where i have a week lte signal from one tower and a strong signal from a non lte tower   in any case   i definitely believe there is some type of key issue which specifically show how does not tell my device to use my wifi radio as the primary when it has a strong connection resulting in every request from any app which uses the internet having a long delay before  and sometimes times out  it completes its requests   please advise if there is any way for you to look into this for a fix or if you know of some app which would allow me to force specific applications to use wifi if its available   thanks in advance   chris h

 snicoll  i wouldn't read that tip  as don't do it  but more be careful if you are doing this  i also wouldn't expect this functionality to change in a minor revision  as this a breaking issue    good catch on the  public nested getnested     would expect that to show up in 2 1 5 as well   i actual project this is a private method  so i've updated my  example project to reflect this  https   github com bdemers spring config problem commit fd97c0894d6b8143ae4993efd43592e801e96a3c#diff 86560ea992f714b0bec72ed9ace49852r46    the metadata generated was not effected by this change  both in 2 1 5 and 2 2 0 m3   thanks for the heads up on the   autowire  + constructor   for now  i'll try to work around this to support 2 1 and 2 2 with your suggestions   thanks again 
i did manage to fix this  and i'm pretty sure it's going to be difficult to reproduce   but here's some more info   the rule looked like this     rule "test" when     switch_family_room changed then     loginfo swfr  "this is a rule"  end    however  the error was originally firing when any of my pre existing rules fired   i had everything working  but was adding some new items to the system and ended up needing to restart and that's when the issues began   i originally had the "script interpreter can not be obtained" errors for them  so i upgraded my oh install and was greeted with this error   in order to fix it  i ended up first moving all of my rule files   when that didn't work  i restarted again with them removed  and that's what got things going   i've since added them back  one at a time  and they all seem to be working   it's almost like some bad data got stuck in the rule pipeline   i know that's not very helpful for hunting down the bug   and feel free to close it now that it's working again 
i believe it is being picked up because if i remove the configfilename property and leave the default one of    src main enunciate enunciate xml    but without having the actual file on the path  it complains it doesn't exist  like it should  as soon as i move it inside the folder  the warning disappears  the config still doesn't work  even while using this default file location  any ideas what could be wrong 
no  i did not export the override  when launching the server in standalone mode  the changed settings are considered  cfr the options on the command line    when i export the env variable  then indeed the distributed server process starts with the changed heap settings       please fix this incorrect behaviour

hello  sijie   while this is a perfect technical explanation of why the issue happens  this is not how one would expect a regex pattern based subscription to work  a regex pattern based subscription should allow the topic list to grow when new topics are created  similarly  the regex pattern based subscription should allow the topic list to shrink when new topics are deleted   please do let me know if you believe that this is not a valid business requirement 
the message appeared this morning  but i only started testing ums yesterday   i didn't have debug logging turned on for your library at the time  i've since turned it on  added some logging to output the buffer if it's negative  and am waiting for it to happen again  i'll post more info when i have it   i'm not up to speed on the chromecast protocol  to know whether it's guaranteed to return 4 bytes   but you're calling   read    on an  inputstream  and not checking if the return value is   1   which would indicate the end of the stream   you could get some strange behavior if that happened   a different approach might be to use the  read byte   b   method on inputstream  in case there are fewer than 4 bytes available

that would fix the test case  since it is predictably running touchdown during the lifecyclelistener's pause event  but i don't think it would prevent the issue from happening in practice if a timer could still possibly be created during the "danger period"  what about suluke's suggestion from #1548  setting timer thread to null during the pause event seems like it would work

no  it's not    see eg full log  here  https   s3 amazonaws com cdn freshdesk com data helpdesk attachments production 3031256570 original token_expired txt x amz algorithm aws4 hmac sha256 x amz credential akiaj2jsyz7o3i4jo6da 2f20170913 2fus east 1 2fs3 2faws4_request x amz date 20170913t140300z x amz expires 300 x amz signature ee81de4989719a0d974e32842999447162b27461857000f1e56eeade1561531c x amz signedheaders host response content type text 2fplain    but it does know that the token has expired  that's why it's getting a new token   and anyway    why should it be normal to include  token  credentials in a token request  only someone with a key should be able to get a token  which means either an unsigned token request done with basic auth  or a signed token request with no auth    realtime rejects unsigned token requests done with bearer auth anyway  even if the token is valid   at least  it should  if not then that's a security hole   so at no time does it make sense to send token credentials with a token request  surely
hi sjka  tested the change with the last snapshot of oh build #989  the  return  doesn´t stop the execution of a rule  maybe something still missing  can you please have a look on it  thanks very much

 christophd yes you are right  that works  it is certainly not the most obvious solution though  if this is the intended solution  it should be at least documented somewhere   tovacohen can you elaborate if it is already documented  or add a mention of that in the documentation    but this is a thing you don't really expect that you have to read documentation for  maybe a little mention in the ui where there is the "provide a condition that you want to evaluate  for example     in header type     'note'  or    in body title  contains 'important'   " or in a perfect world if the datatype is a json schema there could be a note added or something   cc  syndesisio uxd

i sync the latest the master branch 2 2 11 snapshot  and build it by myself  but it might have no improvement for the long latency issue  is this issue caused by netty or is it possible that we have missed some configurations about netty

in this case the update of the database is too slow so the leader lease is lost and the rm loose the leader role and transition to standby  this is what the logs say and this is normal behaviour  the rm does not relinquish its role as leader  it lose it   what the log does not say and that is the cause of the strange logs we got is that in the transitiontostanby function we force the leader election process to relinquish its id and to get a new one  this was done to give the administrator the possibility to make the leader transition to standby  i can remove it but i'll have to rewrite all the ha tests for this  they use the transitiontostandby admin call to simulate the crash of the scheduler node    keeping this is not a problem because once the rm as transitioned to standby it will have to go through a total recovery to become active again  so it has no impact if the new leader is the same rm that kept its id or another node because the previous leader relinquished its id 
i am referring to general option of the app language  there is an option to set the ui language  this does not work right ro me  if i choose anything else than system default i get different random translations in some activities  i also found some actions not working if you set a language that there is no available translation  for example setting my mobile to greek ui  has a result of notifications without text to my mi band 2

 jotschi we were in standalone mode  no cluster  but restore occured when getmesh was heavy loaded  40 req   s average   after a restart it returns working properly without lock  only certains type of schema were locked  i created a new schema and new node and it worked fine  all get queries were ok  only some update queries returned errors due to orientdb lock  perhaps because not all orientdb files were locked    another thing  during the restore  i saw some errors logs about orientdb was locked too  mesh cli returned status 504 too   but in the end restore was effective  we manually checked that modified nodes during the current day were restored to precedent version    hope that pr about restoring older node version will become effective soon

 zoewangg  the jdk version is 1 8 0_191  the aws s3 sdk version  is 2 5 31  the code is very simple   maybe there are some missunderstandings here   i have analyzed the source code of aws sdk  the class of  software amazon awssdk auth signer awss3v4signer  and  software amazon awssdk auth signer internal abstractaws4signer   i did not use any  inputstream   the inutputstream i mentioned is used in aws s3 sdk  the  inputstream  represents the stream data of http request  it's quite easy to reproduce

if you are testing this through the twitch launcher  twitch has the tendency to enable disable other mods related or at least dependent on the one you disable enable  an example is disabling jei will disable just enough resources and twilight forest  theres more too  but that's not important   re enabling jer will re enable jei  but re enabling twilight forest does not 
of course   
sure  we could do that  there are a couple of outliers in  httpheaders that have words with consecutive capital letters   etag  and  www authenticate   see http   docs oracle com javaee 6 api constant values html#javax ws rs core httpheaders accept   maybe we can just create a special case for those   i'm not fond of special cases  but that would ensure that we normalize exactly once and use  httpheaders  constants everywhere else 
everything seems fine  no crashes of any kind

 subhrajyotisen if i recall correctly  we implemented “erase from notification” because android didn’t support app actions   furthermore  notifications are supposed to be highly contextual  ie  they should appear after a certain conditions have been met and can easily be dismissed   rather than appearing permanently  so our original use of the notification seems hacky

we use an aws s3 bucket to host the actual cache artifacts  and then use s3 pre signed urls to redirect bazel clients to the s3 bucket to get the actual artifact   this allows us to run a very simple and small remote cache cluster while leveraging s3 to actually serve all the artifacts    the remote cache service still needs to handle writing to the s3 bucket  but all cache reads are handled by s3

1   i receive data from a backend that i need to encode with specific set before appending them to an url later when actually loading it  since it's on a performance critical path and dealing with many thousands  i do the encoding before saving to database  okhttp code fit that needs of specific sets and is way faster and allocation efficient than os versions  specially since i then need to do some replace in the generated string to fix the applied set   2  less important as less critical path  but i do need to generate simple static string urls with encoded login password and place holders with manual encoding allocate a lot less than create a full blown httpurl and convert to string   for that one i could use provided httpurl api

hello   sorry i didn't write a more comprehensive report i was in a hurry  after i upgraded nextcloud the android app started complaining about e2e not being installed on the server  so i installed e2e and it fixed the problem on my phone  but then the webui stopped working with the "permission denied" error in the files app  i couldn't find a fix for this other than removing the e2e  plugin  after i removed it webui was fixed but the android app was still not working  i uninstalled the android app on my phone  cleared all the data and installed the app again   i logged in via the qr code  it didn't ask for e2e plugin and it seems i can access my files  but now it's crashing constantly   thank you  kind regards

dita ot 1 8 5 and dita ot 2 1 have the same problem 
_turns out it wasn't the motion photos but photos i took in the portrait mode of the camera  which allow you to set a custom background blur  it saves the blurred version but also an original   but this doesn't change the problem with the folders _  looking more closely  i noticed there are a couple of things going on here     original app   with the original nc app  with sync on for the  camera  folder   1  i take a portrait photo 2  the app tells me there is a new media folder  this is the type mentioned above  named after the photo  so  camera photoname photoname jpg   3  i ignore the notification and don't enable auto upload for this new folder 4  as the subfolder is part of a folder with auto upload on  the  camera  folder  the nc app uploads the new photos anyway but puts them straight into the  camera  folder      qa app   then i disabled auto upload in the nc app  installed the qa version of the nc app  and enabled the auto upload function of the  camera  folder in there   1  i take a portrait photo 2  the app silently creates a new folder inside the remote  camera  folder and uploads the images to this new folder   in both cases the thumbnails on the  auto upload  overview in the nc app are not updated to show the new images  doesn't show anything in subfolders      the result of the qa app makes sense  you get a folder with the new files  which is also the structure used on your mobile device  one  potentially huge  drawback of this new folder on the server is that it is    a folder  this means you can't easily browse your  camera  directory anymore  as you'll have to enter multiple subfolders to see their contents  which sometimes is just a single photo    the gallery app on your phone gets around this problem by not treating them as folders  it presents you with a single image on the gallery overview  and when tapped it will use the other images in the folder in specific ways  original edited versions  etc   of course the nc app could do something similar  but that would be way too specific behaviour for a project like nc     final thoughts   i'm not sure what the best option would be  any thoughts on this   1  keep the old behaviour where the content of subfolders ends up in the parent folder       pro  easy to browse gallery pages on the server     con  different structure from what is on the phone  images are not linked related anymore  though you can use the name for custom scripts   2  use the new method where subfolders are uploaded as subfolders     pro  mirrors folder structure of phone 3  something else      con  makes it harder to browse images on server

they both definitely produce output  it's just that the output is incorrect  the second link shows the details for rp1  correctly  which suggests that the genenameservice does indeed know about it  it's a valid gene  and it exists in our system   however  the first link doesn't include rp1 among the autocomplete suggestions  here is the output i get from the first link    "numreturned" 10 "docs"   "symbol" "abca4"   "symbol" "adamts19 as1"   "symbol" "adcy10"   "symbol" "ahdc1"   "symbol" "amer1"   "symbol" "apobec4"   "symbol" "arid5a"   "symbol" "c1orf167"   "symbol" "c1orf174"   "symbol" "ca4"      rp1 is sadly not among those results  even though it is an exact match

thanks  lilgreenbird   i will be updating the version to 7 4 1 and observe the system for 2 to 3 days and let you know the status back 
 cpfeiffer thx for the quick reply   it's a guess that debug logging doesnt't work because of the same reason  but since it's trying to write to the same location it seems logical that it's the cause  the directory exists  owned by  root sd_card  with permissions 775   here's a quick logcat when pressing  export db  
i'm still trying to reproduce the error  in the mean time  here are my settings   plugin settings xml     xml version "1 0" encoding "utf 8"    settings     webhooks enabled "true"       webhook url "http   some web page 8080 a folder" enabled "false" format "json" template "none"         states           state type "buildsuccessful" enabled "true"             state type "buildbroken" enabled "false"             state type "buildfailed" enabled "true"             state type "buildstarted" enabled "true"             state type "buildfixed" enabled "false"             state type "buildfinished" enabled "true"             state type "responsibilitychanged" enabled "true"             state type "changesloaded" enabled "true"             state type "buildinterrupted" enabled "true"             state type "beforebuildfinish" enabled "true"            states         build types enabled for all "true" enabled for subprojects "true"          webhook      webhooks    settings    server info  centos linux release 7 1 1503  teamcity 10 0 1  build 42078  tcwebhooksplugin 1 1 109 134

my proposal without community input would be as follows  given we find with further investigation that replacing the current metrics files histograms with histograms with empty bins doesn't negatively effect any known uses of these histograms  i think this would be the best solution and i would implement that option  along with any other changes for histogram sizes that come up with further testing  so far  we have not found an issue with putting in the properly sized histograms    nh13 the use case where we ran into this was in the metricsfiletest  there were previously no tests for gethistogram and upon implementing them  and continuing with its current test format of a function that 'writesthenreadsback' the metrics file to a file  then reads it back into a new metrics file object and tests to see if these metrics files are equal  it fails on any metrics file containing multiple histograms of different sizes because of the 0s that get filled into the histograms upon writing to a file 
i now switched on version 4 3 61 and it it doesn't occur currently on that version  maybe it fixed itself 
i did not  but  trying it just now  that didn't appear to make a difference

hi  these are the steps i followed  #  i created around 6 workspaces of different stacks recent workspaces lists always shows the old ones and not the last updated workspace though the status is running #  also during workspace creation if i consider 'stack authoring' and have docker receipe   the workspace name which i provided in this step is not same as the workspace name once it is created  in other words  workspace name provided during creation of workspace by stack authoring does not seem to work   yes  will upgrade to 5 4 0 version and check with the new version too

we can try the latest version but we don't have a reproducible test yet  no  it doesn't occur consistently and that was the first occurrence of the issue  we have been using helidon for our micro services over 6 months and never seen this issue   another question  our common library has the helidon config which is used in all micro services for runtime config changes  if we upgrade webserver to 1 0 3  will this work with config module of older versions  i read release notes of release 1 x that config module has significant changes in 1 x from 0 10 version of config

what do you mean by inplace rebuild  reindex into the same index  if so  it is recommended to reindex data into a fresh index  so less deleted docs in lucene  
after deeper investigation i see that in normal configuration indeed it works   however  when you look at the code above it should be clear  that for hierarchical contexts it won't work because of recursive call with the same argument for each call   and this is exactly my case   i am using 'spring cloud starter config'  so i've got contexts hierarchy as follows     will be trapped inside infinite loop leading to stackoverflowerror

ahh i see  you are correct  as a sanity check i confirmed that the 0 8 9 artifact in maven was indeed targeted to 1 8    i agree this is an issue with the standard library    doing some digging this is the path that i see  1  cast to buffer in all appropriate places 2  it looks like they added   release for this very issue  http   openjdk java net jeps 247   so    release 8  would need to be specified in addition to sourcecompatibility and targetcompatibility in gradle   this will cause a compiler error for all places where the cast is needed  making it detectable at compile time instead of at runtime   i would be happy to look into this further and submit a pr if you think this is the correct path to go down

thanks for replying  we have the plugin configured in the  build  and  reporting  elements  the project has around 45 modules   we have it within the  build  element to fail the build to fail the build when  failbuildoncvss  is    7      what we do is run the build on a schedule overnight  if the build fails we generate the report separately and send it as an attachment in an email so we're notified if our software has a vulnerability   maybe we have configured it wrong

originally i observed the problem on a more complex circuit  i have reduced this circuit to its simplest expression to test this problem  there remain only three inputs connected to three outputs with the test vectors file as shown in the figure  i added "not" gates so that the outputs are in error with respect to the vector file  i could also edit the vector file without modifying the schema  this problem arises as well for 1 0 errors as for e or x

thanks for the explanation  i was wondering if  distance_error_pct  applied at search time  but i was not completely sure from the docs  re reading the geo_shape query documentation  i can see how the  distance_error_pct  configured in the mapping will be applied at search time as well    regarding the difference between using the  geohash  and  quadtree  tree implementation  i have a more specific example  if i use the default settings  i don't get the false positive with the following mapping   i understand that this is a pretty outlandish case  but it was surprising to me that one tree implementation returns a false positive with the default precision settings while the other does not   it seems like the behavior is indeed expected  and if i really need more accuracy for these huge multipoints  i can tune the parameters as you mentioned  thanks again for the clarification

not yet  it was just blind attempt at fixing by reverting grizzly modules to previous version   i'm trying to create a sample project  but it seems that it needs more ingredients than just form auth  jvmroute and jsf page   i hopefully get back to it on monday  and try to look at diffs between grizzly releases 
i did actually  now that you mention it  from 1387 to 1388  which completely removed the edited  jar file after installing forge prior 1387  as in there's no  jar anymore    guess it's back to 1387 again 
no it was on an existing db  but some of them may trigger exceptions on indexing   it may be related   will do more testing to identify the issue  i have observed this errors 7 times this week 
i tried to find anything about pattern of path parameter in openapi spec but find nothing   
sorry just saw this  i will try to get you some

install quiverbow  http   wildwestscifi net coding 9889  as well with your mod and run it server side with forge 1307 
ok you can make the bug work right away  no filtering needed  just get the second page and click on the item's icon  the recipe shown is the one from the item in the same place on the first page 
i can confirm that  fixed

i tried to refresh whole workspace  but it did not help and double checked that all projects exist  unfortunately there is nothing in the eclipse error log  checked both view and log file on disk   if you do not have any clue what the problem is  i could try to compile and debug the plugin from sources 
ok  i will try to remove it or at least make it private  but i will wait for merge of pr #1154  because there will be some conflicts

you can simply download the  project base for vaadin 13  https   vaadin com start latest project base  and copy the code from above into the  mainview   of course you must first add the add on to the  pom xml

hi  jgrandja    thanks for the pointer  it just works as you have described  but it is not what i have been looking for     background  i have many rolebased annotations with should be used in our code base  i want to simplify usage in test cases  so the name of the annotation itself describes the role very good and i don´t want that other developers have to handle annotation parameters     using the annotation itself i have to write n withsecuritycontextfactories with the same implementation  but with different annotations as parameter    testwithrolexy   createsecuritycontext testwithrolexy customuserlikeannotation     testwithroleyz  createsecuritycontext testwithroleyz customuserlikeannotation     the implementation is the same because i am using reflection to read the annotation parameters and the annotation parameters are the same for all annotations     this leads to more code  easy code  and i only want to say that it was easier before    this ticket can be closed if the previous behaviour will not be reverted     i saw some changes by  rwinch in the classes which processes the withsecuritycontextfactories  so maybe you know more  rob   thanks  jens
please see the commited unit test in my fork  if you debug it and change the offset array input for second  extractone  call from   10  8   to   9  8    it will serialize the example message body properly 
hi  marcingrzejszczak   just demo code for now      would it be possible to maybe just start discarding spans if the queue is full  it would probably be preferable to lose traces rather than throwing unhandled exceptions    a sampling rate of 0 1  or even 0 01  may be fine for expected traffic  but an unexpected spike should probably not start throwing exceptions if the rest of the code can cope  as you say  a custom poller would probably solve that  i'll definitely give it a try   i've tried similar tests using http as the transport mechanism instead of kafka and haven't seen any issues 
gmd 2 1 it is working on demo  but as i can see there is code at 370 372 of materialautocomplete                   if  suggestionmap containskey suggestion                 return false             which prevents from duplicates  please verify 
i   think   we can fix this in the archetype  switching to beam will probably make this moot  but that's a bigger change 
the normal interface  http   puu sh gj9s2 8b7e378987 png the interface terminal count  http   puu sh gj9sm 64ab4eda25 png i want to stress that no other changes were made other than the single change pictured below  the multipart'd interface  http   puu sh gj9u1 1ac554560d png the new interface terminal count  http   puu sh gj9v5 5daa9cc608 png again  only that single change is made  back to the normal interface  http   puu sh gj9xx 64b3709599 png and the new interface terminal count  http   puu sh gj9yn 47acc460b7 png  it may do this with other blocks as well  maybe even cables   however  i only tested this effect with interfaces   this is very very very bizarre to me  and it took us quite awhile to figure out why all of our interfaces weren't available 
hi  i checked this in production mode  mvn clean package  pproduction  deploy war on tomcat   and everything was fine  aplication runs and works ok   probably because dev webpack is not used    but when i returned to dev mode the problem is still there  no matter if i generate war  mvn clean package  and deploy it on tomcat or add project in eclipse to tomcat server    please notice  in my 14 1 2 log    that this is executed twice     com vaadin flow server startup devmodeinitializer   starting dev mode updaters  so frontend is compiled twice  for the first time frontend is compiled successfully but at the end dev updater and dev webpack are executed second time and frontend compilation fails 
did you mean a custom component for topbar   if so  no it doesn't have a component  it just shows a title 
i don't believe it is limited to just the euphoria rom  but i haven't tested it on any other one  i'll try cyanogenmod when i have time
thanks for fix  i've tested it and works as expected 
it's definitely a regression  can't say exactly when it started happening  but it's been at least 2 or 3 months

the conversion to a url was part of pr #85  which is the pr that started pulling proxy information from settings xml  the reason it was likely converted to a url was due to me incorrectly naming the proxy host configuration parameter as proxy url  the naming issue has been fixed and thanks to erik  the proxy host is now correctly used   on fri  aug 15  2014 at 4 29 am  erik wramner notifications github com wrote

how about something like this  http   bl ocks org mbostock 4218871  they break down polygon into lines and do simple point to line distance calc  this would require converting lat lon coordinates to a cartesian  utm  first    is this better or worse than converting circle into 32  100 point polygon with getgeometryfrom circle     for the most part i need to compute intersections on the scale of 1m   100m in the us and alaska

that is actually hard to say  because it happens with so many items  one example would be an upgraded armor set  you craft the first set like any other vanilla armor  for the second you have to put any part of the first set in the middle and an upgrade material above  the upgrade material is crafted with 9x the item  that is used for the 1st tier armor  every item needed in this process is a rpgitem that is given by playerkills or by commandblock over time   the weird thing is  that the 1st tier armor could be crafted without problems  but none of the 2nd tier armor worked  sometimes even the 1st tier armor is bugging 
i've updated the sample project to use openpdf 1 3 1   at some time i should have a try and debug the issue  but i'm not very familiar with image processing  and also with pdfs   so someone with more experience might be more efficient

before the 1 8 update  1  give yourself a custom mobspawner   give player mobspawner mobvalue 1   where mobvalue is the mob network id  for instance pig is 50 2  place the mobspawner 3  essentials will check if a mobspawner has been placed  check the placed items datavalue  in this case 50  and then change the mob on the placed mobspawner  this is no longer possible  as the data value can no longer be stored in mobspawner items in your inventory  giving yourself a custom spawner will simply reset the data value to 0

thank you i'm testing it 
sure  here are screenshots of the channel screen and the ap screen notice that there is no entry on the top of the screen showing the ap i'm connected to  even though i am definitely connected  the network is ipv6 only     screenshot_20171107 195143  https   user images githubusercontent com 4332910 32531018 6ecfc9cc c3f6 11e7 999d cf9b4f344a89 png    screenshot_20171107 195124  https   user images githubusercontent com 4332910 32531019 6eedcc38 c3f6 11e7 8fea 2782877c491b png 
i used vaddin chart 1 1 9 and vaddin version is 7 6 5 you  also can reproduce in newest version  you should create a chart and use  containerdataseries set visible false 
with   i   of course    i’ve opened #6199 
hi  no  as i mentioned  it doesn't happen on my galaxy nexus   but it's obvious by looking at the code that it relies on the order in which getview   is called for the various rows    since the caches are just queues  fifo   if called out of order  they can end up with more than one item which are not retrieved in the right order causing this problem   this doesn't seem to happen on my device  but it happens reproducibly did on my tester's device   my "fix"  which is a huge hack  throws away the cache if any of them end up with more than one item   in effect  the cache just because a single variable 
it is in a unbuilt rocket on top of a liquid fuel tank  lastest version of ar in 1 10 2 i place the seat then right click it  the rocket has not been built by the assembler yet  and then i push lshift to dismount and i get thrown into the void 
the issue occurred with both the the sawmill which requires power and only when it was in use  and the igneous extruder which does not even require power   the crash log contains the following details on the version   thermalexpansion 3 0 0 0   thermal expansion  thermalexpansion 3 0 0 0 jar enderio 0 5 6   ender io  enderio 1 6 4 0 5 6 142 jar 
i can confirm that i can create a file with path length   260 from  cmd exe  using the        prefix 
in the new version i can't reproduce the error  so i closed the issue   
hi martin  thanks for the interest  yes  i added  extra_java_opts " dgnu io rxtx serialports  dev ttyusb0"  into the   etc default openhab2  file   it wasn't there before but i added it after reading through the messages on the openhab forum   this doesn't solve the problem though  the error isn't wrong   none of my rfxcom items get updated  i also thought about dual connections but that doesn't seem to be the case    i was already running the rfxcom binding in debug mode   here's some of the log
i tried to reproduce the exception  but i couldn't anymore   in the meanwhile i had updated to 2 5 0 m4   for the ibuttons it is an expected behavior that they are not connected  therefor it is not en error if they aren't connected  nevertheless offline is correct   the state still is not available in my items  it is always null  the thing itself is online   here are my current definitions and the trace log 
well  as i stated before  the utility worlds mod adds the ability for players to craft portals to their very own private mining  garden  or void worlds   every time that a new portal is created  so is a dimension  similar to mystcraft   this is not such an issue with the mining worlds  however  the garden worlds are only 5 blocks deep  4 blocks of dirt grass and 1 of bedrock   your mod is biting chunks out of those dimensions leaving gaping holes to the void when it tries to generate the lush caves because there is not enough depth for them to generate   the utility worlds mod author is at a loss as to how it can be blocked   i have seen mods in the past retain the ability to use either a whitelist or a blacklist so the server operators can decide which they need to use for their modpack servers based on the mods included in the pack  this is usually in the form of a simple config option that allows you to choose 1 for blacklist or 2 for whitelist and they utilize the same list in the config of dimensions for either one   i am not asking you to remove the blacklist for players that need them  but it is not very useful for anyone using the utility worlds mod or any other mod that allows for dimensions to be added at any time   as it stands  if i add say dimensions 5  6 and 7 to the blacklist today  by tomorrow i may need to add 2 or 3 more and restart the server for the list to take affect and by then the damage may already be done  you want to talk about annoying  that's rather annoying as well   perhaps then if you can't be bothered to add a simple whitelist  then you can make it so that lush caves do not generate in dimensions added by utility worlds mod by default which would also solve the issue of the gaping holes in the ground   it's ultimately your mod either way and at least i can turn them completely off for the server    utility worlds mod  https   minecraft curseforge com projects utility worlds    other users with same issue  https   minecraft curseforge com projects utility worlds comment 54     2016 09 17_18 48 33  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1578429 18611444 7d757d0a 7d07 11e6 8c62 8ef6a79e2f7d png     2016 09 17_18 48 56  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1578429 18611445 8b82bffc 7d07 11e6 9e1f b2686586da11 png 
i using gradle 4 4  and i just upgrade to gradle plugin 3 1 2 today from 3 1 1  it's failing when i execute    gradlew  mymodule assemblerelease  from the command line 
thanks  danglotb for helping me  everything does build fine now but i still encounter some issues during the  mvn test   see  error_debug_log  https   github com stamp project dspot files 739255 error_debug_log txt    i'd be glad to provide any relevant info   
ah  sorry axel  my apologies if i am  i didn't realise there was two different editions  i presume we're on the community edition  i've pulled the 5 0 7 artifacts down from the mvnrepository com 
i can't see the visual representation of how full the tank is  waila   functionality works fine

hello  when i first implemented an exception handler for the 0 13 0 release of java object diff i was fighting with lot of exceptions raised when comparing hibernate envers revision entities  i needed the proxied objects to get lazy associated entities to compare  so i couldn't detach them from session but  at the same time  the diffing tree invariably reached proxy attributes that raised errors when called to be compared  the exception messages were not usefull to clearly identify failing attributes because the complete node paths was missing in the exception message  so i wrote a listener  originally a single interface for both circular and read write errors  to log offending node paths  in the meantime i reached a quite stable solution using attributes exclusion both with builder exclusions configuration and annotating entities with  objectdiffproperty  even if i don't like very much the annotations which pollute my persistent model with diff engine implementation details  i think the diffnode is indeed an essential information to pass to the exception listerners 
i was facing this issue in preview 5 version as well   this is a problem on ios as well and i am using the rest api to complete the room
hi radu   i am so sorry for late answer   i am still using oxygen 17 1 and i am planning to move to you new one   version  19 00  i have been check the libraries in 17 1 and it is pointing to commons io 2 4 jar  so we can close this ticket   once again thanks for hint 
this is so i can use meld rather than the default diff tool when using perforce  here is the full excerpt from my  bashrc  i was missing some single quotes in the command i sent through

what i can tell you is that issue #321 seems to be fixed and we are not having any crashes related to the screenshot feature  this issue can now be closed 
i am using firefox but i also couldn't reproduce it now

yes  i prefer the latter  too  even better if you can clone the clientinfo object and set the mediatype in the clone as the only one mediatype  so that the original client preferences remain unchanged as javadoc says for the clientresource get mediatype  method overload 
aravind's theory may be correct  i also tested it on galaxy s2 its working alright  btw os version on my s3 is 4 1 1
i checked and there is nothing in the "regular expression pattern remover" configuration  i also did some further testing   the script appears to run fine when i send it to the machine   it is only when i attempt to test the code using the  c option that i get the errors   usually it is either error code 20 or error code 1   see below  the ugs program then hangs up and i have to disconnect and reconnect to the router to get the ugs program to respond again  the problem does not always occur at the same place in the code  and  rarely  perhaps once or twice  the script has completed successfully in test mode     example   error 20  unsupported or invalid g code command found in block       pausing file transfer         error 20  unsupported or invalid g code command found in block   error 1  g code words consist of a letter and a value  letter was not found       pausing file transfer         error 1  g code words consist of a letter and a value  letter was not found  ok

it was not working without kryoserializer as well and was throwing similar exception as with spark serializer as kryo   i have getters and setters in my actual code for all the fields but i haven't pasted that here    is this because of array of objects within an object   is that supported with default serializer  
i wouldn't mind it  i'm thinking about getting rid of the fossils mod because i already have jurrasicraft  which works just fine with jewelrycraft just fine  i can also message them to see if they can make it more compatible with your mod too

initalizing the client works seamlessly  it connects with the provided consul address to the cluster  connection established   and connection stays if no sniffer is used    then the node sniffer kicks in and does its round  parsing the response from the nodes endpoint  here it receives the publish_address in the es7 format hostname ip port  the json parser inside the node sniffer parses the value into a string and creates a new uri   here it fails  everything after the slash is considered as a path  the port is neglected and an uri with hostname and port 80   1  is created  the sniffer returns the new found nodes  updates the client  no connection anymore   i will provide the settings file of our cluster if necessary

the call is just "mvn sonar sonar"  but we have some magic in our parent pom which sets the sonar branch name if git_local_branch is available  but as this is not set in my local test environment there should be no sonar branch name at all  the nullpointer source line indicates that the branch is null  which matches this

it looks as if the problem comes from a missing port in the defaultzone configuration  this was my configuration       i have a repro project here   https   github com snussbaumer spring cloud netflix issue 840  without the port  the url is changed to http   172 17 0 2  1 eureka  and later in  apachehttpclient4handler gethost    request geturi   gethost   returns null  it looks as if there is some parsing error somewhere  because the uri host is null  but the authority is ok and contains "172 17 0 2  1"  i have a workaround  so i'm allright now  but i think if would be nice if this was corrected or documented somewhere

both seems fine  waiting would be neat but not necessary
the regression test also passes in my case  the problem is that the test checks if functions with a certain suffix are present in the cg  reachable is also a suffix for also_reachable  the test finds the same cgnode for these suffixes 
here is a gif a player made  no it does not matter where they stand  it is very weird  as i said i have tested as op its fine  then i de op and set myself as a low rank and i can re produce it 100  of the time   https   imgur com a idxrkm8

no it started occurring with the version you released yesterday titled "plenty of bug fixes " last night i updated to your latest version and it is still occurring 
thank you for your fast response      i do see it every time i close the idea window   maybe this is also important   i have 2 projects opened  2 different windows   one which has a dependency to camel and one which does not  when i close the project which is not dependent on camel  the error message appears in the project which is dependent on it
i see  but did you try to connect again after turn off on with device being discoverable  because my problem is that when bluetooth turns on i call  establishconnection  and then it hangs   i am using nexus 6p  android n preview 4    this is the code 
perhaps they are vengeance spirits  i'm not sure of the nomenclature  i can assure you that the ghosts are not part of another mod   the ghosts which i'm discussing are the semi transparent clone entities that appear after you kill a mob with the evilcraft mod  ie if you kill a pig  it'll spawn a semi transparent pig with altered sound effects  normally these "ghosts" are only visible if you're in creative mode or using an item from evilcraft in survival   i haven't been seeing either the expected ghosts or the glitched dragonflies myself  the provided screenshot shows what one of my users has seen   a mysteriously appearing dragonfly that i theorize is a mistakenly identifying the ghost entity type as another id  the dragonfly   since the entity takes the form of whatever it was killed when a living mob was slain that's the best guess i've got   again of course i'm no expert  this seems to be exclusive to evilcraft and doesn't happen with it removed   though i have no doubt that it is due to an interaction conflict bug with another mod   if i provided a console log would that be at all helpful  like i said it isn't causing crashes or anything  its purely a cosmetic issue  i will keep an eye on the console in the mean time and see if anything catches my eye 
 serge rider my point is that this situation should be handled same as https   github com dbeaver dbeaver issues 6463    
i was moving  console say that vlader97 moved too quickly  but i could not repeat it   the error shows up randomly 
is it related to spring boot used in another modules  anything i can check   пн  9 сент  2019 г   13 45 alexey loubyansky  notifications github com  
 lucko sure  i've updated to 4 1 16   4 1 16  https   i imgur com fyrf4jj png   same error 
  open a normal json file  like tsconfig json or package json for example   set the cursor to the end of the file   hit 4 or 5 times enter   save the file   error occurs 
no  for example during echange but it works even with this error 
here's how 6 2 4 looked   i've highlighted over maximize as it makes the bug easier to see     screenshot 20191125092331 1606x885  https   user images githubusercontent com 38067056 69528087 82df3080 0f65 11ea 8bae 4e5a59f2e4c3 png   this might be a swt bug

hi  iref   thank you for your suggestion  i prefer to do filtering is a behaviour that leads to a defined result  throwing should be the least alternative  breaking the program at runtime is not a good idea   i'm looking forward to your contribution         daniel
hi  saudet    can confirm that also happens on javacv 1 4 1     please let me know if you have any other questions or need any further info  thank you very much in advance for your help  cheers 
sorry for the late response  i haven't had the chance to test it before  it is still not working and i think that the issue is that bluetooth state receiver is unregistered once bluetooth is turned off  meaning the new code won't be called in case described in the issue    close    is called once bluetooth is turned off  https   github com nordicsemiconductor android ble library blob 135a7774e26d7bae61c13d584c8905c5c737fee5 ble src main java no nordicsemi android ble blemanager java#l207 l249 and that method is unregistering bluetooth receiver  https   github com nordicsemiconductor android ble library blob 135a7774e26d7bae61c13d584c8905c5c737fee5 ble src main java no nordicsemi android ble blemanager java#l729 l736

yes sometimes later it usually goes back from blue      i have also setup git so it won't count crlf as change   
yup  i've edited my report with a link 
the update task does nothing in my project  there is quite a difference between the code installed by ml 9 0 5 and the master branch in the github project  i am going to look at this again now to see if i can resolve

yep  it's the same error in the title of this issue    nice  yes  those install steps appear to work  two points of feedback on the docs  1  it might be worth calling out that if you do those manual pod steps you'll still have to setup android manually  2  i'm uncomfortable with the  post_install do  installer   step since it appears to unlink the react base pod  what's the point of this step  also  the project still builds if i remove that step

i use single user che and stack 2gb but i would like to know the real figures for multiuser configuration as soon as possible  could you provide some basic resourse consumption grid for different che flavors taken into account that our customer projects may require up to 1g memory for some lsp servers and builders  i struck the memory consumption barrier too early  could we disscuss the concept of resourse allocation by fabric8 for pods  with resourse limits off line

no worries      nope  same stacktrace  stepping through code in debug mode it looks like contextmanager getcurrentcontext   in gestalt asset core ends up with a null context  somehow in this scenario it isn't getting a hold of a legacymusic module reference  probably i just don't know that part well enough and it may not matter   that then gets passed into assetmanager getasset  still in gestalt  where it provides an empty  ""  modulecontext to the resolve method  seems to handle it ok   eventually we indeed get caught in a finally block under eventsystemimpl bytecodeeventhandlerinfo invoke then pass through the exception handler      and then the game doesn't crash  it just gracefully continues after throwing the stacktrace  try again without debug mode leaving the game window inactive and it again didn't crash  huh  then try two more times  one leaving the window active while the crash happened and another while i had the window up with the menu active while working in another window and it still crashed   confusing   bigger copy paste with a full crash     ran it through debug again but with an immediate resume after my breakpoint came up and it crashed again  race condition of some sort maybe   pinging  flo if interested in maybe checking it out  if the context stuff looks right    can probably reproduce it faster if hacking all the music prefabs to fail rather than wait on spatialwinds

hikari bean config    i verified the properties values being loaded correctly 
i think  generating uuid each time when an instance of multipartcontent is created is a very little overhead  having any static string value publicly available will significantly increase the likelihood of being included into someone content    at least it's possible   with a random value it's very unlikely to repeat that value

you mean flip arguments to an operator  i tried something like that before  but i always cleared the variable cards when i was done with an experiment 
okay  i skimmed your code before   you have a lot of try catch exception with classcastexception    i will clone your library   to see which one needs to be modified  at the moment i don't have my pc  but i will do it later today

yes the plugin prints some information into the build log but all these logs are correct  the message i want to print contains the pr_number which is for each build correct but the link where it comments my comment is not logged  i can't figure out any details here    so thats basically my problem the environment variables and the parameters are fine   what about the build xml   ps  using 0 1 0 rc11

someone else installed zowe on the mainframe   they do not know the eureka port   how can we determine the url for the eureka service on the mainframe 
as in "packets sent to the server are seemingly not recieved or processed"   i've even tried with the examples  cpu instantly goes to 100  
no_connection should in fact be included in the algorithm above  it is merely a last resort  basically the try catch around everything     this would allow a more detailed control in the operations  the  test    method would have to run more tests though 
at present  graph spectrum needs a tuning panel to retrieve the note from  it can't retrieve one fingering object from an xml view     you aren't likely to see this problem with the other tools  because i don't know how to provoke an exception  or an early exit  from any of them   by rights  graph spectrum should be greyed out when the xml view is shown  because getselectedfingering is returning null  but for that to happen  widesigner  would have to call studyview  updateactions    which is currently protected  when it calls xmltoggleview  toggleview

i cannot tell you the version number but no  not today's version  i shifted to the nightly build about 3 days ago  so it might be the version before the one you published today to the play store 
mathieu  i am not sure about the exact error location  it would be easy fix once we figure it out    the error occurs in ui level  and the user is prevented from adding a new constraint  i haven't been making any changes in this area  did you make any changes that might affect constraints 
if i'm sorry  i've been busy  i close this   the only thing i would like you to look at is the essentialsx option  "allow direct hat"  which defaults to true  which allows you to make this bug in survival mode  even if you only have to set it to false

thank you for the reply   1  yes  i am seeing the issue only on galaxy tab s2  i tried it also on galaxy s5  android version 6 0 1  and nexus 9  android version 7 0  and just noticed that selection of higher video tracks are disabled  2560x1440 and 3840x2160  on these devices  on galaxy tab s2 these video tracks are available and i see same issue when selecting one of them manually   2  i must have tried reproducing the issue with unprotected short video before because i just managed to reproduce the issue with shorter widevine protected video            "name"  "dash gpmfv6 h264 encrypted"          "uri"  "http   media axprod net dash gpmfv6 h264 encrypted manifest mpd"          "extension"  "mpd"          "drm_scheme"  "widevine"          "drm_license_url"  "https   drm widevine licensing axtest net acquirelicense"          "drm_key_request_properties"              "x axdrm message"  "eyj0exaioijkv1qilcjhbgcioijiuzi1nij9 eyj2zxjzaw9uijoxlcjjb21fa2v5x2lkijoinjllntqwodgtztllmc00ntmwlthjmwetmwvinmrjzdbkmtrliiwibwvzc2fnzsi6eyj0exblijoizw50axrszw1lbnrfbwvzc2fnzsisimtlexmiolt7imlkijoin2yzyze0ntutowe0zs00odc4ltgyzdetywq3yjyyytyxmdzjin1dfx0 qgt0i2hzmntyfq9tk3p2u2s1pruygb12rsb3g6ebblq"              i did not find any default demo app videos to match requirements  protected video that would have several video tracks  one of which would need to be higher than device resolution   therefore i could not reproduce the issue with default demo videos 
tl dr   it mostly depends on the volume of the tracks song i'm listening to  some tracks i had the volume increased using easymp3gain  they're the troublesome ones  as lowering the media volume via the button on the side of the phone  will also lower the volume of the announcement by opentracks  with some other songs the volume of the song is similar to the volume of the announcement in opentracks so when the media player output is lowered it's  easier to hear the ot announcement  still i would increase ot's volume a bit if i could   especially during rides     i did a few tests and realized in opentracks the volume of the media player output was only lowered not muted entirely    muted as no sound but the announcement  similar to tasks or osmand     i think i noticed a slight difference between odyssey and vlc  to the benefit of odyssey  but it's hard to tell because it change on a song to song basis as described above  in both media player volume is only lowered not silenced though   when i poked around the sound settings in the parameter's menu of the phone   four separate volume settings   ringtone   media   notifications   system     i noticed that in tasks the announcements are channelled through the notifications one   in osmand user can choose where they want the voice guidance to go to through in settings navigation settings choose a specific profile  under voice select voice guidance output and choose   while in opentracks it's through the media output thus i can set the volume separately for media player and announcements for tasks but for opentracks the volume is changed for both media player and announcement through the media setting   or the button on the side of the phone for that matter  
yes  using the default encryption module 
so from your experiment we can conclude that a value was printed which had a different in memory representation than the reference value  hypotheses     an equals method which was implemented wrongly  producing false where it should have produced true       this may happen sound like something about annotations went wrong  but that would have been the inverse situation i believe   equals  should include annotations  and isequal not        we forgot to override  equals and hashcode  somewhere  like in one of those annotation or keyword parametere wrapper classes      we have a rarely triggered bug in an existing equals method  let's say one of the locations or the datetime implementations

the missing input file is because you need need to prebuild the compiler via  scripts prebuild binaries sh  or build with    define yaspl_bootstrap true  to actually build the main compiler using the bootstrap compiler  my bad for missing that in the instructions   it looks like it is still broken with 0 18 0

i mean  its clearly a bug   it should be fixed once and for all   that said  if you have any advice on how to mitigate it in a clean and java friendly way  i'm here to listen and to learn 
so  after a restart the mediator sees the state as open which is what i would have expected  i only closed bob's ticket so it is probably a ui bug somewhere where it marked both rows as closed even though only alice's should have been closed   i've updated the description to make it more clear what actions i took 
yeah  i'll try to see if i can create a small app that reproduces this

none that isn't normal  i hover around 25 30ms latency   i think it may have had something to do with how fast i was breaking the block  because when i turned off my haste ii  it didn't happen anymore 
it doesn't happen with schematics  i must've not written the title correctly at 4 am  xd i meant that some blocks have a chance to tesselate  for example i crash instantly when joining a server because one of the stairs stone bricks tesselates  sometimes from someone placing a block  it tesselates  but personally i never saw it happen from me placing a block nor schematics 
yeah  it has been fixed a while ago 
i tried the workaround  and it works well   btw  the brave library only depend on zipkin2  so i thought we can replace with zipkin2 completely  but it seems difficult

ah  so you're saying that only pipe wire inputs will cause sided outputs  yeah  that'll work 
if client always request this abnormal message  it will cause the edge service to die the log will print exception info  too many open files

hello  sockeqwe  i want to keep the presenter on a configuration change  that's why i call  setretaininstance true    i just tried without calling  setretaininstance true    the presenter is not retained anymore on a configuration change  and i'm still having the same issue   if i return to fragment a  by pressing back or popping the back stack   the presenter is recreated anyway  so that's why i set  keeppresenterandviewstateonbackstack  to false   issue #265   i also noticed if you remove fragment a from the back stack  go "up"   then fragment b c call  detachview retaininstance true    i currently have worked around this by calling  detachview false   manually in the fragment's  ondestroy     is this a bug   thanks for your help  thomas
 aaaaalbert  the method "_enable  " for the bluetooth sensor will be called when the user enables it on the settings  right  when the bluetooth is off at that time  the sensor won't start scanning  however  if the sensor is enabled by the user and she turns off the bluetooth  for example  when the battery of the device is low   the scantask callback will not be removed and keeps scanning  you can confirm this by looking at the logcat following the scenario i proposed  you should be able to see "restart bluetooth scanning" message on the logcat every 10 seconds  which is the scan interval for bluetooth sensor     sure  i'll submit a pull request related to this issue

this is for nomorerecipeconflict mod  i am using it as a simple gate before a costly recipe look up  for optimization sake  i don't think this method has any effect outside crafting  you could imagine a modded recipe that first check this method of the inventory  the recipe would work in vanilla crafting table  but not yours  as opposed to other inventory in blocks  where not implementing isempty   may bring issues with hoppers

it gives the right output    strange   but for some reasons  it doesn't gives the items edit tested this   on death of player       loop items in victim's inventory           remove loop item from drops          add loop item to  inventory  name of victim      on respawn      loop  inventory  name of player           broadcast " debug  loop index   loop index   loop value   loop value "   edit2  http   paste md 5 net sedufirife vhdl  github code just broke the format   no output   
there are reasons to do this and this actually is an issue on a production server so this is relevant and not just a theoretical case 
the weird thing is that i have dropped the stored caches and reloaded a couple today and the position on the live map is now accurate  the original stored caches were uploaded from a gpx file with other caches a couple of days ago  i will need to see whether this was a problem relating to storing many  60  caches at one time    i'll keep playing with the software and see if i can replicate the problem  meantime the bug has resolved itself

i have only tested a couple of videos  as not all videos crash   but when using ffmpeg exe direct it does not crash  it just cannot process the videos   the behavior is strange  some corrupt videos will crash the javacv straight away  others crash when we use multiple videos instances but do not crash if we load them as a single file   it seems that when we pass the video and time to extract the frame from  it is after this point it crashes  it seems to be a crash with the codec used inside javacv  i have tried adding catch code  in a try catch block  so that if for some reason javacv cannot extract a frame or a codec issue appears it then should return an error without crashing but this does not work and it still crashes   i think we need to find a way to stop javacv from crashing  which then crashes the whole java application  when an exception like this occurs  do you have any suggestion on how we can add code to stop javacv crashing  or if errors like these occur  then we get back some indication an error occurred  the process stops  but does not crash   we have managed to stop some types of corrupt video crashing the application  but we have to get each video  look at the error  then try to add code for each error which is too bigger tasks as many videos crash in many different ways  we need to find a solution so that if javacv crashes or cannot work  it does not crash and returns an error

the only entry in the bug report is the xtandem command  there are no errors  it looks like it sends the command and then tandem starts but doesn't really do anything  the window just scrolls "g" along the left edge and nothing else  when i run tandem from the sg folder from the command line  it also scrolls that "g" and never finishes    i've narrowed it down to something in the parameter file  i started playing around with running tandem alone from the sg folder and from the tandem that i downloaded separately and using the tandem default_input xml  both ran fine until i used the parameters_searchgui xml file instead    i downloaded a fresh copy of sg  created a very basic parameter set  and it seems to be running  and interestingly  there is no scrolling "g" as it runs  maybe that is some way it shows it is in error    now i have to add back in my modifications and other settings and see if it continues to run ok  this time it finished in 18 minutes instead of sitting 3 days       so the problem is solved  but i am still not sure what the cause was  maybe something got corrupted in that parameter file and tandem wasn't smart enough to send an error back so both were just stuck   angela

the build you've posted seems to restore the ability to place turrets on the ceiling and fire them  as well as dealing damage to players  thanks so much for working on it   the turrets don't seem to damage mobs at all  hostile or otherwise and i have yet to be able to try this on another player   though it can certainly kill me   is there some intended functionality that i'm not seeing in the documentation   you're totally correct on the rolldoor texturing  i applied a dye and it showed up like magic  my apologies   the energy turret icon is still missing from my hotbar and nei  but it doesn't affect the functionality

i haven't had a chance to try the master code yet but i did scan through the class and it looks like the push   method is now applying the mapping before eaching the values  once i get a chance to check i'll confirm 100  but in principal  it should be fixed   
here are latest test results  this time it looks like stably reproducible   this time  i downloaded the app from play store on a physical device with android 6 0 1  followed this procedure  1  initial settings of the app    2  tap "take photo" button    3  enter title and description    4  tap "share" button  saw a crash  file was not uploaded   after the crash  i manually gave the app the "storage" permission  the next attempt  2   3   4   went fine   and then  i manually revoked the app's permission  and the crash would happen again under the same procedure  2   3   4     by the way  i am seeing the same crash pattern on emulator  with the build of the current master branch  as well after i turned off the storage permission 
that might be   i will double check
yes  i used the latest version which was released about hour ago   i tried to add 3 different apps  and any of them makes app crash 
thanks  it works now  i think the lib treated the file as corrupt because there is an empty line at the end of the file unless i deleted it manually by a text editor

sorry i am reading my description and is too vague  let me add this is by doing a query for my user  and not for the individual package  if npm stats is retrieving all repos for a user there is an assumption that all those have statistics  but for new packages  even after a few days  this assumption is not true as there are no statistics  and one package makes the entire query fail  so in the case of an errored package  it might be good to make it more exception safe 
i was outputting to  vcf gz     i reran the command to output to just  vcf and it runs without error    this is the case for the file that i augmented with what the sed command was meant to do  otherwise  the command errors  i think the tool should be able to take collectsequencingartifactmetrics whether run using picard or gatk  i say this since folks may have these metrics from old runs before the as of yet available picard tools in the gatk jar 
i'm using 1 9 3 on the standard launcher at the moment  i'll try updating the mod to see if that fixes it 
i simply have the comment within a test java class that looks like below and add spaces change a letter  then save and it will continually happen  it's possibly some of the settings i have may be interacting with the saves causing it to happen more often than it should 
yeah  it was in the latest version of the plugin  revert back to 1 5 03

hi  saudet   here is the code 
yes  our home server hosted locally 
 khotyn  the problem is described as follows   org springframework beans factory listablebeanfactory#getbeannamesfortype  is a common method invoked frequently when refresh spring application context  such as autowire constructor injection  this method is used to get bean names according to the specified type  it will scan all bean definitions and fetch bean type    if this bean is a  factorybean    spring ioc will generate a shortcut instance early stage of bean instance   generally  the shortcut instance will return the type of object that this  factorybean  creates  however  if null is return  the shortcut instance will fall back to full creation  it may be lead to some problems  once the  factorybean  is fully created  then the subsequent  beanpostprocessor  would not apply this  factorybean   such as  smartinstantiationawarebeanpostprocessor

for me at least  if i use the apply operation with a 1 parameter operator  and specify a fixed value in the second slot  the result is a 0 parameter operation   i e  i have an operation variable that accepts an entity and returns an nbt value  if i use it in an apply with an entity variable  the resulting variable can be placed in a display to see the result  it seems it can also be used again in an apply

hi   i m unable to recollect exactly what the errors where  but it was something like this   cannot create home  username   local        filename   extension  no such file of directory   i think  in the script  you would have written where the files have to be copied relative to the current directory from where the   install sh was run  this caused an error maybe my system problem  as it couldn't 'cd' into proper directories and copy the main files  on mon  may 28  2018  6 07 pm matthijs kooijman  notifications github com  wrote

hi  flaurite  sorry  there is an important detail i missed in original ticket description  commit happens in  done    method  thus my complaint in regard of  localizedtaskwrapper  is directed towards implementation of  done    and  cancelled    method with try catch block  exception is caught and is shown in a non user friendly fashion in comparison to globally defined application exception handlers

hm  from what i see you are using a very old version of jaxb and when i see it correctly  since several versions it is already included in java8  https   docs oracle com javase 8 docs api javax xml bind jaxb html  and also have a look here https   jaxb java net 2 2 11 docs release documentation html#a 2 2 11  there seems to be a sample somewhere which inlcudes some namespace stuff  look also here  this is a newer gradle plugin  https   github com ewerk gradle plugins tree master jaxb2 plugin

the question is that if it happens with other primitives too  at this case right know  using inputstream or multipartformdata would be better for file uploading  but this older project had byte    d hope it will be fixed soon

using latest windows 10  eclipse running on java 1 8 0_181  i've re enabled "egradle project decorator" an i do not get this error anymore in startup log  but i removed some plugins since my initial post  so it could be that    i'd say that if you cannot think of an obvious cause for the stack trace i posted  don't spend too much time on it 
here we go     ans i guess you are right with your assumption
it is fixed  thanks    
yes   i'm using the chcp cli tool  it just happened again on my config js file   starting to think it's with generated files somehow  my css file is generated from a preprocessor and some gulp tasks updated the config file  the other 20 some odd files that i manually updated match   it's almost as if generated files from windows get a different hash from the objective c function  i've verified all files from the server match the hash in the manifest

as a matter of fact  it is  however  in theory  shouldn't the  recombinator  work for any population size greater than or equal to 2  i noticed that even with a population size of 50 and an offspring fraction of 0 5  it sometimes still produced one such instance every generation where an individual is recombined with itself  it seems that with the current implementation  there is always a chance  smaller as the population size is increased   this situation occurs  at  retest  https   retest de   we use jenetics to implement our genetic algorithm with the goal of optimizing test suites for multiple objectives  the population we currently deal with is relatively small  the altered offsprings are evaluated each time which is expensive  hence  we would like to avoid this situation   can the current selection mechanism within the  recombinator  class be improved  we would be glad to help

okay  it's not a problem with  remotespringapplication  itself  but if you have  spring cloud starter config  on the classpath and configure  spring cloud config failfast true  in  bootstrap yml  then autoreconfiguration of some other spring boot projects  in my case  spring boot starter actuator  or  spring boot starter ws   will try to connect to the config server somewhere and crash the  remotespringapplication  because of failfast true

hello claudio this would be a nice to have   however  the device details screen is super critical for us   we are starting to depend on consistency in this screen for in field issues  hence we are want to try and report issues as we see them thanks   on thu  oct 11  2018 at 3 24 pm alberto codutti  notifications github com  wrote

i installed the app version 20171208 from f droid and everything worked fine  later i uninstalled the app and reinstalled version 20171213 from https   download nextcloud com android dev  and this broke "only upload on wi fi"  then i uninstalled 20171213 and reinstalled 20171208 from f droid because that one worked  recently f droid updated the app to 20171213 and broke this once again 
i tried to reproduce it but wasn't able to  it seems the issue has been fixed  last time i remember seing it was 2 or 3 weeks ago  since  we moved our frontends to n1 standard 2 instances  maybe it's linked   i let you close the issue if you want to  i'll reopen it if i see it again in the future   thanks 
yeah   version is 0 2 5  latest  and using android platform   for now i've changed my local copy so line 121 always assigns 'billingproducttype inapp' since i'm not using subscriptions   the same issue occurs on line 158 too   it looks like it's taking in a string from the 'product' json response and assigning it to billingproduct's 'type' field   'billingproducttype' enum  without conversion   the compiler isn't complaining because  fromiterable treats the input as dynamic so it doesn't know 'product' is a list of strings   i'm not sure the best way to convert string to enum in dart  but this seems to work   billingproducttype values firstwhere  e     e tostring    product 'type'   
i can't share the project  however i can reproduce it with a barebone project  which i've pushed here    https   notabug org zsombor che test  i can't see the exception  but the error message about the missing classes are there 
here is the feature list    i'll need to check to make sure we can share the classloading trace in the open 
yeah  latter i've noticed that the class being in the wrong place doesn't break the build  but the class can be found at  https   github com internetarchive heritrix3 blob fbb0173459b698b1bb9fcedf4ea3c4ac7b5f0cf6 contrib src main java org archive util onelinesimplelayout java

ok  i made a new link   https   pastebin com zw4wpark
2 0 1 b354 i downgraded to an older version and  ci worked  then re upgraded and now it's working oddly 
nothing  it's broken  it doesn't work  it should place 4 stones in the crafting table but it doesn't 
from what i understand this affected all versions 1 8 1 12  viaversion wouldn't solve this problem since viaversion doesn't work that way  i'm already using 1 12 2 spigot so obviously  there's nothing to inject there

i can't reproduce the issue of sign out now    
i apologize  you are right  i have been expecting a different behavior  i e  the marked folders being listed way further towards the top of the list    this went so far  that i didn't even notice the most bottom folder moving up one position  i guess  that if it was easy to implement a "free" folder sort order  you'd already have done this  once again sorry for the noise and thanks for this great piece of software 
it's part of the dnstechpack version 7 6 2 2 it's on the atlauncher https   www atlauncher com pack dnstechpack  to list the mods would take a while  it might easier for you to just look   i just assume this would also happen even if the mod was by itself  i hadn't tested that  before posting the issue  until just now and it doesn't seem to be doing it

hi  yes android_alarm_manager is on android x  i will try and track down the issue as well 
i tried   java 1 7  update 60  32bit   and   64bit      java 1 8  update 5  64bit   and it's same behavior on all of them  _none of them works correctly_    i spend few hours by debugging jdk and weblaf code and i manage to narrow down the problem   when propertychange listener is called  line 251 webfilechooserui class  and condition  prop equals   jfilechooser accept_all_file_filter_used_changed_property    is fulfilled then  filter  and  filters  values are obtained    filter  value contains   selected filter     setfilefilter  method  and  filters  contains   choosable filters    then the method evaluate  colected  filters and set them to the dialog  if none found  accept all file filter is set as default     that's completely fine     but  there is difference in creation of  jfilechooser  with weblaf installed and  webfilechooser  itself    when  jfilechooser  is created  it's called its own method  updateui    which on  line 1838  calls     and adds accept all file filter as   choosable   file   filter    that means  when property change listener is called the accept all file filter will be in  filters  variable     when  webfilechooser  is created   updateui    method on  line 302 webfilechooser class  is called  and this method creates  webfilechooserui  instance  which creates  webfilechoosepanel  on  line 109 webfilechooserui class  and this class on  line 306 webfilechooserpanel class  call method  setfilefilter     this method though sets accept all files filter as file   filter not as choosable   file   filter       then property change listener contains accept all files filter in  filter  variable  instead of  filters   and acts differently  smiley 
well  the remarkable thing is  that selecting a picture with c geo and selecting a picture in my mobile browser opens the same selector  when opened via c geo it shows every file except   jpg greyed out  via browser several image file types are selectable   that made me think we apply a filter or preselection when calling the file browser

hi  muffinjello  i did try the androidx migration just to find that android studio detected no androixx usage so  that warning must be misleading from flutter  finally i have managed to make it work using the below approach and honestly i am not happy with this plugin conflicts with required sdks etc  while i understand that flutter is relatively new and these plugins are generous contributions from the flutter family  they need to ensure that any flutter version upgrades don't break things line this   ok  the core issue came down to 2 plugins and esp  these versions  which i was using      flutter_webview_plugin   0 3 5 google_maps_flutter   0 5 16  so  if i just use the flutter_webview_plugin   0 3 5  i get the below errors and the apk build fails      if i use just the flutter_webview_plugin   0 3 5       it complies with below warning but does successfully build the apk   if i just use google_maps_flutter   0 5 16  i get the below warnings but it does end up building apk   i even tried to use webview_flutter   0 3 9+1 it builds the apk with below warnings     initializing gradle                                                 0 7s resolving dependencies                                              1 5s note  some input files use or override a deprecated api                  note  recompile with  xlint deprecation for details                      running gradle task 'assemblerelease'                                    running gradle task 'assemblerelease'    done                      25 7s built build app outputs apk release app release apk  5 3mb       but    if i have 2 plugins i e  google_maps_flutter   0 5 16 and webview_flutter   0 3 9+1  i again get the same big fat error about dex archives see below   and the build fails    so  in a nutshell the google_maps_flutter  0 5 16 conflicts with any of the other 2 plugins  an may be a few others which i don't use   hope this clarifies things

that if i could answer  the fission port of the other two reactors did on version 2 7 sometimes the same problem  reactor complete build up and nothing would be imported  after switching the sides of the import and export it worked  best example  the second small reactor on the first picture  same build as the first small  don't accept fuel rods too   for explanation and clarity   2 small reactors  same build  2x2x3 fission port layer 2 don't work  doesn't matter on which side i place an export bus   first reactor  moved the fission port one layer up  backside of the port don't accept fuel rods  the top of it accept it and the controller doesn't recognize the rods   second reactor  second layer  don't accept fuel rods  third layer   surprise surprise   don't accept fuel rods    now i'm confused right now cause this are the same builds   well i build the same reactor in a few minutes and i think i have the solution and where it depends on     maybe chunks  my first 2 reactors are in nearly with the interior in one chunk  the small ones aren't  the chunk border is exactly behind the controller

it means that when you call  buildproducer produce    outside of the scope of your build step  it is  probably  throwing an exception that is silently discarded   though looking at the code  there might not be a check for this after all    sure    you'll need another build step if you want to produce build items later   if you want to produce a build item earlier which represents some action that should occur later  your build item could contain a function of some sort that is executed in a later build step

i think either is fine    most people using docker are used to doing  docker run myimage  which docker translates to  docker run myimage lastest   i don't know why you would ever want to assume that  myimage  without a tag is anything other than  myimage latest  unless docker started adopting something different 
yea  but i can also only test it on an emulator  i had a real kitkat device  but i recently updated it to lollipop  
hi  i changed my setup step by step to eliminate potential culprits   1  removed guava 15 from dependencies  problem still exists 2  set max memory to 4 gb  problem still exists 3  set min memory to 4 gb  problem still exists 4  upgraded to jdk 1 8 0_92 b14  problem still exists 5  used your system err println statements  problem gone   looks like a timing issue  because the logging slows everything down  in a second test  i redirected the output to a file on a ssd with same result  the problem is gone  then i removed most of your logging statements and voila  problem is back   it smells like a race condition where you have to have bad luck with timing

hi  thanks for the answer   i'm using 1 4 1 from maven 
the fix didn’t work in a quick test of something else last night   not sure where it’s at now  but i’ll take ownership 
ok ill try to do this in creative mode
i've tried with the latest version 11 0 1  this issue is still there  and yes  it's responding on the fill area even if it has fill "none" 
i'll correct what i said  it does work when you are op but  i think you are supposed to be able to use this as a normal user by default  right     1  no it doesnt  tested   i think this only affects essentials commands  so for example i can use tab with  tell from uchat   2  luckperms  vault  protocollib  essentials  3  no errors

 knightminer singleplayer    thequadshot what i meant was that when a building block for the smeltery is placed in the smeltery multi block while it is currently smelting items  the smeltery will then drop the items it is currently smelting in front of the controller  it dropped a set of real items and phantom items  for example  if it is currently smelting an iron ore block  placing a smeltery block in the smeltery causes the smeltery to drop the iron ore block  along with another one which is a phantom item

hi harald   thanks for the email reply  i'd be happy to share it  what is the best way to do this  it is over 30mb   48000 sequences  of rhesus macaque  plasmodium vivax  and human sheep cytokeratin contaminants  and a few proteases   and includes reversed sequences  starting with xxx_ in the fasta file  from prior use of msgf+   i had to process it to remove dots  stop codons in  20 macaque protein sequences  and some keratins that were giving errors  so i'm  unfortunately  not surprised  it could be that the xxx_ entries are causing problems as well    any advice on how better to construct it would be appreciated   thanks  dave anderson  on 1 30 18  harald barsnes  notifications github com  wrote 
sorry  i meant post instead of push  the flag is also wrongly named "pushalways" instead of "postalways"   until a couple of weeks ago there was only i "save" method on the resource repository  in the v2 version there is now a "create" and "save"  so it becomes possible to distinguish "post" and "patch"  before that it just did a post  this thing now just needs to be enabled   the general issue is a bit more complicated due to the flaws in the current serialization handling  i looked into all that and think i will have a solution tomorrow that does a first cleanup in this area by having a proper representation of a json api document and moving the logic out of the serializers 
in my example project  i used 1 1 9 release 
note that this is the consequence of another issue  so it might be relatively hard to repro  i think that it was caused by https   github com eclipse smarthome issues 4871 but i'm not entirely sure  i've removed some addons from the 'binding ' line in one of the addons cfg file and it seemed to fix the issue  i'll put them back and see if the problem repro     the suggestion here was to limit the number of elements that can be contained in sitemapresource  eventoutputs

thanks hylke for the link  i tried those solutions and a few others  here are some observations 1  the jixb m2e connector does not want to install on my current version of eclipse and m2e  there seems to be some version mismatch  2  the above solutions are good to mostly ignore those build options in eclupse but not to get maven m2e plugin to include them and perform binding and packaging  also  the jixb in gsn has configuration lines to bind files in a specific directory  i tried searching online but could not find a way to include config information in  lifecyclemappingmetadata   3  i managed to run gsn from cmd using maven command after playing around with the start bat and stop bat file  that works well  i will shortly checkin the updated  bat files   the question is now  what version of eclipse  m2e and jixb converter was used to setup gsn  that way we can resort to a common operating platform 
yes  the fix will be included in 2 7 0  probably next week  if there's no issue with the release candidate

because i tried to reproduce on a vm and i can only reproduce with remote caching  the same failure happened before  it was green for a while after i updated the cache key https   github com bazelbuild continuous integration commit 2e04e41a934a64e69473d2e80899d8c11958083f  now it appears again 
yes  that is exactly the problem i encountered  failure in the compliance tests 
i tried again and looks like it only happens when i swap the head with an existing tool   in my case i started with an iron pickaxe head  made a pickaxe with it and then later swapped it with an agate head  i also double checked and it also happened with the second pickaxe

im added workaround   if  world isremote          but idk if its ok   when usig this workaround  no crashes anymore  but when press right mouse button to fire  nothing happens   maybe some incomplete client server code 
i don't mind either way   i think it would be ideal if we could do it by the phones hardware but only if it doesn't over complicate the code  otherwise i think something like fixing a max width and height would be good

tried a few different build  it breaks in #1488 as well  i just converted my server from using the built in sqllite database of mytown to a mysql server running separately and that works perfectly  if that helps any  unfortunately it's not a bug i can provide much testing feedback in as i had to get towns working for my players asap  as no towns on a pvp allowed server had the potential to be devastating for my server  if others have this issue  going from sql lite to mysql fixes it 
yes  they go off the edge   you can scroll down to see the buttons  but usual android ui is for panels that include a large text area to resize  reducing the size of the text area  to keep buttons below the text area visible when the keyboard appears  try the twitter app's post window with and without the keyboard visible   i think there's some kind of flag to control what mode the keyboard is in   disabling predictions  numeric only  etc   screenshot in your inbox in a minute  as i can't post one here afaik 
menu key on keyboard  that is between right windows and ctrl   the key is quite convenient  as apposed to the mouse  to speed up work 
nope it doesn't work even using the jar manually   the problem is that when the   taskmanager   has the focus it doesn't work   but when it is unfocused then it works         example code

i think  fadefx is correct  macrodroid and libtretask uses notification  personally i don't like the notification service   but an optional settings is enough for those who facing issue like this   they can enable notification service to keep alive the app 
 maggiolo00  typically this happens after the database was opened  and records were inserted to some classes  by which lucene indexes got updated  when i do a 'gracefull' shutdown then  the above error appears nearly always in the logfile 
hi vladak    there are no tomcat  warning  logs   the java securitymanager is not active   indexing and tomcat run under the same user   all dirs are readable  i am now using apache tomcat 8 5 13 i have added  some debug printf to the list jsp to see if tomcat can read the corresponding dirs and can verify that i get a response  e g   happy easter anyway

nope  i am loathe to fix this bug because all the regression numbers will change slightly  punting for now 
there is only one log as this is the first node that should start correctly  situation is    the database directory is remaining from a v2 0 15 and is copied with no change to v2 1 5   the node name set for this first node is new  following the startup log  where you see        i removed name of db classes

yes  if it's for dart i think get rid of it   any absolute positioning stuff will break with this flag running and the kind of people that need it will know how to add the arguments themselves 
 vrallev i will provide a sample to reproduce   i agree this should work  in fact  our original way of canceling the job was the following     but looking at the library code  i realized that in this line  jobmanager  285  https   github com evernote android job blob master library src main java com evernote android job jobmanager java#l285  the  includestarted  parameter is assigned to  false   so  i assumed that that was the problem to cancel the job  because i was calling the method inside a running job and  therefore   getalljobrequestsfortag       was returning an empty set   that's the reason we are using  jobmanager instance   cancelallfortag tag    directly  because this method   jobmanager  419  https   github com evernote android job blob master library src main java com evernote android job jobmanager java#l419   sets  includestarted  to  true    none of the solutions worked  obviously  another thing to say is that the usage of  includestarted  in those methods is kind of misleading and maybe a better way would be to expose this parameter in  getalljobrequestsfortag       method    anyway  maybe i could open another issue for this or provide a pr

as power source i was using two  first a solar panel tier 6 from environmental tech connected via thermal dynamics cryoducts to the chunk destroyer  arround 1 7 million rf t   which was later changed for overloaded's creative generator  which outputs 2 1 billion rf t per side  directly placed next to the chunk destroyer   i forgot to mention one thing  the chunk destroyer behaved normally in a 32x32 chunk square  but the one in the picture was way bigger  being  i think  1024x1024 chunk square  0 10 0 made that pattern  but 0 9 22 worked with those huge distances
 thatslch   no  but i disabled a reasonably big chunk of the mod  here's the config  http   asie pl ae2 644 cfg
for example  if there is an 8fe t solar flux reborn solarpanel on the battery and the battery is full then only 8 fe t will be output  without an incoming energy source  2000 will be output or what you specify in the configs 
not sure why its been implemented that way
 pierantoniomerlino  i am using 5 46  which is the latest one  but issue appeared since version 5 40 at least  currently the output looks like    knotification handle   0x004e value  2f ff ff ff c8 03   due to these extra 3 chars before  notification handle     substring keeps     0x004e value       instead of expected  0x004e value      and subsequent split takes      not  0x004e  as handle id 
the item pick does not have a filter  but if i add one to blacklist the chisel mod it works to stop the drone picking the items up  version is  pneumaticcraft 1 1 4f   running on the crash landing modpack in ftb  probably just and old version bug  i'll install the newest version and see if it happens again   i couldn't see anything related to this in your changelog  so i shared it here

yes  it should only affect people from #583   well  my idea was to reset the execution count only for scheduled backups  now i see that i didn't mention it  anyway  if you are ok with ignoring the execution count for exports  i also think it's better  i evaluated the possibility of doing so but  as the ui allows to set a maximum execution count  i didn't want to break it  but to be fair  i don't see it very useful for exports and i think we should be save from having anyone using it   i'll prepare another pull request then   
we encountered if when we used it continuously for half an hour  this cannot be consistently reproduced  please try using studio continuously and it might get reproduced 
i'd like to use it in components flagged with serializable  working on networking 
seems not  the problem is even more than that  no cdn related logic is activated at all  which is typically a build problem 
i could find the error   if i write   test assigncategory "category1"   test assigncategory "category2"    category filtering works well  but if i write   string var   "category1"   test assigncategory var    category filter does not work   i step html example  change it from  txt to  html and watch it   reporte txt  https   github com anshooarora extentreports files 68484 reporte txt 
it was the current one 
yes  i have just spoken to both players 
i will create a new image directory  it's not crashing any more on the current one  and send you a logcat 
a  no idea honestly  sorry  i'm pretty much a plug and play guy when it comes to networking  my router modem thing does show both an ipv4 and ipv6 address in the lan settings  let me know if you need a screenshot  b  not directly from the email problems  no  another app that could use a default exception is audible  doesn't show ads  but the audible store throws an error on every page if it's not blacklisted in dns66   but maybe this should just be mentioned prominently at the first start of dns66  not sure if is right now   for me it was pretty much the last thing i thought of  otherwise you're just adding and adding more apps to the default list  c  yes  receiving emails works fine now    thanks for working on this

hi snickermicker   i understand the workaround  the problem is with this items configuration  datetime date   "date and time    1 ta   1 td  1 tm  1 ty  1 tt "   ntp "europe berlin de_de"  knx "11 001 5 1 2  10 001 5 1 1"    the config transmits the time to the knx binding at a set inderval   this results in formatdatetime datetimetype datetype  string dpt  receiving dpt 10 001 with the  line 579  calendar cal datetype getcalendar    calendar instance fully populated  and from this it is supposed to extract and format a timeofday  which according to knx documentation also includes a day of week   when the code then uses 'if  cal get calendar month   2 ' to exclude the day of week formatting  it fails in march in my example since march is month 2   10 001 might not have any date information  but in order to calculate the day of week in formatdatetime for timeofday  there needs to be room for a fully populated calendar instance  hence using the calendar month for flagging 'no day' should maybe reconsidered  if the case was that the calendar never had any date information  then  line 584 return datetype format locale us  " 1 ta   1 tt"   might as well be removed   i might be overlooking something here  so please just consider this my observation and correct me if i am wrong

well the tests asks you to add set all other kinds of settings from your local settings  this is one of them  so maybe adding that field to the test explicitly makes sense    i think fixing the issue would be the appropriate action

this project has 2 flavours and a library dependency  builds nicely until i changed to put the generated drawables in the build directory     looking at this  i would think that the 'generatereleaseresources' and its respective targets and flavours would be a good spot to hook into   leaves it later in the build   its possible the clean is being done after the dependant library thats built first

then if i make a change to templates date html and refresh the browser the change is not shown   of course changes to the ratpack groovy script refresh fine   also touching the ratpack groovy script will cause the cache to be discarded so the template change will show up   i don't think changing the cachesize to default to zero is a great idea but is a reasonable workaround for simple dev purposes   the behavior i'd like to see is for the template file timestamp to be checked and compared to the cache's timestamp for that template with a switch to disable the timestamp checking   i was looking at the code and started to work up a patch  but i don't have time to finish it at the moment   i think the easiest way to implement this is to change the compiledtemplatecache to cache string  compiledtemplate  and make the key be the timestamp + separator + file path   the timestamp will just be 0 when checking is disabled   would you like me to finish the patch and submit it later or is something you want to deal with yourself

 sbernard31 sorry for the inconvenience  i think i found the reason why i've had so much trouble with this   after testing with a custom model that only has a single instance string resource  i found the following   if i request only the resource  i e   3000 0 0  it works  changing the resource to opaque  it also works   but if i request the instance  i e   3000 0  it doesn't work  independently of using a string or opaque resource 
this bit worked 
unfortunately i don't know  it did not happen in the version that was installed before  but don't ask me  what version that was  d  i think adding     to app oncreate   fixed the issue though

hi srikanth  thanks again for your quick reply   the zip file contains 28479 files in two folders  regards  peter
thank you for the tip   it worked  i didn't even see that button 
 filiphr the real mappers are quite big  it happens when you have a shared config and non existing properties  the exact conditions i need to figure out   
hey  brettwooldridge  you're right  that's a bad practice  we realized that issue recently and tried to debug it  1 total connection is not normal so i put a breakpoint where hikari tries to throw the timeout error and realized that both log entries for 30 connections and 1 connection belong to postgresql   i actually tried a bunch of different configurations for lifetime and leak detection threshold and none of them worked  most probably maximum lifetime value was 60000 in this example  i tried 60s because i thought that the socket connection might become unreliable after some time  so i was wrong when i said it uses the default configuration  it's likely that hikari tries to connect the database for 60 seconds and then expires the connection  however  when i disable hikari it works smooth and it shouldn't take 60s for hikari to connect the database   ok  i fixed the pool name issue now and restarted the server  i will paste the output when it throws the error again 
fine with the title changing   but the only reason i restart the docker desktop is because the che stops working  if i go  http   che che 161 44 255 0 nip io  browser will try load the page and eventually timeout  then retry again  and again

this is on linux with openjdk version "1 8 0_91" the launcher is version 3 2 3 1  i had a quick look at the launcher's code  it looks like you have your own code for deleting files  which looks similar to the apache commons file utils   would it be an option to use the original file utils for doing the job  if yes then i can do a quick test if this would fix the problem

i will test web service as soon as i find bad signal area  using oc with a stable and fast connection looks pretty good  so i'don't think it has anything to do with perfomance problems   the point is  of course it can take a while to load the file list  but it shoud show the "loading" animation  or "pls wait" message  or "connection failed" message  instead of freezing and crashing 
i'll try to come up with a test case when i have more time  i'll post the full stack trace for now 
thanks for your efforts  xmd5a2  the data were generated with srtm2osm  as described in a comment in the linked osmandmapcreator issue  but all ids were positive  though close to 2 63  since i wanted to use a larger area in my garmin map  i created the elevation data again for a larger area  but now with smaller ids  some 2 40 for nodes  less for ways   a smaller maximum length for ways  319   and used a fresh geofabrik extract also  now  all ids stayed constant during the process  i checked the original id in josm for one object  and the final id after osmandmapcreator process for the same object  137 439 087 617   the issue prevails   but i found a new hint  lines which are shown are open  while lines which are not shown are closed  oddly  this does not happen with building and islands consisting of circular ways   is there some "flag" required to treat closed ways as lines instead of e g  areas 
if i understand you correctly  telling ap to only use wifi  disable mobile data connection   but that you don't care for particular ones  no filter   would be rather complicated   i think there should be a "use mobile data connection" preferences  the summary tells the user that this allows mobile data to be used when wifi is not enabled and that it cannot be used together with the wifi filter  just to prevent confusion   when activated  this disables the wifi filter  because we cannot restrict android in that  then  android uses whatever connection it wants  
no  it's exactly the same machine  i only switched from coap to coaps

## i can indeed provide you with a plugin   i made a quick test only plugin that houses the customdata and minimum code to auto add it to placed tileentities and entities that meet specific criterion  and right clicking them with a blazerod will show the data tostring     showing optional empty   or optional all data lumped in string text    creative mode and specific info are displayed onlogin   the version of the customdata included is one that a  spews the complaint about the builder not implimenting abstract something on startup  b  has a list of strings to store uuids  c  has a lot of other messy code usage   every time i ask for help with it  i'm told that i "should do x a different way" based on whoever is sharing info at the time about the way they like to write particular things  'but that works too'  and much of it is cobbled from whatever snips i can piece together   the strings of uuids originated from wasting a tonne of time with raw uuids back in the days when there was no native support for uuids  and when finally cobbling code from various helpful people  was botched due to byte order switching  so i stuck with strings    i planned to change them to uuids when upgrading to 1 10 2  but i've only done so with vanilla  so it may be a simple thing i did wrong  or a complex thing that doesnt work right  but a simple switch to lists of uuids resulted in the server spamming future task errors with stacktrace not pointing to lines in my plugin   so while you may wish to criticise my choices and say "why the fudge are you using strings  you should use native uuids  you just switch x to y its not that hard" i still wait for someone to provide a proven working example since i've exhausted my attempts at it  and can't separate my bad from 'maybe its sponge' possibilities with certainty   criticising the rest of the custom data methods is fine  if some actual code is provided for "you need to   " that takes the guesswork out of getting the code to match what specifically 'needs to  '  or to say "x method does nothing at this time  we just included it for future purposes  where you commented about "why return empty here  what is this method " etc  smile    that caveat stated  i did a lot of backpeddling from making various changes thinking i was missing something  but it wasn't the various combinations of approaches that were the cause after all  and this version presented is the existing 'rollback' that was last tried  and does demonstrate the working notworking after reboot differences seen between entities and tile entities and  everything is fine working with spongeforge  phenomenon described        plugin jar file      http   www ethicraft net custdatapersisttester jar  pastebin of classes for this tester plugin  http   pastebin com e2ataamu

sorry   i did not mention the primary datasource  it says primary datasourceproperties   in my case  i'm running a multi module project  and i have multiple data sources   so  instead of 'spring datasource'  we use datasourceproperties which receives 'app datasource1' and 'app datasource2' properties     a module     some applications use only a single datasource  and some applications require multiple datasources   the application only needs to use the required datasource configuration module dependencies and write the properties   there is no problem because datasourceproperties is explicitly bound to each datasource   however  the problem is that the datasourceproperties cause a nouniquebeandefinitionexception   so i have come to the two conclusions mentioned above   1  remove enableconfigurationproperties  and datasourceproperties should be created with conditional beans  2  all datasourceproperties inserted into the spring boot auto configuration must be wrapped in an objectprovider

the code here  https   github com arquillian arquillian cube blob master openshift openshift src main java org arquillian cube openshift impl client gitserver java#l91 defines a hostport on the pod    this is something that is generally considered a bad practice  see  1    also its something that is not supported on all environments  e g  openshift dedicated   but even with plain openshift  it requires certain configuration on the user side in order for that to work  more specifically it requires that the user is associated with a security context constraint that allows host ports     so what i am suggesting  is to remove the hostport definition from the pod and use a service instead  so that we access the git server through the service  ideally we should also expose the service as a route  if possible  so that its easier to consume externally    1  http   kubernetes io docs user guide config best practices

yes  the issue in the mailing list reported by stephen wong has probably the same root cause   there  they have a restricted proxy where domain names have to be configured explicitely  in our case  the server running pushy is restricted of external dns lookup   the common problem is  that the pushy mechanism  pushy or netty  i didn't have a closer look so far  does a dns lookup upfront and sends the ip address to the proxy instead of sending the host name to the proxy and let the proxy resolve the name 
 mkouba    i thought the same  i did a quick test  but the fix for the other pr did not seem to solve it  i will double check it now that it has been merged    my initial thinking was not to solve it using a test and a warning  because i was afraid to hide a root cause and potentially not using this opportunity to correct a bug  if any  somwhere else    but yes if everybody believes that the right solution is simply to make the code more robust  i can take care of it

the last time the area didnt show any thing but the selected area   don't know how about the unloaded area its far away from my base   but if you add a area on the pc it creates a standard area like x1 1 y1 1 z1 1 and x2 2 y2 2 z2 2 and suddenly my drones teleported into a cave to going attack mobs

this is an interesting concept  i think we should probably keep a default mapping  but perhaps add better documentation around customization so that a developer could do that trivially if the default doesn't satisfy their use case    i'm thinking that the change proposed by this ticket will allow us to support all use cases though  although we'll know more once i finish the ccp codecs 
 komachision  here is the demo project  just run the demoapplication and it will cause the exception  thank you  https   github com fenghuanfun sharding test  url 
uh  yeah  that worked  i had to "force stop" it once and now it seems to work just fine  should i leave this issue open 
i run from the command line instead of intellij and it works  sorry for that 
my reasons to use lux    in lowlight conditions  mainly at night  the screen is too bright for me  the  black transparent  overlay reduces the brightness further   i can create sensor reading screen brightness pairs and control the auto brightness this way  i understand the tap jacking concerns  for me i found a solution now    actually i found two          1    in the lux app there  is an option to use an "alternative overlay"  which does not cause the unresponsiveness in the owncloud app  i dont know  if that alternative overlay works for me like the standard one  but i will see     alternative overlay causes the same issue  2  the lux app has a list of apps  that cause the overlay to be deactivated while one of these apps is in the foreground  this list contains the android package installer per default  which seems to have a similar tap jacking protection   so i added the owncloud app to that list

michael   yes  i meant the query frame  i am using chrome  i shared the zipped version of my 2 3 1 database in the issue specifically related to performance tuning  no  i don't see any error messages in messages log  sorry  i have trouble locating console log   also  as i indicated in the other ticket  my 2 3 1 installation is really misbehaving now when i have 2 2 7 and 2 3 1 versions installed  and i dont even attempt to run them at the same time  i always make sure one is shut down   that may be a separate issue   thanks  gene 
yes  freezing  and as ubuntu applications do when they freeze for more than a second or two  the entire app grays out   i will take a dump on monday at work and collect more information   i haven't tested on a bunch of databases  only the one ms sql db  i have access to some mysql databases  so i will try those   the windows version  however  i was able to connect to the same database with no issues  by the way 
sorry  i can't find the log file in mac osx 
hmm  i missed the   jsonproperty  annotations last time i checked the generated code  i think i expected them on the method parameter  rather than the method itself  or maybe i was just tired   so    it seems to me that indeed  just adding   jsonignore  is enough  i've filed a pr  in which we can discuss the implementation details  #466  with this pr  all of the above tests pass 
i tried multi_fiield and it works as what i wanted   the mapping i use is similar to what  brwe mentioned     thank you for the hint  s1monw  
that's fixed++   i'm away for the weekend  but i'll be back on tuesday to find more bugs   
yes i can view the video stream in my web browser 
jose  thanks for looking in on this     i've created a branch https   github com edlunde dnastar biojava tree mmcif seqres that incorporates  1  the fix for the finding all chains in all models  and  2  disables the  replacegroupseqpos    method that causes mis numbering   a unit test for 2ksa is in the testdifficultmmciffiles java   the first listed residue asp in chain a  should be residue 2   this is correctly specified by the _atom_site records  but made incorrect by later changing again in  replacegroupseqpos      i think trying to renumber by the _pdbx_poly_seq_scheme is actually incorrect unnecessary here   take a look   the first change would fix the bug  1  only 
thanks  andrew  1 0 1 rc 1 fixes the 'origin  not found' problem  but introduces a new one  the gradle build fails if no gradle git publish task is executed  for example  running    gradlew tasks  fails because the plugin tries to access an uninitialized grgit property in  its buildfinished closure  https   github com ajoberstar gradle git publish blob ca1bcac7b289fda741d508907b92b8305e442ef0 src main java org ajoberstar gradle git publish gitpublishplugin java#l46 l50

yes  i try to update the document from the plugin  i create the documents by adding them on the admin console and it works fine   by the way is there any way to only update some fields in a document  based on my experience i have to specify every field when updating otherwise it will be removed 
i'm using v2 2 0 
yep  looks good 
yes one second  let me load up 1 8 9 
kotlin 1 0 5 2
as far as i can tell it does  i'll make a branch pull request
i'm not sure how to check that  however it looks like something went wrong already with the upgrade   i can try to just do a fresh reinstall if you wish   upgrade logs   2015 08 29 15 35 18 458 error

sorry  my bad i missed to copy binaries applet file  thank you 
i have set up the project with maven pom  and the selenium version 2 53 1 has been imported as the dependency libs
nice   i just ran into that scheduling issue last night and hadn't yet diagnosed it  but looking at your commits now realize that you've fixed both of my problems in one swoop   thanks for the quick turnaround

hi  i've used another framework but to help you figure out the problem  i was using the latest sdk 0 5 2  i was also using smarttab layout library  https   github com ogaclejapan smarttablayout   and i believe that was having some problems  just guessing because of sliding_tabs  
i'm using version 2 0 1 well a snapshot of it
so i couldn't figure out the incantation to make sbt exclude the nd4j native      os name         dependency  and then i couldn't figure out how to re include it with the variables filled in   so i guess it should just be documented until the coursier guys get a fix in  sounds like they're working on it though   i imaging a lot of scala users who use emacs  like me  will trip over this as ensime officially recommends coursier  because it makes sbt a ton faster  
no  they are not shown as stored 
thanks   jgrandja  since i'm pretty busy those days  please go ahead  rhamedy 👍
 definitlyevil  i had tried mcpe 1 2 9 and 1 2 8  and both of them caused the same thing  dragonproxy compiled by me was from the lastest source code in https   github com dragonetmc dragonproxy  thank you  and sorry for my bad english again 
i've created a pr  https   github com eclipse hono pull 1009
after some extra testing  we wrote down these   when both the gapples and regen are enabled  it's broken  when the gapples are off and the regen on  the hunger part works  but ofcourse the gapples aren't cuz disabled  when gapples are on and the regen off  it doesn't work  hunger goes down quickly  when both are off  the hunger part works again   after some more testing  we noticed it's only broken when you've lost health  when it tries to regenerate  it drains your hunger  even right after you gappled  after you eat anything else  like steak or fish  it does fill your saturation however  so it's clearly something with the gapples   regeneration   hope this helped   
tried again after deploying the latest master and i have the same message  it could be the environment is broken  so we will investigate further 
maybe it only happens on linux and not on mac 
i tested a few minutes before  and i think the first 200 rows fetching is the problem  my answer your question  "do you see any dups in dbeaver results grid      yes "do you see any dups if you copy by simple ctrl+c "    yes  but if i execute sql with this "select all rows"  ctrl+alt+a      there is no dubs  so i think the problem is the first 200 row fetching and afterthat the all rows fetching 
i'll give it a try  setting up an empty server with fe as the only mod 
yes it does 👍  i made exactly the same change  but i figured the other places also need  update since it will fail if master changes and so on 
sorry  the project is a larger project that i can't share  it's been mostly built by other developers    i can try to give a little more context to see if it helps at all  we're using struts 2  the project structure consists of parent artifact with several modules  i've included the above configuration in the webapp child module  not sure if maybe other plugins could interfere  if nothing comes to mind  i'll try to re create the issue in a test project  might be some time before i get to posting that though 
i tried   image  https   i loli net 2019 08 18 rwykvx4zw38hyai png

the exceptions are observed again even without data of long type  i am doing some testing to figure it out 
yes it is indeed "autoupload"  just the directory on my nextcloud is called "instantupload"  i don't know what a logcat is  if you let me know i will try to provide 
hi marc  thank you for the quick response  i'm using the gui peptideshaker version 1 13 4 in archlinux  i was also experiencing a similar issue in windows 7 with gui version 1 13 1  i was able to save the peptideshaker project and put it in this dropbox folder along with other potentially useful files  https   www dropbox com sh av7t6yz7zk3n9hu aadenc80e02rdhvrp_zyeoi1a dl 0

i'm using the latest build  as of today  4 11 16  of spigot 1 9 2  the latest vanilla minecraft client  1 9 2   and i have no idea what version of java i'm running on the client because i've never installed it on this gaming laptop  it's brand new  so it must just be whatever the minecraft client installs downloads     there's nothing in either the spigot logs or the minecraft client logs  i don't know where i would find any java client logs since i never actually installed java on this laptop     the pet hat feature definitely works for me  too   but when i click on the pet hat icon again  which is supposed to remove the pet from your head   that's when java crashes  if i just toggle the pet off instead of attempting to remove the pet from my head with the pet hat icon  it doesn't crash

hi  smillidge   tried to put a minimal example together which reproduces the problem  but haven't succeeded yet 🤦🏻‍♂️  i've checked all the jars in the app where it's not working  and the only one i can find which includes a version of asm is groovy  however  when i include the same dependency in the example everything starts up fine   one other difference between the broken app and the working example attempt is that the former uses a custom domain xml  i'll have a go at including that in the example app next week and see if the error pops up then   as always  your help and thoughts are very much appreciated 😊  will get back to you when i know more   cheers  c

 mjpt777 thanks for the quick response   i can verify that the fix to the statusmessageflyweight has stopped it causing a jvm crash   i did however hit one further alignment issue when starting the mediadriver in the cncfiledescriptor which also causes a jvm crash   it looks like the client_liveness_timeout_field_offset needs a 4 byte pad  but this would break the cnc compatibility and would need to follow your version strategy i expect

yes  that's right  we initially discovered the issue in a setup with haproxy  but we are able to reproduce it easily with just a standalone jetty serving a static page and a remote browser  chrome or firefox    for example accessing jetty from a smartphone connected to the local wifi   as i explained in the mailing list  we can reproduce it also with jdk 1 8 0_72 and alpn 8 1 7 v20160121   i attach a log running jetty with    module logging  dorg eclipse jetty http2 level debug   the page load that fails  the second in the log i think  starts at 2016 02 29 19 20 13 985  in this case the visible symptoms were that page load halted while loading an image  and after many seconds page load finished leaving one of the images with the broken image icon in the display    2016_02_29 stderrout log gz  https   github com eclipse jetty project files 151522 2016_02_29 stderrout log gz

yes  this seems to be an edge case around cluster sizing  it does appear that this will occur if one of the nodes is at capacity in the cluster  cpu in this case   i've deployed the same code on clusters that have worker nodes with more resources without issue  and  yes  this is on mesos 0 25 0

i do not have experience with other java ee applications using native memory instead of heap  i am only aware of memory analysis tools for heap dumps  not for the native memory   unfortunately  even if the observed behavior were considered normal  websphere administrators would take issue with an application using several times the memory figure allocated to heap   i could see the memory grow on the java process corresponding to the jvm in the windows task manager  not using some websphere tools  i let the memory grow to 5gb before pulling the plug  the db usage volume was minimal although the few records affected were relatively large   1mb   the database size was small   2mb   i was basically adding  reading and deleting a single record  the heap size was 1024mb  the physical memory available on the server was approximately 5gb   now  i did open issue #6493 which could well be related  since deleting a record results in error  i suppose that it could factor in that record being preserved in memory

hi   i tested using the latest snapshot  same issue  wether with spring boot 2 0 0 or 2 0 1   also  the case appears each time  for the first as for the following    what do you want to say when you say "does it affect your webfluxes"    i can take some time to prepare a reproducible case to give you more facilities to figure out the problem if you need it    thank you for your help

slight performance hit on island load  it will sample the y 0 coordinate below the island  as well as the 4 corners  if any of these contain bedrock  it will wipe the lower 4 layers of the island  issue a warning  and do it after 10 seconds   giving players a short time to flee  if they are roaming the flatland   it will remove one layer at a time  starting from the bottom  and do this asynchroneous   to minimize server load lag

it may take some time to find what script can reproduce the problem  of course  a quick script i tried could not reproduce it   dsroot extends v dbtable extends dsbaseentity which extends v none are abstract  they are using 8 clusters with round robin algo  at the moment  dsroot has 1 record and dstable has 460 and dsbaseentity has 9213  v has 12 545 and e has 22 045 records   the dsroot  dstable and dsbaseentity have no index  as far as i know  we are not using indexes anywhere  the web console shows only dictionary  ofunction name  orole name and ouser name in the indexes list    i'm still look for a repro script  do you have other ideas that could help pinpoint the problem 
 asolntsev thanks for looking into this  no  our tests doesn't look like this  it's just a snippet  stripped down as fast as possible from a very complex test  testing the sort order etc    the same for the html page  it's a html page  saved by selenide test case  stripped down from a complex and big gwt application    ok  the guys at selenium tell me its a webdriver bug  https   github com seleniumhq selenium issues 5994 so i will open chrome firefox webdriver bugs tomorrow   what i don't understand is that all the other elements outside the viewport  after this one element  will return a text   that seem to be wrong   would be great to speed up this code  if you want  i can send you a few other selenide code examples  working with the table  that is slow right now

hi   ok  so i have developed a simple application with glassfish 3 1 2 and i have used its library of  mojarra 2 1 6 which implements jsf 2 1    for web page i have created once with primefaces 5 1 and viewscoped managedbean to control the view  the page contains two elements    1    p commandebutton     that implement a simple  function it is a matter of incrementing a variable type integer for each click on the button  i++  2    p outputlabel   to display the value incremented after click when i finished reading this link    http   mjremijan blogspot com 2017 04 high availability ha session replicated html    i have created successfully the cluster withe two instances in different machines and the replication between instances worked well if i deploy a simple page  jsp  i have the same id session  but if i deploy the jsf application  which i have just mention on top  to test the high availability after launching firstly the first link    http   instance 1 280280 myapplication  and secondly the second link    http   instance 2 282281 myapplication on two tabs navigator the scenario is as follows  so if i click on the button in the second link the value is incremented and is displayed on the page but if i click on the button in the first link no change occurs and in the log file i have this error   javax faces application viewexpiredexception viewid  page xhtml could not be restored   now i refresh the  first link and i click on the button the value is incremented and is displayed on the page but if i click on the button in the second link no change occurs and in the log file i have the same error   javax faces application viewexpiredexception viewid  page xhtml could not be restored and   reciprocally   if i refresh the second like i have the same scenario   so  if you want more explanations you ask me thanks 
 kenwheeler i just tried on my android phone  normal conditions 
with the value set to true  the tests don't run at all  they just seem to hang with their corresponding spinners spinning away  i did try pausing execution  and it looked like it was cycling between three different lines in the time4j library  looked like it was maybe waiting for initialization  but i unfortunately didn't make notes of the lines in question   with the value set to false  the tests fail quickly as described

it only seems to do it when i break it with an item  it can be any item  i tried sever different items in my hand like leather  torches  crafting table  dark matter pickaxes  and a red matter sword  it breaks into a normal pipe when i use my hand 
no  other keybindings 'stick' like normal  i just tried it in a new instance with only dynamic surroundings  and there it also happens  something else i just notice   is that the keybindings do not show up in the list  options   controls  when i am not in a world  so going to controls from the main menu does not allow me to set the keybindings  i can only do this with esc inside a world  i also updated to latest forge  2479  but this didn't help either 
it's like   https   dev azure com  org   project  _git  project  
no worries  it only happened the once and to me   so may be something to do with being op  ill keep an eye out thanks
most of the root related messages were eliminated by the grep  but it was just some  10 more lines per instance  eventually resulting in root permission being granted 
sorry  this happened with production traffic  so i'm not quite sure how to reproduce  there were actually two threads stuck at the same location  the threads entered the server  and thus probably the lock   some tens of seconds apart

hello   thanks for the quick reply   sure  below is a unit test that does reproduce the error  details about the environment are     java 8   spring boot starter parent  2 1 7 release   amqp client  5 4 3   and using junit 5  i did try it on another project though with following specs  which actually works      java 11   spring boot starter parent  2 1 9 release   amqp client  5 4 3   and also using junit 5

i'll do you one better  i recorded this and threw it on youtube   https   youtu be twoogfy0p7y  as you see from the video  it works right at the start but then it won't let the cart pass going the other way  this leads me to believe that i am doing something wrong but i can't seem to figure out what   i am using it in a modpack    could that be the issue 
yes  maybe the server was unavailable  unable to reproduce the problem again 
i'm attaching a screen capture under rstudio 1 2 1511  but i tried in other computers with the same os and rstudio version and did not experience the problem  moreover  if i open a new rstudio window  the second window doesn't suffer from this problem either  for more context  this happens inside a project  with many tabs open in the editor  but these conditions alone don't seem to cause the issue either     selects_another_pane  https   user images githubusercontent com 11860098 57755901 b578b880 76fa 11e9 891a 247dfecab161 gif 
i'm using spring boot 1 5 6 release which is using jetty 9 4 6 v20170531  on the test you mentioned  the forwarded url has the same parameter as as the original request but with another value     not sure why this would be the case  but ok      in my case  the forward is not changing any values  i'm simply removing the language part of the url so it can be handled by the controllers as if it wasn't there     so the parameters are the same and so are their values

thank you for your quick reply  getlocations returns only one location if i remember  i didn't call getvalidlocations   i have just done another test  and no problem here  getlocations and getvalidlocations return 20 entries  see  logfile  https   gist github com sekiroh ef633e5734f7c09b2906f0a8d4445fcf   this time  wifi connection wasn't enabled when starting  perhaps a problem when previous location is obtained from network  and new from gps

yes  marcalwestf is a big problem for any user that use adempiere app from older versions
the thing is that i already don't have to worry about this happening with later versions of multi hotbar  it's the fact that people can still use an older version of it to do this  and have their own copies of it    is there any way for carryon to insure that carryon "items" will only stay in inventory for so long as they are actively selected  and always drop if they aren't  otherwise there will always be the potential for various other mods to do this 
if  textrenderer  serves no purpose  then it can be removed  otherwise  i would expect it to be modified to work in a more efficient way  which i assume would mean changing it into a  basicrenderer  so that template based rendering would be used when appropriate  
    umm i don't know why your virus thingy went off but it is not fake
hi  i tried it again  the newest version on bapp store    i can confirm  that if the reflection happens   only   in the header  no issue is raised   as expected    when i scan request which has multiple reflection  the first and only highlighted occurrence is the one in the response header  is it possible  that this highlight would not be present  as it should be excluded  also  since there is only a single highlight in such a case  i would automatically miss all the other reflections   other 3 reflections in the body  only when i manually search the value can i see there are 4 matches  1 header + 3 body   is this something which could be fixed as well 
that's a valid reason to not change it   what i can offer is a work around for others who are hitting this which is telling flyway to start its initial migration from the 3 3 0 sql script and run a modified 3 2 0 script  which just has that line omitted  prior to launching genie   this way new users can keep taking future migrations and this won't break existing deployments changing the hash of the 1st migration on working non aws deployments   as for my version of postgres  yes i am also using 9 6
i meant that i was only looking at the code for  try   i assumed wrongly that if the methods there contained  class x      parameters then that would cause issues   i didn't actually check  however  all those methods have a   safevarargs  in place already in the 2 1 1 i'm using  so  again  the problem seems contained to  fluentfunctions

 joewiz  indeed  app xql in the zip contains "stream transform  " from my testing  line 19   change that to just "transform  " and you should observe the behaviour i described     dizzzz  from an xslt file stored in the db via doc    see app xql in my zip 
i get the same behavior running the module from the cli   here is a  dump of the log  https   gist github com fwgreen d66178246d72e108d90564b841403684    hopefully it helps 
gave it a go looks like it worked  thanks 
eek  i'd love to  but i'm afraid i don't know how to do that  happy to if you show me how  otherwise equally i can wait until you fix it  that's not a problem  cheers

yes trying to get some outside input here  can’t figure out what is causing this error and think it maybe something with how the binding interacts with the framework that is outside my understanding hence why i posted to see if i could get some guidance on where i need to look     i know that the servlet is not starting but i haven’t seen this error before and the error in the log is just so non specific to me that i don’t know where to start

thanks for the quick response   the thing is i love mucommander  and trying to make it fit my needs   where is the jira page  clicking "report a bug" from mucommander  nightly build  leads to  this broken page  http   www mucommander com bugs   which redirects to the broken trac subdomain   i encountered several issues  not sure if bugs or misuse on my part  like    i was unable to make anything in commands xml work  for example i tried making f4 open sublime text as editor with many variations on this line   command alias "edit" value "c  program  files sublime  text  2 sublime_text exe  f" type "system"      on my windows machine  right clicking a file has "open with" which is always grayed out  wanted to know how to add commands to this submenu   sftp does not work for me  using a passphrase protected private key  i am easily able to login using another client  winscp  but with mucommander i get invalid credentials    wanted to read a little more about commands xml in order to add more commands to it  since mucommander suppresses the native windows right click menu    for example  wanted to add  ctrl+shift+v   send to virustotal   and  ctrl+d   dos prompt here    wanted to suggest to add a "cut" operation on a file in addition to copy and move   wanted to suggest a preferences setting to suppress the move dialog  always move to the other panel     wanted to suggest a "duplicate file" operation  or even better  simply allow  ctrl+c then ctrl+v  and paste the file as  original name   copy  or  original name  1   or similar  right now  copy then paste results in an error dialog   and some more      footnote    for now  i have solved the hotkeys   commands xml problems i have above by simply writing a autohotkey script that overrides the commands i want   so f4 sends alt+shift+c to mucommander to copy the selected file path  and then i handle it in autohotkey 
i fixed it already  the problematic code were  https   github com gluufederation oxauth commit 0c145b1d875f1cbd7f6461f0871b066d6b06add7  as result it showed blank page    without redirect user to right place  in this and in few next commits i fixed logic  closing this issue

thx  sberyozkin    i can remove the quarkus specific hack and share the same code with all other servers  +1 
i can reproduce it in our environment  so what we could do is enable debugging and attach an ide with the orient code in it to the server to see where it goes wrong   but i'm guessing this will need a restart of the node that goes wrong and that could potentially fix the problem as it gets a fresh db from another node  or is there another way to enable debugging without restarting   as for an online session  i can do that monday  preferrable in the morning 
it was a long time ago  and i should have been more specific when raising the issue   i think it was 'shared' to non shared at the package level  and moving packages between modules   at least that is what i did a lot of early on in my project

you are correct tom  currently remote debugging is not allowed by default in java 11+  allowing it all the time would be a security concern  which alasdair also raised on pr #7834   right now i've gone with a solution that leaves the default behavior as is  and if the user wants to enable remote debugging on their server they will be able to set the  wlp_debug_remote y  env var 
it worked    thank you so much  this issue can be closed 
has no effect  i've made it blasting iii and nothing is happening

i tried to reproduce this issue by starting a music and stopping it during 1 hour  no error happenned but it seems that the error occurs when the bot has already been running for a few hours   i have also tried to send silence instead of nothing using this code   this did not fix the error     timeline      my bot started at  2019 02 20 22 29 41 951    the first error occurred 4h30 after  at  2019 02 21 03 03 30 862    the last error occurred 10h30 after the first error  at  2019 02 21 13 36 35 275   during this period  13 436 portunreachableexception were thrown   also  but i'm not sure if it is linked  my shards stop reconnecting after a while  they get stuck on  retry attempt     in     ms  but i keep getting the portunreachableexception  as quantic said  pue are sent by epoll thread pool so it makes sense it could hog all resources 
no  the problem only occurs with an "upgrade"  backup domain  restore domain  
this test was with an creeper but skeleton  zombies and and and dont work too
tried to edit the post to be according the template 
ok i pushed to my test project https   github com chongma test   choose test   gmap
that happened in 2 1 rc5  almost sure that it can happen on 2 1
this was working on a previous version  but i just checked the linked issue and it looks like the  lib  directory will go wherever the final build directory is  which i guess it's wherever the  finalname  config setting points to   that will work for my usecase 
 fmontesi  yes i do it straight away i will post all the code and resulting wsdl
start syncthing and close the activity  it only happens when the activity gets closed  not just send to background

workaround for turning off root mode  1  as root  edit   data data com nutomic syncthingandroid shared_prefs com nutomic syncthingandroid_preferences xml   setting  use_root  to  false   2  change owner for all touched files from  root  to the respective user  for example   chown u0_a143 u0_a143  data data com nutomic syncthingandroid files    data data com nutomic syncthingandroid files index v0 11 0 db    3  force restart syncthing  maybe multiple times   unfortunately folders seem to has been reset either by this or because of some previous upgrade and device id reset to one like  aaaaaaaaaaa aaaa a   but this may be unrelated   so maybe just using "clear data" may be more approripate 
trying 0 12 0  will reopen if it still happens 
sure  it should have been created like this  we use a script that is auto generated to create the index  i tried to reconstruct it in a few lines  but there could be syntax errors now  
saw it a few times in the past few days  but i tried to replicate it just now and couldn't  i'll update here if i see it again 
i tried rc6  no rc7 on f droid  but i can't login because the user pass fields appear to be missing  i enter the url and i get an error when pressing enter

so that behavior would be leaving the file from time t2   i don't think that is a possibility  because that file doesn't pass the filter s  saying to only give us files that parsed   i always viewed the behavior as 'give me all the code at time x  and then filter out anything not matching one of the filters '

at least in the current state of the conversion method this might happen   of course i could also adapt this in the implementation to convert both  n and  r n to breaks which is probably better

the problem is not the compilation stage which invokes gcc  that can be handled with crosstool  it's invoking some intermediate binary compiled by gcc  which need proper ld_library_path to work because of the mismatch of system level gcc and the gcc used to compile the binary  the only way i see is to add rpath during compilation which looks like a hack

well unfortunately the above code did solve the problem only for a while   i made a libgdx project repository for testing which shows the errors   https   bitbucket org tomgrill itest  each time you touch the screen it toggles between load show interstitial  so always wait for "interstitial received" message in log before showing   you can switch between crashmodes      edit  iosinterstitial java to reproduce the errors   there are 3 modes you can use  explanation   0  will crash the app immediately when you touch the screen the first time to load an interstitial  crash error  terminated due to signal 6  1  will crash the app the 2nd time you load an interstitial  crash error  terminated due to signal 11  2  loading and showing new interstitials works     somehow  works for quite a while but then randomly crashes after  8 minutes   may take even longer  repeat  load and show 3 5 interstitials  dismiss the last interstitial and leave the phone without touching for like  8 minutes  crash error  terminated due to signal 11  tell me if you still need the symbolicated crash logs  i hope i manage to get them  seems kinda difficult to do that   
yes  that's the point    many tools including check_jmx4perl  nagios check using jolokia  and j4psh  command line shell for jolokia  use the encoded form for accessing the agent  and in fact plain jetty works perfectly since it uses  org eclipse jetty http httpuri#getdecodedpath    for decoding the pathinfo

i respect the decision to keep it   but it is simply the principle of deleting a file  when delete  delete forever  from everywhere  perhaps i could fabricate a few extreme examples in which this small "feature" could expose secrets but i'm sure you know what i mean 
my git is configured to not use the windows line endings for text files  is this test supposed to test if the url stream is actualy normalizing the line endings to the platform defaults  otherwise i would simply compare the length to a constant instead to a different file

yes  i'm just testing it and no combination of buttons  that i've tested  q  x  esc  ctr+x  ctrl+w  ctrl+q  seem to make it close  being a "real" modal window  i can't click on anything back in the app    i say "real modal"  because the welcome window doesn't capture the action  and you can keep clicking back in the app  so that isn't so critical for me

amazon fire phone  os is based on android 4 4 4   pb 0 8 0  steps to reproduce    open pb    service on    launch camera by pressing a button on the left of the phone    take a shot    exit the camera app    open notifications    press on pb notification    get an empty view  everything white and pb header on the top     i will be honest   it is not always reproducible  sometimes i get regular pb view after pressing the notification

yes  problem exists on both android mobile chrome browser and desktop browser accessing the mobile ui  here is the only output from the javascript console    consider using 'dppx' units  as in css 'dpi' means dots per css inch  not dots per physical inch  so does not correspond to the actual 'dpi' of a screen  in media query expression    webkit max device pixel ratio  1    max resolution  120dpi   i believe you are correct that it is related to #126 because i have  on some occasions  opened the mobile ui on my phone and did not see one or two devices  even after waiting for a while  they never showed up

not sure just yet  needs to be looked into   installing them all may lead to issues  not sure  don't think so since they're classpath loaded in on launch   i think the best option would be to check the libraries when play is clicked and create new fields in the instance json for the os and version it was installed on so that if they change  the libraries are reloaded in  sounds like the best solution  but may be other ones 
that was fast  thank you  it does not crash any longer 
yes  the steps are only   1  go to hidden apps setting 2  check an app 3  press android back button 4  return to hidden apps setting to discover check mark missing  also  a couple of times i checked an app and scrolled down to check more  and when i scrolled back up the checks were missing    edit  not sure if changing any default settings affects this    i have   1  icons turned off 2  tap to open app drawer off 3  persistent pinned apps on scroll turned on    edit 2  to clarify  any apps i hide individually from the app drawer stay checked in the hidden apps setting  only ones i check from the setting ever disappear 
for example  i call a friend to see a car on the map and when i pull away it can have access to my username and password

sorry i didn't check that at the time  i'm currently crazy for a deadline on tuesday  but i'll give that a try afterwards   good job on the library btw  makes things a lot easier  is there a way to  custom  inject subscriptions  eg by entering a code i'd activate a subscription on the device locally instead of via the market

i think it happens because you use the link text over the actual url in the link to retrieve the card information  same thing also happens with "return  card "  and i'm sure a few others 
yes  this is right  but the crazy thing is i set the timezone in kibana already to europe berlin     the result directly from elasticsearch is ok 
that's the culprit indeed  the condition   conditionalonmissingbean asyncconfigurer class   is not enough   it doesn't take into account the fact that spring will also consider the taskexecutor or executor it may find in the context  see original description    as a temporary workaround  we disabled sleuth's default async configurer by setting  spring sleuth async configurer enabled  to false  then we added the following configuration in our code 
if i disable the extensions  i don't see this behaviour 
can't seem to replicate the block changes on the road    it would replace some of the blocks with water  and also changes the biome on the roads and neighboring plots on   the e s w sides   all sides    debug information  http   hastebin com ifivoqotak   edit  okay  so i got it to replicate  it didn't change any blocks on the road  but it did generate trees in the adjacent plot     image of bug  http   i imgur com jchf1xl jpg 
i'll test that on tuesday  keeping you aware   
that doesn't seem to help  the only way i got something running again was to leave the beta and install the latest released version  which worries me that next updates will break on my device   i also tried to reboot the phone  but that didn't help   run conditions shouldn't be a problem  anyway  i tried to run on the usual wifi wile plugged in and nothing loads   while the app is stuck loading i cannot even check the settings  which doesn't help me do diagnoses what's going on not to try and change something

i think so  would we not want to support ubuntu 14 04 as well 
yes i have a stock samsung phone with the multi window feature 
we already have that ability in "project" menu  it should impact the whole "project explorer"  so folders in   projects  too 
no  i just stripped out everything but malisis doors and it's fine  i then re added quark and the problem presents itself  so it's an interaction between quark and malisis doors   further testing shows it's something to do with the double doors code since it doesn't affect single doors   i'll report this to quark's git as well since it only affects when _both_ mods are installed   quark r1 0 59 autoreglib 1 0 2  cheers 
i don't know if haxe or haxelib were involved at that moment 
hi  mattjacunski   we tested it on samsung galaxy  htc one  and china phones  those three are using jellybean and kitkat 
i mainly started thinking about it because i had a lot of cells of data that contained the string "n a"  so i just transformed all of them with  value replace "n a"  ""    now i realize i could have used  null  instead of  ""   but i guess for my end location  any postgresql compatible db  it won't make much of a difference for the data analysis workloads i'll do   i also noticed when i delete a column all the cells get set to null when the option to view null is enabled   i guess i just wondered why there was a distinction  but i guess it makes sense in the context of an sql db  or even for example  what value to store for a blank cell in a numeric column   i think it is the type of small distinction that it is important to mention  even if it is just to say  "it doesn't really matter which one you use " because now i've spent a while thinking  _oh no  which one is better more idiomatic  etc etc   _  i haven't tried doing the sql export yet so i haven't hit any problems but i'll keep you updated  also  i'm glad + excited to hear about new plans for records mode

i did nothing special   i plan to refactor the download code by using only one thread with a proper way to send it the requests  this is on my todo list 
 mherbst   sorry  but i'm not sure how to do this    got it debug set to trace i suppose  will try with the next restart  thanks   but since all other 40 homematic things never throw an error  and if i define the 6 wall thermostats without any channels definitions they don't throw and error either  i'm more inclined to assume it has something to do with the channels delay statements 
the command system is quite obstrusive in comparison to other plugins and some commands do not make sense to have in game  for example  some commands will overflow the chat  making some information the command gives to not be readable   
i installed the alpha release  version  2 12 3 568 fdbe53d  and my issue appears to be fixed   however  i am suspicious that it was the act of installing and reinstalling the app  not the alpha release itself  that resolved it

 neozwu i tried running with 0 22 0 but forcing the version of auth to 0 7 1  and was unable to reproduce the error that way   i also tried forcing 0 8 0 and wasn't able to reproduce the problem that way either   so either i'm building it wrong or it's not the auth library   from running  gradle dependencies  it looks like the force is working though 
both ios and android  the ios client is built with tabris 1 4  the android one is older  don't know the exact version    on mon  jul 7  2014 at 12 19 pm  moritz post notifications github com wrote

i have no idea what you're talking about  ekager   no one said anything about replacing any buttons that's all fine  brampitoyo   but i think you guys have lost the point      whether it shows as "open in fennec" or in the "open in    " menu thing is    bikesheding  the bug is that fennec is both not showing up as its own button nor in the "open in   " menu when focus klar is set as default  there is no way to open the webpage in fennec at all  but  in contrast  the xiaomi browser does show up in the     menu  maybe i should submit an issue to fennec    to anyone else having this problem   the work around i've found is to hit "share" then i can open it in fennec through that menu  it's a bit weird

i don't know  i did update every day except friday and sat  however  i tried to reset back to the version  on wednesday  it still didn't work 
so i took another look at it this evening  and i'm fairly sure it was an issue with the drive having its permissions changed somehow  the  data directory had been changed to be owned by root  i've no idea how  but changing it back fixed the issue

i could not recreate this   i tried a new world  same seed  with beta 3  ran around and found five villages all as they should be   the only thing i can figure is that when i got your mod and added it to my world  the current villages were devoid of villagers   new villages were fine  the others were all empty   not killed off  as i started that world the day before  not enough time  only day 3   so i started a new world  with the same seed  and the same name  but i deleted the old game from the client   deleted the old worlds  started again  same seed  beta 3  completely different world name  no issues   all villages i had investigated are there   could there have been an artifact in the game that associated the old save with the new world   i assume i can avoid that by not using the same world name    i assume it had something to do with the names of the worlds being the same   i know little about mods  but it seems logical to me   interesting mod  thanks for developing it   glad to be of help  even if it appears to be a rare issue   cheers 
i booted in by deleting maxlock apk  reinstalled it  uninstalled clearing data  and deleted the dalvik cache  installed it again  strangely works but it keeps getting optimized at every boot   additionally  could i request you to add an option to lock apps upon screenlock  and also  may i know whats "pausing" as stated in 5 2 update 
so what about this term   f1  xᵇ   f2  f3 xᵇ         with f1  f2  f3 all functions   are any calls blocked here 
this fixed the problem  thank you very much 
 mrniko following annotation when added is working   this way we should know because of the existence of 'spring redis redisson config' we are using redisson as cache and because  of 'spring cache type redis' we are using redis as cache
ah  good callout  it looks like closing the previous response before retrying  does  fix the crash on 3 14  i was able to change my code to the follow and re run the same scenarios with no crashes     that definitely gets me unblocked  but it's interesting that this changed in the new version  maybe something to note in the documentation for the future   thanks for the rapid response   and of course  for all the work on maintaining this core library       
when dealing with it in an android app it works fine   but in logcat appears like that
sorry for that  i think it should be forge  that's my fault and i have changed the title  i recorded a gif to explain this    1  https   user images githubusercontent com 17660052 61802061 6cfc1a80 ae62 11e9 8c62 c71e9a1b0be3 gif  this also happens in fire pit 
its on the latest version of atm 3 remix running version 4 2 3 of electroblob's  tried it on multiple worlds and still get the same result 
 jvrao sleep   helps indeed  test passes under the debugger  which adds delays   i did not look at this much closer after finding a repro   workaround unblocking myself 
yes this works  thank you 
i changed it to 5 seconds and it worked  stopped recording video automatically after 5 seconds   then i set it back to maximum  13h 1m   and tested again and it stopped recording after 30 minutes  no change  
hi  philwebb  sure  here a repo with a sample test application   https   github com lincetto spring boot ghissue 7625  https   github com lincetto spring boot ghissue 7625 
i see   this makes sense of course  i just was concerned  something referring the code was not correct  using the on off buttons of the initial typical's node screen would result in a recent change of sliders position after changing to the'manual screen'   your suggestion above concerning the state feedback sounds very interesting  if it's not to much work it would be nice

android o 
1   i use version 5 004 with a galaxy s5 2   protocol pop3 3   i haven't seen any details  in the last days it didn't happen  i guess a mail server within the cluster with an invalid certificate  but i don't know for shure 
i guess i should just stop reporting bugs until i update to 1 7 x seems like a lot of my bug posts are in the already fixed catagory
i believe i downloaded it from https   www microsoft com en us software download windows7 a while ago   fwiw windows declares its version as 6 1 7601 sp1 build 7601   somewhat surprisingly  after rebooting this vm and trying to launch the latest daily build everything works  given that the issue seems to have magically resolved itself i'll close this but let's keep our ears open in case we hear   see anything else from users running windows 7

hello ilayaperumalg   thanks for your fast response  the last step that had the status unknown actually completed successfully  i was also just wondering why the second step still hat the status started and the last step already has the exist status executing    let me know if you need any further information to fix that issue 
the video in "up next" used to be just the first element of related videos  imho it doesn't separate ui part
if you want to send a message without opening the default intent  you have to set the intent value to empty  intent ''    so if you're sending multiparts message  more than 160 characters   we need to add the following permissions in the androidmanifest xml    uses permission android name "android permission read_phone_state"      i need to understand now why the callback method is called multiple times now  1 time per part of the message 
i suppose i could try that but it doesn't make the above any less of a bug  so    for example if you already have an item stored in a variable   then you can't use the syntax suggested above without resetting the properties of the item inside the variable   also if you have for example  10 lines of lore with specific things stored on certain lines then using one line lore makes modifying the data cumbersome

thank you for quick response  i have debug ready to submit but would like to remove password if it is stored in debug log as indicated in instructions   but not sure i see it in txt file   are passwords in log file 
i will provide an example soon  and i forget to say  the file handle leaks is really related to the bootstrap because when the client disconnect  the frontend channel  client to proxy  channelunregistered   and channelinactive   functions have been called  and the backend channel  proxy to server  channelunregistered   and channelinactive   have also been called  so even when these 4 fonctions was called  some file handle  related to the bootstrap was still open  i checked using lsof  p pid on linux 
thanks for the quick reply      woops  turns out  all the changed i made actually do work  the problem seems to be with jei  as it still shows no change at all  removing adding machine recipes isn't recognized by jei  despite getting registered with the specific machine  that leaves the question open  on what mod's end the mistake lies  maybe rt has to update the recipe in question in jei 
i prefer leaving our own fetching  although flawed   but adding javadoc to that method disclaimering we are not a fetching library  thus the fetch faults are not necessarily the parsing faults  as well as wrapping the fetching line with a try catch segment logging out a short exaplanation that the sitemap failed the fetch not necessarily the parse    i do think there are will be many cases where people will need a fast sitemap parsing and they won't want to delve too deeply into their own fetcher etc  they will look for a quick and dirty sitemap fetch 
i have been trying to do this    seems to be hard to get a small example to fail  my complete multi project build where i use git p4 fail pretty often but in a simple gradle init project not so much apparently  if i run the failing command in my  usr bin i get the same output on stderr and sometimes this error seems to be forwarded to the gradle output and sometimes  mostly  not    this line  https   github com eclipse jgit blob 176466ed281f85f2ba92ae8b605fb43eb3e010d9 org eclipse jgit src org eclipse jgit util fs java#l639 seems to run such a command and spotless lib extra src main java com diffplug spotless extra gitattributeslineendings java seems to be using these config classes so i guess it originates from there  it seems if there is a commandexception  it will do a log warn   so i guess this is forwarded to gradle   https   github com eclipse jgit blob 176466ed281f85f2ba92ae8b605fb43eb3e010d9 org eclipse jgit src org eclipse jgit util fs java#l515 indicates that it is not certain that stderr will always be read  but rather readpipe   will more often continue with it's work   for me this indicates that there is some kind of race condition here whether the error will be logged   sorry i can't supply i proper reproducible example at this time 
i have this in the toolchain  i think it was generated automatically from the migration scripts going from old crosstool files      i would still like to be able to add a define for a specific target in a build file though

the problem is as i discussed about the filtering  it's not a question of does the expanded search find a node or not  it's does the expanded search find a node that _passes_ my filter  inside of   findclosest   the   findnetworkentries   returns a set of node ids  then we loop through these nodes using the edge explorer and the supplied filter  the basic search does not find a node that passes my filter so   findclosest   returns a "null"   queryresult    if i try and expand the search further i still don't find my node because no matter what value of   maxregionsearch      findnetworkentries   returns the first set of nodes that it finds but i already know those don't pass my filter  so once again they don't pass my filter and i get a "null" result  here is the code in my app that i use to wrap   findclosest   to get my result  i feel like this could be easily incorporated into locationindextree itself if it makes sense to others  and then it would be clear that there is a link between the search and the filtering  i would be happy to write this up as a pull request if you agree 
thansk for clarifying  👍
sorry  i actually removed pushy completely from my project as version 0 4 in a tomcat environment was not sending all push notifications and was not logging any error while with version 0 4 3 i cannot start tomcat at all  i no longer have any webapp set up to make the test 
both 1 11 2 and 1 12 1 have the issue 
跟dubbo admin server没关系，配置我举个例子   注册中心  zk配置：  两者zk集群相同，zk path节点不同，其对应的  用户名  和  密码  也不同。此时我的理解，应该是需要创建两个不同的zk client

sorry didn't get a notification to the respond  i can't get screenshots because it is working fine now  but what i mean is it wasn't ejecting the cyanite was coming out of the reactor at all    as in not to either access port out or in    no pipes or anything  just a basic reactor  we have the 0 4 0rc8 version and forge version 1 7 10 1 1 0 300 and cofhcore 3 0 0b6 32

ok i feel that we are missing the point here  let's ignore the round to nearest second and the fact that we do have sub second ticks and also the fact that we get many  many ticks per day    we're talking  in a carl sagan voice  "billionzz and billionzz" of rows in the database   whether the time period is ms  sek  minutes  days  years or centuries shouldn't matter btw  every time period has an open close and high low  as well as total volume  this is what i understood your tick class was handling  by having an addtrade   method for all trades that occur within the tick period    anyhow  we are using ta för intraday trading  and i was testing your framework on our data  by doing a quick hack of the tradingbotonmovingtimeseries java example  it immediately gave exceptions on "cannot add a tick with end time    to series end time"   i read trades from the database for a whole day  symbol  timestamp  price and qty  and feed it into the program  in this particular testcase i had about 34000 trades  a few of them has the same timestamp  whether the timeseries period is 1 second  10 minutes or 1 hour shouldn't matter  right  for the sake of argument  i created ticks with period 1 minute and 1 hour too  but got exactly the same exceptions   since it occurred every time we had two trades with the same timestamp  so i started to see if i could find a way around the problem   the tick class computes begintime as the given time  stored in endtime  minus the period  doesn't this complicate matters when you add trades sequentially  wouldn't it be a lot easier if you took the given time as begintime and set endtime to begintime + period  since you normally have trades in time order with increasing timestamp  how else can i test that "this timestamp" belongs to the "current tick" or if i should create a new tick  i must have misunderstood something here   thats why i had the "lasttick inperiod d " call  to see if my tick was to be added to the current tick object  else i would create a new tick for the next timeperiod  also  the rounding was just trying to avoid the problem with the endtime begintime i mentioned earlier    so  to clearify  we are not talking hft and we are talking intraday ta  of course in coop with other proprietary analysis   i just want to be able to feed in my data with duplicate timestamps 
i tested and i can confirm that is fixed
i am happily going back and forth between the nether and the overworld  going _to_ the end works just as fine  as well  only coming back is causing this issue   using mystcraft linking books has been safe so far  as well   i have not tried custom ages  though  i installed mystcraft because of this problem

sure  currently in morphia you can call the addall   method on the updateoperations with the last flag set to true in order to perform a  pushall   specifically on line 83 of updateopsimpl you'll find a reference to updateoperator push_all  the  pushall operator has been deprecated  http   docs mongodb org manual reference operator update pushall    however  rather than discontinuing this in morphia  it could simply be replaced with  push and  each   this is similar to how the updateoperator add_to_set_each works  line 207 of the updateopsimpl

 pstorch if you follow the steps i described you will find the cache in history but not on the "stored" list 
default textures aren't patterned so you don't see the overlap  however in the interests of resourcepacks it really needs to be addressed 
 dennisoelkers  nice tip   clearing the browser cache fixed the issue  thanks 
i've tested it again the current snapshots from https   oss sonatype org content repositories snapshots com eclipsesource jaxrs  unfortunately the problem is still the same 
i did sent the right one and the problem was present before  but i can't reproduce it now  closing this 
ill test it right now for you

 trustin you're right it's my mistake  i had a dependent library still referring 3 6 3 that was causing this jar to be used instead of 3 6 4  many apologies 
i doubt that i hit  f2    almost nothing in the environment   the code  that i had just selected for copy paste  
i took jed out to see if it was causing problems  even in a standard overworld i was not getting any ore decoration   but i found the issue  i must call  addblocktoreplace    as part of my decoration setup  even though the docs say this is defaulted to stone   perhaps the default isn't correct or some other mod is messing with stone  but adding    dec addblocktoreplace "minecraft stone"    to each ore gen decoration fixed the issue 
i have no idea  maybe it's something that maven surefire does  but how would the debugger know to open that file  what might i do to debug it further 
 djechelon created a pull request right now  it is an early proposal  without tests  yet 
yes  i published to mavenlocal used build snapshot and it is solved 
i've pushed what i _think_ should be fixes for the shading problems to a separate branch  shade dependencies  as i was a bit worried that it might not be totally correct  if you can try that just as a sanity check  i e  that you don't get wierd classnotfounds   a 0 9 beta1 sounds a good idea 
i have been using zap 2 6 0 for normal use  when i'm debugging i have been using the development build pulled last week    about the workaround  do you refer to the following steps  1  enable global http session tracking 2  open the request editor 3  select the cookie "use current tracking session" 4  disable global http session tracking 5  send request  in my attempts  this has been able to send the request in "ignore_cookie" mode  in the dev build     to answer your question  i think the request editor should not use any http state  and thus use the ignore_cookie mode  unless the user enables the option "use global http session tracking"  then it should use the global state  therefore using the "browser_compatibility" option or the "default" option  i think it is defaulted to rfc_2109      i must say i do not fully understand the difference between the global http states and the non global variant  could you elaborate on this  what is the functional use of a non global http state tracking in the request editor 
no crash at all just simple restart of app as you can see in device  i'm using nexus 6 lollipop  and nexus 4 lollipop    problem occur in only nexus 6 but not reproducible on nexus 4

 justacodefan  i would be able  but i do not have the necessary time right now  we are having an upcoming deadline for the project containing this issue and we still have a lot of other tasks to complete  the basic steps would be  1 create a project in android studio  “androidproject” 2 create 2 flavor dimensions  “dimension1”  “dimension2” 3 create 3 flavors  “flavor1” and set “dimension1” for it 		 “flavor2” and set “dimension1” for it 		 “flavor3” and set “dimension2” for it 4 create 2 sentry projects  “sentryproject1” and “sentryproject2” 5 set “sentryproject1” data in sentry properties in the root folder of “androidproject” 6 set “sentryproject2” data in sentry properties in the source folder for one flavor combination of flavors  ex  “  androidproject app src flavor3” 7 set build variant to something including flavor3 all of them should since we got only one flavor with “dimension2”   release variant  8 set autoupload for proguard mapping  9 compile 10 notice that the mapping goes to “sentryproject1” instead of “sentryproject2”  let me know if there is anything else i can do to help

and that is what happens  yet  on the device registry side  that request is still present and will be processed  delaying requests coming in after that  so all requests which arrive in the future will also time out    it does  but that is not the problem    yes   assuming you have a device registry which allows for 100 credits  but only can process 1 request a second and the timeout it one second  and the request rate is 10 requests per second   on the first second  you have 10 accepted requests and 1 response  9 timeouts  and 9 requests in the queue  as canceling requests doesn't remove them on the device registry side   on the second you have 10 accepted requests  1 response  already timed out   10 timeouts and 18 requests on the queue …

that throws a            error  at least on my mssql 2012 server   guess you would have to add a new "else if" for the "mssqldialect" and then the sql should be    alter table jv_snapshot add version bigint 
we have a pom called  grails dependencies  that basically is just used to refer to other dependencies  when this is declared as a dependency in the app  the pom is included in the built jars  lib  directory   i don't understand how this can be "pilot error"  it is quite common practise in maven to publish just a pom that includes the necessary dependencies without publishing an associated jar file 
i'm afraid i've got no error  and as for the code  i don't have any piece ready   i can try to make one  but can't promise  i've got lots to do currently   concerning the gwtupload problem with gwtbootstrap3  it actually works  but wait until the end of its retry policy to call  onfinishupload   this leads to 2 to 3 minutes waiting before the download shows as finished  even though it could have been done in less than a second    downgrading gwtbootstrap3 fixed the problem for me  but i don't see why it should be related   does gwtbootstrap3 overrides some of gwt's methods 
 system err log  file is present but indeed empty  0 kb    i disabled ssl verification for geek and tried adding it again from scratch

for your convenience  i have  generated sample certificates  https   github com jenkinsci docker plugin files 107507 docker internal certificates zip  for 1 server and 1 client   those certificates were generated with  openssl 0 9 8zg 14 july 2015  on mac os x 10 11 2   i have production certificates which were generated by  openssl 1 0 1e fips 11 feb 2013  on centos linux release 7 2 1511  core    both seem to replicate the issue   i'll attempt to write up a test case though my java skills are pretty weak   i'm a lot better at reading java than i am at writing it  if that makes sense         additionally  your hypothesis about "caused by multiple docker java libraries from different plugins in your jenkins installation" is likely incorrect   i newly provisioned jenkins today  and yesterday    the only plugins installed other than the built in are  git  github  github oauth  docker plugin   there's no other docker related plugins installed

hmmm  not really sure  the bug was due to a malformed uri  which shouldn't really affect the cells  but it did anyway  i do remember that restarting the app fixed them  can't really confirm because both all branches are now completely different from master

the app init can call a method  e g   settings isinitialized    which is mostly the same as present  then it can start the settings activity  the current method in settings  which causes the problem  request also this method and returns null  like we have it now     edit    easier  make  setting isinitialized    public and call it together with  setting getlogin    in the init process   getlogin    return either login credentials or null and is not involved in starting the settings activity

no reports from nightly users so far  but afaik we had less complaints in general and a better playstore feedback since we introduced the general concept of googleplayservices and the sensor work as is  therefore i do see some risk in changing the default sensor    maybe we should stay with the orientation and offer rotation as an option in settings  so reverse the current priority   could be less dangerous but still a help for users having problems  to be explained in the faq then  
thanks  pejovica  i confirm that the proposed patch fixes it

i'm not sure i understand what you mean 
i don't  but i'll contact the guys running the server to provide one  once i have it  is there a way i can give you the url without the whole internet knowing 
thanks for fixing this so quickly  i tested with latest build  and it fixed my issue  please help to schedule release
thanks ill mention this to the admin  and no i cannot provide any further infromation beyond what i have  i have no access to any server files  and admin recently disabled  plugins command   but thanks for the replies  i'll let him know about this profile reset  which in my mind sounds like the most logic thing to work on  prior to what i described above  i had lots of items duplicating when placing and removing them   items disappearing when i die  and duplicated into other items   like one example my sword got turned into steak  food  when i was first hitting with the sword   then ran low on health  switched to food rightbefore i died  holding down rightclick to eat   the sword was then gone  and instead of having that 1 stack of steak  i now had two stacks with the same quantity  this happen whilst fighting "bosses" that was created from the plugin bosselite  or something     atleast a boss plugin   later i had placed redstone on the ground  and was going to remove that redstone piece   and place a piston when i placed the piston the piston disappeard   then when i right clicked the ground where that piston was  it placed redstone whilst i had nothing in my hand  due to berserker triggering even if i was holding an item in my hand   then when i rightclicked on the ground redstone appears  from "thin air" i could still tap the redstone again creating a new entity duplicating redstone dust  but the piston was forever gone  these things happening and also getting loads of these lagspikes after teleport i do not know exactly whats causing it   i'm now digging through bukkit forums to find more solutions 
i already had 2 hd accounts  both non empty  and created third one  with nothing on it  of course  then i selected it  pressed "delete" in menu  and that just deleted its label but left the account row itself that says "contains one private key " i think  hd account can only be deleted if it has no transaction history  the "delete" option is not available for my other accounts   but in this particular case the account was empty and it didn't work out 
i couldn't find anything that looked related  but here's a log file just in case   2018 07 07 4 log  https   github com cyclopsmc evilcraft files 2173523 2018 07 07 4 log

 erdeved sorry for late response  but  the batterydrain is gone for me since i made an reset of the phone  android 9 stable and nextcloud 3 2 1   i have enabled autoupload from camera and screenshots  with wifi only 
it applies to exec's  shell operations and file copies   for example    i created a remote file "testfileÄÖÜ txt" using sftp  scp  exec and shell each     in winscp it gets displayed as "testfileÃ„Ã–Ãœ txt"  in putty it gets displayed in 2 lines like "testfileÃ nÃÃ txt"    when listing files in sshj using "ls" or sftpclient ls    a file "testfileÄÖÜ txt" that was remotely created using putty or winscp gets displayed as "testfile    txt"    calling getbytes   returns "84  101  115  116  70  105  108  101   17   65   67   17   65   67   17   65   67  46  116  120  116"  each ' ' is encoded as " 17   65   67"    on the other hand  all files created with sshj will be displayed correctly    existing files can't be found  executing "cat testfileÄÖÜ txt" results in "cat  0652 050 cannot open testfileÄÖÜ txt " and only works if the file was created using sshj  e g  when "testfileÃ„Ã–Ãœ txt" exists  same for sftp scp downloads

currently  stellar sky 0 1 4 6  though i plan to update to later builds for my modpack soon 
yeah was running a version from a week ago  just re forked to the latest and everything is working as intended 
i tried with dita ot 2 1 2 as well   the behaviour and result is exactly the same 
i would settle for either smushing it all into one line     as long as there's no lines starting with     and it compiles i could go either way  my work around just moves the "  true" back on to the previous line 
well idk to what it was related  but it seems to be fixed now   
if you disallow a block like water onupdate it would technically be called whenever the nature changes a block in this case whenever a player replaces lava with another block it would block the placement

ah  it's fairly simple actually  see  while testing i figured out that pretty much all passive coolers have far  far too little cooling to be useful in such a large reactor  and most of the actives weren't great either  however  the default cooling value for glowstone is five times as high as the next highest liquid  80 000 for glowstone vs 16 000 for liquid helium  so  i made a sort of cascading grid layout  and filled the entire reactor volume with it     2017 12 10_16 34 13  https   user images githubusercontent com 16315400 33809675 9c67d88e ddc8 11e7 9101 531ee0a3df79 png    2017 12 10_16 33 58  https   user images githubusercontent com 16315400 33809676 9fb52aa0 ddc8 11e7 8f2f d41897d6f08d png   anything with heat production much higher than thorium produced far too much heat  but thorium oxide is just about right  and really efficient as well   i haven't tried turning it on since the fix went out  so i'm not sure how much glowstone it'll require  but i think i'll manage  at worst  i might have to set up a dedicated et void miner for it 
this is a very large file  here is the output    details  summary log output  summary      details   it seems as though the output is different  this is strange since the build runs the same each time  i can execute the build manually ten times and a smattering will fail  guaranteed  however  it seems as though instead of printing  org eclipse jetty server server  started   it printed  org eclipse jetty server server  jetty 9 3 z snapshot   and i should look for  org eclipse jetty server handler contexthandler  started   what an odd thing 
nope  but someone got that error somehow  
 costin yes  it works  thank you 
thank you for amazing response time 😄   there is a doc site for that  https   developer android com training testing unit testing local unit tests html  if you're using gradle i think it would just be easy to do a small subproject that applies the android plugins and follow that guide  i don't think you need to do any real android programming for this but if gradle complains you can just generate an empty android project with android studio   i'll test the snapshot later today and come back 
yes

this was  unfortunate copy paste typo when i wanted to show on simplest possible example where in real i was experiencing it on different set of loggers  sorry for thath  the problem is still there  after correcting to  org springframework   as described in the issue description  the same configuration logs on info level  where it shouldn't  when deployed to external tomcat  but doesn't log on info when the identical war is run in the embedded tomcat  that doesn't sound like typo error

thanks for reply so quickly  i think #27 provides a good way to reproduce it  based on my understanding  slaveserver shutdown will cause its tcprosserver's outgoingchannel to be null  in that case  calling  in the for loop will trigger a npe in advertiseaddress touri    because advertiseaddress's portcallable require a non null outgoingchannel  it is not clear to me why it is not happened all the time  the only functional consequences i can think of are some residual rosjava processes after shutdown 
no matter this is a bug or not  it is definitely an incompatible change  because the above example works with bazel built before 9c5b310
no  but deleted one group of tasks and it works now  after restart 
you can use a very simple setup   just start an eureka server   create a simple spring boot application with   enableeurekaclient  and add a dependency to spring starter jdbc with a h2 db     everything works as expected

many thanks for solution  one more thing i need to ask that how can i get the changed selection item at my custom binding and post update accordingly  i have also defined rule for this  actually  i am creating one custom binding for testing like when i select timezone from selection then it should display time according to that timezone in date item 
my use case is   run an  apache camel  https   camel apache org  based application as a windows service  so i have a start method to launch camel  and another one to stop it    using the  java  way requires to develop  ipc   inter process communication  as the  main  method is called to start and stop the process  it means  one  jvm  is launched to start the application and another  jvm  is launched to handle the stop request  we need an  ipc  between both of them to notify the first one to shutdown    using the  jvm  way  it starts only one  jvm  it means start and stop will executes under the same context  and may use same object instances  it is more easyier in my use case    but you are true  it breaks the feature  logonasservice   to provide both features   start stop method  and  logonasservice   the  mode  should became configurable and the doc should be updated  but should be easy to do

my debug method was simple   i noticed that i was only reading 0 or 1 from the a3 a5 pins  when the input placed on them was high 5v    so i physically checked the pins and saw that they were pulling the lines low   the pins were physically low outputs  not high impedance inputs as they should have been   i began placing a while 1  loop line by line until i found that the inputs stayed high impedance when the loop was placed so that only one output was declared   i've changed the code  so it works  so i know exactly sure which output it broke on  but it was either pin 0 1  or 2   on a hunch i moved the output statements above the input statements and tada  it worked   this was basically the code i had running when it broke 
happens for me both with ascending and descending order on artists  does not happen for me with ascending or descending order on albums or songs    on artists the sort order is consistently wrong in the same way   for instance "the chemical brothers" always shows up after "aerosmith" and "no doubt" shows up after "the chemical brothers"  even if i sort descending and go back to ascending   thinking about reinstalling the app  because songs within an album are playing shuffled and i can't seem to find a way to turn that off   artist ascending   screenshot_2018 05 18 12 06 35  https   user images githubusercontent com 5641900 40245647 45637860 5a94 11e8 9974 9867183d4b0d png   artist descending   screenshot_2018 05 18 12 07 21  https   user images githubusercontent com 5641900 40245657 46d99404 5a94 11e8 818c 490ef787007b png   albums ascending   screenshot_2018 05 18 12 13 00  https   user images githubusercontent com 5641900 40246114 957e0f76 5a95 11e8 890a 0c0d8da44324 png   songs ascending   screenshot_2018 05 18 12 16 48  https   user images githubusercontent com 5641900 40246126 9e8cd3d6 5a95 11e8 82bb 221c469aa3b7 png 
i played around a bit and found out that it seems like a problem from derived implementation of texteditor class used in problematic jbosstools plugin  i will try to dig around more 
it happened with version 1 11 253
it was the issue of openjdk  sorry for not explaining that  specifically  openjdk is the default java version on most linux versions  in fact  i could only get the build and library to work with the oracle specific runtime and jdk  the build failed on openjdk versions 7  8  9 because of the override     thanks  current builds complete on open jdk 7 8  
thanks  safris   i tested  opentracing specialagent 1 5 3 20191209 144139 17 jar   similar behavior  i tried a relative path  a log  and an absolute one   tmp a log   log file is still empty  so the log file will be created  but without any content  would you say this is different in static attachment 
i had to delete the content in the data repository  otherwise  the neo4j server silently crashes again  and the logs tell me that it is complaining about missing transaction logs   but yes  increasing the limit to 524288  according to your source  does help  
i didn't describe it clearly  now i think i'm clear  i'm sorry   run well   the issues is simply that inline algorithm expression don't support uppercase   it's a minor problem  it just doesn't look consistent 
 hsz unfortunately i have not seen this error repeat itself again  but i will see if there's any way to trigger it reliably

yes  it can work  but it seem that it just write one vcf to another vcf without any change  so does it mean maybe it is the problem of my pedigree file

i checked on the rr wiki and it states  that it added support for the ic2 mining laser  therfore the bug can't really be on your side  it's probatly because your and ic2 exps laser apis differ 
i think it's reasonable  i'll work on it 
it is transport client  i use scala 2 12   that's all the code left  then i ran  lsof  p pid   grep tcp   wc  l  every second  the count increased by 3 exactly the same number of es servers configured for the connection

i agree that would be best to match transit  transit has an index with the time departure and after that says the line and more things in the map view  but in the itineraries fragment it just says "1  takes 5 min"   so  we can add the index and always say "1  3400m   5 min" instead of  "1  ride 751m takes 2 min"  in the map view  to have information about the distance  i think that is good to avoid the use of ride or walk here to have the same output for all the bike routes even if they start with a little leg of walking  also matches better the idea of the transit part  in the itineraries fragment we can just say "1  takes 4 min" if it is ok  as it is in transit  being this way more verbose in this part than in the map view   i have tested netherlands server and it happens the same failure with  itinerary  fields  so i will report the bug   2014 01 29 sean barbeau notifications github com

hey  no worries   i think you can probably close this one   i updated some of the other mods i'm using and the problem has gone away so i suspect your diagnosis was spot on   thanks 
how can i get and use fixed version 
awesome  that sounds perfect 
i agree  it seems it's data relative issue   do you mean add logging to source code   or you are saying about enabling logging on the rest package at log4j configuration  i can not see any logging record in the code   thanks

hi    we're working on making this into an reproducible test case  keeping the minimum needed for it to work and also checking if there is no other component that might interfere   in the meantime  there is some additional info clarifications    what i named as _staging_ are experimental versions that we run _internally_ with _live_ accounts   on a few debug runs  on emulators  had also missing calls to listener methods  sadly i'm not able to reproduce the case  i suspect this has something to do with cleaning the build and or rebuilding the project    i need to confirm if our implementation of  connectionacquired    has some  null reference  issues with  connection socket     i'll keep you updated

it shouldn't have    we had no issues before i updated towny and the rest of towny changes get saved   it's all the same database  just different tables   the issue also occurs on both our test and public servers  which have completely separate mysql   i can try wiping the towny tables on my test server and reverting towny to my old version there and make sure the problem doesn't exist     i can't revert with the data i have as towny really doesn't like it  
no  go for it  i made another slight modification to the script since it wasn't showing the last item in certain cases  however  i've noticed that the rtl stuff is still broken  particularly on larger screens and i haven't yet been able to determine why 
i believe it was introduced when the gpx output was added as it was some sort of required value in the response
the  tmp __rythm folder is fine and accessible  here is an example of one of the failures   it looks bizarre since there i have no clue what specifically would make this test fail 
sorry i did not get any msgs
just tried  the oldest commit it'll let me compile   3bfcae3c779e875ea5f74a82d1359cb8aeba96db   still has the issue 
xabber eedb pl pass xabber  also in order to xabber even consiger mod_mam as enabled i needed to add those lines to prosody mod_mam module    and  as far as i can see the behavior of application changed after i restarted it  from "the server does not support storing chat history" to gray field with info "support for chat history server store is not determined yet"
its only a single node and i didn't delete the mapping here's my version

ok since yesteday i made some progress and found that it is related to recent helm behaviour  i almost succeeded to upgrade my che on windows 10   helm install    namespace che1   set ishostbased false   f   values multi user yaml    from che deploy kubernetes helm che  but chart yaml itself points to the old che release and my che version makes no progress  imaging my table is not so close to the gui room  who must care about chart versioning  the person which installs che for productive use should be able to take all stuff from corresponding helm repository and not from github  something is missed in delivery chain

  yes  it was a clean install    lineageos  lineage 14 1 20171109 nightly   i tried two things  clean install and a titanium backup  both failed to import or to restore the entries    to my knowledge  i set the correct password  yes   however  i did a complete reinstall of the app again in the mean time and manually purged the andotp folder  this time  it seems like the import worked   closing the ticket and thank you for your time and the product  😃
i'm using windows 7 professional edition sp1 with "java tm  se runtime environment  build 1 7 0_51 b13 " now   the  fourth post adoc generated by "jbake  i" is encode in "utf 8 without bom" by default  i just added two chinese characters into it  and it will generate the "invalid byte sequence in utf 8" exception when it's baking    2014 07 10 22_56_12 r__test_content_blog_2013_fourth post adoc   notepad  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 547085 3540368 6deb853c 0842 11e4 9f17 5489a89c471b png   after i converted the fourth post adoc into "utf 8" with notepad++ v6 5 5  i got the following errors      2014 07 10 22_46_54 fourth post  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 547085 3540372 796bcb88 0842 11e4 9846 7fb89abe9295 png   please get the fourth post adoc in different encoding in my  dropbox public folder  https   www dropbox com sh uragnx79mhsq0z0 aabwlovazld42ggxs1z_fs_ja   update  sorry for the typo  all the "unicode" should be "utf 8"  just corrected it 
i have update jira  what do you mean by srv  
it is in #281   can also be shipped with 1 3 1 if we want to  i vote yes   i'll leave the decision with you   
hi   bf8086 i tried that too but no luck  other metrics like alluxio remote host and ufs read is being updated but not the short circuit read and alluxio local cache hit 
 snicoll outside of docker everything works fine   eddumelendez using 1 5 7 release i'm getting the same result 
at the moment  5 since the latest factions update reset a bunch of them    as far as power goes  one faction called vhaah has 51 
i can verify  with unit tests  that changing the check     fileutil getintfromfile f getname      0   at line 66 to     fileutil getintfromfile f getabsolutepath      0    fixes the issue    i changed to unit test sensorstest to verify the value is greater then 0 in stead of      asserttrue s getcputemperature     0d    s getcputemperature      100d   
debian package
we actually pulled down the latest from github and built it manually since we don't have access to the jenkins   the build was from about a day or so ago 
i think the most recently added should be the most specific   it already has a pater of default overrriding so i would follow that  so adding them to the head of the list seems best to me
i have downgraded to jdk 12 until gradle  and vscode java  fully support 13  if this issue still happens at that point  i will provide logs 
version 0 19  singleplayer  haven't tested without other mods  but i'll try updating first 
no  not sure since when i tested  but it never worked on lineageos on that smartphone model  sure  if i can download the compiled apk 
the phone has not been changed   after posting my question i realized a possible change that might be affecting the situation  the patient started wearing a garmin vivofit2 ble wrist worn device that has an app installed on the phone  can the phone not handle two bt devices   or is xdrip somehow assuming it will be the only one   when i try to install xdrip+  xdrip plus 20161124 9bf0276 apk  it states "app not installed"   on dec 28  2016 12 22 am  "tzachi dar"  notifications github com  wrote 
its the newest one that is automatically updated from within webstorm  but i can check later to retrieve the exact version number  the version is 1 5 4
i ran it last night again and it seems to happen in jit_vich_0 test  where the server hits the assert while client is running the jit_vich_0 test  however  when you run the test just by itself the assert doesn't come up for me  to see the assert  i think make _sanity has to be run 
i uninstalled the plugin  restarted idea  and manually installed the nightly build per these instructions  https   www jetbrains com help idea 2016 2 installing plugin from disk html  still no luck   please log an issue here with the following details and reload the project 
corrected in qa    thank you
don’t know how to retrieve a debug log  my email is hosted by 1and1 com
not sure  how do i get that   also i can't seem to find how to save the game on the pc 
fix looks good  thanks for addressing this so quickly 
yeah
hey  yes  the tabs get refreshed and everything is ok if tab is refreshed  i know this is a general "problem" with all the views  i realized just now  that this is actually duplicate of issue #1079 so i am closing this   i had a feeling this issue was posted before but i could not find it 
i'll try  unfortunately it doesn't have an obvious trigger  so it might take a while 
yeah sure  just one moment 
with jdk1 8 maven3 2 5 and when i set jmockit version to 1 36 the error fixed，but jmockit version 1 47 the error happend
 tonihei  thanks for the response  yes of course  here are the test media   mp4   is loaded in the device storage    http   commondatastorage googleapis com gtv videos bucket sample forbiggerblazes mp4 https   video dev github io streams x36xhzz x36xhzz m3u8  in fact  it does not matter what files  you can take any   mp4   and   m3u8       logcat output     i call the  playmp4    method and after 2 seconds  preloadhls    method  at the same time  the internet is disabled     exoplayer    2 8 3  if anything  i can provide a demo app this problem 
yes  your summary sounds correct   the add fails to show the validation summary  above the tabs   but does show the inline validation messages   however  the edit shows both  the inline messages and the validation summary   i debugged and saw that in both cases the bindingresult had the validation errors contained in it  but for some reason the modal view does not render them 
ok  so are you saying that your mod doesn't support upgrading   you might want to tell modpack authors not to upgrade your mod  then  seems like a huge issue  to me 
i've verified this problem is gone now  i've already wrote simple integration test for this particular issue  https   github com redhat developer che starter pull 279  i'll do some more testing with che starter and che6 in next few days  closing this issue  will open new one if i find something 
updated the project to be lombok less    updated the repo on gh   same issue persists

i'm sorry i do not know much english    p2p tunnels do not transmit rf energy using bc pipes and p2p tunnel does not change its type with me on the rf when clicking any bc pipe on it
something like that  there are multiple metals left in the smeltery  because there is that stoppage in the ingot cast  i'm not sure about the metal in the cast itself  if some of that was lost or simply rerouted into the pipes or the smeltery etc   the details are getting a little fuzzy after a while  dealing with this multiple times is so annoying that i just switch to a redstone clock as soon as i can 
i think the only fix needed is to check the servlet version as early as possible  does not matter if older tomcats can't find routes if the old servlet versions blocks deployment with a clear message before it even gets to scanning  or not scanning 
 jakubklimek i uploaded a sample pipeline that depicts the problem i'm having here   sparql select utf 8 problem  https   demo etl linkedpipes com # pipelines edit canvas pipeline https  2f 2fdemo etl linkedpipes com 2fresources 2fpipelines 2f1562939394046    i am not executing the sparql select query on an endpoint  rather on the output of a "json ld to rdf" component  which in turn gets the data from some json files i have on my local machine  in the example pipeline above  i used a text holder instead of the json files   when executing this pipeline on my machine  the csv file generated by the sparql select component does not correctly depict the accented letters that can be seen in the input text holder   in other components that output files  such as "json to json ld"  we can specify the encoding we want for the output files  can the same be done for the sparql select component as well 
thanks for merging it in  i have verified on my side that collections are no longer leaking in this scenario    sqlggraph  is failing to open on  readonly  database when it is opened for the first time when it needs to create some schema and tables

 sobychacko a basic app with a single binding should do the trick  we're using spring boot  2 0 5 release  and  2 0 1 release  of  spring cloud stream   to reproduce we've configured the application to connect to a local kafka instance  after booting the app with the kafka stopped  producer creation will eventually fail with the following exception      we were expecting this to be reflected in actuator but it's still reporting the binder as "up"  an app with just a consumer    enablebinding sink  class    and no available kafka seems to constantly attempt to connect to the broker while also reporting as "up"

as always i try to pinpoint the source of my problem as best as i can before posting in the correct place   so yes i have already disable all plugins and have defaulted all settings    i don't mean to to argue but the bug that i was referring to that went on for a while is the one where your spawn point was not saved and you respawned at the map's default spawn point every time you died   not sure if this happened more than once but this bug dragged on for about 2 crows and a stable canary build before it was fixed when i noticed it   here's where i requested to be fixed  http   forums canarymod net  topic 3171 0  which was fixed by commits   fixed bug regarding server crash when your bed is destroyed   somners  https   github com fallenmoonnetwork canarymod commit 93651f6f8270bcff442a4af51454a39c6aabc627  and  fix bed re spawn issue  i hope   wwol  https   github com fallenmoonnetwork canarymod commit 49e48c81500585ac97b72be54cae8d9ed068ed22       anyway if you're talking about the current bug  respawn at death point  then let me know if that's the one you've already fixed so i can be quiet and we can dismiss this case   thanks 
as far as i can tell it was to mirror the change in spring projects spring session#1308  the problem there was that they use a  onceperrequestfilter  to wrap the request object and set a request attribute  later code  when it saw the request attribute assumed the request was wrapped  but it wasn't  since an error dispatch needs to be done with the original request and response objects  in this way an error dispatch differs most significantly from a forward dispatch 
but what if the two registrations of the device are the same   ip port     the first registration of the device is successful  but for some reason the device is restarted  the device sends a new registration to the server  unfortunately  the device's ip and port remain unchanged  in this way  the device receives feedback on successful registration  but apparently on the server side  the map    regsbyaddr   has no information about it   am i right in this analysis  thanks

yes i'm pretty sure   i've also reproduced the issue locally  my test case consists of 3 threads   thread #1   connects 1000 users to a channel " users user " + id  simulate load  thread #2   connects a single user and disconnects him every 100ms  simulate locking when adding removing resource  thread #3   sends a group message to group " users " every 1 second  testing this with 1 0 6   reaches 4000 threads testing this with 1 0 13   after 10 minutes run  already around 9000 threads and keeps climbing   the only change i did when i upgraded to the new version   changed the messages offer to dispatchmessages
yes i did actually  had to reset my phone

 frank en stein the types don't matter  take a look at  this code  https   github com basishub components blob master src main java com basiscomponents db util resultsetjsonmapper java#l284 l304   when dates are parsed  the  z  is dropped and when times are parsed the date part is dropped  passing these incomplete iso 8601 date times  to the browser will make the browser thinks that these are local date times and not utc zoned date times  even  this part of the code  https   github com basishub components blob master src main java com basiscomponents db util resultsetjsonmapper java#l244  is wrong which assumes the date times must be zoned according to the default jre timezone   stephanwald this is something that needs to be configured in a global config object along with other stuff  the exgrid should also be able to access this information so we can customize renderers in a way that honors a specific language  timezone  mask

hello  i find it quite simple to use the api and i appreciate the flexibility one has to handle a specific situation  e g  i could read the first bytes of the body to check for a specific version of a file format   i find it way more interesting and flexible than the alternative  map type  function     however  i am not convinced of the _call the next_ strategy  it means a programming mistake in one parser could prevent the ones following in the list to be executed  i personally think this should be a responsibility of the underlying infrastructure  e g  the parser could return an  optional object     optional of       if the parser can handle the request and  optional none    otherwise    what are your thoughts on that

hmm  looks like it's been tweaked in 1 8 2  i'm going to retest it   ok  haven't tested yet  but i have a theory  does the code take the  current  speed of the horse and multiply it then set the  base  speed  because i had a mod giving nearby entities slowness 3  so if it took the current speed modified by slowness  and then set the  base  speed to a certain percentage over  that  it might effectively reduce the speed stat  since the decrease from the slowness effect would be more than the increase from the carrot  i'll have to test as soon as i can get minecraft finally booted up   yes    that does seem to be the problem  when the horse is under slowness it decreases the speed  when not  it increases the speed  btw  the reduced speed increase in v1 10 2 1 8 2 makes it require a lot more carrots  especially since i started at a low speed stat after it decreased it initially  i think i used 2 stacks just getting it up to 2 7x  from like 0 5x or something  i can't remember  edit  then again the lower the value the lower the increase and vice versa for higher values  since it's a percentage based increase  you could maybe just make it add a flat 0 1x increase to the speed stat by i think just adding 0 01 to the base speed   apparently  it also works in reverse with speed splash potions  greatly boosting the speed increase granted by the carrots  of course i think i was using speed 2   so until it's fixed the work around would just be to make sure the horse isn't under potion effects that effect speed when using the carrots 
i just did   what should i elaborate

 kiview thanks for your quick reply   i opened the bug here because i thought there could be another way to get the ip without having to access the logs of a container  i think the logs command is not even supported by docker itself with the syslog driver so i don't know if raising the issue to docker java would help  i will check that anyway   to help me moving forward  do you know if it's possible to override the gateway ip using an environment variable or java option  i tried to look for that without success reading the code   doc of the project

sorry for the late response though we were busy releasing new versions of our software and fixing the mess after updating plenty of external dependencies    we updated the client configuration of the pub sub command handler to throw away any incoming  or left over  commands while redis is currently down as the commands aren't the most important stuff in the application anyway  we've therefore added the following lines to the configuration     though we have to test it again and see if it fixes the issue  i hope i'll find time tomorrow   regarding your question of the object root for the majority of  keyargument  instances  we can send you the complete heap dump if you like  in that case we'd prefer some secure channel to exchange the file as the heapdump contains some sensitive data even though it contains only development related credentials

yap  now it looks perfect   can you release the 1 1 17 to public now 
yes  currently all emails end up in our default space despite the 3 rules we have created  we are still trying to debug that  the space does exist but has restricted permissions  which i'm thinking we might need to reconfigure in some way 
  bin startup sh

hi  mzelzoghbi  thanks for investigation  in our case  we use a foreground service  that must have its own notification  not really sure that there is a difference in this case   we are pretty sure that the problem is several processes because we started getting crash reports with this issue right after releasing an app version with the foreground service  it is 30 times more frequent than the next reason in our top crash reasons list 
sorry for the file  the upload did not work from my linux centos  too old chromium    i retried it and still the same    i tried to change disk permission  root users to the folder  opt jmstoolbox    the log and the gui only gets' the first message   see the screenshot  i used activemqbrowser to send to the queue and listen to the  mirrored topic  if there will be a problem in my config  the other client would also be impacted i think     capture jtb  https   user images githubusercontent com 2510180 46406447 dd874e80 c70b 11e8 9c0b fedd9ca687f6 png 
you are right  i might have moved the map around  or zoomed out and in before i had 500 caches  still i can pretty good reproduce  as on my home location there is only one unfound cache  that caches disappear from view   maybe you could try with any location by    open live map   set strategy "fast"   zoom out or move until 500 caches are "buffered"   slightly zoom west east  in my case this works best  to see whether caches go missing
i asked same question too  will update once the answer comes  he asked from twitter  i don't think he has a github account 
sorry the list is extensive  d yeah i am thinking it may be one of my mods messing with the enchants  i dont have any that alter reaching as far as i know  "c  users matty5ps desktop multimc instances

thanks for your investigation  we have added the classpath to the client script  it was left out to speed up pure client operations  but obviously the igo library is also needed client side to parse queries using the japanese tokenizer  closed  feel free to reopen

the fix is required if you want to play an mp4 file  using the usac codec   as well as for shoutcast and dash streaming  in those cases the aot    42 
it can not transfer into the extrautilities2 wireless battery  and cannot transfer into any actually addition machines  and cannot accept energy from enderio capacitor banks but can transfer energy into the capacitor bank   testing other storage blocks in our pack to see if it has more issues 
 szczepiq hi  for one occurence i was able to implement a default constructor  for another occurence  it did not feel sensible to add a default constructor  i changed this and mocked all used method calls manually  for me it's ok now   btw  thank you very much for sharing and caring for mockito 
yes it does  so are we just waiting for it to be published 
perhaps tipping at app version same google is doing for developer console  if this is to complexe close that issue  was just an idea 
 vsch  thank you looking into it  i believe making 'disable gif' option working for swing would do  if it were possible to implement some behaviour based on file size  that would be great  e g  if image size is bigger than x kb then display a stub saying 'the image is too big' or an initial frame from   gif  just like default jetbrains markdown support plugin does 
i am aware of it now that i've discussed it with people  but i would like to have this information in the documentation somewhere  maybe https   vaadin com docs v10 flow polymer templates tutorial template components in slot html
 davsclaus indeed i have a version of activemq running in my karaf instance  we use our own provisioned version of karaf 3 0 2  which boots with activemq  apache camel and some other things right off the bat 
dunno  doesn't seem like a very logical place  the cmr only does lookups and downloads  it knows nothing about sources and making packages  we might use the common package that will be introduced in m4 perhaps 
tested it with only  animania 1 12 2 1 5 1 1 craftstudio 1 0 0 93 mc1 12 alpha on forge 14 23 4 2705 i found it while playing a private modpack of my own  but trimmed the issue to this with testing 
we will review this animation issue from adding items and removing items from the list on the later stage 
i think it affects everyone on every local run  new projects won't work  as we no longer export it   export "false"  in  plugin xml    converted projects don't seem to work either  which is not surprising  as we saw in the user report   i vaguely remember we briefly agreed that the dev appserver really should provide the jar  but i guess that's not going to happen soon 
i've tried previously to    switching to another sms program and switching back   staying with qksms and hitting the resync button   restarting the phone  qksms must recognize the contact because it's displaying their contact photo  but just won't display their names  there is even the "add to contacts" button next to their phone number  but when i click on it  the phone pulls up their contact info 
i thought the purpose of this button was to open the user's preferred file manager  so it would make the whole feature less useful  maybe we could use that as a fallback if the intent fails 
you can get end drones from end towers villagers  its easy to breed out end flower

it's actually a bit worse than the current build on f droid for my set of devices  unfortunately  it's getting stuck in with the buffering circle for about 15 seconds then plays like 4 5 and repeats    it displays 2 6m sec downstream continuously  no matter if playing or buffering  not sure if you can get something from that    vlc has issues  mx plays choppy with dropped frames  but displays buffering to be ahead  i'm a bit confused on why it's choppy then

i've tested out 362fafe  here are the results  booted up the emulator  with shaders enabled  and started up the game  tested loading game save from main menu with "continue" as well as all other options such as "start game" and the gallery  music player  etc  did not run into the freeze issue  shut down the emulator and then restarted it  game doesn't seem to run anymore if i simply use the emulator's reset   loaded the game and repeated the process 4 times  still did not run into the freeze issue again   +1    title logo animations issue remains  also while i was in the gallery  i tested out playing a cutscene animation unlocked during gameplay  the same issue with the green sheen remains  there is also a noticeably delay between choosing to start the playback and when the graphical content of the animation actually shows on screen  even though the audio of the animation starts playing right away  just to clarify  i say "cutscene animation"  but it's not 3d generated within the game  instead being a prerecorded 2d animation  likely a video file   also even though the green sheen is the most noticeable issue during playback of the animation  it's not the only issue  while the audio of the animation plays at a smooth rate  the actual graphical content barely displays at all  only the occasional image is visible throughout the entire video   screenshot of the animation using external software renderer    jpcsp gallery video 1 ext soft  https   user images githubusercontent com 20574569 31376015 7363f454 ad71 11e7 8f63 f1ec66260d69 jpg   screenshot of the animation using opengl renderer    jpcsp gallery video 2 opengl  https   user images githubusercontent com 20574569 31376021 78a724cc ad71 11e7 90d4 02c76b59e0c7 jpg

remember that elk core and elk algs has to be compilable by gwt  i therefore vote against using xtend code in those parts of elk    i'm not sure i get the problem you mention  why would a dependency to xbase help elk core to accept a unary      the generated code shouldn't contain any xbase calls  should it

i don't know if crates needs to be redone  but your implementation seems fine by me   as far as i can tell  it's just a matter of casting on the interface and not the class  everything's alright in dimensions that use the default savehandler instead of declaring their own  casting on   isavehandler  would make it work with everything

from gtfs   "the block_id field identifies the block to which the trip belongs  a block consists of two or more sequential trips made using the same vehicle  where a passenger can transfer from one trip to the next just by staying in the vehicle  the block_id must be referenced by two or more trips in trips txt "    maybe it's not technically wrong according to the gtfs spec  depending on how you read "sequential trips"    i'd be pretty conservative with that and say "sequential trips" are where the trips share the same physical end begin point   if there's a gap between those points  and some dwell time along with them being different physical points  then there's an assumed dead head trip between the two points  and thus they are not sequential

thanks for such quick response  i appreciate it    i have encountered that while building response just for tests   in real world there always  or usually  are headers  or header  present  i've just found inconsistency in logic  there was not a null check for headers and after that there was an operation on the map assuming that headers are present  but there is a possibility to build response without them  as a result there was a npe thrown without any meaningful information 
from the point of the gist  it doesn't matter  it's just simple java application based on lsp4j which starts as language server for yaml file types and send notification to the client on didsave event  it works fine  but sometimes initializing is going forever  it's also true for json language server

i'm still pretty busy with other stuff  and since i don't actually use webdav  i don't really consider this a priority if no one else runs into this problem  i consider this more or less a reminder issue for after my thesis deadline 
it happened with the iam outage earlier this week  in   var log auth log  it shows  aws ec2 ssh  deleting all the users during the outage  perhaps iam returned 200 and an empty list while it was still recovering   nonetheless  this is still a case we have to consider

fantastic  thank you very much 
hey lecho   its just 4 lines in total  2 solid lines and 2 dotted lines  to make the chart a little less complex i have removed all but one lines  the issue still appears  but does not happen as often with less data on the screen  examples below     before    screenshot_2015 09 23 08 41 06  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 5235732 10075107 e60f32b8 62cb 11e5 9cbb d4695aa93adb png  1 min later    screenshot_2015 09 23 08 42 49  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 5235732 10075108 e60f48ac 62cb 11e5 861f 294809f29bd0 png   as you can see the chart reloads its viewport to show the full chart and then links the start and end of the line together  the charts viewport is linked to the preview chart at the bottom   here is the code   chart setup     building of graph    best to link you  direct to github  https   github com timomer happ blob master app src main java com hypodiabetic happ extendedgraphbuilder java#l222   you can see the full code on github  the code i quoted above is in mainactivity  i believe all you need to see is here   this chart  along with others that have this odd behavior are in fragments  but the issues existed before i did this   if that assist at all

hi stephen  sorry  seems the attachments did not go through as i answered via email  i tried the project again today and funnily enough it worked flawlessly  has there been any update  i was able to consistently repro it  anyway    will also try the insiders version  what version are you guys flighting 
i'll try to provide some example  quite possible and shouldn't happen since  alldeclaredfields  and  allowwrite  are two different levels of abstractions if i understand right  one if read only and the other one allows writing 
i removed the config file before running minecraft and that did the trick  it seems like "config evilcraft blood_stained_block blockwhitelist" is the only one that needs attention

the read pairs that are not merged are left as unmerged read pairs  for example in this file 13  consist of unmerged read pairs 
hi dave  it does not solve the problem of  getresourceasstream  which returns  null  while  getresource  returns an url   you can easily reproduce it  by adding a folder  let say  file    c  config   in the loader path  if this folder contains files in subfolder like  c  config original myfile txt   and you are trying to access it by calling   myclass class getresourceasstream " original myfile txt"    you will get a  null  while calling  getresource " original myfile txt"   is returning an url   finally  i don't think the first " " is the issue  it is more unusual to use  file      comparing to standard classpath usage   the major issue is more related to the fact that classpath entries that are added by using the loader path mechanism are not added recursively      see source code below     changing the recursive flag from false to true seems to solve the problem   by the way application loading time is becoming very long  if they are plenty of files to load   why do you need to perform that scan and fill your map with all the found files  is that not possible to use directly the  urlclassloader  standard mechanism by using the  addurl  methods   i mean for resources     i understand that for classes you need to intercept it           thanks for your support

hi there   a  big  bunch of mods installed  but i'm using optifine_1 7 10_hd_b4 too  will downgrade to hd_b1 and comment   cheers 
when app first starts      internal instance   new internal    at  line 131 is called  and then   return connectionpool delegate   at line 141 is called   after photo gallery windows is shown and returned back  when call is made  neither of previous lines are called   i also checked if injected version of okhttpclient is the same and it is    i also noticed another crash  probably the same reason  during  the call that was made right before activity was destroyed     it's different error  but probably the same problem  so i guess it's not necessary to create another issue for that   
i don't unfortunately since it is a auto reported crash   it looks like it is incorrectly determining the maker note shot info which is a set of either int16u or int16s types   i will try to get some more info on the  photo being processed     however  the code path from int32u to setobjectarray   doesn't support this type of call   this would at least need some checks to validate the array before use

i do have biomes o' plenty  the large mushrooms in the backround didn't give that away    but the biome around the nether portal is "hell"    2018 04 28_07 37 37  https   user images githubusercontent com 8942955 39397665 0f5f0a54 4ab8 11e8 9ad1 b135f5303126 png  i turned off spawning  and there is a dynamic surroundings dust storm going on in that screenshot   biomes o plenty uses a "wrapped" version of the hell biome  but as far as i can tell  it doesn't change the biome dictionary registration   if you look at https   github com minecraftforge minecraftforge blob 1 12 x src main java net minecraftforge common biomedictionary java#l417 you can see that forge registers the biome as hot  dry  and nether   looking at your code  it seems there are a few species that spawn in "dry" biomes    also  i can think of a couple of dimensions added by mods that players might want to blacklist animania animals from spawning in even though the biomes there are otherwise favorable for them  mining world  from aroma1997s dimensional worlds  and twilight forest   galacticraft dimensions would definitely be a bad place for animania animals to automatically spawn in  but they are registered in a way that would make this possible once grass was imported   e g  the moon is cold  dry  and dead  mars is cold  dry  dead  and sandy  venus flat biome is hot  dry  dead  and sandy 
you have to look very close to see it on the pictures   maybe this will be easier to see    imgur  http   i imgur com 56c0p8q png    imgur  http   i imgur com kfq44st png   maybe try download and zoom with a photo editor

yup  we run with debug logs enabled at the moment 
i have several thousand polygons that result in this error   i have not pulled them all out of the logs yet  i will hopefully have time to do that today   on mon  apr 14  2014 at 1 08 am  alexander reelsen  notifications github com
yes i know it's pretty vague  i can sometime reproduce it but it's very tricky to document  the only thing i know is that i am indeed having  1  a third app  github desktop  but i often have it and i never notice anything wrong  2  i am experimenting with the layout and permanent facet link to this issue #2287 3  the model is pretty heavy  i will close this one as it's indeed to vague  and i try to add some info related to #2287
this works for me now 
i am using chrome 68 0 3440 106 on windows 10 
thank you dadoonet   that is correct at the moment i don't have any instances running in the second zone  this is my current setup    the problem is that when a second zone is added to the configuration file the communication between the nodes is terminated  i'm using autoscaling so depending on traffic i may need a new node on a different zone or if traffic is low the nodes in a certain zone can be shutdown leaving that zone empty
this happened on a sony z3 running android 6 0 1 but i don't think it's related to the android version or the phone   note that this is happening only on the first of the month  on the second i've checked and the display was normal    anyway this is really just a minor bug 
yes it does  i am using version 2 5 2 now  but i think i have found a way to reproduce it   it does not always work but  since i am using a launchpad plugin   often when activating the bat blaster at

 tanguyantoine here is the component that handles the controls 
thanks  i will try and come up with a pr or further questions    
it is the complete stacktrace  as recorded by firebasecrash analytics  also  googling for the stacktrace shows other people who have similar stack trace not related to this lib    i had 100  crash rate using the steps that i outlined   there may be two cases i can think of   you remove the bottomsheet after click  in the app code   or your phone removes the activity a bit late  low spec device  or the bottomsheet is removed before the activity is destroyed high spec device   not very useful diagnosis

the shift rightclick issue only seems to be happening with the copper  iron and silver variant  gold  diamond and obsidian works for me   the items not dropping was a mistake of mine  they drop just fine  sorry 
yes  there's one sentinel cluster managing many redis masters  each master has a slave   masters  and their slaves  belong to different projects  have different passwords  different configuration and should have nothing in common 
sorry  i completely spaced on rechecking this   as of this morning i have checked with mekanism 5 6 0 639   enderio 1 6 4 0 5 3 129  latest off the jenkins  under 1 6 4 with forge 953    and i can confirm that it is still an issue  your item conduits can insert into a mekanism machine  but they cannot receive goods from a mekanism machine  i've tried turning on auto eject for the mek machines  and just setting your item conduits to 'insert extract'  bi directional mode  but that didn't work  tried with auto eject and extract    extract but no auto eject  nothing across all fronts  unfortunately   i kind of thought that if i just put your item conduits into 'bi directional' mode and set the mek machines to auto eject  it would all sort itself out  alas it does not  tho   let me know if you need specific combinations tested   promise i won't lose the reminder email this time  p

from what i can tell  it has to do with drones from pneumaticcraft i think    
according to my first tests i cannot reproduce the npe with #105  thanks 
you need change the phone language  and after that  you need reinstall or refresh the metadata  i tested it  with development branch  in real device and in the emulator  and i have this bug always  i tested it against hnqis and hnqis dev ci with my user 
ok the dev version works for me  so the issue can be closed   to reproduce the error is quite difficult  it just happened in my private account with thousands of files in the trash bin  the filename where it eventually crashed was  2b kd 0  png  there were 4 5 files with that name   i was able to track down that it was because  third_parties davekoeller alphanumcomparator#compare java lang string  java lang string   always returns  1 if both inputs have this value  eventually stating that  element1   element2  and  element2   element1   which is not possible in a total order   technically  most sorting algorithms should still terminate correctly  it should just result in unnecessary swaps  i'm not really familiar with java and how it detects "comparison method violates its general contract " when sorting  maybe the detection depends on the position of the files in the list  or it's size  more recursions iterations of the sorting algorithm    
using the elasticsearch api  the problem is that when setting the allowed maximum number of indices in the server configuration  the web interface would only display this exact number of indices  these indices were always open  the only active buttons in the web ui were 'close index' and 'delete index' and the closed but retained indices would not show up  not being presented with appropriate manuals made me resort to the es api   i'm glad to hear that this seems to be resolved in the latest beta  i'm looking forward to testing it by myself  thanks

thank you for your reply  my app is for japanese so the crash is occurred by picking a japanese named file  it is replicated when you pick a file named about 200 japanese characters from google drive  something like this     i know it is not usual naming actually but it is possible so i think it is better to be fixed   thank you

 tylerjewell  the root folder that you mean  it is call "share folder" from vbox    i think all folder can be mounted on hyper v  after 8 hours of google ing around   i found out that when i  set che_conf_folder  c users thomas cong  the file che properties are not copy created inside the folder that i want to set as custom folder   and it is different from che_data_folder  data folder look like it copy the json file into the folder that i want to be set  but it is not the case for che_conf_folder    very confusing but i have fun of it   hahaha

hi  fmichielssen    you are right that it shouldn't affect the manually created service in any way  although it seems to me that it does delete the services  i've tried it with the original example configuration on minikube and with a slightly modified one using kubernetes with acs  the problem were the same in both cases    i've tried to collect more info about it  please let me know if i'm missing something and maybe that causes the problem     in the config file  i use the following settings   in the log  you can see that before the delete operation there is 2 available service  shinyproxy srvice and kubernetes  although we don't have any service associated with the proxy and  getproxy proxy  getservice    value is null  the two service gets deleted    looking at the kubernetes dashboard i can see that the pod is successfully deleted  my shinyproxy service is also disappeared  and the kubernetes service is restarted its age is just a few seconds     i'm not familiar with the kubernetes java client  but could it be the issue that the filtering at  kubeclient services   delete getproxy proxy  getservice       line is not working as expected and if it gets a null value it deletes every service    it would be nice if you could do a quick test with the example config and see whether you can access the service after shinyproxy deletes the pod

sorry for the incomplete issue posted yesterday  i was in a hurry   however  i was using the code above for this operations  1  reading an empty configuration with a default value of zero  2   doing some operations not with config library  3  updating previously readed config with a value  example  1  read database version  0 at the first time  2  creating database with migrations 3  saving database version  version 5   as you can see above  the config object was built like this  the first debug line prints 0  as expected  the second debug line   prints 5    as expected  but the   value is not updated   in the file from the version 3 2 0 while in the 3 1 0 this works right         i'll try the lib with master commit and watch the issue you linked me in a while

 samtstern  yes  i observed that while working on   firebaserecyclerpagingadaper   https   github com firebase firebaseui android blob version 4 4 0 dev database src main java com firebase ui database paging firebaserecyclerpagingadapter java    i did an experiment    when i added this line    mdatasource observeforever mdatasourceobserver   then after calling  getvalue    on  mdatasource  doesn't returned a null value    when i commented the code of  observeforever  then  mdatasource getvalue    always returned a null value   by observing this  maybe livedata not hold values if nobody is observing
 vacla  yes  this feature works if system language is set to english   maruohon  i am using 1 14 4 but i have been experiencing this issue on all versions since 1 13 2
i'm sure that dealing with this one will help by using zap proxy through jenkins plugin  most of companies will use zap proxy through automated tools as jenkins plugin  so this is my selling points          all the developers to home i presented zap proxy and how to use with jenkins told me that they have to obtain a delta between two or three jobs and need to tag false positives    as you know the managers need also the information to see how the issues are dealt with and the only thing we can get when using zap as daemon is the report   i hope you understand the importance of the fix      thc202   the alerts are shown with green flag    thank you all for your help   best regards   abdellah azougarh
yes that was what i did  otherwise it is not possible to start the plugin inside of intellij  the same sdk works fine if i create a simple intellij plugin  without anything  so i think it is configured correctly 
on the first screenshot  the "n" value is correctly reported to 82  after step out  screenshot 2  the "n" value is bogus  "err" is not reported at all      if you follow the second option  i e  to step over at the "return" line instead of step out  the debugger stops again  but at line 31  sr  ok    r r   strings reader  for unknown reason   sometimes  if i just hit twice "resume program" twice  for each stop at the "return" line  i get crash with the following error   null java lang nullpointerexception 	at gnu trove tobjectlonghashmap put tobjectlonghashmap java 142  	at com intellij xdebugger impl ui tree nodes xvaluenodeimpl 1 computed xvaluenodeimpl java 145  	at com goide dlv dlvxvalue 3 run dlvxvalue java 164  	at com intellij openapi application impl applicationimpl runreadaction applicationimpl java 884  	at com goide dlv dlvxvalue a dlvxvalue java 187  	at com intellij openapi application impl applicationimpl 2 run applicationimpl java 309  	at java util concurrent executors runnableadapter call executors java 511  	at java util concurrent futuretask run futuretask java 266  	at java util concurrent threadpoolexecutor runworker threadpoolexecutor java 1142  	at java util concurrent threadpoolexecutor worker run threadpoolexecutor java 617  	at java lang thread run thread java 745   last thing  that i've noticed  see my first screenshot   at line 31  is that the reported value "ok  false" is and never should be false  this line always succeed  which is confirmed by the fact that the message "panic "unexpected reader " " is never displayed

i'm using 0 13 7  the latest version that appears via f droid   on fri  sep 7  2018 at 6 38 am  christian schabesberger   notifications github com  wrote 
sounds good  thank you 
 theobald93 yes i tried it resoled #379
sorry for the delay  tasking switched  we are using version 3 0 1  i believe the 3 0 1 version also has the dependencies you mention  i was saying i added the dependency to my module to skirt the jaxb context exception  but my workaround doesnt solve the following issue   i'll be working on this the next week thanks  josh

yes  i can confirm  there is a large case statement 
i am using version 2 1 1  i'll try with 2 1 2 
yes  it is always reproducible   also i just saw when trying again there is a popup shown  likely the one for the sync conflict  for one second  before it crashes   when i opened a different txt file that was _not_ downloaded already and  thus  has no sync conflict  the built in editor works 
fwiw setting the default protocol to null works in my tests  i e  http 1 1 is used

thanks a lot   d
the issue is intermittent at startup  this is a code quality issue in bookkeeper with how it is integrated with zookeeper and how it checks and handles state at startup  since it's a bookkeeper issue  i'm closing this as a non issue for pulsar 
i think resources should be included  when i add a framework in xcode   for example facebooksdk framework   the only thing i have to do  according to their instructions  is to add the framework and other dependent frameworks  coregraphics framework

at the moment mine just skips rendering the board when you set the speed to 32x or higher 
using the code client sendrichpresence builder build    new callback  consumer string   system out  println    i receive this  child "activity" fails because  child "party" fails because  child "size" fails because  "size" at position 0 fails because  "0" must be larger than or equal to 1    
i apologize  i haven't but i have now  working as expected 
i guess that you create new images at some point  just create them as static fieleds once   instead of calling return fmuiplugin getimage imgpath   every time just cache them   see configurationmaplabelprovider getcolumnimage  the images might actually already exist somewhere   we could also just rewrite the method fmuiplugin getimage to cache the images in a map 
 cschockaert i added some information and new issues 
yes  sorry  it is the apiarist database  the craftable one   i'm using  i think  the lastest versions of both forestry and binnie's mods that there are for mc 1 7 10   i'm also using optifine  if that means anything
then it is probably the case that the debugger functionality is disabled in my external node  thanks 
issue  sunforger does not work properly   unable to target some spells  such as tithe to cast from the library    unable to target spells such as lightning helix or warleader's helix resulting in fizzled spells

according to my friend  c geo hasn't asked him about storage permissions  because "it was ok"   also from the system information i can see  write external storage permission  granted   so it should be fine
not sure about 2 0 3 and lower  the 2 0 4 was just saying that this happens in the latest version 
 dilshat let me re test i am gonna delete the plugin from the browser  delete ss and install all over again  let me see if i am still gonna receive that notification if not i will close the issue 
hello  ferdicus thanks for your fast reply what do you mean by make sure that the linking was successful  sorry i m kinda new to this stuff   
thanks a lot  i´m making a pull request right now   
here's the full stacktrace from running the first query with   verbose 
an empty omni tool 
 tobiaskaminsky this is related to the storage location in settings  not the push itself  for me it's set to  emulated 0 which is wrong  when i click to select it and select one of the two options  key can be generated and it all works  
i am using the latest dev build   and yes  each user has access to mywarp cmd give
hi david thanks for your reply  i was just playing a little more and the 13th directory is ok  i can open it  it is the 14th directory  unfortunately since i am out and about i can't see the name or content  but once i get to a pc i will give you more details   just fyi the previous version of the client worked fine with a very similar directory structure  though all the directories were children of one main directory before on andriod   when i resynced  the new client changed everything to be under      oh  yes  and the crash happens irrespective of whether i am on 3g or wifi  best regards alex  "david a  velasco" notifications github com wrote    ##   tel   h   +81 47 315 1603  m   +81 80 1277 5595 skype  alex baker222
this is the same behavior i was experiencing  though i didn't try with plain redstone  it also doesn't seem to matter what kind of light is used  or from what mod

hi  i think that the change should solve the problem   i am using  a href "https   gerrit documentation storage googleapis com documentation 2 11 cmd review html"  gerrit review  a  command to add comments and review to a patch  in pipeline there is a task which sends verification status via custom command  where gerrit review looks like following   ssh mygerrit gerrit review   label verified  1  2    parameters are set in custom command as attributes  as you can see it runs as ssh  not http

yes  the file was deleted from the server  but it still exist on the client in "ghost" form  which means that the oc client doesn't show it  but it can still be seen with an android file manager   the issue with this is that if those stray files are big they will increasingly waste storage space 
yes  it 's solved
no its not plaintext  its the hash

 jeffbrown  yeah  i originally thought it's related to   micronauttest  but then i was looking at the  httpclientintroductionadvice#getclient    and apparently  it's a micronaut core feature bug as you're "caching" the client in the map and the key is determined by clientid and path at  computeclientkey    cc  jameskleeh

the sd  is needed to be checked by the root path sd exists " "  because the current  files on the sd are unknown  so finally the root path is the only path which is existing on either formatted sd  otoh  sd begin   also always returns no error if the sd is mistakenly not present any more  additionally  if no sd was inserted at the start  sd begin   fails at setup      then a later re inserting during runtime plus an extra sd begin   also does not restart and reload the sd contents  a total mess all over  tbh   eventually i have no idea what the lib does or not  but if intended behavior or not  it's faulty what it does  currently  so it needs to be fixed either way

it breaks so easily for me    how can you not reproduce this  maybe it's windows lr stuff anyways  i will provide you the exact steps  1  go to collider wurst in the standardlib with folding imports enabled  should look like this    1  add another newline after  import fx  by pressing enter 2  add a newline after after  import linkedlist  by pressing enter at the end of it 3  fold the imports     the newline we added in the previous step is being folded  even though it should not    4  place the cursor in front of the 9th line  constant real default_collision_size  and press enter  creating a newline between the imports and the constant 5  remove the 2 empty lines between  import fx  and  import timedloop  6  fold the imports    it will automatically unfold again and you will be presented with something similar to the screenshot        http   i imgur com kqh7ksb png   as mentioned before  this is just one way to make this happen  sometimes blank lines are being eaten  and suddenly re appear  the 2 dot boxes appear at wrong places and multiple times 
you're right  i forgot that completions used the scanner and from other ide's i guess comments dont need highlighting  ill update this 
i'm not sure what is wrong  the failures are intermittent and not always in the same test case  possibly it is just a bug in the openjdk code 
sure  i will do it 
tested ok 
 fpj i hit the problem while developing a unit test for the writer   i don't think the specific error is significant     take a look at the referenced code block  observing that the  pendingwritescount  is not decremented on error  causing a subsequent  flush  to wait forever for  pendingwritescount  to reach zero

sorry  my mistake  the server port and the management port are treated in the same way  i have updated the example accordingly    nevertheless  the main issue remains  the   value  annotations gets resolved to the values specified in the  override properties  file  which i believe is correct  given the order of the   propertysource  annotations   however  when tomcat starts  the port values are not being overridden  and the values specified in the  some properties  file are used  imho this makes the overriding mechanism inconsistent  and it would be better if the tomcat properties are resolved in the same way as "normal" spring properties

it would be needed in a sense that we want to know if the data is loaded but is empty  if at any time the data is not loaded that can imply two possibilities  1  data was empty or 2  data was never loaded due to some other unknown issue   in the later situation  if there were no errors or warnings by the system  one has to go and cross check why the data was never loaded  this can be avoided when we load the data into the database irrespective of its nature   this is particularly required when there is a batch execution of similar csvs every day or every week   on tue  sep 24  2019  12 36 am justin makeig  notifications github com  wrote

as far as i can tell this is still happening in build 134  following the steps above and filling out the "dive date and time" field  i invited you to join the test project of unfathomable awesomeness if you want to test using that 
unfortunately this issue is different from the one that we have already discussed on the ml  https   groups google com d msg rdf4j users eer3qqwopow hpcyfadyagaj  let me explain   the issue on the ml concerns the project  rdf4j runtime   which is no longer available as a jar artifact  this problem affects dependency management by maven  which i use to build my projects    this issue concerns the project  rdf4j runtime osgi  that should build an osgi bundle containing all classes and resources corresponding to rdf4j's runtime  you can think of this bundle as a sort of fat jar aggregating all rdf4j's jars  without the dependencies  plus some metadata  in  manifest mf   of interest for an osgi framework  i use this bundle when deploying my osgi based applications that use rdf4j   i think that some change in the build process of   rdf4j runtime osgi  has erroneously excluded most classes and resources from the aggregate

nothing special  my network connection might have been flipping on off 
using postgres  the log clearly shows the error where limit is added 
there are several ways of making it noticable    spawn a block and notice that it is way too small    connecting blocks  making the arguments change text and thus length   carefully move the knot to the point  frame  where its index changes and the arguments aswell  in most cases the arguments are now larger then the block   but if you keep moving it resizes sort of correctly again  this one is really precise     everything where the total argument length suddenly changes 
hmm  will close this and re open if i can repro 
sry for the late answer  you wrote  _"it hangs and i get outofmemory "_ that's something we experienced too      we installed your plugin on our production bitbucket and tried it on a huge repository with a long history  as soon as we noticed that it runs very long   and our normal users cannot access to bitbucket anymore   we restarted the server to have it accessible again  so we did no experience the outofmemory as we restarted before   after this i wrote this report      your proposed features are the same i thought about    
all 3 of those options sound good     a  very poor  example of the implementation in the configuration file

how can i activate the debug logging of http request in vertx   in the meantime i have added the header "accept application json" to the facebook provider config to force the fetch method of your oauth2api class to use this header and then it is working   the facebook api responds with content type application json instead of text javascript 
this is the code in my class oncreate   which extends application    this happens in the emulator which runs android api p x86  i have not tested it in a real device 
hmm  i can confirm that last night  just after the release of amonkhet  that it was not working  however it is possible it was fixed shortly after the release   after work i will try and confirm again if the cards is working or not under various circumstances  cheers

hi  i'm sorry for the delay but i cannot test this bug   i only use tcp trip event after "wifi connection" and now wifi connection is never true  when i open "edit condition" for "wifi connection" i get the message "waiting for wifi scan result" and a pink spinner   the waiting never finishes  this is with easer 0 7 9 1  i have the message "some skills do not have sufficient permissions" but "wifi connection" and "wifi enabled" both have green ticks next to a grey box

you are welcome  davivel   i just tried it in android studio once more  with an emulator  of the 40 times that i chose 'rerun selected configuration' i noticed that the problem appeared only twice  i tried it in my xperia arc and the problem appeared nine out of ten  so i set about finding the delay that would solve the problem for arc as it was more reproducible  adding various delays  to the runnable in startsyncfolderoperation of filedisplayactivity the following table can be constructed     added delay  ms    successful refresh  dotted animation appearing on startup                    50   0 10     100   0 10     150   2 10     200   7 10     250   7 10     300   9 10     350   10 10  
no  i only know what i'm seeing here  and the apparent inability to ignore it   i tested this in a few ides below   they all show different information than flyway   perhaps it's the driver interpretation   in any case  this blocks us from proceeding with the poc we are doing on the trial for pro   will we be able to get our time extended once we have a resolution to this   datagrip   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 24945592 51751461 8cb0b280 207a 11e9 8a08 a4ae77922e87 png   ssql server management studio   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 24945592 51751645 f03ae000 207a 11e9 8582 2cb90aafc186 png   sql operations studio   image  https   user images githubusercontent com 24945592 51751716 2c6e4080 207b 11e9 98cd d0e3db4c25f7 png

i will try to check on this later  but to continue my app i had already changed the logic to use non null values instead of nulls   i had actually run into another strange situation between two computers where i saw integer returned in one emulator  but long from the other emulator    to ignore that  i changed my local variables to  number  
it is intended to operate on these fuels for these values  biofuel cell               6 000 eu coalfuel cell            16 000 eu biofuel                     32 000 eu bio diesel cell          32 000 eu nitro coalfuel cell     48 000 eu fuel                         384 000 eu nitro diesel cell        400 000 eu  however currently it only consumes lava cells and gives no empty cells or power in return 
 dadoonet ok  that'd be a good message in lieu of the npe but i am able to successfully use the keys  etc  in other tools to access the blob storage   also  i had been successfully doing this w  es 6 0 so i'm not sure what changed   here's my repository creation request   oh  and yes it's a fresh installation   i've simply been doing reindex from remote from my es 1 7 5 cluster but it's not an upgrade of any kind 
from what i've seen it appears to happen on entity fields every time   also i'm not sure if it's really a false positive since it is indeed overriding the parent class field name  i still want this inspection in most cases  just not this particular instance 
we're using 1 8 3  there's no upgrade visible in the plugin manager though 
no  only with vistextfield

thanks  eivantsov for testing this  i've researched this a bit more and discovered that what i am experiencing was reported in issue #3324  the workspace structure is created properly  as you demonstrated  but the workspace container creates projects and files in  data  not in  my data che data   i believe this has been fixed in pr #3318 which has other changes  i'm trying to find a recent build that i can use to test this  the nightly build is failing because che server creates the directory structure as root and then launches the workspaces with user 1000  so they can't properly write into the storage area

yep  i don't either  i've debugged the application in spring boot and something should call  embeddedvalueresolutionsupport#setembeddedvalueresolver  but it's not clear as why it's not called  i don't think the background thing has any effect   perhaps  rstoyanchev knows a bit more about that part before i start digging again

yes i do have some saves  i looked back through my save archive and i managed to locate one before and after the problem  again  this is using mekhq 42    astec bug saves and custom units zip  https   github com megamek mekhq files 818493 astec bug saves and custom units zip     i included my entire custom unit folder for this specific campaign  it probably won't load without it    c82 is the save made on june 3  there is an impending extraction mission where i have to rescue 4 civilian vehicles    c83 is a save made on june 4 the day after the extraction was complete and i had received several dependants as my bonus reward  this one shows astech work minutes as zero   i did some basic testing on my own and here is what i found     i took save c82 and reran the extraction mission again  i didn't actually play out the mission in full  i simply deployed all units and then used  victory to end the game  this generated the "astech test campaign" mul file  i then reloaded save c82 several times and used this mul file to resolve the mission instantly until it rewarded me with dependants again  6 to be specific  i then saved the game  this is save c82a    if i load up c82a and hit the button to advance the day  the astech minutes pool instantly drops to zero  just like save c83  in order to fix the problem i have to fire all temporary astechs and then rehire them    i thought it might have to do with work jobs that were in progress when the day ended  so i used the gm tools to finish all of the work in the repair bay and warehouse  this had no effect  astech minutes still became zero  i tried again and simply deleted all mechs and parts that were being worked on  same result    i tried using the gm tools to delete all of my dependants and then advanced the day  this had no effect  the astech minutes still became zero  however in this case all i had to do was bring all astech teams to full  i did not have to fire all of the temporary astechs first

thanks for the quick fix    much appreciated   as far as the boot logging you were interested in  here's a comparison between 2 1 3     as i understand it the slave response for ip xxx yyy zzz 67 is arriving in a separate packet before xxx yyy zzz 65  which seems to be overwriting  or somehow losing  the response from 67   if you want me to log a separate issue for this let me know and i'd be happy to   thanks again

my think is    the  finishing  state is either short  nothing to commit m or cannot be interrupted  because apparently we cannot abort transaction during its commit phase   so i think that  finishing  state should be uninterruptible and attempt to fail cancel query in this state should be ineffective  ideally  should throw    i am aware this isn't ideal  committing can take considerable amount of time   but the apparently only alternative    fail query but continue work and retain all results    is less appealing   cc  dain  electrum

oh    interesting  i did not know that was a new feature now   ok  well that does change things a   little    but i'll explain the most basic method of how we would create an item with a recipe in the _old_ rpgitems 3 4  aka 3 0 4       rpgitem furball create  rpgitem furball display  6a  egross  7furball  rpgitem furball lore the result of nyaacat's excessive preening   rpgitem furball item firework_charge  rpgitem furball damage 10 15  rpgitem furball recipe _ place recipe items in a pattern  close menu _ done  what is of note is that the command we used was    rpgitem  itemname  recipe    when i attempted to use that command on v3 5 100  it kept coming up with the help text  and that is when i noticed it would display the "chance" option  so i figured i'll just use 1  since that generally is 100  in rpgitems   and the recipe menu showed up   _however_  the key here is that we never used the chance option before  and so it seems that 3 5 xx is imposing its own chance of 0  if an item lacks a chance   previously     also    i don't know if this is related or not  but i just received word from one of my admins that the quests plugin had delivered the reward  which we have set as executing the rpgitem give command  as a vanilla item  this item is only obtainable by completing this quest  and so it has no recipe

yeah i saw the orm and it would be great to use it  but the app's so not ready for it  there's so much spaghetti and view stuff talking direct to the database almost  it needs pulling apart  that's what i was trying to do with the forum package but there's so much hardwired into using int ids and building making database queries and network requests  it's a ton of work and it's basically a rewrite of a lot of the app  the appended id is a good idea    since it is sort of another 'thread'  and it'll never show up anywhere else  and get purged after a week anyway   only trouble is the thread id is an integer in the database  and  of course  everything's pulling rows out of the database and expecting ints from that column  i'm not sure if we can quickly hack this  i'll have a look at it though  i'll push the tweaks i made to the parsing code  hopefully it's a bit easier to follow and it should fix some of the gotchas with reply calculations  there's other fun stuff that needs fixing though  like ignored posts aren't added to the post database at all if 'always ignore' is set in the options 
hello thomas   thank you for your answer  yes  you were right  "just" start order issues  but unfornately binding is still unfunctional  i have cleaned all items and sitemap files  i left only relevant items to this binding in items files     i have had no error in openhab log in debug mode  with tcpdump between asterisk and openhab server i still saw communication  bud no state change happened if i had a call in asterisk   do you have any advice where can be a problem

adding the timeout indeed improved the response time to recovery  it's still a bit longer than i'd like  but considerably better   thanks

thanks  paul    i had overlooked that preference  and when i switched it to  all   on compilation it threw exactly the right warning  helpfully painted orange to make it jump out   warning  suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value   wparentheses     i'll now suggest setting that preference as one of the initial ide setup steps for my students 
my idea for a change is two fold  1  add a 'forcepull' option  default false  if true  ignore isclean and discard any local changes  take from remote  2  add a logger warn statement that triggers if local repo goes dirty  this log statement could include details about which files are dirty

i had a bunch of laser fluid relays feeding water to some ic2 ore washing machines and a canning machine along with biomass to a bunch of fermenters  it worked fine at first but then started crashing whenever the chunk was loaded  i removed them with worldedit and it stopped  i've not had any problem since switching to using xnet  might have something to do with the different fluids being used in the same network but i'm not sure how aa deals with that  if you want any more info i'm happy to provide 
i can't reproduce it either

hi  here is a tentative solution  following the same approach we use in geotools geoserver  https   github com opengeospatial teamengine pull 106  the version numbers need to be modified on release of course  but it's a quick matter of running something like 
fixed it  it doesn't work on internet explorer but i can see all the messages after sorting them from newest to oldest on google chrome  is there a way we can see all the messages  like a next page button  without having to specify a filter or order 
version 1 6 0 is in the pack  and this was in an rftools dimensions world   it may have something to do with a dropped entity bug that i noticed  where any thrown dropped entities keep teleporting  you can notice it in the above gif with the dirt blocks    if this is the case  it may not be cyclic's problem

tested on  392df98bfeedfe8615657448f62439c888649444  and confirmed that this issue has been resolved  i tried these steps on latest develop   0533baf76be6fa9c9b0d3c6fa18855f5ed4d0083    but there seems to be a regression of the block merge crash  so i could not perform these steps there 
 serge rider a great suggestion and it fixed my problem  thanks   i am used to using dmg's to install stuff  will try pkg's instead now

 log txt  https   github com tuomount open realms of stars files 1076853 log txt   i might be wrong  but i feel like it could be related to the project's structure and its dependency on jre 1 7  since 1 7 isn't available on windows anymore  it's been obsoleted by oracle in favour of 1 8 
they are standing on tablist for 5 6 seconds
 allanneves  wilkinsona thanks for these two observations  yes   looks like the issue has something to do with intellij  i went to intellij settings   delegated build actions to gradle   the application works as expected  if i uncheck this box   run the app with intellij  then issue is consistently reproducible
i have started the instance a second time  and also tried your advice  still  i can't make any change in the tree of the configuration editor  even if i don't color features  looks like we reload the config file after a save  but the save never happens  so no configuration can be modified 
thanks for the fast reply  that was it actually  i had to bind it to the build phase manually  i just executed docker build alone 
i have tested and it's fixed at this release 1 0 15  thank you very much  
 kingoleg sorry  i don't know any workaround and thus downgraded to 3 5   gbenmansour i cannot reproduce the issue with version 3 5 and the bug in the source code was introduced with 3 6  maybe your problem is slightly different and has another cause 
sure   https   nofile io f qocgstrxqke minecraft zip mods included   just in case   ps  also  if land at pad and dismantle remove rocket   pad still mark as used   not sure if this can be fixed 
 kevinushey just tried  the problem still exists    img width "864" alt "image" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 8368933 53899728 d4f9c200 4075 11e9 933d edff8e08e71c png" 
great  i'm not sure how to do that though

 tylerjewell the value for me is _simple_ human laziness       i happen to have vagrant already installed  someone passed me a link and i tried the easiest route  that's all     nevertheless  the image from  humb1t is up and running ok 
yeah creative  when experimenting with a mod i like to create what amounts to a void world so my laptop doesn't have to render more than it needs to  i tend to like building ridiculous setups that make placing a block in the chunk the setup is in cause something like half a second to a second of lag as it rerenders the chunk 
thanks for your reply  i'm afraid that i could not post the full debug log because it has been a long time since i last found it  fortunately i have latest log at that time and i can post it here  2019 09 21 2 log  https   github com lambdainnovation academycraft files 3702256 2019 09 21 2 log  let me discribe this issue again  when players log in the game or complete executing teleport command like  tp or  spawn  they would often get disconnected and the game client would display "a fatal error has occurred  this connection is terminated"  they can continue to try to log in the game  then meet the same issue and disconnect again  however  by attempting loging in the game over and over again  they can still get logged in and play normally just like this issue has never happened before until next disconnection  i'm sure only academycraft need lambdalib in my mod list  to my surprise  i tried to remove academycraft related blocks like imagfusor machine  in the chunks which i always played in and the frequency of disconnection actually dropped

 awalter17 the  return void  problem with the  chunker  op was a legitimate bug  it's fixed now  thanks  ctrueden   the  fftsize  actually is correct in returning a list  but we had to look in the  abstractfftsize  method to figure this out   it has  two itemio both  https   github com imagej imagej ops blob master src main java net imagej ops fft size abstractfftsize java#l48 52  parameters  so it effectively has two return values  the framework was just automatically converting these into a  list 
i've sent a full bug report to dev exoplayer gmail com i could also see the issue in a nexus 6 with 7 1  but only once  haven't been able to reproduce it anymore in such device  in a huawei p20 lite with pie seems to be more common   doing some test  if i delay the video playback to start around a couple of seconds after releasing the codec  then the problem doesn't seem to occur anymore  but  i can't confirm at all if placing such delay may be related or just pure chance  since the issue happens rarely and i need to perform several times the video encoding followed by the exoplayer playback before the error happens again 
i see  the problem is the different names in preferences  versus on drawer   on   drawer       at this point i have no     ing idea what is what    and if they are the same or different

for me when the app was uploading a new page and a new image it was just hanging on the upload for a new page and never completing  waited for a few minutes   however  if i can fix this issue by  1  tap the image 2  select retry 3  tap the image 4  select cancel  5  back out to site pages  then the page uploads successfully  just revalidated a few flows and this looks like it's an issue on other media blocks as well not just gallery

 andriizhumela i have a single activity architecture and always initialized stream in my activity's oncreate  but on application death  the stream chat isn't initialized anymore  i have handled this  but this is generally my biggest discomfort with the library  the god singleton streamclient which isn't in anyway lifecycle aware  makes it very hard to be flexible and adds restrictions  it's not a good approach imho  having such kinds of classes in a view would always lead to a crash like like this  i'm not initialising stream client in my application class as i save my keys in my server

yes indeed  getuserobject in com jme3 bullet control   classes could just return spatial    it used to be set from setspatial  but the new cloning doesn't call it anymore  i wonder if a similiar issue could affect other controls that relies on the old behaviour 🤔
have to check with bootstrap how it handles that be i suppose they renders on the other side  left to right  as well

i agree that address validation isn't necessarily useful  but if you view the source code for  abstractsubjectconfirmationvalidator   super class of  bearersubjectconfirmationvalidator   you'll see that it is responsible for validating addresses   its implementation uses  inetaddress getallbyname       which seems to imply that it would support name resolution lookups to compare to the sp's whitelist   the  abstractsubjectconfirmationvalidator validateaddress  method will return  validationresult indeterminate  if the whitelist isn't populated by the sp and the idp included an address in the message  but unfortunately the validator is specifically requiring that the  validateaddress  method returns a  valid   from there   opensamlauthenticationprovider  https   github com spring projects spring security blob master saml2 saml2 service provider src main java org springframework security saml2 provider service authentication opensamlauthenticationprovider java#l335 l340  will throw a  saml2errorcodes invalid_assertion  as the validator returned  validationresult indeterminate  instead of  validationresult valid    in summary  i think the provider should support validation of the address  which may be a hostname or ip  as well as the ability to disable  or ignore  specific  validationresult indeterminate  results   #7517 provides a solution to validate the address

ah  sorry for the poor report  no errors  just the values no longer show up in the manifest   if i use 0 6 0 the values like mavanagaiata commit sha get properly picked up and that info is captured in the manifest  if i use 0 6 1 then those values just show up as empty values   i tried to downgrade the version of jgit used as a dependency to what was used in 0 6 0 but that didn't work   this happened on both win 7 and our ci linux box  i've tried both maven 3 0 5 and 3 1 1   i've had trouble debugging the issue with eclipse  linking the code to the source   but i think that it's not finding the  git folder   i'm most confused how the artifact from central doesn't work  yet if i run "mvn install" locally with the tag 0 6 1 tag from github  that artifact works   if you're unable to reproduce it  i'll try to whip up a project that can demo it

i was actually just looking at configuring slf4j logback to output to stackdriver for now  and after submitting this issue and looking at what i needed to do to make this work for webflux  realised that it's not really doing what i need  that being said  i'd say it's still a valid issue   i've followed the instructions here https   cloud google com logging docs setup java for configuring the appender manually via a logback xml configuration file and using this blog https   simonbasle github io 2018 02 contextual logging with reactor context and mdc  as a basis for logging context based information   i've actually just disabled stackdriver trace because i've ran into an issue with it being enabled in conjunction with pubsub  not managed to figure out the cause of that issue yet but will create an issue if i get time to figure out whether it's my fault or a library bug

i'm using the latest version available via the twitch curse client   i tried loading up just now to see if i can get this info for you and naturally it didn't happen this time  i'll keep my eyes peeled   the tooltip had your normal error line for when a part id isn't found in the network but i don't remember the wording  the display gui had the red x and the same message   further info  the display screen on the left in the screenshot is using a variable card reading a single slot's item from the apiary  the queen slot  when the problem happened that slot was empty  the display screen on the right in the screenshot is using the list of items from the apiary  this showed the big red x on the screen and the back of the screen was red    i don't know if what i was using it for matters but there you go   i'll try to get more info as soon as if it happens again

hi   danieldietrich    thank you for your quick response   i see and agree with that storing the hash lazily _can_ have a significant memory overhead  maybe it would make sense in scala  a language that has native support for lazy fields  where most of the overhead  the  lazy  instance  the lambda for the supplier  the  integer  instance  and thus the implications on gc  would not be present  the fact that scala's immutable collections don't do this is a good sign that  even in scala  it still doesn't worth it _generally_   when the benefits do outweigh the above overhead  such a wrapper class that you proposed seems perfectly feasible to me  we'll consider implementing that class given that our measurements confirm that it worths doing so  as a wise man once said  "measure  don't premature "  the fix for this issue in master is perfectly fine by me  and i'm looking forward towards your next release     until then  we'll stick to your snapshot builds   keep up the good work

you're correct  i must have checked our latest development build and we have switched to a newer build and from all to core   looks like our old version was using  2 4 6   so when we release this new build that uses 2 5 3 core we won't have the issue

stephan  thanks for so many good suggestions so quickly  i will definitely try those breakpoints  at the moment  the ear is working perfectly  of course    so i will have to wait until it fails again  as to ear  tom's project is a war and he is seeing the same behavior  so i don't think it's likely to be a packaging issue    one other thing i do notice is that when the app is failing  the screen comes back very very fast  much faster than when it is working correctly  the difference is only a second or two  but it seems like the speed may be because the renderer is skipping things  just one more piece of the puzzle to mull over    thanks again

i've completed the changes for this  but i don't believe i have the right permissions to complete a pull request    appears when i try to push to a new branch  there was only one file changed for the code  and three tests were removed that tested the escaping of square brackets  however  they are now special characters in terms of cucumber expressions    is there a way for me to gain those permissions  or would you like me to just post the changes below 
yea  i think i can make that work by using 5 clients with 2e9 operations each  and pointing them at different tables

hi  leantk   indeed  if i do first use git and login  clone a repo and such  next time i do try to select the tfvc from the main screen     2016 12 23 08_34_54 welcome to intellij idea  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 3026551 21543548 c81b829e cdc7 11e6 9fa4 86f23628b16e png   then the app gets stuck  i do not get to even see any other window   the same goes vice versa in case i use the tfvc then try git 
here you are   yes  i know i should have used jmh instead of caliper  but somehow my mvn got borked  thus jmh doesn't run atm  still  the results are so far off that i think there must be something amiss   it should be easy enough to reproduce   regards  andre  2014 07 28 13 57 gmt+02 00 roman leventov notifications github com 
the tests are ignored  if they are needed check they pass 
it works perfectly with the number  thanks for help 
as you said   if genre isn't yet implemented   the problem is to implement genre  anyway   if genre is blank or unavailable api index video json type series include genre action  should return 0 items  the example is   api index video json type series include genre action which return all series

jepp the line number is 1560 if i remember it correctly  seems to be only an issue for files which are on the tablet and can´t be pulled in an windows 7 enviroment  therefore  i pulled all these files with a working zotfile version on my mac from the tablet    et voila   pushing  annotating in pulling in windows 7 seems to work  maybe a file conflict issue

 marcingrzejszczak sorry  missed your original notification   the error that i think would be more useful  is one which says authentication failed with the remote repository  and i think it should fail regardless of whether you have the stubs locally or not  if i had them locally  i wouldn't get this error  but it would silently fail to get the actual latest 
it's hard to clarify since english is not my primary language    but basically 1  if a player knows the username of a player that is  rich  or got a lot of stuff 2  that player still have to know the password to log in and do the bad things 3  but before  2   they might need to know if that username is worth griefing or not by using this bug a  if that username is worth griefing  then they will use some password leaking tools and waiting it to be cracked that is downloadable on the internet  b  if that username is not worth griefing  they may stop do it at first glance in inventory  4  if they can't use this bug  they'll need to hack this account first  if it success but that username doesn't have the prize  it'll be their failure  every account in their glance should be hacked again and again  why i want this bug to be fixed  hacker is doing bad things  they should work harder to get the prize  or they will not get it  not just knowing that username had a prize then spend 10 hours of breaking it easily without thousand hours  of course there's a chance  that player is hidden their treasure before log out  but i want to make it impossible to exploit or there's a big chance that i'll not use  authme reload anymore  but it's inconvenience that i have will to run it 24 7  speaking of the " authme reload" command  is this bug related to " reload" command or sort of autosaveworld plugins  so each update might be recommended a full restart  i haven't tested it so i can't tell  if this bug exist it'll even more inconvenience

it's only sending text though  correct  i doubt the filesize can be an issue  otherwise i can only imagine games on a much larger scale  like mmos being technologically impossible   honestly  i can't think of anything causing a timeout aside from a poor connection  temperamental firewall  or dropped packet  is the timeout duration manually defined  perhaps we should increase the time allowed before the application gives up   this is only the second time i've heard of this particular error in the logs  the second one being on the sub earlier today  so i'm not sure how often this occurs in the wild  sarah's internet has been so abominable that i haven't even attempted a game with her recently  though probably i should to see if the result is a similar log now that logs are more verbose   i'm tagging  rayrobdod and  purplemandown so we have all hands on deck for additional insight on this  these softlocks need to stop  ideally before the next tourney   i don't want a repeat of our 2nd tournament 
i don't know what the overhead of  new  is   i wouldn't leap into doing more object pools unless we knew that object allocation was a significant problem  i e  as part of a general look at perf     right now  i need to do something about the process size growth   it might be that  if we really don't have a heap leak  all i need to do is reduce the heap size on my box   that will have the side effect of making gc work harder  but  within reason  that's preferable to my current symptoms   still with me to poke around a bit more 
i will test it again when i get a chance  but minecraft has not high on my priorities lately  and do not see my self doing so for at least a few week weeks

the qa reveal that everything was handled correctly  note that   1  the problem occured when i tested with udig copy feature command and  2  only in the case the source and destination shapefile layer for the feature was the same   3  when copying between 2 different shapefile layers or creating a new feature or deleting a feature via the map tools everything work correctly  read locks were held and released correctly and write locks always were acquired

sure  https   rcrdbrt com blog if it's too much of a big deal or there's a lot of code refactoring involved tell me  i could just add a subdomain  in that case i think it will work  maybe no one else uses a setup like my current one 
 xli thanks for looking at this  the pipeline view is always displayed as the screenshot shows  we generate the pipeline via a jenkins job which runs a java jar using the gocd sdk    i've put logging in place and that shows the order in which the pipelines are created is build  pat  undeploy_pat  prod  undeploy_prod  we do not change the order after creation    also  undeploy_pat and undeploy_prod are just created  they should not have a build pipeline   what i find particularly confusing is that when we specify an environment  e g  auprod  that should have pipelines which run after the prod pipelines they appear in the correct order  not sure if this helps   if you have any more queries please let me know

thanks for submitting the stu comment   brynrhodes  i think the definition you recommend is the proper one  purely evaluable at compile time   i also agree with  cmoesel in that it makes sense to _not_ allow  today    and  now    in parameters  since a dry enough pattern can be written using regular cql expressions when  today    and  now    are necessary  for authors who might discover this thread later  an example is probably something like

hey  joeatwork    sorry for the slow reply  it has been busy around here   here's the answers to your questions    on device   we've tested on the moto x and nexus 5  both lollipop  and saw the problem   it doesn't happen on our lg g3 or htc one  kitkat   jellybean     i added that metadata and the problem stayed    yes  we had 5 codeless events   i removed them all  deployed  and tried again   the problem still remained    the whole app appears slower   it appears to be most obvious when a re layout happens  such as the height animation    but it is also super noticeable by simply calling getactionbar   hide   as well as other places in the app    downgrading wasn't entirely straightforward  i'm guessing the api must have changed since then   so i gave up trying    actually  i'm able to reproduce this without tracking anything   after removing every single event in the app  i still see the lag   if i remove the initialize call it disappears completely   thanks for looking into this  brad

for me this version isnt usable     1  the issue is still here    2  if you set a adapter before having any data to populate the array with it will try to add a header that doesnt exist yet     3  when scrolling down i wont get any sticky header until the second header "is sticky" and then when i scroll back the first header works as it should   
for example when i want to run the analysis for multiple profiles  which means multiple projects in sonar  
the problem's solved  now there are no more fluid losses   thanks man 
this doesn't work because offset and speed are part of the visual effect object  and it throws the same error as before

i have worked around it by extending concurrentmapwrapper and overriding the appropriate methods with the fix  as you can see here  https   github com thegoodlike13 twitch sahyun bot blob master src main java eu goodlike sahyun bot http cookies correctconcurrentmapview java  then instead of cache asmap   i manually cast the cache into internalcache and use the constructor  it's not pretty  but it works   
  test using any file set as "available offline"   have no internet access  eg  turn on airplane mode    click on file to open it  you will now wait   65 seconds  with "fetching most recent version of the file " on your screen   there is even a further maddening delay of 5 seconds or so  where a "using old version of file" is shown at the bottom of screen   after this all passes  you will be able to view the old version of the file   understand that  for example  you may often need to look through many documents quickly   i was at the airport  and had to search through 8 documents to find an obscure number i needed   timeout in such a case should be much  much  much less   say    a few seconds at most   alternatively  a way to just view a cached file should be available   eg  long click hold menu   even better for it to realise that you'll never get a file  when the phone has no network connection   and most maddening of all   i was  as mentioned  looking for something at the airport   so  if you close the file and re open   same behaviour

i've found a work around for the issue by not registering the gpdsc files to fgeneratedpacks unless it actually exist  this will also solve the issue with the listener which then is activated when the  gpdsc actually exist on disc  however  saving the rteconfig before the gpdsc will leave the gui red for the cubeoption until a new selection event occurs  for this i've found no solution

yeah sure     the bottom part is just an addition to represent why enforcing getmockforabstractclass is not always a good idea  it is really hard to recognize what each flag does   without the show argument name feature of phpstorm 
yes   the monitor was rewritten for 2 0 and it just seems to have lost this functionality 
strange  it's consistent for me even with the latest build  58e60970e18a00ff54cd223d905ce6a158031b27    regardless  is it possible that two calls to edit for the same role  initiated on different threads  could cause this issue even after your fix   i just took a look at the source code and it doesn't look like the request is asynchronous  but how is the result of the role updated  is this sent later on by the discord server

as far as i found out the reason seems to be a bit of a design flaw  a  handle  creates a threadlocal for its config in its constructor   now  if a  lazyhandlesupplier  is used  in its  inithandle    method the  lazyhandlesupplier  overwrites this threadlocal of a  handle  via a package private setter  this setter is only used there and its only reason seems to be to support the  lazyhandlesupplier   thing is  the  lazyhandlesupplier  also handles the clean up of the threadlocals that itself has set to the  handle  by this setter   seems good  it handles the things it created  but if the  handle  is not managed by a  lazyhandlesupplier   as is the case when using jdbi withhandle   method   the threadlocal  created by the  handles  constructor  is never destroyed in the  handles   close    method  problem is  as soon as the  handle  will destroy its own threadlocals created in its constructor  it also would destroy the threadlocals that are set by the  lazyhandlesupplier  and therefor  handle  would possibly affect  lazyhandlesuppliers  internal state  that's the flaw i was talking about   hope i'm on the right track and this helps to fix the issue  please let me know

sorry i'm too busy at the moment and installed back to 3 2     i only can say that the database properies ui is buggy  if you do a  change in any field  in our case we changed the standard file path  the sort order of the primary criteria is applied  standard   "abstract"  although we have activated "sort by original order"  its not year as i claimed false before    i have no capacity for more feedback or tests  hope you can reproduce the bug   i'm happy with 3 2 at the moment and we need it working at our institute  i might be able to help later this month 
if you have a gitlab account i can just let you in on the project and you can see the source proper and run it
you're right     gradlew runide    i'm debugging a program within the plugin  if i run gdb session in terminal with the same args then gdb stops at the breakpoint 
it works on single node cluster for me and it recreates it consistently  i tried on 2 and 3 nodes cluster but it does not recreate it  please use single node only 
my xenforo mysql db has always been remote and when you use bungee with servers on the same dedicated server you bind the servers to localhost so players can only connect through bungeecord  when i don't bind the minecraft server it works but when i do it can't connect to the remote mysql db so i would say yes in some cases i need the mysql connector to bind to different ip than the minecraft server  thanks jamiekg
can't reproduce it now either

i don't really follow the math within the carbon reduction handler  so i'm not sure if the errors derive just from the gameconst stuff or the internal math of the handler    if it's possible to get it to output reasonable values for testing that would be awesome

it happens to normal messages   new messages after logging in hopping   also sometimes it is working normally  then just stops  no logout hopping 
actually  i found it's because my test is under androidtest folder  not test  which causes the package unavailable

it concerns the methods marked as fixme  like for instance this one     its already some weeks ago that i handled this  but i think its like this   i assumed that the original idea is that sourcetotargetdefaultmapping does not have a forward mapping  like all the other sourcetotargetxxxx mappers    however removing the   inheritinverseconfiguration  makes the testcase fail with   expected  ' 01 01 2014 00 00  utc'  but was  ' january 1  2014 12 00 00 am  utc'    after some analysis i found out that this mapper  again presumably accidentally  relies on  targettosource   which in its turn relied on  sourcetotarget     i fixed it when i was introducing the   inheritinverseconfiguration  to what actually happened prior to the introduction  not to  what i think was  its original intention    ##    btw  this is the reason i stated that the old behavior of the reverse mapping was quite unpredictable

thanks  albertzaharovits for the comprehensive reply  i'll take the changes for the spin and report back  once thing to note from the start  there are differences in the rest vs java transport api  with  getalias  one can restrict the filtering only to aliases vs indices   getalias setaliases   vs  setindices    while with  getindex  one can set specific  indexoptions    which sql uses namely for  getindex  to not expand to aliases but rather only indices   again  i'll pick the updates and report back 
will do today when we try the next caches     i have unifiednlp installed  so it should be able to get non gps positions   but then wifi cell tower is not nearly good enough for geocaching anyway  so whatever

i ran it as java  jar basex842 20160321 145321 jar  d  basexgui would run an earlier version i have installed   i got the following stack trace  i'm not sure if it's related but since it mentions the clipboard i guess so  
it happens with 'com otaliastudios cameraview 1 4 1'
omitting the type makes the problem worse  the file path gets passed instead of the actual file 
this came up from using a weird  non java standard  serialization mechanism  instead it traverses the object graph  so a customer with an order history will pull along basically the entire catalog  however  the issue i ran into was something different…session activation was busted iirc due to hibernate’s lazy loaded collections having trouble finding the sessionfactory after weird deserialization  it may have been something else  this was a while ago  i filed the whole thing under doing weird stuff breaks things and didn’t notice this sub issue until recently   the anonymous customer is only stored in the session if it has a nullorderimpl cart  so that customer is small  it also doesn’t have any hibernate classes in the object graph to interfere with weird serialization or weird deserialization 
i see this on a pixel xl running the latest android o beta  the popup shows up after clicking on the "open" snackbar action   instead of the "do you want to install this " screen   this is how it looks like when i try to download an apk from apkmirror  https   youtu be cvlrd4okaxi
what i mean is same type of lucky charms can't stack in bags  but is stackable on the keyring 
i download latest nightly and here spiner works perfectly with the same sources

yes  termux api is installed   android  5 0 2 device  ze500kl  asus zenfone 2 laser   logcat didn't show anything relevant  i don't have root though  not sure if that's necessary 
no  i'm using the master version  should i be using 1 1 dev instead 
can't easily tell as we can't go to version above 1 1 x without breaking the build due to the  objectid  been made final so we are stuck here until we find a work around for our  class entityid extends objectid  thing or the morphia devs _un final_ it   p  in any case the offending line from  mapper tomongoobject    is still there  now in line 616  https   github com mongodb morphia blob r1 3 0 rc0 morphia src main java org mongodb morphia mapping mapper java#l616  and so is the  mapper getdbrefs    which is unchanged so it would be quite safe to say it still happens

i didn't look at how the card is implemented but the important thing is  that when moving  1  1 counters from ones own creatures onto enemy ones  they aren't affected  maybe this has something to do with ownership of tokens  but that's just speculation as i don't know the implementation like i said 
hey   so  i don't know the project well to state facts  so here are my guesses  you could take away   enablerabbit  from   rabbitlistenertest   so  rabbitbootstrapconfiguration  is not loaded in  in order to get other beans from  rabbitbootstrapconfiguration   the  rabbitbootstrapconfiguration  could be split up or you could redefine all beans in  rabbitlistenertestbootstrap   so  rabbitlistenertestbootstrap  would be a full replacement for  rabbitbootstrapconfiguration    in that case user can use spring profiles  i e test vs not test  to choose what bean configurations they choose   the goal would be making the  rabbitlistenertest work with the spring boot default config spring main allow bean definition overriding false   does that make any sense

that's fine by me  the snippet from sponge is mit licensed  so you can use it wherever you want  as long as you attribute it to sponge 
 florianesser did some testing with a local proxy  unless we get any further feedback that would be sufficient for me to close the issue 
yes  the same thing plays out after upgrading to 1 2 0  i've pushed an update the sample app  upgrading it to 1 2 0 
seems to be working now – need more tests cases to be sure  but at least sdk passes tests and no weird errors have come up 
yes  it returns correct headers along with 401 code if there is no  authorization  header  which is a bit inconsistent  to my mind because responses for a request without header and with the "incorrect" header should be the same   401 
fixed by #1802 
sorry  for late feedback   yes i was able to reproduce the issue   will try to reproduce with sample app and provide more info

hi benny  i would really like to assist you to get this out of the way  until now i used your binary releases  is there any pointer hint on using this repo to build the plugin myself  i think i could maybe experiment with some debugs myself to tackle the problem  i checked out the source but get lost on the way to turn this into a useful project in my netbeans installation that i could work with  any help greatly appreciated 
i was using 6 1 which aborted parsing  i upgraded to 6 2 which tolerates such a statement  but it seems to just skip until closing brace 
having been forced to forcequit minecraft due to a freeze up  unrelated to bc   i can confirm that a complete relaunch does indeed fix the problem  as for repeatability  this has only happened once  if it's useful information  i should say that the bottom rectangle was connected before i placed the other markers 
it works  i didn't realize i had that directory  is the directory cerated even when only using the cli  i did use the gui with x11 forwarding so it might have been created then   thank you very much our lab really appreciates all your work

okey  after fully restarted phone  only than it started work in english  probably i don't really know  how to terminate and restart app without restarting androi  thought i know how to do it     
i didn't have to do this kind of things yet  i was just getting started with che and its single user setup    fast  but with that in mind  the checks still prevent me from running any che cli command without the    fast  flag  which seems a bit weird    fast  on the other hand  do you want me to test a command that would access hub docker com  to see if it is a false positive from the checks  if so  please just tell me what to run      fast

freebuilder version  1 14 6 jdk  1 8 0_144 using eclipse oxygen  4 7 1  to build    looking at this a bit more  using eclipse to build seems to trigger this  when i run a maven build it seems to be just fine 
i checked the console and most times it's when a player dies and other times when a player joins  i went ahead and checked all configs and   config armorplus entities cfg  had   changed that to true and it seems error msg in console has dissapeared    false by default and it's when error spams console  
nevermind  after i deleted the entire battlearena file  it regenerated and i was able to paste the config file i had before  then the respawnwithclass thing worked  thanks for trying to help   
yep  haven't noticed  1 1 1  update  works great  thanks

i'm not familiar with visualvm but i'll see if i can figure it out   i assume it needs to be run on the server  not the client  yes  or do you want both 
i wasn't planning on it but i can if you just want the one file changed  no new unit tests   what branch   and did you want the apache license link to be https instead of http or just fix the missing colon 
ok  i've tried something different  i changed the mapping etc  to have the same set up as in the documentation   new field    just for clarification  there is no suggestion missing  i'm looking for "bohrer" which is returned for confidence 0   what i noticed is the following  when i create a fresh index and start to index data  at the beginning everything is working with confidence "1"  and at some point  which seems not really deterministic   i have to adjust the confidence value to "0" to get any result   i don't get it  in my opinion the set up is the same as in the documentation  is there still a weird configuration  i will try to distill a dataset that reproduces this behaviour  but this seems to be difficult 
it’s a big project and a large build script  but i’ll try to identity the problem 
from my understanding of what those users reported it does not seem to reappear after restart but only the next refresh after restart solved the problem  for now i asked for a complete list of the custom settings to find out if it is perhaps related to a special combination of settings  debug log will be difficult  due to the fact that the used devices are all  4 1 
its for personal account  and i have integrated one drive for one of my android application  previously it was working fine  we found this bug today and i am unable to fix it  its happening consistently  and its not even opening the picker dialog   its crashing when i am calling this class from activity                                         mpicker   picker createpicker onedrive_app_id                                           linktype linktype   linktype webviewlink                      mpicker setrequestcode id_onedrive                       mpicker startpicking getactivity    linktype  
i'm using mysql  and this no matter with the database  i mean that when a field is a type of string  the generated xml file should add the expression in the if clause for example  if my java code is    string syscode   ""    xml file content is     select id "query" parameter "java lang string" resulttype "java util hashmap"  select sys_code as syscode from table  where   if test "syscode    null"           and sys_code   # syscode jdbctype varchar      if    where    select    when i call the query method  the sql will be     select sys_code as syscode from table where sys_code   ''    actually it should not match the if clause  it should be    select sys_code as syscode from table   so i had to add the code   syscode    ''  every string field every time   because it spends me a lot of time 
sure  i'm not at home right now  but when i get home tonight i'll post it    thanks for the response 
it looks like this problem only happens when you try to define a task that modifies the main class   maybe you could help me debug this problem at some time 
 albendz indeed i had forgotten a word  fixed  thanks     
we should  unfortunately i am on android n where instant upload is  completely broken   so i am not able to test debug this matter  cry  apart from this  yes fixing it right away would be the way to go   since it is related to #25 which hasn't been merged  yet  we can postpone it since i just postponed that one too  due to the fact that i can't test anything related to instant upload at the moment   so to "re enable" me we should prioritize getting instant upload working again for android n  i already started with the build process part  but there are still some quirks i need to fix

yes  i checked it during installation and it's in the users path  c  program files dpf manager  also added the path to the systems path but that did not work either  perhaps the jre did not recognize the updated path     a restart   new login might be required but i am just guessing   edit  cannot be the jre   forgot  that it is a vbs script running there

same glitch exists in ankidroid 2 8 installed via apkg 
i've had a look now  but i'm sorry to say that i don't think i'm able to ascertain whether this would help me or not  i have no reproducable test to simulate this sudden unregistration that we sometimes see in real life situations  where a successful writeresponse may turn up in the logs long after the device has unregistered and perhaps even established a new registration in the meantime   but i didn't think that this was only a leshan issue  how does the californium blockwiselayer class get aware that it shouldn't send the next block but instead cancel the request  i cannot find that logic in the code 
i am using '1 7 0'
 hmottestad thanks for looking into this  i'll need to revisit this to jog my memory but from the top of my head  yes  updatecontext was added to handle isolation  iirc the way it is set up is such that  addstatement  without a context is actually the "special case"  that is  it translates to an addstatement with a null updatecontext   as for removing that line from the test  i did that because the compliance tests should validate the _default_ behavior of the sail  especially since this config option is not  yet  available as part of the sail config template  but if removing this line makes tests fail we should perhaps raise that as a separate bug instead of trying to fix everything in this branch 
works perfectly  thank you

i don't have it fixed locally just bypassed the bug in my code  but i can make a pr for it  and with the other issues that i have found 
yes  sorry  there was another one right below it  for some reason the line numbers are not really interesting  they point to the declarations of the classes containing the methods in the stack rather than to the lines that are executing   however  it's a nullpointerexception that has mapactivity getgeolocationandmapittask onpostexecute and then mapactivity access 500 at the top of the stack  so it seems reasonable to assume setpositionandmarker is crashing due to mmap being null   i can test that hypothesis later today if it's not easy for you to do it

i haven't looked through the enunciate code  but i would think the parameter type  inputstream  would be the most relevant thing to look at   can you read the method signatures or just the annotations

if i clear the workspace  then my history will gone  i would like to preserve the history results  but without test cases that are not in the project 
you are right  my problem comes from the fact that with gama 1 6 1  the reflexes of an experiment were executed at the end of each simulation  i e  each repetition   now  it is only called at the end of the each parameter set  only once even if there are several repetitions   i don't know if it is the expected behavior of the experiment reflexes  but it poses some compatibility problems

i was in the middle of development of some feature and needed to make fast debugging session of master  i had to commit my changes  checkout to master  recompile master to debug  and then checkout my branch  recompile it to continue my work  with codenvy it is even worse because i have to do all of that for 2 repos

this is an oracle database that i have query only access  i'm glad you brought that up  i quickly tested a couple other scenarios  when i query a  csv file  i do get the filter list  i also get a filter list when i query a slqlite database  interesting   i don't see anything in the logs that points to a potential problem  though  of the three log files   log  dbeaver_sql_20190924 log  and dbeaver debug log   the only one that changed when i ran a simple select   was dbeaver_sql_20190924 log  this is what showed up     entry org jkiss dbeaver model 1 920 2019 10 02 10 55 55 607  message select   from rtvccoe  subentry 1 org jkiss dbeaver model 1 0 2019 10 02 10 55 55 610  message success   1   the other files did not get updated when i ran that query  i'm not saying there isn't something further up in one of the log files  like at initialization  but i'm not seeing it if there is  admittedly  i only gave the logs a cursory glance to try to find it and i honestly don't know specifically what i'm looking to find   let me know what else i can provide  thanks

ok so i basically reinstalled vscode i think  it wanted to update then it did and i had to reinstall all extensions  so after i reinstalled the jdt ls extension  this worked as you describe   i think i might have pegged the v0 4 0 tag  confirmed that with latest master and v0 6 0  it works   do you think using the tags is the right approach   we're trying to pick a stable release as we head towards landing in ycmd    i know there's a lot of movement on the project  so i think we can track master pretty closely if you recommend that instead  we're considering marking java support as "experimental" for the first 5 6 months or so   closing this as it is clearly fixed in later version  sorry for the noise

i tried finchley rc1 release but the behaviour is still the same  the content encoding header gets removed and the content still remains compressed making it unreadable for the downstream service   i think the issue comes from the fact that the proxyrequesthelper#isincludeheader is used in proxyrequesthelper#buildzuulrequestheaders and proxyrequesthelper#setresponse methods  i think it should only be used in the proxyrequesthelper#setresponse method so that the "content encoding" header remains in the request forwarded to the downstream service  what do you think

i haven't reported it to cofh yet but plan to  i wanted to get some more screen shots and see if i can do a screen capture video of it  what i am seeing is two behaviors one  a redstone block is broken by the quarry and red liquid comes out and spreads and stays and continues to spread until the source block is filled or picked up with a bucket  the other is i break a redstone ore block with a pick  red liquid comes out and quickly drains away leaving the ore pieces  it's no big deal and to be honest the only reason i have the mod is because it was one of the recommended mods to be able to use the bc tank mod

i have been working on this for the last 10 days now  i have created a test case for it and have also re factored the blockwiselayer quite a lot so that it now handles all of this correctly afaik  in the course of doing so i completely removed all  special behavior regarding blockwise transfers  from the matchers as well   i will push the branch with the changes later during the day so that you guys can take a look  but beware  i made a lot of changes    
i do  and it's exported from the firebase dashboard   i have a feeling it is to do with the upgrades to the android dependencies made in the latest commit referenced above 
since your the one who i imagine makes most use of the log then i think you should have the final decision  i should point out that this update clears the log  only when played via the ui  _every game_ not per duel 
it's hard to reproduce because it happens rarely    close on the report should have been called only once  else there is some bug with nunit  also  endtest   should have been called on all tests before close   
 ronblum in the course of trying to document this i realized my mistake  it seems if you have a  tag included in the highlighted text that rstudio can recognize as documentation  like   example  or   param  or even     by itself   then using ctl+shift+c will result in  #'  inserted instead of  #    could you confirm this is true  or am i still missing some nuances in how the shortcut works   i didn't see this behavior documented when looking at the rstudio ide cheatsheet  but perhaps i missed it  i had assumed initally when i posted the issue that there would be a separate shortcut to add #' to lines of code instead of #  which was incorrect   i think this implementation is logical and no feature request is needed  feel free to close issue   to make this clearer to others who may see this  this is the behavior i have discovered  if i have 3 lines in an r script opened within rstudio    so plain comment symbols   #   were inserted instead of documentation symbols   #'    this last chunk was what i was trying originally  which lead to my misconception

no idea what he tried to say  s   config folder has all config files  but no sub folders for me 
sure  the main issue is the "jump" handling when you need to go more than one item forward on any side  my previous code example represents case when i need to set 6th index active by default right after component initialization  basically it can't jump from 0 item to 6 in this case  instead it will set item with index 1 as active    i've slightly updated sample code with this block for component init   technically  listed blocks related to "jump from the edge" cases only  jump from other positions in the middle does not work either

thanks for the prompt reply    i want to construct a class instance from within a module  that is  what i really want is to be able to write  new thistype 42   within a module  unfortunately  this doesn't currently work  instead  i tried to use  abstract static protected function _construct int i  returns thistype  as a work around but got bitten by bad code gen    i had a feeling this was the case  admittedly   abstract static  is somewhat special purpose  it seems to be a  debated issue in other languages  https   github com microsoft typescript issues 14600  as well 
i guess you're right  the  rfc states  https   tools ietf org html rfc7230#section 3 3  that    so in that case  i guess the client should at least send a  0 r n  body to send an empty body if nothing has been sent   right now the client sends the following     is there something wrong with this request 
it is 255 255 255 0  so should be fine  anyway  the dropdown in paperui lists 192 168 10 24  so if the netmask would have been different  the selection in paperui would have been wrong 
it doesn't seem os dependent  because i get different outputs on machines that all runs win10  though it seems to depend on something in the system  anyway 
here it is 
sure  i provided one by mail  +1 
actually you could have spotted a different issue  i e  that of having nbest in the log of server  i meant the problem that the parameter "v" in the config file is not handled at all   i create a new issue for the "wrong" output of the nbest  this issue keeps related to verbose parameter   nicola
it happens when the server stops  my script was very small when this happened  and i modified it alot from then  this error happens randomly and doesn't seem to be compared with what ever script i have 
the java exception stacktrace was displayed direct after the crash on the android smartphone  i clicked on report bug  but how to retrive it  where to find the log   maybe the error report was sent to the developer of "dateimanager+"     i keep on searching     nextcloud server version 14 0 4 2
hi jesse   thanks for your reply  i'm not sure if i've done this correctly  but it seems curl can cope with the server responding early with a 403     note that i changed the urls and truncated the request body shown here      standing for the zeros i generated  the entire conversation is 147770 bytes long  so since the input is 10485760 bytes i can assume that we got truncated early and could not stream out the full body   cheers  fabs

the issue i was seeing is that there _isn't_ a  gold  associated with the  clang  installation  on travis   clang  was installed in   usr local clang 5 0 0 bin  but  ld gold  was in   usr bin   and there wasn't an  ld gold  binary or symlink in  clang 's bindir  so if i'm understanding correctly  that won't help   since the   b  option can be passed multiple times  what if you pass   b  clang bin dir   b  which ld gold   to those actions  then it'll find  gold  associated with  clang  first  falling back to the default that  clang  would have used anyway if it's not present there

using enderio 2 2 6 317 and forge 1277  and v1 14 of ex astris  which has this method incorrectly returning null in the auto hammer   hoppers  transfer pipes etc will not insert  but enderio conduits will   what i expect  admittedly without searching too deeply  is that the conduit is checking caninsertitem  but not isitemvalidforslot  as this is what i was doing in ex astris    it actually appears as though the filing cabinet thing is not the fault of enderio  so ignore that one 
 aqatl  concerning the approach  i think a simple joptionpane is sufficient  i'd just extend the message to something along the lines  "you are about to close this file but have unsaved changes  would you like to save the changes first "   concerning code  we should definitely not create some static methods in savefile nor in any classes that are registered via netbeans platform   moreover  there's no need to pass editor top component to savefile class  since it already retrieves one on its own  see topcomponentfactory that returns the singleton components   if there's some common logic that must be shared  i'd extract it to some separate util class   also  the code that will handle confirmation should also be as "standalone" as possible  so it can be easily used from other places in the application  i think in the future it will make sense to ask for the confirmation in more cases   for example when attempting to close the application or opening file from dropbox 
a   i like it   b   i would think so  if we have one specific file that's already compressed and is known to fail through the processor  this would allow us to exclude it and still use "strict" processing for the remaining files  should part a be implemented

if you made changes after the release  then it probably is fixed   i'll test it later this week when i get chance to get the most recent source     thanks   dana
i adjusted as follows in eln java and compiled   it did not work however 
before making changes   bazel bin  pointed to   tmp bazel koju1lop out execroot bazel bazel out local_windows_msys64 fastbuild bin    deleting  bazel bin  and re running the build  with 0 3 0 and of 0 3 0  since it was failing the same way with re build of 0 3 0  worked  with some warnings     after the build   bazel bin  pointed to   var tmp bazel  kbpkhqy execroot bazel bazel out local_windows_msys64 fastbuild bin

i don't have any filters on my home screen  didn't know i could   i called the screen where i choose e g  to search for caches or switch to the saved ones "home screen"   since i didn't find a better name for it and because of being the first screen welcoming me   by the way  it helped to delete and reinstall the app  but i think this cannot be the answer since all saved caches   including all my notes for the now "invisible caches"   have been erased as well  last update saving of data too long ago   i tried to save the last status   and i got the message all was ok   but in the end it turned out that nothing was saved but an earlier status was still there 
sure  i'll test them tonight after work  note that what i mentioned are trees  not biomes  so it's only the individual trees that cause the problem  not the biome the player is in  another gigantic tree i'll test is the sacred rubber tree from minefactory reloaded

the tests were done with a already pulled eclipse che nightly image in dockerhub   the following was ran with   docker run  it   rm  v  var run docker sock  var run docker sock  v  c tmp  data eclipse che start     then i pulled from che repo  compiled dashboard with gulp as per instructed in readme  some errors shown up  mostly doesn't exist in the current context errors  etc   using   gulp serve    with server arg   no local binaries were mounted to test dashboard changes 
 nkorange i have fixed and pull a request  tiltle is 'fix 1036'
nothing fancy really  just the spring property server servlet contextpath  data all 3 tests were done with the same code base and configuration  just switching the springfox version

hi jordi  it occurs on android  i don't have ios facility yet   browser is ok  thanks  john
thanks for spotting that  that will teach me to re use one of the examples without fully understanding it     just a suggestion  perhaps the code could emit a warning if there are multiple sections encountered and only one is supported   removing the included content does indeed get my bits working 
add  set and sub works just fine  it's only get that's weird
unfortunately  no   first  it is a xamarin project with bindings i created   second  it's an extremely large customer's project that includes ios  wpf and a web back and front end   
the resultsetutil#convertbytearrayvalue method references to mysql jdbc driver 5 1 version  it just checks first of byte array in 8 0 version  it changes to byte array    long    boolean  you can find the implement in  here  https   github com mysql mysql connector j blob release 8 0 src main core impl java com mysql cj result booleanvaluefactory java#l78   i’m not sure which way is better  what do you think  btw  this method has only been verified in the mysql database  i don't have an environment for other databases

 davidfestal this went from 100  reproducible  over multiple days weeks   to 100  non reproducible     with an error like    it's really hard to know what the precipitating factors are   i guess we should just fix https   github com ceylon ceylon issues 6730#issuecomment 261806500  correct the  target 7  config in ceylon sdk  and see if people complain 
yes that's the scenario   answers  1  device a has 90 documents  2  there is a _load docs_ button on the ui to insert 20 documents at a time  the document properties are the same on each button click  the doc id is not specified so is uniquely generated by the database 
sure  my personal server is w5castv5k4dhwexj onion  however it's not open to registration at the moment   it was a while ago i set it up so i can't remember if i made a root signed cacert for the hidden service  however i know i did so for the non hidden service and would be surprised if i hadn't  i'll try to check later 
i did get an outlook notification on my phone   i can try to generate another log 
hmm  i disagree it's working as intended  first of all the  app elevation  property is there  there is also code around it  that tries to set the elevation   it doesn't work   i've just done quick research about that and found this https   github com material components material components android issues 652  which is also an indication that something is wrong here   my point here is  there is no clear documentation around  app elevation  and  android elevation   i had to spend some time investigating why there is no elevation there  wanted to highlight this to people working on the library and maybe make someone else's life easier in the future 
that build works great  thanks   on an off note  i can't get the project to compile with the provided pom because of a repo error   any way to fix this 
this happened two times on two different pcs the first time  there was no prior installation of the client nor of the game  so programdata files just weren't there  it crashed at launch because of init lua missing  etc  and i had to host a custom game so that it would download required files  the second time  there was an outdated faf patch version since i hadn't played in a long time  updated the client  tried to match ladder against askaholic  the game crashed on launch because the patch version was different than the one i was trying to connect to  had to create a custom games so that the client would update my faf patch  then ladder worked

well  my answer wouldn't be easy  so  the following env var needs to be set in  docker run  for api node  by itself  this env var represents a public  reachable through the internet  ip address of the lb container  so  missing steps here are  1  deploy api container at the end  2  when lb container deployed   check its ip address  that could be  docker inspect  f '  range  networksettings networks     ipaddress    end  '  lb container     3  add   e fn_public_lb_url http    lb container ip   lb container http port    the most crucial part here is fn cli simple test  since this type of the deployment is not usual to anyone expect us  you need to show the following things  1  create a new context with api container ip address  2  deploy hello world  3  inspect a function  highlight the annotation because it would be different compared to regular annotation you'd get from fn running through fn start   4  call a function with both an  http trigger  and  invoke

still nope 😭   similar issue  but not oculus go specific      #373
john  i believe in this situation it would suffice    thanks again for looking into this problem  konstantin
ah  it seems like it doesn't crash with the sample url  however with  bna show url  it does 
could very well be   i'll revert to common vfs 2 1 in our fork and see if the issue goes away 
methodname_args are the defaults as defined in the thrift file  right  that's mainly for programming convenience  and especially for supporting optional parameters but not useful for populating a debug form i think   for example  imagine a user_id field  no one's going to put a default user id in the thrift file

yes  that what i mean  i have not tested with a button yet to see in the button works  will do tonight  but what i'm seeing right now is this   when i flip over to a certain page i'm seeing my image and below it my progressbar  which is not moving   so this is the snapshot being taken on demand after my image finished loading  the progressbar is not hidden afterwards   i release the page and the page stays the same  when i move this page again the screenshot during the animation is still this same page with the stationary progressbar  spinner    so whether i'm moving the page and watch the animation or after i release it  in both cases i see the exact same page with the progressbar at the same position  so my conclusion is that i'm looking at the same screenshot in the animation and when i'm not in the animation  and i would expect that after the animation  the actual page must be visible in which case the progressbar should be spinning

sorry  i'm failing to build the 0 34 version of ghdl 
it happens on most files  maybe i wasn't specific enough with the extra info  but the data in the bug report is for one file  that crashed in around four minutes  however  the one i called the "original problem" the mkv file playing on the xperia tablet  played for a little less than 30 minutes one time  and more ore less 10 minutes on a second try   there is also the case i mentioned about the 70mb files  that are 20 minutes long give or take  and they play without issues consistently   thanks  fernando
i think that makes sense     in general  the goal is that the condition classes compile  so whatever makes that possible  this won't be directly possible when the condition method has parameter types that are private  so  when the target class is private  as in   my guess is that you can lift these to a public supertype in the condition method  keeping the correct types in the json   there may be conditions that cannot be expressed properly  but  regardless  i think you should be prepared to drop some conditions because they cannot be made public

yes  the berkley database  when the web application crashes for any reason if you try to deploy another war  for example with a fix   you need to restart the web application server  in my case  as the database stays locked  maybe using the servletcontextlistener  when the application or servlet gets destroyed  undeployed      the database can be unlocked before that   is a very small improvement in the code but should be a few lines of code  will some research on this and post the results
based upon your comments i did some more digging into how spring data is processing the sort request parameter  you correct spring data does support the csv format   however  the csv format appears to be processed differently than multiple sort request paramters  for instance  the sorthandlermethodargumentresolver parseparameterintosort it would appear that only one direction is supported so in the example that i provided sort firstname 2clastname 2cdesc the direction on first name is set to desc   java doc states "if the last element can be parsed into a direction it's considered a direction and a simple property otherwise "  however  when the values are submitted as sort firstname sort lastname desc the sort request parameter processing set the sort direction on firstname to asc and lastname to desc   so even though its supported the functionality is different which is why we are detecting a regression   i will work today to put together a sample applications but hopefully this clarifies the issue more   i didn't realize where the break down was happening until you mentioned that spring data rest was successfully parsing the comma separated values 
i have plugin on both servers   spigot and bungee i have turn on bungee on spigot config i have set mysql database  when new player enters game he gets his skin  when i use  skin command on spigot server connected to this same database and i have set new skin  this new skin is set on bungecord server too  so there is some connection between server plugin and database  it dont work when i use  skin command on bc server

if they are placed with async ways and aren't stuck to a block they get destroyed

right  it is a server side issue 
my os is arch linux with kernel 3 11 6   jdk7 openjdk 7 u45_2 4 3 1  ant 1 9 2 3    unset classpath  and  unset java_opts  don't work for me 
using 7 0 0 202003021717  it behaves the same regardless smart commit mode 
so  after doing some more testing  i think i have a better idea of what happened  i typically run during testing with the screen off to save battery power  which puts the activity to sleep  however  when the usb comms interruption occurred and the ftdi to disappeared and then reappeared in quick succession  android sent the usb attach intent to the activity  waking it back up  while the screen was still off   which called  onstart    and thus triggered restart of the event loop  this  i think  is another good reason to remove the event loop restart from  onstart    as mentioned in #11   the activity should just be a front end for the service  activity lifecycle events should not impact the service 
i tried after your opngl optimization commit   it disappears  so i close now 
tried to stop it with ctrl+c   it happened to me during the old game of starting the cluster in office network  put macbook to sleep  open it again in hotel home network and having the funny state of stale ips in non existant subnets  probably nothing that happens to production servers but some change caused this to happen in the current master it seems and i don't know what other es cluster connection states can cause this   probably close the ticket until somebody else complains or it happens to one of us

our scc version is 1 2 1   in the contract  we have query parameters in the request section  e g    parameter 'size'   4  ideally  we would want to use a regex here  allowing the user to call us with any integral number  as such  in the response we do not want to use a hard coded number either  but rather refer to the request  e g    body   size   fromrequest   query 'size'            this  however  yields to quoted strings in the generated json stub  e g    "size"   "   request query size  0    "   ideally  fromrequest   would allow us to specify the type of the result  as it cannot guess in advance  as i said  string is fail safe  but in this case yields wrong results

it works fine in most of the standard scenarios  but in my case  i am adding a countdown to the switch and updating the text  which is the remaining time  with a  countdowntimer   the switch is part of an item in a  recyclerview   and  requestlayout    doesn't make it redraw the view  i could obviously call  notifyondatasetchanged       notifyitemchanged int i    but i don't want to do that in this case because it would crash the app if the user was to toggle the switch at the time the view is redrawn  or cause artifacts   basically  i want to refresh the text of the  switchbutton  in a  recyclerview  without requesting the view to redraw the item entirely  i would like the switch to update itself and it doesn't work because  invalidate    is not called  i would add that it works fine with a standard  textview   because textview's  settext    calls  invalidate    after updating the text  i made a workaround by calling  invalidate    after  settext     but i think it belongs in the  settext    method   concerning the second issue  text not centered if different from the initial one  here's a screenshot of what it looks like  i set the initial text o an empty string  and then  updated the text to "0 00 left"  you can see that it is not centered anymore  because the text keep the same initial positionas when it was an empty string     switchbutton text cutoff  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7110330 17709479 13ce746a 639e 11e6 8e22 4d6e8e7cafd8 png

hi  siedlerchr  you are right  whenever i create a biblatex library  i usually set up the user specific library for the respective library  instead of one single library location   and i also click at the save actions   enable save actions   recommended for biblatex   this last action automatically enables the all text fields  latex to unicode option  while i can disable it  i think it is a useful conversion  and it should be rather latex to utf 8 instead and not firing an error mentioned in my 1st post

okay   i'll test it later on my other machine  while we are on the subject of animations  i can't remember if this was reported or not but when you load animated  blend files it says they are converted but it only imports the  blend  you can still right click and convert to  j3o 
you're right  i can compile with these   1  delete ivy's cache  to build sbt   i could move all my sbt projects from javacpp 1 5 1 to 1 5 2  i checked both windows 10 and ubuntu 18 04  thank you  i will close this issue 
build is frostwire plus  the issue appeared while i was clicking on next songs quickly 
huh   it seems inconsistent  must be something to do with my system   linux mint x86 64 with up to date master  1  run the game 2  create character  recruit  named it "s" to keep consistency 3  debug 4  stats  output as expected  now the following steps  1  exit debug 2  save game 3  exit to main menu 4  exit game 5  run game again  ant run  6  load character named "s" 7  debug 8  stats  output  nullpointerexception   i kinda found something while debugging this now  when i opened up the game the second time  it didn't load the player information  attributes name etc  in the player singleton  the attributes are all "inherited"  so it throws this error inside player getstats   when the program tries to recover the name with getname    it somehow never initializes the player instance  i'm looking into this  but i'm trying to make sure this happens with other people 
i tested it that way  because that link is shared on other apps too and it works well  only email on ios is having problems  the link is a dynamic link  so it has several params to open needed page later when app starts
 artembilan it makes sense that it should work and it does work in the test  however  i can't get it to work with a web based boot app  i added  spring cloud gcp starter storage   but i just keep getting  could not open servletcontext resource   gs    bucket   object     what am i missing 
i think the error in your screenshot is not from the staging phase  but after that  i see "success " and the last output line of the staging saying that the staging result has been left in some directory 
sure install beyond reality via at launcher use newest version  load it up check on iron gold or what ever ores are loaded by default via the xml https   github com crazypants enderio blob master resources assets enderio config oredictionarypreferences_core xml now remove enderio and check the exact recipes 
hmm   how can i find out      i just re ran the scan by setting "maximum rule duration" to 4 minutes and disabling "handle anti csrf tokens" after reading that this forces the scans to run in a single thread   i didn't see anything come close to approaching 4 minutes  and it completed without issue   the entire scan completed much faster    faster than i would have expected going from 1 thread to 5   i've reverted those two changes and am re running to see if this is still reproducible and then will run the scan by just changing csrf   it has already passed the point where it hung last time 
i'll attach the actual request soon to make it clear  i may be wrong here
i have verified what seems to cause this problem   if you go to strip feeder and select the starting hole and second hole with camera on a previously configured strip feeder  where z is no zero  you will notice the x and y change but the z remains   now if you do not hit apply but instead try to run machine it will have set the z to zero internally and run with z of zero   if you go back to screen and hit apply it will then  apply the z value and run correctly 
there's a couple of other places where i've seen odd things like this   i'll wait for the dev to drop as a release before reporting any others 
i mean a sticky header  apparently a bit too sticky    
looks like it has been introduced by #11414
yes i meant 980ti 
i have windows7 and it shows "users" share  inside this are some symbolic links for example "all users" or "default user"  opening these folders  e g  for listing  returns error with instantiation of symboliclinkerror 
i'd like you to give the snapshot a try and tell me if it fixes your issue   once i have that  i'll do the release 
just installed version 5 3 4 201902031804   with the same schema if i insert a row with cons_id   1  failed_attempts   1  time_locked   null and then right click in the cell for time_locked and choose edit    edit cell i get a dialog box  in that dialog box i click set current where it fills in the time text box with 2019 02 05 14 23 04  i then click save  i get the nullpointerexception 
ok  i will try it in my test world
i'm not sure how informative my answer to mario will be after tom's comment  but since the thread does not seem to have come to a conclusion consent yet  i'm adding my answer to be sure nothing is lacking   our use case is a service that uses the java cda api to obtain cdaentry instances  i e  our service is a client of the cda api   the service caches these instances  the service uses different threads to serve multiple concurrently connected clients  each client can have a custom locale  whenever the service serves a request from one of its clients  it will access the cached cdaentry using the client's locale   contentful surely cannot know the access patterns for all the clients of the cda api  that's why we are happy to tell about our access pattern  the cda api should certainly support all access patterns insofar as it should be thread safe  i e  the cda api should by design avoid hard to detect bugs like race conditions and this is certainly possible with the solutions tom and i outlined  we could surely build an abstraction around the cda to avoid the race condition for us  that would  however leave the issue open for other users who acccess the cda api from multi threaded services which would need to uncover and fix the race condition again  individually  contentful could solve the issue once and for all by adjusting the api   please let me know if i can provide any further input to solve this issue 
oh  sorry   according to proguard mapping file
i think the reason is two fold  1  to reduce the possibility of creating nearly identical file names  which can be confusing to file users  2  this is how mediawiki normalizes file page names  among other conversions such as mpeg→mpg  and we would like to stick with it to not surprise editors  https   doc wikimedia org mediawiki core master js source mediawiki title html#mw title method normalizeextension
we used maven 3 3 9 and java se development kit 8u101  at first we used windows 7 as os  and we get the previous errors  then we switched to gaffer 0 4 1  and get the same error  so we moved to debian 8  and we get the following other errors   gaffer graph graphtest txt  https   github com governmentcommunicationsheadquarters gaffer files 465350 gaffer graph graphtest txt  so   unclassified02 solved commenting the function shouldconstructgraphfromschemafolderpath in the file gaffer gaffer2 0 4 1 gaffer core graph src test java gaffer graph graphtest java now it seems to work properly  we are testing it with an accumulo cluster and we are getting no errors nor warnings 
the problem is when you change your textview by any container with two textview for example

sadly  java fails to report the beginning of the stack  so it's pretty much useless    looks like the stack overflow is systematic unlike on previous version  here's a full log in single with just evilcraft  https   gist github com lemadec 16371b603cfc205397d7c45872d7d925
yes  i'm always led to main account on login 
i do not 
well i don't have any of those mods  and the emc is correct on some most worlds  i have ex nihilo ex aquilo botania  thaumcraft and add ons  blood magic  the only difference in worlds is the one is a botania garden of glass world which changes recipes but other gog worlds are fine  is there a way to clear cache or something 
it's fairly simple to test    just create a web worker js file with the following       watch the javascript console to see the errors   essentially  dojo and jquery both attempt to use items that are not available to web worker scripts  window  document  etc   the likely correct answer is to use an alternative library implementation designed specifically for use within the limited web worker environment  with the acknowledgement that doing so might mean limiting some of the sdk features  authentication might get a bit weird  for instance     this would not necessarily be a simple fix  unfortunately 
i think we just differ in opinion about how desirable mass prompt is  i would prefer to be notified prompted quite a bit when first running apps  so that i can get a feel for what they are doing in real time  rather than trying to anticipate every app's needs ahead of time  sounds like that isn't an intended use pattern for xprivacy  though   i am curious as to why prompt is considered an exception setup here  sounds like there is something i am missing  in many desktop security apps  there are settings for how much you want automated and how much you want to deal with via realtime prompts  i usually set them to lots of prompts  is there a reason that is undesirable in android  other than the aggravation of getting a zillion prompts the first time you trigger a new event

 ozlerhakan thanks for your quickly answer  really  i can't test right now  i will try monday and i come back to give you a feedback  thanks again 
i'm ok with giving an error message  what's the filter for 'no status label'    label status    still works 
yes  that's correct  i'm using my own docker image  which i have used without problems up until es 5 5 1  
thanks for the feedback  i created a pr  https   github com graylog2 graylog2 server issues 2062

hi  macdonst  what do you mean for unistall   i'm just building with cordova build   release android
yes   i tried using one called "achunkloader" and it does the same thing   but thanx for the suggestion    rick
 eivantsov it was a firewall problem  i added some exceptions about docker in my firewall rules  and i now able to run the command but now  i have this error about postgres
i used ffmpeg to add a subtitle track to an existing mp4 file   so i don't know why the edit list is there  but it seems that ffmpeg always creates an edit list for each track   in my video there is an edit list for every track   the edit list for the audio and video tracks indicate a duration equal to the length of the video   but the edit list for the tx3g track indicates a duration equal to the length of that track itself  which is when the last subtitle ends   if the last subtitle ends near the end of the video  then the problem is not very noticeable because the last subtitle is shown for only a few extra seconds   but the problem really shows itself when the last subtitle is shown for quite a bit longer than it should

i personally like that idea   show a loading screen whenever user opens a folder which has been changed in any way and or shows incomplete data  there are a few issues with this approach though  mainly that the current approach  small loading bar at the tom  lets you interact with files while others are loading  making interaction with the app much faster  if user has to wait for each screen to load updated content  it will damage the user experience    i really like how mega app reacts to data changes   github  https   github com meganz android     it doesnt seem to be running in the background and the updates are immediately synced  i would enjoy this very much on nextcloud

i have struggled for years to comprehend the details of the sam format specification document  and i admit that its opacity and lack of precision is still a perennial source of frustration and amusement   nevertheless  my understanding of the difference between "unsorted" and "unknown" is simply that "unsorted" means "sorted neither by pos nor qname" whereas "unknown" means "unknown "  in the case where the output contains alignment records grouped by qname  the sort order is obviously not "unknown"   in any event    one should not be obligated to hack markduplicates with  is no longer true  it should not be fooling around with the sam header record  regardless of how one might interpret "unknown" versus "unsorted" in this context

hi  i'm not able to test it with nb10 or 11  i use nb9 jdk11 at work as part of my employer's tool suite and do not have the authority to change upgrade versions  the reason we use nb9 is because of the lack of sufficient javaee support in nb10+   even if i was able to successfully test the plugin on nb10 or 11 it wouldn't solve my particular use case

ahahahahah  gps was switched on  of course  that was my first verification      anyway  this morning i made some more deep testing going to work    here is what happens     with kalman filter off routing doesn't work  as previously described  and location provider message says  gps  this morning on the first attempt the app crashed  on the second one the position was stuck at starting point as previously described   with kalman filter on routing works  even if it  always  asks to switch on gps even if it's already active      hope this helps you  do you confirm to try the above attached app or do i have to wait for some other modifications  some other random comments     translation of kalman filter toggle should be improved  now italian translation is "legare il movimento"  quite confusing   would it be possible to modify it in "movimento fluido"    speech synthesis is always in english  not a big issue  but it would be nice to have it according to device language   the app keeps on creating a "pocketmaps" folder in the download folder even if map location has been moved to another position  again not a big issue     many thanks  francesco
all tabs had been opened at some time  but i don't know which was open when the error first occurred   now  i can never see the exerciseviewer window   i select a file but the window does not appear   i get the same error with any gpx file  including files that did work last week   i have since tried some old gpx files and some sample gpx files from the net  see https   github com pytrainer pytrainer wiki sample gpx  for example    it is always the same problem   i also just tried v7 1   same problem   it seems now the problem has happened once  there is some setting preference somewhere that make it happen everytime   could it be that the window is off screen and hence giving errors when it tries to render   is there some other setting preference that i can remove reset

hi  when i try it without my change i get an occasional hang  something to do with user preferences  and the last time it tried to load the url from the current directory so in this case failed to read file c  memoryapps http  localhost 8080 lastgc log  looking at the code i couldn't see it working it seemed to just pass the argument to the method expecting a file name   with the change i have it working though i got an occasional fail to read the file  my jnlp passes a null argument   it may be a webstart bug as there was one reported around these lines though i thought it fixed   so i have now changed to passing and reading a system property from within the jnlp to gcviewer  and that works every time   i still am investigating an issue where i have an occasional issue where it fails to read user preferences and null pointers on loading recenturls  i've changed the code to just empty string if it can't load from the file rather than crash and that works fine   my use case is as part of my test results i have a web page of gc logs  i previously had the option to copy the link as an url into gc viewer manually which does work but it was suggested if i could web start gcviewer and pass the url requested in that would be nicer and i do have it working in principle   thanks for the reply   chris  ps i needed the replace but that may just have been with the way i was testing  i don't need that replace in real world usage

 maxanier 1 8 0 221 64bit java is installed and so far it's not been corrupted since every other mod seems to work just fine and minecraft starts up as well  a datapack is a "mod" within a minecraft that will allow you to get items that you wouldn't normally get from mobs or items you get from mobs that rarely drop do more often  if i'm correct and i'm usually not   the only mod i can think of is  all loot  https   www curseforge com minecraft mc mods all loot  mod  funny i don't know what a jdk nashorn internal runtime ecmaexception is  i've seen it though   i'll go through my mods again and see what happens when i figure out which one doesn't get along with vampirism  i'll let you know when i find out   prospercraft i gave it 6gigs since anymore than that will be unnecessary at least for my current system  i doubt this mod would go above that 6g limit since i normally have around 130 mods  including some game  and lighting optimizers seeing as minecraft 1 14 4 isn't the best in terms of optimization nor are some of the mods for it   right now i only have 94 mods  i don't feel the need to go overboard  thanks anyways though  it's possible the arguments could've been cut off after a certain point  wouldn't know why unless gist has a hard coded byte limit     edit     maxanier it's not all loot as i tested it with vampirism and it worked just fine  i'll keep looking though     re edit    i found the mod that's causing all the issues and it's underground biomes  i'll make sure to give that fml log to the right person this time  although all mods seem to cooperate now  x_x i don't get this at all     re edit again    and now there is an error again   i may have a solution to the problem and it involves a mod i found on curseforge called nashorn and it deals with emca scripts  however  why a mod requires it or even makes mention of it is beyond me since the mod in question is for 1 12 x not 1 14 x   aang23

alright  got it  note  this occurs on any right click when you are not within range of  the black square outline   removing this plugin fixes the issue  and no errors exceptions occur 
the entry in  workspace      should demonstrate the issue  there may be one reason  when this may make sense   when you use  my build my  from different repos

well  so it seems that for aspects setting  proxytargetclass true  does the trick   however  as far as i know  transactional is always implemented via cglib proxies  unless there's an interface to implement  this means that new testcase for this situation in the updated test cases below will never work  at least  unless there is an interface for the stage    testcase tar gz  https   github com tng jgiven files 662256 testcase tar gz

this is reproduction code   just set custom fontfamily on any topbar title     without fontsize    with fontsize                                         screen shot 2019 12 13 at 18 03 39  https   user images githubusercontent com 7337535 70795717 0e184d00 1dd3 11ea 822a af5fd28c1000 png       screen shot 2019 12 13 at 18 04 27  https   user images githubusercontent com 7337535 70795722 12dd0100 1dd3 11ea 9804 d416875d6a43 png   
i can see other players' messages and  tb tools works  but changing the userprint value to the suggested values does not change the fact that the tools do not display messages  also  the only plugins i'm using are the essentials plugins  voxelsniper  worldedit  mobdisguise  and tim the enchanter  all of them can display text  but only essentials alters chat in any way 
sure  i just installed it 0 10 11 on a samsung galaxy s4  model sgh m919  that had not had the app before and the folder id of its camera folder is "sgh m919 photos"
it's linked in my first post 
this wasn't actually too terrible of a fix to implement   also  i don't think defaulting those radios to the first value makes sense  what happens if that field is on another tab  it seems to easy to submit unintentional data   closing as now this is resolved 
not sure  we might have had similar issue on other classes  it's clearly worth fixing before 3 2 in any case 
yes  that solved the problem 
 tolusha  i fixed the problem by adding the following entry below the spec  https   github com eclipse che blob e3999fcc8b040a537c11300de178358acaef4396 deploy kubernetes helm che custom charts che jaeger templates deployment yaml#l17
verified
the issue is solved

the point is not about reproducing this specific issue because it is a general class of problem    there is no useful feedback during the web ui intialisation process  i can give you a command which will reliably cause che to fail but this is not about fixing that failure  it is about making sure that the users know what is happening    docker run  it   rm  v  var run docker sock  var run docker sock  v  tmp che  data  e che_multiuser true  e che_single_port true eclipse che start   this will try to start up and run but the front end code will fail to talk to all sorts of things properly  such as the websocket   and please do not say that this isn't a supported configuration  that isn't the point  it is just an easy and reliable way to induce errors in the initialisation process 
it seems to be intermittent  there doesn't appear to be any pattern  but i have noticed this morning that the count on the notification stated 3 messages  but there were 7  including 3 in a mailing list thread  that had come in  i'll try a day or so with the threading display off to see if that makes a difference 
when it deleted the tinker's construct tools i just had those selected when i looted the compost   when it won't allow looting with fertilizer in hand then i switched slots inbetween last time looting and this time  did use some fertilizer acquired from last loot  or generally reorganized the inventory  it only allows looting with empty hand or freshly acquired fertilizer   not even bio mash works   the way looting the compost is implemented it's asking for incompatibilities and also isn't user friendly

sorry  i'd assumed it was an isolated problem based on https   github com spring io start spring io issues 191  i thought we would have heard about it before if it applies to the cloud starters that  i imagine  are more commonly used  i guess it's unusual to use one in isolation though    if the problem's more widespread then  yeah  it probably makes sense to handle it centrally than have loads of issues  whatever works best for you

right  so let's say you do an xpath and it returns nothing  i should be able to do    but doing either results in nothing being displayed at all worse is if i'm relying on  node empty   to check if there are no results  but it won't work becuase  node empty   seems to return nothing just as much as doing  puts node     p s  i just noticed that the  puts node  isn't printing out       rather it's the  puts node inspect   my mistake  but  puts node  should at least display a blank line  or nil  or something so you can check if the results object is empty 
yes  thank you

 lumpfish  apology for a not so clear description  i have updated it  the issue was originally created with the following in mind   jck tests currently run via stf wrappers  these wrappers are part of systemtest repository  so  in order to compile and run jcks we need to compile systemtests and stf  however jcks have run without stf wrappers in the past  so  for sake of simplicity and ease of maintenance we may want to think about running jcks without the stf wrappers

updated question with config   
all the bugs are fixed except for a case resulting from scenario 4    viskell currently crashes  probably endless recursion  judging from the stack overflow  in an attempt to check this program in which a connection is made higher up in an expression tree  after which it is no longer a tree but a dag   note that this doesn't hold in general  for example   type  manipulating a list and then zipping it with the original list works fine 
ok wireshark showed a lot of data at the beginning and then got throttled by "tcp window full" but kept sending packets of 65kb  local tcp connections allows big packets  every 3 5 seconds or so  fits the  140kbit s quality of the music  at 60 015 seconds after response was sent i got a closedchannelexception to the sendfile result handler  the data kept flowing though on wireshark  at 290 893 seconds the fin flag was finally raised in a packet sent from the server and data flow stopped  finally at 341 009 the buffer was empty in the music player and the client responded with fin  completing the closure of the connection   so i did a new test  i created a 120g sparse file using the command  truncate  s 120000000000 zero   i'm testing on the same machine  so throughput is about 1gb s so 120g is enough for  100 seconds  well above the 60 seconds idle timeout   i then ran wget against the url serving that file  downloading at maximum speed all the time  here's the result     so the connection still breaks even when sending at full speed   for reference  the documentation of  idletimeout  is    if the linux sendfile syscall is used to send the file  i didn't manage to find out   then it means that it's not actually possible to monitor whether there is activity on the socket or not in software since the operating system is transfering the whole file in a single call   i don't know if the bug is in vertx or in netty but the idle timeout originated from netty  if either is indeed using syscalls for the transfer then i guess the idle timeout should be disabled for the time of the syscall    so i wrote a workaround to use asyncfile + pump instead    speed dropped to 300mb s but no more idle problems

there are three different behaviours i'd find more intuitive     the relative sizes to each other are kept to display the same information what was shown in screen 1 on screen 2      adding to the first one  one could introduce a minimal width each column should have and if not everything fits into the available width  introduce horizontal scrolling     save a default layout for each screen  when the user changes column width or shown columns update the default layout to a user specific  when dragging the window arround use the most recent layout    those are some possibilities i could imagine   
 gerzytet  each card issue  serves as a reminder and also a job to do   i would say it's a bug of the website since the link is dead when it shouldn't  we do have the javadoc for commonfunctions  yet the website just doesn't show it anymore  i will have to investigate what is going on   wiki is different in missing information  not the link to the existing information is broken

hi marcel   thanks for your prompt response   thought i attached logcat to github but it’s attached again to this email   clearing xprivacy data has restored wi fi connectivity  never thought to do that as previous upgrades didn’t require it  now have to re enter permissions authority on each of 214 apps but well worth the time and effort   do i need to run xprivacy free and xprivacy enabler concurrently or should i just run free or enabler with the pro license   thanks again for your assistance   coop  from  marcel bokhorst  mailto notifications github com   sent  wednesday  december 04

this is the error actual error which occurs in flyway     i haven't tested postgres 9 6 x yet  in terms of whether this is even fixable  i think that the strategy for locking a schema for migration would need to be changed  you may be able to switch to using  pg_try_advisory_lock  and poll for it to go true instead of relying on  pg_advisory_lock 's blocking nature

it looks like it may be fixed  i can't produce the same error when using the flag with rules_swift on 0 22  so i'll close this  thanks 
wow that was fast  thanks   i cannot share the specific code  but i can tell you what led to it and how i "fixed" it   i was using a cache with an interface  implementing serializeable  as key and an interfacearray   interfacetype   class   as value  the only implementation was generated by  https   github com immutables immutables  https   github com immutables immutables    i think the problem occured by accessing the cache without the implementation class used elsewhere in the code   i added the   serial version value   1234l   annotation and removed the interning annotation  which causes immutables to use interned strings     thanks for looking into this  i know that the thrown cause was generated by my code  but since also errors could occur  i really think your new approach is more correct 
i am using the gradle plugin  it doesn't fail      maybe it is a problem in ddmlib  see this issue   https   code google com p android issues detail id 79396  and this one  https   code google com p android issues detail id 79396

time the kompilation and you will see that it takes about 50  the time when  kompiled is there   there is lots of caching going on there  but this time that works against us   but now i'm confused  too  wasn't  k supposed to keep all the caching 
i did not look how the library use the reference  but i looked where the information is lost   when a new  java lang url  is created  the constructor does all the parsing job  then a  java net urlstreamhandler  is called to finish the parsing  the reference part is properly parsed by the url    when we start a spring boot application with the  spring boot loader   the  org springframework boot loader  is registered as  java protocol handler pkgs  and   org springframework boot loader jar handler  is used as urlstreamhandler  but this handler does not use all parsed information of the url  source  https   github com spring projects spring boot blob da550efc6ba8cce601e2ce34432d1224184a2477 spring boot project spring boot tools spring boot loader src main java org springframework boot loader jar handler java#l214      the reference information is available in the  context  object but the method always set a  null  value   i don't know if this behavior is voluntary or if it's mistake 
yes i always use the latest  niw i got 1 1 0 1243

 jpountz i didn't expect the numbers to be highlighted in the query  to say the truth  we only realized we were automatically including numeric fields in the "highlight" section after this error came up  it is an id in the real scenario   maybe this should be an error  but with a different message  like "numeric values cannot be highlighted" or something like that 
version  1 7 10   2 2 8 381  yes  fastcraft is enabled but optifine is not 
seems to be only smp issue  i am using big reactors 0 4 0 rc8 and forge  1208    1217
add an autoplaylist that is a live youtube link  after a while add songs to the playlist expect them to end and fall into the autoplaylist  after a while the autoplaylist is playing  ask some people to add several songs and use the queue command   i believe that if the bot spent a lot of time playing the autoplaylist it will be easier the bug appears   but when i reboot the bot this bug disappears after a while 
i haven't gone to ahc yet  the reason i think this is a netty issue is because this line  works when not connected through a proxy   websocket websocket   c prepareget gettargeturl    execute new websocketupgradehandler builder     however when i call   asynchttpclientconfig cf   new asynchttpclientconfig builder               s setproxyserver new proxyserver "192 168 1 130"  3128   build            asynchttpclient c   new asynchttpclient cf     things no longer work  all the connection data appears to make it to the netty handler correctly  that is it correctly detects that i want to use a proxy and it also knows to work in ssl mode and issue a connect to the proxy server  and it knows the endpoint of the websocket  also the proxy server works when issuing https requests    with all that said it could be a misunderstanding on my part since i'm having a hard time finding any examples of the way to correctly set this up  i assumed  setproxyserver would be the only modification i would need to interoperate with a proxy server  but i definitely could be wrong on that point 
thanks for suggesting the workaround  which works great so far  it seems obvious to to do in retrospect  but it somehow did not cross my mind in the first place 
did that and still have an exception saying that javascript files couldn't be written   the issue doesn't occur if i use the previous version  so it has to be caused by something that changed 
check my repo supersonic cpp  it's my own  so  do you see how could it be that the path ends up containing the string "null"  cause i don't  there's explicit checks for       null in most places to prevent that 
since there most likely won't be visitors on kafdrop and in our case it is not even connected to the internet i guess no  but in general if you run a website and you use the link then you cannot guarantee that google is not collecting visitors data and therefor you have to embed the fonts  so yes 
the sample code is below  unfortunately i cannot send you my keystore and truststore files  but they can contain any key and certificate in order to start the application   environment variables                                  export server_port 8443 export server_ssl_key_store  keystore_file_in_p12_format  export server_ssl_key_alias  keystore_key_entry_name  export server_ssl_key_store_password  keystore_password  export server_ssl_key_store_type pkcs12 export server_ssl_trust_store_password  truststore_password  export server_ssl_trust_store  truststore_file_in_p12_format  export server_ssl_trust_store_type pkcs12  sample code                                 
in gh core repo we have a check in routeresource to prevent this

only on the cauldron server  sorry for the late reply  worldedit is a plugin i use  in single player i have no problems or issues at all cause i use forge  i don't know if you will be providing support for plugins  but i thought it was worth mentioning since a lot of people use cauldron  also on the server i have found no issues with this mod  i'll do more testing with it if i can even removing all the other plugins to make sure exactly which one it is 
ok  thanks  will try 
yes  i market the screen images  thanks and greetings from mexico   https   drive google com drive folders 0bwtchwuvtpt5yzbzahpxzfdurlk usp sharing
okay  i will do that   
you are right  is it ok after refreshing  so the cause seems to be the same as for #4472 
 sbrannen this fixed my issue completely  thank you so much for the prompt response and fix  i am looking forward to testing out the new features of junit 5  thanks for all the devs hard work 
first  i has installed the plugin from jetbrain's repository  then i generate the  jar from github  master version  by idea 14 and installed it  overwriting the previous version     the doubt that i have is that i do not know if it was the other way around  first the master version and then i has returned to the repository version of jetbrain   and finally  i returned to the master version  
nope  it only happens when a compile error occurs  you also do not see the compile error in the repl
yes  it happens at every crafting station with a 3x3 crafting window  i'm playing on a server with the waystone mod and it only happens  when crafting of items from the mod  e g  the warpstone  is disabled  yesterday i contacted the admin for enabling it and everything worked 
bingo   that appears to fix it  fantastic    thanks so much for the fix 
i have carbonrom  something like su is built in in my rom

am not sure from where it comes  but the bindfilter  will add a filter that throw an  unmodifiablelistiterator  from guava 19 when sorted   i got it with a 0 10 0 snapshot wisdom framework 
hmm i can't seem to replicate it java  it was only an issue through quercus  i think it's not a bug in orientdb  sorry
the workaround  ref setparent method   was already added  here  https   github com inria spoon blob 27fc8208c4da4145c687c7f4db057de7dbed50f6 src main java spoon reflect factory executablefactory java#l101   but is just workaround  because we cannot assure that parent of executable reference will always point to it's declaring method  i have created a test and "some" fix in #1277
"do you override or provide your own mapping "   didn't get you  well but the same query works for the first time

i have international stock rom 2 3 2 7 on the watch and xiaomi mi a1 with android 8 0  in amazfit  from google play  i login with google account  not xiaomi account  i don't know if this affects 
it looks fixed to me
here is the trace level debug output 
i just specified "export file name myfile txt" in properties expecting the file to be created in current directory where the script was running from in 2 4 1  this was what i do usually   no export file folder  finally i ended up using export file name as “output myfile txt” and it worked   yes  jumping to parent directory might not be required   we can test it   note  i was testing using the new feature to stream individual source files from a local zip file and write a simple transform to insert them to a modules database and writing back status to export file  this works great  but i could have used an example  for each use case with loaders  text and use cade  needed to figure out by looking at source code and errors  i am now tempted to cleanup make generic a transform that takes optional base directory  defaults to     permissions  defaults to user default perm  and collections  defaults to no perm  as input and bundle with corb or at least provide a downloadable file  this can be used as a flash deploy tool for source modules  or developers can modify as needed 
i use macos and my command  i have use   debug i follow  https   github com dadoonet fscrawler issues 409
i am sorry  that's all i've got  unfortunately i am not using this library anymore for a different reason  i think the only other detail i can give is that i have multiple fingerprints  but besides that i have nothing 
 azatsarynnyy that would be awesome  parametrized task is ok for now  i guess
jup  in the past its have work   the last time who im sure that it work was before b209
well the larger issue is that the mmmps powerglove becomes my  and lots of other peoples'  default device in mid to late game  once i get sufficient resources to make and start upgrading it  that becomes my wrench   my portable crafting table    my light source    one of my melee weapons  along with something from tinkers' construct     and my ranged damage weapon  it fills slot number 1 on my hotbar and i work with it inside my base constantly  which means that right now   most of my floors and big chunks of my walls turn into ugly black transparent squares  if you hard block the powerglove from hiding conduit facades  then the wrench functionality in it is rendered useless and i've still got to carry around an omniwrench   whatnot   so  to me at least  while this may not be a major functional hurdle   it is a rather significant aesthetic hurdle   shrug   you could always drop an email to machinemuse through her website  ask her if there is an easier way to code around it  she's pretty receptive to other mods cooperating with hers  so it is worth a shot 
i have queried the redis slowquery log there are only about 10 entries which have a high _querying_ time none of which are during the 56 seconds of timespan during which we recieved these errors no disconnects either during the said interval according to the number of established connections remaining constant for that time period we have a thread pool defined as 100 though in the application  can it be due to many threads invoking commands on the single redis client or am i barking up the wrong tree 
hey   i am attaching a file with 50 labels  when i try to open it with edumips i get a parsing error that label below "label32" are not found  i have named the labels from label0 to label50   i tried removing the first 2 labels and the error i am getting is that labels from label34 and below are not found  that's why i assumed there is an upper limit to the labels   thanks for your help  john  labeltest txt  https   github com lupino3 edumips64 files 225602 labeltest txt  ps  i checked there are no duplicate labels
ah ok  haven't seen that call  thx for the remark  i will try to disable this  i will get back on you tomorrow  but probably you are right 
my humble apologies for taking so long to come back to you  especially as you responded so promptly   we’ve been trying various tests within our jenkins build set up to try and isolate the problem   we are definitely going ahead with an order for the enterprise version  it should come through as deutsche post   dhl  but we can not get the oracle apex applications to load without the “ ” placeholder error   we have set sqlplus enabled  but it looks like the set define off is still being ignored   we use placeholders elsewhere  so we can not globally turn placeholders off    it looks like flyway is still setting define on – see highlighted line below     public string replaceplaceholders string input                   130        string result   this placeholderreplacer

wow  thanks for the fast reply  i've installed mirakel 2 2 1 and tried it with davdroid 0 5 7 alpha mirakel  2014 01 27   0 5 8 alpha mirakel  2014 02 11  and 0 5 8 alpha mirakel  2014 02 12 
adding the generic types to the  sendersupplier  then using this form works
yep  sorry about that    didn't notice the request for 'unstable' until it was too late  hopefully i got it right this time    
you can find the code here https   github com chriskn data provider static i also included a build sh so you can reproduce how i build the native image   i am using annotations  see package eu datex2    i tried it also with the entities located in an external jar but no success

 serge rider  yes  i have been saw this issue #3931   i use ppa repository 
moved to 2 5 0
that is the code that registers the custom data  it persists fine even after a restart  it's just not rolled back from the block snapshot   it appears to me that the problem is not on my code  but on the code that does the snapshot rollback 
yes
thanks  it works that way   i generated the application properties from  mvn quarkus generate config   i'm going to close this ticket 
i use em both for 1 11 2 and yeah  it still happens when i hold shift
yes  i have to change the phrase there    the issue for delete object is #309
i haven't been able to reproduce this on newer builds 
thanks  updating version works for me   btw  is it possible to force restamp the binary if the head commit changes  even if all dependency is unchanged  afik go rule is using stable_build_scm_revision instead of build_scm_revision which can force restamp  can cc_binary configured in this way as well 
hi ripcurlx  thanks for looking  without the torcontrolport argument  both 1 2 5 and 1 2 7 fail  because tails prohibits tor inside tor   but they _fail in identical ways_ so it's no problem on bisq side   the only problem is when i try to use the system tor via torcontrolport         i only had limited time  but i've made one more test to isolate the issue   sudo strace  f  e trace connect  u amnesia  opt bisq 1 2 5 bisq   loglevel info   torcontrolport 9051   i did a little cleanup on the output and pulled the following relevant snippet  note that this is a successful run of 1 2 5  showing the "expected" behaviour"    there are two   connect     calls  and from the context we understand that the first one is an attempt to probe for a bitcoin node on the local machine port 8333  and the second one is the connection to tor's control port  supplied via command line as 9051   the software works correctly   when i repeat the test with version 1 2 7  i see the first connect   call to port 8333  however after the message "connecting to running tor"  strace  shows   no connect   call     to port 9051 or any other  the timeout occurs 4 minutes later    this is consistent with my observation from running tcpdump on loopback  and confirms that the issue is located within the bisq app  not a firewall issue etc     i hope this helps  and provides a portable test to reproduce the bug even on non tails linuxes

sorry for filing this report because it is definitely a matter of the local file system  on the sdcard there is fat by default which doesn't allow ' ' in the file names   fyi what i did  i used the  'myownnotes' app  https   f droid org repository browse  fdfilter myownnotes fdid org aykit myownnotes  which creates file names with ' ' in it but on the server  the server of course allows such names because it usually uses a modern file system  which is ufs with freebsd in my case  and not fat  but when i try to download those files with the owncloud client then it fails to create the file locally   i suggest to make the error message more clear because it says 'download failed' but actually the download is ok but the file creation fails 
here is a snippet from my sdk pom xml  spring framework version should be fine 
right now i have only certificates from our clients so i can't share it  but the problem is with multiple certificates from multiple clients  thank you  complete code

ok i finally figured out the problem   i installed java8 on this new mac  but it already had java11 on it and was using that as default   i switched the java_home to jdk8 by using this command   export java_home "   usr libexec java_home  v 1 8 "  and then it built fine

interestingly  bazel project itself is not affected  and    just works  however  all projects that have   bazelversion  stopped working after d3f8efc   so the workaround for now is to remove   bazelversion  file from the tree   also  i would have expected  that higher version number semantic is still preserved  if   bazelversion  file has "1 0 0" version  and i have installed bazel version 3 2 1  then it should just work  and not telling me that the   bazelversion  has version 1 0 0  but currently higher version 3 2 1 is installed  the only reason to refuse running bazel  if the installed version is lower than the one referenced in   bazelversion  file

i see   no  i was assuming that the communication with the email server was the issue  but i think you've determined it was a database problem that seems to occur some time after reboot   let's leave it as is for now regarding email   but  if there's an additional error situation you can trap and display a meaningful message  that would be best because i think it wasn't displaying an error   this may have been simply because of the other elusive problem that prevented me for registering and or using an account within our domain where email responses are currently limited to   in fact  i'm almost sure of that   this issue can safely be closed by you if you feel that same 
i've found out that  app recyclerview " +id recyclerview"  attribute in  com turingtechnologies materialscrollbar dragscrollbar  is the cause of the error  it might work well in an activity of only 1 recyclerview with id  recyclerview   however  in an activity with multiple fragments of which each fragment contains recyclerview with the same ids   dragscrollbar  could not determine which recyclerview to bind   my immediate solution is to give unique id to the particular recyclerview with  dragscrollbar  
yes thank you 
i don't know if there updated and mcpe version is 0 7 2 the mod i really want is the climbing mod
i will take a look later sometime again 
hi martin   i'm fairly new to this  so how do i do the debug in order to provide you the necessary information  as far as i can see it was working on 2 2 0 build #1099  then i started to have some problems with another binding and then i switched back to a backup rpi3 with the former stable release 2 1 where both was working 
here's the log   lsp log  https   github com microsoft vscode java debug files 3966544 lsp log   i also fixed the url to link to the project workspace if you want to try it yourself 
i have only tested it in smp  i will see if i can duplicate it in ssp 
 secupwn  please try to ask a specific person since  in my experience  generally addressed questions are even less likely to be answered 
i attached an example project to the original description  as  jaikiran noted  it is specific to  dev  mode  it does not occur if i run tests  also included  
it's possible  as i was fighting mobs and some of them bestow status effects thanks to infernal mobs  though i didn't specifically notice it   i'll turn fog options back on in the config and blind myself to see if that triggers the crash   i'll edit this comment with results   edit   https   pastebin com vltnxy9c that seems to be the issue   went to the spot i originally crashed  outside a mesa biome   set time to 23000  drank a potion that bestowed blindness and stood still   crash 
ok  i will provide a pr for this the next days 
its working now  thanks 
pls fix this now
thank you for your quick response  yes i understand  plex is optional  but it is good option 😄  every time happening for me  just play a video from your sd car  external storage   when it is playing try to push back button  not working for me  after 2 3 seconds try to push again  just 1 time   not working again  3rd time  push to back button  carstream will crash  if you want  i can try to send a video to you

with the latest changes on the zte racer the map is no longer corrupted  however it still doesn't draw correctly  it's drawn with a blue green tint  furthermore two copies of the map are drawn  one at the top left and one at the top right             blue              green          map                  map                                                       _________     __________                                                                                             _____________________    it would appear that the only pixelformat that renders the map correctly on this device is pixelformat rgb_565  not sure about other devices pre jelly bean though   on a samsung galaxy s4 the change from using 0x00000000 to android r color transparent re introduces the black map background on load 
i messed it up to set the module path correctly in gradle  now i am able to compile my stuff  sorry for that  it was my mistake  but there's still another problem  i'm using eclipse 4 10 and it does not recognize the module info class inside meta inf versions 9 thus displays an error saying 'net bytebuddy' cannot be resolved to a module  if i repackage the jar and put module info class in the top level directory  it gets recognized by eclipse and everything's fine  i guess eclipse does not  yet   handle multi release jars correctly  are you aware of that  what ide do you use

the pwd should in fact replace the old logic with string type and suffix "_pwd"  but for compatibility reasons both ways would be possible for now to define passwords  i do not say any reason to treat the pwd parameter types differently on ui  so they should be editable  if the technology manager specifies them as configurable 
it doesn't appear so  as seen here    however  not all recipes from ie are exhibiting this behaviour 
actually the protocol is in swift  but this also happened in obj c     actually  now i see that in the myapi protocol i have methods with no parameters that are working  the difference is that i don't specify the selector there 
thanks for the quick response    yes  you're right  i should rephrase that  the statement was referring to point 1   currently exoplayer decides to list the platform codecs with 'regular_codecs' or 'all_codecs' filter depending on whether the app needs a secure decoder or not    in file  library core src main java com google android exoplayer2 mediacodec mediacodecutil java codeckind   includesecure   mediacodeclist all_codecs   mediacodeclist regular_codecs   i guess if the utility class knew whether the app preferred a tunneled decoder it could select the right filter   anyway  i figure these are implementation details so you guys should know better how to address it  looking forward to try out your changes when they're ready   thanks

ah yeah i use faircircadian   i wanted to write an open source version anyway  maybe it doesn't really need internet access  but it shows weather and sunrise sunset for the local position   is gb supposed to make that kind of data available directly instead of allowing network access to the watchface   still though  some watch apps really do need network access    like the public transportation app i wrote  or a weather app that uses a specific source    will you enable that eventually   what about watch apps that depend on javascript running on the phone   is that supported  or will be

i used a simple avro schema and parsed with avro parser class  it does throw exception which points out exactly where the mistake is   here is my sample avro schema     as you see the exception message  it clearly shows the error message pointing out line and column    i haven't yet looked schemaregistry code fully  but i guess in schema registry somewhere original exception got swallowed and different exception alone passed over to the upper layers 
if i find something else i am  going to tell you  thanks for the quick fix  3 edit  i was running the latest on curse  i should have told you  but then again i should have told that i did check your "latest" source code and made my guess based of that

i ran  bazel coverage   test_output streamed path to testtarget   i'm not sure how to describe the project   it has several maven jar dependencies  it uses  rules_protobuf  https   github com pubref rules_protobuf  to implement a grpc server    the test is mocking a few things and testing certain http calls would have happened 
i do believe it was a regular zombie  although i can probably run a test on that in the next few days  i am aware that this issue has occurred for multiple people on the server i play on  so in case i can't test it  i can get one of them to test it instead 
it looks like the error would be somewhere else after my associate has jumped into the topic   please see #8845

yeah  that looks like a solid start  i don't know if i should break this into a new issue or not  but here's something i've been considering  do we want to make a subclass of activity that we use as the base for most  or all  of our activities  it seems like a lot of functionality  mainly showing these warning and the navigation drawer  will have to be duplicated in a lot of places   if we had this "super" activity  we could avoid a lot of redundant boilerplate code  that hinted at my next point  which is that i think these warnings should be displayed at the activity level  a  we avoid a lot of boilerplate  and b  they would remain still when scrolling between tabs  when launching the activity  we could check the internet connection and display this if there is none  if we want to get really fancy  we could register to receive updates on network status and hide the warning and trigger a refresh of all fragments  once all of them incorporate the refresh framework    i think i answered my own question  we need a new issue  p

that parses exactly as written  but the label from a list production is still getting declared as a cons list so that rule doesn't work correctly

without that many blocks in the toolbox would it hurt performance that much to disable recycling views on the toolbox and shouldn't there also be a minimum height of the toolbox 
yeah  the way dispose is called on android is not really the way to go  http   stackoverflow com questions 5227071 understanding of isfinishing
yep  double checked  i got the update just 1 hour ago  before testing     your fix seems to work  but only when the option is not already checked   what i did to fix the issue     disable logging   close database   force close kp2a   load kp2a and db   enable logging   close database   force close kp2a   load kp2a and db   send logs  following this scenario worked  maybe there are useless steps  but i could not send logs before disabling and enabling the option again     i tried a more adapted scenario     disable logging   close database   force close kp2a   load kp2a and db   enable logging   send logs  and it works  of courses logs are empty  but it makes sense   
nope nothing in the slots but for me block reach broke the armor hmm
i see they are fine  i e  before and after the issue 'fwmconfig xml' contains paths corresponding to user 'a' and 'b' in their respective paths   thanks  on friday  18 april 2014 1 05 pm  bogdan popescu notifications github com wrote    jashanka  hi  could you check if the  home a twister config fwmconfig xml is the same as  home b twister config fwmconfig xml   could you check before   when the paths are not the same   and after   when you see same paths   the issue   could you post them here   thanks  — reply to this email directly or view it on github 
 sleshchenko  thank you for your help  i am an admin  i made a stack which name is test and i granted the stack permission search  read permissions  to all users   even though there is already a stack name is test  created by the admin  the same stack is created for the admin as well   i think che has created the same stack because admin is also a user

hi  gunnarmorling   i just checked with latest snapshot and indeed it seems to work ok  both in my reproducer test case and in our "real" code   do you have any idea when we can expect a release with this fix   thanks a bunch 
this happens when i import a document  i am using 5 3 0
go ahead  i'm not working on this one  don't know about other people out there though  p
there seems to be the same problem in all other bin   bat scripts too 
yes  this is for a custom  encoder   decoder    as a temporary workaround  until this issue is addressed   i was thinking about extending  encoderhttpmessagewriter  to make it work like it did in spring 5 1 if the inputstream was a mono  i e  call  encode  rather than  encodevalue     i haven't actually looked to see all the places where the new methods are used   if it is limited to  encoderhttpmessagewriter   then i guess one of two fixes could be made there  1  have something that made  encoderhttpmessagewriter  always call encode  rather than encodevalue  i e  revert to spring 5 1 behavior   or 2  have something that made  encoderhttpmessagewriter  pass the context as a hint to encodevalue  the more i think about it  however  the more i think that having the context as a hint seems hacky    and neither of these implementations handle _all_ the possible locations that the new synchronous methods _could_ be used   so  this would limit any encoder that uses the context to only be able to be used from the newly patched  encoderhttpmessagewriter    i e  it couldn't be used in any other location that called encodevalue that doesn't put the context in a hint   what if the new synchronous  encodevalue  and  decode  methods were revisited  to instead take return mono   this would allow implementations to access the context normally  via  mono subscribercontext      and it also seems more inline with the fact that the encoder decoder are _reactive_ encoder decoders   i e  it seems odd for a synchronous encode decode method to exist in reactive encoder decoders   e g     in  encoder       default mono databuffer  encodevalue mono t  value  databufferfactory bufferfactory  			resolvabletype valuetype   nullable mimetype mimetype   nullable map string  object  hints     in  decoder      default mono t  decode mono databuffer  buffer  resolvabletype targettype   nullable mimetype mimetype   nullable map string  object  hints    i know this would mean immediately deprecating the newly added synchronous methods  and adding another default reactive method in their place   but  it does seem "cleaner" to have only reactive encode decode methods in encoder decoder  and to allow implementations to access the context "normally"   also  the default implementation of the new methods _might_ be able to delegate to the other existing methods  rather than throw an exception    i haven't completely thought that through though 
embarrassing    your memory is better than mine  it looks like i never created the issue    until now  yes  this looks to be the same issue  but different feed 
i cannot say specifically what triggers this error  so far it has happened only on my dev laptop  not on my desktop pc  but several times already  always after upgrading as  last time  a couple of months ago  i was able to fix it by reinstalling as + clearing build caches  but this time this did not work  so i started doing some more internet research  there i found several people having the same problem  not always with a solution at hand  finally i found the solution that worked for me  extending proguard config  here  https   github com serso android checkout issues 138  it also includes a possible cause  proguard config of another component being too agressive   since i have added those lines to my local proguard config  every build is stable again  and without those lines every build directly crashed with the error shown in the first post

i mis typed  i had this bug occur several times  figured out how to fix the units  did so  but attached a save with only one damaged unit when the bug recurred    gm editing the damage on the unit not appearing in the repair bay also causes it to reappear 
i did try it's the same issue 
looks like there's something wrong with it     btw i'm in the ny office if any of the bazel people there want to debug hands on
 popzip yes  i am new to dhf  i developed a workflow on a sample data set and it worked fine  i only got such error when i ran it against a larger data set   just to confirm  is there a timeout limit on how long a harmonization flow can run  regardless of error or not 
updated  multimc still displays it as  029 2 despite literally dragging 0 29 3 in  drill breaks all the bedrock now instead of missing a corner  still occasionally digs really slow even when spun to full speed  when otherwise it would cut through the rock like butter

我用dolphinscheduler用户安装了ds，不是用root用户。 i use user dolphinscheduler to  install ds   修改 tmp dolphinscheduler的属主或者权限都能防止这个错误 modify  tmp dolphinscheduler's owner or authority prevents this error  但我想知道的是，在1 1版本是通过sudo生成缓存文件，1 2版本是通过安装用户自己，这是版本做了修改还是一个bug？ but what i want to know is that ，the cache file was generated by sudo in version 1 1  and in version 1 2 by the user installed himself  is this a revision of the release or a bug 
garcia   i test without "this" and the result continues null
sure  just please don't close the issue too fast  because i may not find time for that in the upcoming holidays  i'll try to do it asap 
yes  just removing worst is also listed as possibility here  not sure  for 3 bits we have 8 possibilities and we should use them
looks like it only happens when  git as svn  detects a new gitlab repo  branch  that should be exposed via svn  if i restart the daemon the error won't appear again 
yes i'm pretty sure the server does not start and i have nothing already running on port 8080  i'm not entirely sure why the helpful error message is not getting printed  i think it's something to do with the extra eval causing an error and the bash script terminating before the call to error_exit   to test this i added extra debug echo statements to che sh as below     the echo line just before the if statement isn't printed  execution stops at the line with the eval statement  so the error message isn't printed  i'm not sure exactly what's the fix to get the error message to print   the script exits with exit code 127
 breautek i can't remember exactly  it always worked before last android studio update or new setup  but know i see in the android studio path the gradle folder  i could set the enviroment variable to this path instead of downloading gradle separatly  but currently it works with my workaround from my prev  post  but the path to  c  program files android android studio gradle gradle 5 1 1 bin  should also work  it's weird  i never had to set the path before  something has changed  how detect cordova the gradle  is the gradle cli required or does it look up the android studio path   installing the android studio without any hacks will not work anymore  the error message of cordova should be changed  it's very trivial if you know what's the problem is and how to fix it  i was just annoyed to get one error after another    be free to close it 
 skabashnyuk imo  providing both che_api_external and che_api_internal is reasonable even if it was in k8s openshift world   workspace containers will connect to the ingress  or external endpoint that have external ip  if che_api contains public domain name  on the other hand  urls with  http   che server 8080 api  will be resolved as the local ip address by the local dns   at the viewpoint of functionality  some ingresses like nginx does't handle websockets well  so i want to avoid connections via ingresses if it was possible    i can't say with absolute certainly since implementation of ingresses are so many  but i just can say it's better to suppress traffic to  ingress  it will give us some stability and quick response

hi hernan   okay   no worries   we're supplying "openid name email" in the scope now and we get back a valid firebase token   another thing i noticed in that code that looks a bit off is this in the  delegationwithoptions  method     thanks for getting back to us so quickly    richard
yes i think that is the problem i have had

there is minor bug in pagination   when you are on the last page  next page button is still clickable
closing as fixed by #3791    
i believe this was due to a race condition in obtaining the address of the tdievaluate function and has been fixed 
 repost   github mangled the last somehow   sure  any regular expression pattern will work  the only caveat here is with this bug  and our mishandling escape sequences   and yes  both bel script and xbel formats require annotations to be defined before use  bel script groups these into  define annotation  expressions  xbel uses the  annotationdefinitiongroup  element shown above 
i have created my own tap detector for now but thanks for looking  re #405 i think that mousex etc is updated after each draw   cycle so if touches is operating in a separate thread  and mousex will always be the previous value

i don't think this is a bug in controlsfx   normally in javafx graphics don't inherit css rules
it would have the same effect  of course  but it's not my understanding of clean code and working efficiency to  un  comment multiple lines of code instead of using one constant for it   that's why there exists hugo  isn't it  at least it would have the same effect to do a manually log in each method too  but it's not as clean and useful as the  debuglog approach 
i never compiled a apk myself  i only tested with openkeychain from f droid org  i would have to build a environment about that and read how to do it 
i was talking to my colleague  thurston  whom you've spoken with on the mailing lists   and he agreed with you   something like this in production would probably never happen and therefore is not entirely worth fixing   i agree   we should just close this issue 
how to set max reg per ip if server use bungee cord   yes i like max reg per email

i didn't really understand your post but simply removing the light while drawing those 2 things does the trick 
hi  hiroyuki sato   with verify  i mean it should check the syntax of the dig before pushing  what happens i think is the version number updates but the code still stays the same  i'm going to run a few more tests today to get the correct steps to replicate   rejecting push command when old revision is running is a good feature but i have not encountered this

ok thank you very much   when should it be released 
yes  i think the issue is that when "no_grid" is selected  the x and y are interpreted as pixels coordinates  while with all other metrics they are interpreted as cell coordinates   very confusing to say the least  and contradicting the wiki  i suggest make it cell coordinates as default  with extra parameter to use pixel coordinates 
ok  the sketch is really big  it's my project romanesco  so i give you juste one part of the project  you're the first to hear a piece of news romanesco before i drop this one in few weeks on github      https   www dropbox com s x29ex2s4ayz72r2 scene_24b zip if you want see the full project downloadable in the alpha 23 you can look on the web site http   romanescoproject wordpress com  and if you'ave comment about my code is welcome     i think something to resolve that  it's when we have the dropdown menu to suggest a new word var  void     and we select one of them  pdex take all the word in the sketch not just a previous part  so in my case the result it's dirrectly "clickshortleft" and not "clickshortleftleft " because when i change the var with the dropdown menu the cursor text are in the midlle of the word    i don't now if it's clear  because it's hard to explain with the words and the english is not my mother language  
thanks jesus  will do it and let you know  sent from my iphone
i have attached some piccys of the server start log file  with the duplicates i get a java duplicate null pointer exception  unfortunately the files didn't attach in order but you will get the idea  the debug level was 7 and i reduced it to 4  but no change  as you will see from the log i am running craftbukkit  the latest dwarfcraft  pex  world edit etc  and all works fine without the duplicate trainers  it does create one duplicate successfully   thanks for your help  i have run out of ideas  we will run with just a central training area if we have to but it is a bit of a hassle  thanks again     final_load_msg  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10723674 8898502 7f326c40 3468 11e5 822c 3b6b0dd3d296 gif    java_warning  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10723674 8898503 7f3dfbdc 3468 11e5 9984 75b6ae596836 gif    server_versions  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10723674 8898504 7f4ab0de 3468 11e5 8494 cb0378545d3f gif    trainer_load  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 10723674 8898505 7f5780a2 3468 11e5 8e34 1a3f524174a6 gif 
 build successful  that seems to have fixed it 
well problem is that it crashes the r session in rstudio before i can ask for a traceback     so it just gives me a window "r session aborted"    but the problem should be easy enough for you to reproduce   
i am using 2 9 0  the only other change i had to make was to up the version of jackson core to 2 8 7   i can post a full list if required  
well  for this test i'm only using requestb in  so it has nothing to do with jenkins   i just ensured that the proxy is set on the prn  and it still made no difference 
sorry for not replying earlier  but i was using  0 5 1   i will keep an eye on this as i just updated to  0 5 2   thanks 
yes i've tried it with the weirding gadget as well  it too doesn't work  no fluid gets put into the chalice when no player is nearby 
i don't have chrome chromium installed on this device  s
for data storage benchmark v2 0  the default should be false  as well  i have changed temporarily the default value because there is no other way to try the benchmark with the parameter set to true 
 sqltaskmanager  keeps information about ended tasks   sqltaskmanager#tasks   for a while  default 15 minutes  so that they can be queried by coordinator 
i can share my mod list  but it definitely was running worse  because changing the tick rate to 3600 fixed it  it's really late here  so the best i can do right now is link to the modpack  i'll update with an modlist tomorrow   here is the version where it happens  https   minecraft curseforge com projects smartcraft files 2598177
hi  kim vde   i have replied you privately over the email 
if i have no log no problem    but once log start coming it freezes  no need to have much in my case  but append every time
depends    lets say  i would have full artistic freedom  i would then catch this by testing with mockito that certain dependency injection methods  created by us are called inside a function "injectsimulationenvironment" into factory classes and to make this simpler  i would create a generic factory creation interface that is used for injecting the environment into the factories we need and implement a registerfactory method  add factory to a list of managed factories  and implement the actual injection as working on a list of factories  so we can define new factories without needing more than copy and paste in one function of simulation    the first junit test would then be as simple as creating a simple factory mock object with  mockito  https   github com mockito mockito   register it at simulation  call the "injectsimulationenvironment" method in simulation  expecting that "definesimulationenviroment" in the factory mock object gets called once    next  i would repeat the test with three factory mocks to make sure it also works with more than one      finally  i would add contract testing to the junit tests of all factory implementations  injecting null objects should result in illegalargumentexceptions  etc   again    with full artistic freedom and a lot of personal taste  for example  its easier for me to spot errors in the creation of factory objects  the function creating them is just made of similar looking likes with helpful indentation  for example    for the actual objects  we can't use mocks   but we could then create an abstract upper class for them and test it with a dummy implementation  for example  abstractbuildingfunction and "dummybuildingfunction" and then test abstractbuildingfunction that it has proper error handling should null values get injected    there are also assertions around  but those are rarely active when you need them  but they are helpful in unit testing as well  so its good to combine both approaches 
removing the file you mentioned and letting it get re created fixed the problem   i captured the contents of the saveactions_settings xml that was bad and compared it to the newly created one   it looks like an exclusion was in there  but i didn't see it listed in the save actions settings ui   maybe it will help you determined what happened   either way thank you for your quick response   love the plugin    saveactions_settings zip  https   github com dubreuia intellij plugin save actions files 287426 saveactions_settings zip 
thanks for the quick fix  i can confirm it works now  grinning 
i upgraded last night to xubuntu 15 04 to see if that helped  it didn't   previously i was running xubuntu 14 04   jre is 1 8 0_11 b12  although i'm pretty sure 1 7 yields the same problem   i can confirm this if it helps   servlet container is vfabric tomcat server 2 9 6 which is based on tomcat 7   i've tested unsuccessfully with javacv 0 8  0 9  and 0 10 
that's on the develop branch with no additional patches applied  i take a photo in portrait orientation then while the image is semi transparent with a progressbar below i rotate the phone to landscape orientation and wait for it to finish  then there are two photos displayed  if i rotate the phone back to portrait it all becomes normal  only one instance is visible

yes i using last version
yes  there's no vanilla client for mac   at least wasn't there last i checked    sadly no  osbuddy also doesn't support it  its not just osbuddy  its pretty much for every application  you can't run multiple instances simply by double clicking the application   but i just had a thought like the mobile emulators are able to make multiple instances  if that could be something we could potentially see in future   d
 cescoffier this did not fix it  same issue appears again   i read something  that is has something to do with the classloader and the way kafka loads its services     org apache kafka common utils utils#getcontextorkafkaclassloader   https   stackoverflow com questions 37363119 kafka producer org apache kafka common serialization stringserializer could no    i missed out some information for you  maybe it is important to know  that my serializers deserializers are in a separate maven module  which is referenced by the main module  i already tried using the default "jsonobjectserializer class"  but that didn't work either  my simplified serializer looks like this

 philipwhiuk any email provider  maybe i did not describe the problem clearly i refer to the forwarding identifier of the mailing list page the weird thing is the email marked after the first forwarded can be shown but drop down on the refresh and the marked icon is gone
i bumped up my glide version from  4 3 1  to  4 5 0  and the issue is now gone  if i go back i'm still getting the warning  it seems the okhttp integration library doesn't actually make a difference for this issue  in my case updating wasn't a problem so i'll use the latest    thanks 
only cumulus tv is installed  asus nexus player  running android 6 0 build mra58n 
he did tried that afaik  can't be sure
no  the message was not received by the recipient  that's how i noticed it hadn't been sent  i didn't get a response    i normally go back into the app to see that it says "delivered"  but on this particular occasion i was in a hurry and wanted to respond quickly  so i immediately shut off the screen after pressing the send button  not sure if it had something to do with that 
i will
thanks   sure  i will build it and let you know soon 
the absolute latest experimental build  and the build after the header fix  it's very inconsistently reproducible and goes away with a restart  but it always comes back eventually

works like a charm  thanks a lot    
i'll test this out here soon  it may take a few hours before i can do so 
sry youre right  i created it with multiworld    mw create end end default  i use the latest dev builds crash log 
 rsudev map activity most of the time  i think once it was cache description but then i had no crash  as  lineflyer wrote  can be really the same as #7300  no i cannot because sometimes  maybe when there was not enough time and app was still "active"  it works  but often i'm getting crash   master from couple of days ago + su 
it's funny  but when i'm trying to send a bug report within the app  it can't be send due to the same connection issue    i'll try to fetch some logcat  as soon as my devices are non rooted devices  unfortunately         it will take some time to setup adb within computer

ok  sorry for the terminology  it's a livestream probably but for some reason it doesn't work in newpipe 
loading it into a test copy of my world now  will report back shortly 
map and theme are created by myself  in order to reproduce the effect i think it's the best if you create a default map by yourself and use your default theme  link to the  small  geofabrik extract  http   download geofabrik de europe germany nordrhein westfalen muenster regbez html  regards klaus

 on my previous phone it worked       i cannot choose any offline map  the app only offers online maps  
thanks for the reply  no stack trace that i can see  i've copied pasted a few lines around the "corrupted" reference  if you need more i can upload the entire thing    idealog txt  https   github com groboclown p4ic4idea files 309379 idealog txt   there are a couple of stack traces in the full file   i think there's the whole history of the western hemisphere since the flood in there   but not related to this 
yes 
i am also on  2019 03  and i see what  aemyers sees too 
yes  i'll provide it next week

hi eric  i'm on ubuntu 18 04 using the latest snap installation of intellij ultimate with latest version of the plugin  i haven't used nape is quite a while  so not sure when this started   i've got a moderate speed improvement by using code completion from the compiler  it also seems to help if i try and reduce the code context by adding   haxe3  and  nape_release_build  flags to the project settings  i can see these are used in the nape source code 
this happens in 1 0 0 in browser environment   note that if i type the inner foo declaration with string   foo string  it does not happen 
no  i don't have any specific use case in my mind till now  now i see it's specially designed for standard users only   but should it be marked to the manager   because in that case manager users have much more permission than manager  manager can't send create commands if nothing is assigned to him but end users can  isn't it a flow in the design of the system from the programming perspective  i think manager always have limit commands disabled   what's your opinion

no certificate warnings at all 
i'll have to get my crash report when i get home from work  sorry i forgot to include it the first time 
checkout #425   we created the configuration at one of the first meetings of the course  i don't have a case  you probably assume some statement type somewhere where it could be also if statement 

it doesn't contain any data about the result  even before analyzed by the scanner    h4b4m ivqpw cr1 pqzlwo  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 17354844 23669886 bf430782 03a0 11e7 84ee 37babc8952cc png  that's all of their tags

i am using 2 1 1  switched to 2 2 and made some changes on my part  but it looks like it runs under win 10  thanks  
the above code change fixed the issue for me  i have to first ask to for approval before i get contribute a fix  same as for the other issue  once i have that i can create a fork and fix it unless you don't just want a diff 
i think it only happens if i have an explicit order by in my query  it will re run the query as if it's sorting  but doesn't actually change the sort  if i remove the order by  then it works   maybe that's the intended behavior  i'd like to be able to change the sorting after the fact though  without having to comment out my order by
latest version  different factions and i believe it only message was this land belongs to someone else 
this happens every time in idea 12  i haven't tried it in 13  since it's basically a concurrency issue it's entirely possible that it doesn't get triggered for some reason in 13  no one seems quite sure why cursive provokes this problem in the first place  but jetbrains have confirmed that holding that lock during initialisation is definitely wrong  so it could easily be randomly triggered by something else in the future  and i think the fix is pretty straightforward 
hi   while trying to send cloud to device message i got exception saying   exception   java io ioexception  connection failed to be established    here is part of serviceclient class which throws exception    any suggestions or advice are welcome  thanks 
thanks i will check in next release  sorry but it is too difficult to build from latest master 
 d good question   if i am not wrong  the f droid version had this plugin app built in  or  this could be a way to bring it to the people with google play store  sadly there is that issue at the moment with the closed source library's   another method could a kind of serial code or a paypal transaction id as serial code  so another way to "buy it"  i think google get a lot of the money you should get for the payment  or 
the call to  reduce    in  price getvaluenum     and  getvaluedenom     is to avoid having to do  this call  https   github com codinguser gnucash android pull 484 files#diff f09bdcd45d932eeaff0d88b567e44687l231   if we are to store it reduced  i think it's better to just do it automatically   if you are ok with it  i can fix the unit test 
hello  as stated in last line  app version 1 5 7  server version 7 0  android 4 4 2 on lg g2   nginx 0 7 67

you need to credt a mecha with an ai chip  this can be done in the vehicle crafting table  make sure you have all of the parts for a mecha and an ai chip in your inventory 
thanks for the fix  update it on our side and set it to autoupdate  basically that means as long as you don't make fundamental changes to project structure and keep tagging versions in the same scheme  everything should be fine   we use a straightforward text file for the build instructions  e g  see https   gitlab com fdroid fdroiddata blob head metadata de guerda matekarte txt   so just fork the repo  apply your changes  commit them and open a merge request   our server part at https   gitlab com fdroid fdroidserver  has some python script that help to check the syntax  look for updates  build the app and provide standard commit messages  if you don't want to use these tools  this is fine  too  just keep two things in mind if you do it by hand  first  use  git pull   rebase  to pull in changes from our master  that helps to keep our repo clean from "merge branch" messages  and second  prefix your commit message with the app name  like "matekarte  changed description "  that way we don't have to lookup the actually changed app files 
i will get back to you on friday when i have a better opportunity to experiment with her phone and to try with another person's phone 
i am using this lib in android  compiled with java 1 8  but as i said everything works fine on  alpha 3   the crash happen only in  alpha 4  added too in my  r8 proguard  files rule     keep allowoptimization class org pcap4j     but it crashes in  debug   release  build too no matter for code shrinking  example in this line it crash   attempt to invoke virtual method 'java security codesource java security protectiondomain getcodesource  ' on a null object reference

hi  thanks for the reply   i set drawableparams in onfinalimageset    the top level drawable is a forwardingdrawable so it will automatically forward the parameters down to arraydrawable  which will automatically forward it to mlayers  which are animateddrawable    set a small drawable into the target imageview  it should be pixelated and not blurry when working 
please forgive my ignorance but what is the best method to acquire the 0 2 0 snapshot  i'm currently using the maven central repository via gradle to acquire my dependencies  should i build the 0 2 0 snapshot from source or specify a different repository   thanks    
forge forgeessentials  there's no error in the console from what i see but i'll search the logs properly in just a moment   the database was new over the weekend  i can get a copy if you think it might help  it's the only one on there so it's not like there's something else trying to use mysql or anything 
have seen it also on 1 0 3 and i am using grbl 8 
thanks  i'll add a unit test and pr it to this issue later today  as i'm in a meeting right now 
 zymap thank you  for checking this out  i don't remember doing anything with cluster  but today i've reinstalled it from ground and the error doesn't come up  so i'm closing the ticket 
the craziest part is that i dont even have essentials backup on my server at all either  just found plugin metrics tho  my server owner is looking into it more  tyvm
 joerghoh     can you successfully perform a dry run of maven release prepare perform  my setup hasn't changed and this worked fine from the last release i did 
i am on that version  and ill check  if you would like i can bring you onto my ts and talk and see that pack that i am using  see if anything to do with it can be repoduced by you as well 
yes  putting a piece of redstone in between the torch and the port does "fix" more like a workaround  the problem  about the redstone dying out  if you look "closely" you can see that waila reports a power of 2 on the redstone that is powering the torch  which is also off

i'd be fine with that  just as long it doesn't cause a stuck background process in my workflow

sample project will be difficult   at least since the whole stuff works like a charm if i deploy it on my local machine  only running in azure it breaks   we are assuming that the problem might be caused by a federated ad scenario plus a conditional access policy  access only from company ips  bound to the ad where we are federated into 
i've been trying outside the actual environment    i'll update this when i succeed  it may wind up being something stupid  like calling  unregister  twice  possibly in different contexts  possibly simultaneously

 laa this is server edition  not embedded  by not responding i mean    it cannot be shutdown with  stop   the only way is killing the process    either from studio or from applications  after a restart  it responds to a few queries  then it seems to be frozen  no errors logged  no cpu usage  but it won't respond to anything  at this moment i chose to wait for it to shutdown softly  but it's been about 1 5 hours so far    db size is 88g  thanks

java tests  that interact with the outside world  to be precise  provided there is a test  that interacts with outside world via network  running it in bazel sandbox   fail the test because of the network blocking  as expected   running same test in debug mode   passes the test   it isn't a critical issue  but it comes to be a nuisance when investigating the test failures  the most basic idea that comes mind   is it possible to block network for all  but debugger traffic

sorry  it seems to be my fault  i made new pairing with my miband and the sync started to work after that  curios that the alarm was working without that   update  the problem is that you cannot use both apps  gadgetbridge and mi fit   the tracking data get lost after using mi fit so gadgetbridge can't update it

no i was testing different functionalities in glide and pretty much used the same syntax as above 
understandable but then it make sense to have it with grey background  writable text box could be useful in case when having a directory path in clipboard to paste it into that box  that would be even more useful when having a long path of multiple nested directories  now i have to click "browse"  then hit "ctrl+l"  and then i can paste the path 
actually i encountered this issue while working on issue #94  i was checking functionality and encountered this one  so i opened this issue 
i don't know  just executing them  i guess  😉   the problem with these tests for sure is that they actually are integration tests  not only testing the binding  but indirectly also the complete esh framework  that's why the are hit by asynchronous behavior  automated magic like autoupdate if item states  auto linking and all that  if some of these things change in a slight aspect  e g  timing  implemented in a different way   then these tests also suffer   i think if you want to really get rid of this stuff  then it would make sense to reduce the test scope to the binding itself  just making sure it uses the esh apis correctly  i e  if you want to test if a certain action leads to an item update  just take the standalone thinghandler  feed it with a mocked thinghandlercallback and ensure it's calling  stateupdated        don't care what happens afterwards    the new  testing documentation  https   github com eclipse smarthome blob master docs documentation development testing md#mockito  gives a pretty good example of how this can be done using plain java 8  hooray  with mockito  for the majority of binding tests  this suffices and there is hardly any need for osgitests 
 adam sandor i'm not sure what else is relevant     i recall that i didn't have  docker machine  installed at the time i tried this  though   
probably yes  the annotation processor does basically nothing  i e   no xml file outputted  for instance   i will try another way of serialising xml files 
 boaks i don't think i need to check the alert message after the exception has been serialized  so for me it won't be needed  but maybe others want to check the alert message even after it has been serialized  is there any reason not to serialize the alert message as well

thanks for your help  maybe bug https   github com raiman sikulix1 issues 258 prevents me from getting a stack trace  confirmed if i use guava 21 0  then this problem disappears 
fwiw  i like the proposal outlined in #10249  it makes a lot of sense to me   but  failing that  i'd 'expect' the meta fields to be the ones prefixed with underscores  and always  not just when conflicting   and 'my' column names to remain untouched   but then there's nothing to stop me from indexing something with a field name of  _ip   as far as i know   and then all that's been achieved is making the conflict less likely  and prefixing the meta fields with underscores would be a breaking change

anything like this does the job on safari  but not on chrome   firefox  where the same circle is serialized to approx   13k   6k message size  both of which arrive without any issue at cineast   so it is most likely a safari problem  however  i think i've encountered the problem already on chrome   firefox  it seems also to depend on the size of the sketched circle  small circles do not crash    screen shot 2019 12 19 at 09 22 56  https   user images githubusercontent com 14314470 71156879 34117780 2241 11ea 86f3 e0d3b52f07ac png  i suggest keeping this issue open in case someone can reproduce it on firefox   chrome
sure  let's try with master first 
those error messages i reported were from an older version of the code   these are the outputs i now get when running aac5f  14 jan    for as11_dpp_hd_example_1 mxf    i'll email details of how you can obtain these mxf files  i suspect the sd issue is to do with klv fill between the header partition pack and the primer pack 
it is a multiplayer server   had this issue on my server with a plugin that when removed  placed a binding block and only did this with mekanism mechanics   however  i am on someone elses server and help him when i can             you cannot place on the block  but can place next to it     i have not tried to move it with a piston but would assume i would not be able to move it    ill try and let u know in a few moments
it happens on every video i download  even when the video is 60fps

_update  i was testing a lot back and forth while writing the below and now i can't get it to work with websockets chrome anymore either  but i have no idea what i did  anywho  if this persists i guess i'll have to workaround using cookies sicen that works now as per issue #485  thanks   and fetch the object manually from cache   i still think it would be fantastic if it was possible to access the attributes on the wrapped request  so i am leaving the description below     thanks _  sorry if i was unclear  i already have an object stored on the request  that i want to fetch using request getattribute    the object is set using setattribute    earlier  on the regular httpservletrequest object by a regular servlet serving jsps and i need to retreive it inside the atmosphere handler servlet  this works when using websockets  but not when using long polling  as i understand it  the httpservletrequest is wrapped by the atmospehererequest and this is why this works  but perhaps the wrapping is incomplete in long polling version   i never got atmosphere test code up and running properly  but the minimal testcase would be to have a regular servlet doing something like     and make sure that ws is actually fetched properly  in my case it's not a string  but a custom object  but should be the same  this already works in websocket code  like i said  _update  as said above  now it doesn't but i don't know why  i "should" be back on the code that works now before trying to work out ie issues  but it stopped working _

this is what i'm using   https   gist github com febilian 6aa0cb30b68d8f0f24949b5cafc99838  i'm using in control to manage where the mobs spawn  which is why all of those options are at 0   now that it's been said  i wonder if putting the tier 3 mobs at 0 is what caused it    even though they are supposed to spawn indirectly anyways  i thought 
plus the type name of the exception   both for http2ex and cause

there are 3 transceivers   one sends power only   one receives items only  and had 2 chests on 2 sides   the 3rd one  that created the error  was attached to the quarry  and receives power and sends items   after this error  the world would not even load  the server would crash   i used mcedit to remove the quarry and transceiver  i could see the location of the ticking entity in the crash log   and then was able to load the world   i then noticed that the transceiver that receives items mistakenly had a 2nd chest adjacent to it  and removed it so that only 1 chest remained   from that chest me cable is connected to import into an ae network   i then placed the quarry and transceiver again  and no problems   there was severe tick lag just prior to the crash

oh  i forgot to mention that i had already checked that file  it saves the user what i created and the odd part is  that the file remains unaffected after reboot  it doesn't remove the user or change it's password hash   i also use windows so there shouldn't be problem with the write read permissions

hi   a small update  in fact it works when i just make 1 step of the client  then 1 step of the server to receive the message  but as soon i make the second step on the client model  i get the socket closed exception 
there is no such error anymore 
initially no  but i just enabled it in the current master to see if that fixes anything  the problem persists

 eivantsov thanks  i'll try with more ram   i had given it 1gb to start  but i'm wondering if that was maybe not enough 
i tried to set it   same result
yes  i agree it makes sense to support ootb behavior    i like your idea of a path pattern based selection  an admin could say "these areas of the site are not access controlled  ie  don't have special permissions  and thus we do not need to authenticate the request"  on the other hand you could also have a field where you specify which paths you do need to authenticate  sort of like exclude and include fields  not sure if that makes it too complicated    wdyt 

i am running  ubuntu 16 04  and  ctrl+f ctrl+a  seems to work fine  could be a nice workaround  indeed  but  still  the default behaviour looks like when you open a new google page it shows the previous query in the search box     
i forgot to mention we are using spring security   according to the stacktrace it's going through the  websocketserverhandshaker    so i suppose it has something to do with the websockets  i was not able to reproduce it locally  i just see the problem from the server logs  app is is deployed on k8s cluster behind proxies      i know this kind of problem is pretty hard to solve  i wanted to report it  and to get some hint  i will try to disable the security layer    eg  this similar one had to do with chrome requests  https   github com spring cloud spring cloud gateway issues 242 yet another https   github com spring cloud spring cloud gateway issues 340  it would be nice to have better logging support for these exceptions 
it turns out  this is a ui display glitch that occurs if a recipe is present on the server but not the client  so they have to be in sync   it would make sense  i think  to add a recipe for the repair recipe   it's "enchantment repair"  not enchantment thaumcraft anything  not sure why   and  implicitly  to allow for recipes being conditional on a mod's presence 
yes we upgraded spring boot  https   github com syndesisio syndesis issues 3917   this is spring core  any objections to go to 4 3 18 for this  i think we need to make sure the version of camel we use in the meta and integration pods can handle this

yes  it's device specific  only mentioned devices are affected   in the meanwhile  i figured out following details  1  using _top_  i compared cpu load  required to play my streams on the japanese xperia z3 versus european xperia z3  on that japanese device cpu load is twice as high   2  as well  japanese devices cause the following message printed to the logcat  07 13 17 47 33 296 w acodec    9173   do not know color format 0x7fa30c04   2141391876   however  european versions do not  3  playback stops when the player switches to the 8mbps bitrate  in the initial experiment  i observed 10 15 seconds playback because i started with 1mbps  and then relied on the player to increase the quality  in the clean experiment  i fixed the bitrate to the predefined value and observed  turned out that on the affected devices  there is no problem playing 4mbps stream  but when exoplayer is given an 8mbps stream   it consumes almost all cpu and drops all frames   so far  my theory is  1  those affected devices are not capable of switching the surface to color format color_qcom_formatyuv420packedsemiplanar32m  0x7fa30c04  2  therefore  they fall back to converting 0x7fa30c04 into something like color_formatyuv420semiplanar just after decoding  and that's why cpu load is higher   if my theory proves right  then there is a little exoplayer may do to improve the situation  except  maybe  adapting the algorithm of the maximum bitrate estimation  and including that "incompatible surface" variable into it

in the client side  i'm using standardwebsocketclient  while handshaking  it is trying to extract port number from the url  but container's public url doesnt have port number at the end   wss   server2v4p7rik dedicated container server 6000 mydomain com chat    so  the websocket client is trying to use the privileged port no  443      in order to overcome this  i had to use authbind to bind exposed port 443 to springboot websocket port 6000

hey mario   the 5 calls are not problematic   i'm actually loading 5 different content types for our home screen  it's those content space and content type querying calls that are strange  because i'm always passing the explicit content type to load   for example  this is how i'm loading the whole content type     as i said  i do this for those 5 different content types  so i would expect 5 different calls like this  but not 15 
sure  i e mailed you one  hope that's ok
actually  i am reusing the same sortoder instance each time when i fetch nodes with getall    in the tests  a new sortorder instance is created when the getall   method is called  i think this is why you can't reproduce this bug with the test you provided above 
hi  macdonst  thanks for your reply well   the code just like the example code    but i am using pgb  build phonegap com  cli 5 1 1 with all official core plugin from npm
i think that any attempt to show it whole will cause the same crash as its simply too big  so to be save i would opt for truncating it after a certain length   mt can handle pretty long strings  but e g  3000+ character makes it crash  just tried it   so 200 max 
it was set to default  square wave  and even on sine it was skewing the waveforms  and would you be willing to rename the rednet historian to rednet oscilloscope 
about 10m+  we cannot set this limit ourselves    best regards
i use the apache one 
i will see what i can do 
there is not a real bug  i found the problem  i thought i turned off battery optimisation but instead it was still turned on   but i gave permission to get app status   usage  the next time i opened the app it asks me again for both   turn off battery optmisation and app status   usage    so i thought it was not working  it works now    some more suggestios   let apps been added to a running lock  let's say i want to add chrome for the current time period without the need to restart the program     turn on flightmode  turn off phone  mail  wlan  for a custom time  would also be nice to have as an addition  so you can say  don't disturb me for x amount of time at all but turn on again automatically in 30 minutes  and of course shortcuts would be nice to activate it quickly    reverse timer is also a good idea  thanks 
i tried the goto station action  to no avail   it was with version 7 0 3   this is more a suggestion then a bug i suppose  it is not an issue when i define a work area

os windows 7  x64 the problem was repeated all the time  but only on one of the projects  i think it was the file that was to blame  i'm sorry i did not save it for tests

hi  setting the limit to 1 is already a good workaround  as there is no need anymore to restart eclipse to free memory   setting a sliding window seems a good solution  since i usualy only dive into the latest lines of  trace  logging  if there is a need to dig into all other logging  a logging file is a good idea  however in most cases the test has stopped at an error  so that is usualy the latest logging  besides that  there is also the possibility to do debugging  so an external file is not a must  thanks for the quick investigation  regards  evert huijben
not using optifine  afaik    fyi  and this may be irrelevant   i have tried going into  indigo renderer properties  and setting   always tesselate blocks false   ambient occlusion mode vanilla  it doesn't seem to help with the issue 
 nadahar scanning is only possible when cache is enabled   yeah my suspicion is like you said  that we are keeping references to objects that are no longer needed   i haven't seen an error yet because the memory use keeps going until it freezes  i've been going backwards in time to see when it appeared and i've found a version that doesn't have the memory creep  4 4 0  i'll keep narrowing down when it first appeared and may be able to find a fix that way instead of profiling 
that is what i'm doing  i've a biodialog method which has the following in it     i know it would deviate away from the bioprompt api  but maybe a way to make a call to dismiss the dialog would help  from reading it may be that when the activity pauses i've got the activity finishing and i've read that the error can happen if your calling finish with a dialog still open 
 reckart  you pushed this change to develop branch  could you also push to master  or should i switch to develop 
that was the first thing i checked  and they were set correctly  the guest users are actually coming from another azure ad tenant which itself is configured to do single sign on with an adfs directory  i'm sure that i don't expect you to be able to fully support this  but wondering if there's a way that i can capture the claims coming back to send to you for investigation 
hi  dzc34   it's the develop version   thanks   
i agree  i could produce a little screencast  would be nice to have a website for weblounge release notes   
my apologies  i thought that i put that in the original post  this bug was found on 0 4 0rc3  update  it appears that rather than converting waste into fuel  the waste and any quantities of fuel that cannot be converted into ingots are destroyed  the ejected fuel is still duped times the number of ports 
unfortunately i don't remember which dataset was it     i'll try to reproduce it and keep you in touch 
thanks  i am using 1 0 0 final by the way 
 srowen will do  the language is kotlin
thanks for your feedback   since it does seem to be unclear whether the bug is due to bootstrap's javascript  or the way it was wrapped in gwt  i simply extended the gwt class with my own and added "try catch" blocks around the code calls that trigger errors

thanks  then i will try with cwm
i think i can try the same steps within simple project or in one of the test projects  i'll write as i try
 thboileau the problem has been resolved in 2 3 10  thanks for the rapid response 
ok  it's due to this code in the language module 
i will pay attention to that next time it breaks  as far as i remember i can only say not all writers on the same network break down at the same time  at least not always  that much i know 
maybe i try the test in a wrong way   after i class i used in the testunit is contains static method 

actually  my setup looks almost exactly like the 'edge case' you've described  with haproxy instead of nginx   but with one important difference    so haproxy sets the x fowarded proto header  so tomcat knows that the original request is secure  i e  requests issecure   returns true  no need to configure https for tomcat  imo this is the correctly configured version of tne edge case   which is not so edgy at all imo

i was able to connect to the server using the login password "test"  the content was shown instantly and everything worked like a charm    i would help if you could tell me what i need to do  my device is not routed and as far as i understood all kind of logcat apps doesn't work with android 4 4 2 anymore  any idea how i could get access to the "important" log files     btw    after the successful test with demo owncloud org  i decided to test it with a newly created owncloud account on my server  i was able to show all files within a second  this leads me to the assumption that the described problem might be caused by the fact that i'm not using local storage but external webdav file systems with my account 
it's obfuscated when the client is built  you can't find it here because it's not open sourced  kyle628

 sjudd  thank you    the problem was confirmed in 5 1  9 0  but i think it is an issue independent of versions 
thanks  i've made a local build of the latest master and the npe no longer occurs     
i think the way a dependent target was defined instructed bazel to use those files  and then bazel complained about that but much later  without context  i might be wrong   anyway  i fixed this by specifying in crosstool the correct   isystem  flag where the  opencv2 opencv hpp  file can be found 
awesome minuskube 
that seems like a reasonable solution  should i reopen the issue for now then

what i'm thinking now is to check network connection and retry pulling data multiple times  it will take some time  but it's better than fail 
i downloaded it from the official site https   cryptomator org   and i checked the sha256 hashcodes  its all correct

hi  fuss86   unfortunately  file lastmodified    suffers from the same problem  it doesn't return any subsecond granularity   i haven't checked it  but supposedly java 10 has this fixed 
i think i figured out the issue  last night i moved the analyzer with the book still in its slot  breaking the analyzer with the book in place doesn't drop the book  apparently the book contains the research  as opposed to thaumcraft where research is stored in player data   effectively resetting the discovered seed mutations  when i did this i went into creative mode to get a new book  perhaps that is the issue    the "missing info" i think  is then just the info being reset  it's likely i didn't get any new mutations after that happened  i thought it might be related to mod conflicts from mods i added to my installation this morning    when i just checked on mutations i ended up breaking the analyzer again and the same thing happened  i cheated in another book  by that time i had successfully mutated sugar cane seeds and they appeared    in short  mutations don't disappear from books  breaking the analyzer loses book and resets research 
i'm currently playing around with this screen  working on the title for the split  so i'll just create all the issues that i run into first  will probably fix later  when i finish this one 
it seems that it does work now  the script keeps connected to the correct event without issuing any crashes   however  i found a similar issue with renaming a condition  after renaming a condition  a script using the condition inside an inline event will now reference to a complete different condition  i would suggest to use ids to link conditions to scripts if possible  this may can prevent problems with renaming 
i had "mod" inheriting from a "tmod" rank that i removed when updating permissions  and forgot to fix it  unfortunately you skip past things like that when you're updating things at 1am 
hi   my nginx config is practically the same as what's documented other than     using   gl    as the subpath instead of   graylog     and   adding  proxy_set_header x forwarded proto  scheme    the problem existed without this line      as said earlier  the other parts of the application appear to be functional for me when using nginx as a reverse proxy   i do not see this behaviour when i access the application at http   127 0 0 1 9000 directly      not_found  https   user images githubusercontent com 8793762 74431017 c5c6eb00 4e66 11ea 98b5 0cc7b0521992 gif

i was thinking of changing the code in nettyroutingfilter to also check if the response is a serverhttpresponsedecorator  and if yes  get its delegate  and do this in a loop  so multiply nested decorators are still handled properly   something like this in nettyroutingfilter    but is there a quick  easy workaround for how the code looks now

well a solution may be to use one variable witch is increased until you find the first letter and the index of the number of letter matched is   0  in my example the first value should be the index 2   that way we keep track of where it could start the next recursive sequence  if the match fail  instead of continuing from the current position  as you do now  you'll have to fall back to that stored value   do you like it i'm planning to write down some code when i'll have time  whoops  seems like we don't have a way to call a reset on the stream  or to do a peek   of multiple position   in that case a buffer is the solution  start to save it when you would had set the possible start of recursive sequence

i don't think it's a good idea to alter the index name automatically  e g  to lower case it   as it may be quite surprising to the user  could you perhaps create the index upon first arrival of a source record from a given topic  then you'd automatically apply whatever name transformations have been configured   if that's not viable  i'd question the decision to deprecate the old mapping option and suggest to un deprecate it  as it can safely be applied eagerly to create the index es  as well as when handling individual source records

from what i understand  the problem is due to the   '  part    that is closing the inline xquery and continuing the xml text block section  it looks like the parser is getting confused and is not doing the xquery    xml transition  so is parsing the  '  in xquery mode   thus  the parsing modes should look like

raw junit5 test  i mock all dependencies  for a service  all repositories  for a rest endpoint  all services         according to me  using   quarkustest  is for integration test  my definition of a unit test is a test testing only one composant without any dependencies     so this is a best practice to use raw unit test  without any framework support  and mocking everything so all my tests runs in a few hundreds of ms from my ide

hi guys   i think we are facing another time zone issue   my time zone is  gmt  02 00 brasilia summer time  and the issue can be reproduced using the sample files   i changed my device to a non negative time zone  i used  gmt +00 00 greenwich mean time   and like you the problem could not be spotted 
actually it works now  some update in between seems to have fixed it  thanks a lot 
the user reported back saying this was the problem  according to  gnome keyring documentation  https   wiki gnome org projects gnomekeyring keyringintro  "login" is the default keyring and it seems like this one was not present on the system   still  rather than crashing cryptomator should just not offer this feature then 
the player in question has been trying to play with 12 year old computer and repeatedly tells me he has has to connect 3 times to finally actually stay in the game  but it is just him that reports that  none of my 100's of players report the issue  your probably missing a simple null check in one those 4 places  at least i hope it's simple   and congrats on the big bucks  i'm nipping at your toes  but i have loads more java and forge to learn 
is it possible that the icon attribute uses glyphicons and not font awesome   that could explain why i only get a limited subset of icons   when i just looked at the glyphicons list a lot of the icons are identical with the same name   i will try to verify this 
something like this  milestone v1 8 x   status closed  btw  i never defined which status labels are considered open closed for this repo  may be this repo doesn't have a label that hubturbo expects to see 
i was missing a config file in the classpath  i expected it to fail gracefully
 qparis so you want a dto for the  script  inside the  shortcutdto   i don't think that's possible because it depends on the engine  e g  "winedebug"   if we create a  dto  for it  we cannot have user defined engines anymore  the previous solution just printed the values for every key in the json and did not try to map anything therefore it did not have a problem 
possibly  though i'd argue that at least in influx's case it doesn't matter  'none'  to me  is a work around for a system that doesn't metrics that have the same 'name' but different tags   like prometheus     why store data that is meaningless   in that exception none is the effectively the same as just not having the exception tag at all

i'm still try to reproduce like a integration test  but without success  but at our test cluster  this bug also manually reproduced  and looks like this   2 nodes 1 4 2 with centos and oracle jvm 8  first node contains shards 1 4 5 7  second contains 0 2 3 6  8 total  0 replicas  query     i have this error only if query  executed at second node  if first  all is ok  with search shards api  looks like 3016 route to 7th shard  second node does not contain 7th  but first does   any ideas

oh man you're right   warps+welcomewarpsign   sorry 
 tvernum in the meantime  i would strongly urge you to document that you can't create api keys with other api keys to prevent anyone else from also wasting a day debugging this    ## my use case  we have many environments all writing to a centralized cluster  production sites feed into a production index  staging sites feed into a staging index  etc  originally  the script i wrote to manage this used one machine user that is accessed via an api key to create api keys  run_as  other users that have the set of permissions that we want each api key to have  after i ran into issues with that  i started to generate api keys for each of the intermediary users directly  rather than with requests  run_as  those users  so that they could then generate api keys with the necessary roles   so for example  if a staging site needs api credentials to be able to write to the index  then the  indexer staging  user that has the necessary privileges will create an api key that can be given to the staging site   i prefer the method of accessing everything with api keys because it allows for easy and frequent rotation of api keys  in fact  the base machine user is _only_ accessible via api key  because it is created with a  password_hash  that's purposely corrupted  i e  taking a hash like   2y 04 c6xlqlggrui o8if98urvoevblmurskqoysml9coxc7s w9n8 f8y  and replacing a bunch of characters with zeros like   2y 04 c6xlqlggrui o8if0000000000000000oysml9coxc7s w9n8 f8y   to essentially disable password login for that user   however  in my particular use case  the base machine user and the intermediary users are only ever used from the server that's running elasticsearch itself  so i can just switch those to use passwords in the meantime   ## my ideal solution  i have two thoughts about how api keys should be implemented   ### machine users  the first is that there should be a type of user specifically for system machine users  i initially use the  elastic  account to create the  machine_user_owner  account  with the corrupted password hash to make direct login impossible   and then i use the  elastic  credentials to run as the machine user to generate an api key    it would be nice if i could create a user that didn't have the option for password login at all    and that the only way to use that user is to access it via api generated by another user running as that machine user   ### permissions model  the second is that an api key should be _continually_ associated with a user  that is  rather than an api key having a point in time snapshot of the authenticated user's permissions  each api key should have the permissions that are the intersection of the authenticated user's permissions and any  role_descriptors    let's say i create three roles     this api key would be limited to the intersection of the user's privileges and the  role_descriptors   so it would only have index privileges  because it was specified as having no cluster privileges       https   user images githubusercontent com 542937 74367082 40c4ce80 4d9f 11ea 8dee b9cc21888c01 png    then  if i remove the  index_manager  and  cluster_manager  roles from  test_user_2  at a point in the future  the  index privileges key  should also lose its ability to write to indices  resulting in the permissions of       https   user images githubusercontent com 542937 74367320 a5802900 4d9f 11ea 9267 6dca6e9efce1 png   #### keys created with keys  and of course  we can't forget about the original issue of keys created with keys  in this case  i think that the permissions of keys created with keys should reflect the intersection of   creator's privileges at any given time    role_descriptors  defined when creating the first key    role_descriptors  defined when creating the second key  thus  even if the creator is the superadmin  if the first key is created with _no_ cluster permissions aside from  manage_own_api_key   then no child api key will ever be able to have cluster permissions

i'm developing for linux  using libcurl  this is effectively my exact situation  http   stackoverflow com questions 6302282 how do i link libcurl to my c program in linux  i was able to work around the issue by creating a "dummy library" with no files  but the linker flags i need in  exported_linker_flags   then making the dummy library as a buck dependency for the binary  this resulted in   lcurl  coming after the object files and a successful compilation execution    while this works fine  it seems like a very improper solution  it's also possible that i am misunderstanding some part of the process and would appreciate any input

huh ok  looks like it more subtle than i thought  i tried a fresh repo with a hand built jar and it was able to extract it alright  there's also an interaction with sandboxing   if i pass    genrule_strategy standalone   i don't get the permission error  unfortunately this means i can't tell how much it's creating before it dies since i can't tell what happened in the sandbox after the fact  web xml permissions are 644   i trimmed my rules down a bit  here's what i have now     file permissions before creating the backend war look ok according to ls  and the echoed paths look fine up until when ijar zipper is invoked  again it works okay if i disable sandboxing  so maybe the root cause has something to do with that  if nothing jumps out at you from this i can keep trying to trim this down to a minimal repro that i can share  but it will take a bit more work

all these alignment options in 608decoder are based on assumptions what the content provider intended to achieve by adding whitespaces around the text  as the negative value is caused by incorrect content  we should probably not trust the values and the safest could be center alignment for pop on captioning mode  but other modes cannot be center aligned  the only other common mode is roll up  always left aligned  so something like this    note  also added the condition suggested in https   github com google exoplayer issues 3533

hi martin   thanks for the prompt reply  also  it's my pleasure to support aedict on patreon  as it's a piece of software that i use every single day and that has simplified my language learning process considerably   as for the current issue  i think that your proposed solution of beginning with the "correct" stroke count probably makes the most sense  another option would be to add "sort by stroke order" checkbox or menu option  in order to give users the ability to disable the new sorting feature   typically  i wouldn't have bothered you about such an issue  but i noticed that it actually had a marked effect on my translation output  i'm working on a pretty technical text right now  and having an additional 5+ seconds added to each search  scrolling to find the correct stroke count  is actually kind of non trivial over hours of work and 10s or 100s of dictionary look ups   anyway  i appreciate the reply and the tireless work you've been investing into aedict   best wishes  chris on may 4  2016 4 14 pm  "martin vysny" notifications github com wrote 
it should either show a empty label  or generate an exception that tells me clearly what is wrong with the code  it took quite some debugging to find the actual cause  because the exception happens latter  when the json is being generated  not immediately when the label generator returns    i would prefer the first option  since i think it will be a common cause of problems   if the second option is chosen  i think the javadoc in the setitemlabelgenerator should also mention that it is not ok to return null values

basically have a config option to turn off your "socket" effects  socket damage  false socket mob freeze  false socket leech  false socket fire  false socket defense  false  like that  also im sure my plugin stackableitems is causing alot of issues it doesnt have alot of compatibility with other plugins   i got a player whos damn good at finding bugs in plugins its almost scary    if you have a duped item or a item from a tier that was changed  which i did 2 days ago  you can use that item as your boots and when you click and drop the item in your boots slot it will duplicate what is in your hand  i havent tried this but they were duplicating stuff like mad   it also ended up bugging their player data or corrupting it and i had to delete their player data to actually stop them from getting internal server errors in the server and getting kicked 
i'm using dbeaver 3 6 7 and postgresql 9 5   i'll give you an example on how to reproduce my exact problem  1  connect to a pg database 2  open new editor  this should by default have search_path public  since no schema is selected as active  3  run the following sql    1  close the editor 2  refresh the database  so that the new schema can be seen  3  set the mytest schema as active 4  open a new editor 5  perform the following queries       image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 6532949 15281046 d62599e4 1b37 11e6 8a3a 863f6b8a7415 png   as you can see the search_path is set to public only although i've created a new sql editor when a schema was set to active

i'm now registering log the following way 
woops    forgot to add that    here you go 
thanks for your quick response  just a bit more information before i attempt to redo the trace to try to capture what you need   i have performed the test with two other mail clients  thunderbird  45 3 0  and standard mail client on ios and both detect an invalid password and prompt the user to update the password   at my organisation we manage approximately 110 smartphones of which 95 are android with k 9 deployed  from my experience i haven't seen k 9 prompt the user for a new password after their password is changed  but i'd love to be proven wrong   during the trace i collected i was monitoring the server side logs and multiple authentication errors occurred for the test account with reason invalid password  which leads to the other half of this problem where by k 9 will keep trying to login after password failure  our mail server  zimbra 8 7  is configured to lockout accounts that have a number of a authentication failures within a period of time  so in our case k 9 is causing accounts to be locked out within moments of the user changing their password   to make matters worse  even if the user has the initiative to go into k 9 account settings and manually update their password  at this point their account is inevitably locked out  which means when k 9 goes to verify the password they've input it reports the password as incorrect to the user   another thing i noticed when i was testing this issue was in between the user updating their password in the email system and them manually clicking the refresh button on the folder view in k 9  k 9 would eventually display a light grey "ioexception  readstringuntil    end of stream reached" under the inbox  and put an entry in the k9mail errors  attached     k9 ioexception txt  https   github com k9mail k 9 files 733905 k9 ioexception txt 
i tried to reproduce it with the "normal" kura version but the bug appears too here is what i did   1  selected single_asset_generated and applied   1a  https   user images githubusercontent com 60254601 73953220 631e9e00 4900 11ea 8221 da84ce5ab7e2 jpg   2  click on "upload channels"  select file  check "replace current channels"  click on "upload"   2a  https   user images githubusercontent com 60254601 73953655 02dc2c00 4901 11ea 8539 6ce390d2f1c4 jpg   3  you can see the config is reseted   3a  https   user images githubusercontent com 60254601 73953731 230beb00 4901 11ea 8dc5 1b758449d51a jpg     mmaiero what kind of detail will help  the snapshot0  
i've tried to find this file again and tried dozens of them  i did not find it   all of these checked files all have to do with the construction of the ngen score generator and perhaps may have to do with the solved issue empty space with dropdown menu #383   i may have been working with a file that was already corrupted     i suggest  as me too i cannot replicate this issue any more  to close this issue  next time i'll give all the info i have   sorry for this one

hey  rohankanojia it's hard to reproduce it  didn't able to capture the logs  i observed its an issue with https   github com fabric8io fabric8 maven plugin blob master rt src test java io fabric8 maven rt vertxhttpboosterit java#l89  where it invoke application rest endpoint and it gets empty error message response  right now test wait for application pod to come up but it looks like time for creating route and service may vary  even though test already has some  delay  https   github com fabric8io fabric8 maven plugin blob master rt src test java io fabric8 maven rt baseboosterit java#l386    to wait until all resources get prepared 
it seems like nodeinfo itself is never null  although i did not check each item  but most variable of nodeinfo is null if we can not get a row from hbase  i agree that nodeinfo isempty   is more readable  i will update it after it passes regression

thanks  sladkoff  i'm fairly new to paper  but i believe it's a fork of bukkit  so it should be fairly similar to that  thanks for taking a look 
what does  do in  phoenicis javafx src test java org phoenicis javafx appconfigurationinitialisationtest java   maybe this is causing the issue 
no  it doesn't seem to happen in the latest nightly  new ui   but i have only run it for a few days so i can't be absolutely sure yet since it didn't happen often before either

i think nothing special needed to reproduce the issue  "openiabeventmanager" gameobject is on the scene with appropriated script attached  all event listeners subscriptions inside onenable   and ondisable   also includes restoresucceededevent  restorefailedevent and transactionrestoredevent   i also checked this list of events and they raises as expected    billingsupportedevent   queryinventorysucceededevent   purchasesucceededevent   purchasefailedevent

with 2 1 ga the illegalstateexception still happens  i have been unable to reproduce the nullpointerexception though   on the first attempt 100 records get actually moved  on the second attempt another 78  again  throwing the illegalstateexception   further attempts only throw the exception and move nothing   console log follows 
this is the used docker version  docker version 1 9 1  build a34a1d5 i installed it as suggested in the docuentation os  centos linux release 7 3 1611  core   running as virtual machine in openstack environment  i saw the same error on 1 14 4  after approx  two weeks cloudbreak failed and i cloud not reach the webui although i could ssh into the machine  after updating to 1 16 1 it worked again   
yes  i do  also  it doesn't seem to matter whether i have optifine on it or not  extending from optifine or vanilla 1 11 2  neither work  i also tried renaming the folder  json and the id inside the json of the version  but it still isn't showing up and i have no idea why 
it is my own app  the only strange thing about it i can see is that it has playmusic   in the update method   while this may seem strange  it is a direct code conversion from as  and worked in flash   consider adding support to prevent playmusic   in update method from causing restarts on focus lost 
interesting  it looks like i misinterpreted what i experienced    you're right it has to do with the list length and not the contents  that makes a lot more sense  i've updated the issue to include the latest information including that this was found on a motorola g4 running android 7 0  it seems to has to do with when items need to scroll   i'd be ok to close this since i think you're right there's not likely to be anything we can do 
1  a  it happened after i made acc cosig #1 a cosignatory of acc multisig #1  b  you enter the account  everything is displayed normally  i scroll down to the bottom and back up  this leads to the msg of the wrong tx get shown in the wrong place   if i go back to accounts and back in it  its normal  but happens again if i repeat b   and so on 2   in this example  pls look up how "dona" gets displayed for two different tx  it should normally just stand with the 1000xem tx   happened in the very first picture on this issue aswell with multisig#1    screenshot_2016 02 18 08 26 29  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 16880923 13136801 d6d657e4 d61c 11e5 88bf 2210286a538c png    screenshot_2016 02 18 08 26 37  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 16880923 13136804 dac59ab8 d61c 11e5 9e7b e6327986aee0 png

 tonihei i see  let me check with the content team on the encryption  is there anyway i can see and identify these in the logs myself 
okay  i adjusted the default github bug report template   feel free to adapt it 
i think the code right now is vulnerable to failure any time an update occurs   my ideal behavior would be that the code is only vulnerable on the very first run on a new system   after that  failure is easy to avoid on any successive run  since one successful run guarantees a data file    here's my ideas suggestions   1  provide a way to specify the cache directory  default to java io tmpdir  but allow the user to override   the only downside to using java io tmpdir is that some systems will clean the directory on reboot  but it makes a good default   2  put the online updater into the core package   i'm sure the majority of the user base wants to use online updates  those users don't require a dependency on a package that's updated monthly   as a bonus  it'll be easier to click through the code when viewing on github   3  you could simplify the code by combining the updating and non updating parser   the updating parser can default to 1 day for the update interval   the non updating parser can use long max_value as the update interval  292 millions years    this makes the less common use scenario  i e  no updates  a subcase of the common use case scenario    i e  giving you less code to test and maintain with the primary code path being the one that is most used    4  consider the option of _not_ bundling any data files with uadetector  do you really want to make a new release every month for many years to come   that's a lot of work for a small number of users that don't want online updates   you can include information on how manually download the data file   if you do decide to bundle  the bundled package can copy it's data file into the caching directory to maximize the shared code

you used the same code  i tried this on 1 12 2 aswell now and get the same error
as i haven't changed any setting startup routine before and after the upgrade  and the drive letter  which is "x"  is not configured to be used by another program so i doubt that's the case here  though at the same time i don't know what the exact cause is   if that would be the case  it's just not understandable why that hadn't happened since  1 4 7  to  1 4 10  at all 
i can't reproduce it reliably

correct  removed jar from couple of region servers and did a cluster restart  since we are doing compatibility check for system table rs  as a workaround could we split system table in multiple regions so that it spans all available region servers

sure  should i attach the xml files too  another thing  is there any significant difference between using cvhaarclassifiercascade and cascadeclassifier  would that help   the minimal code that crashes sometimes      until now i can't replicate the sudden crash error  this causes other errors  though  like having  for example  3 detections but the int and double buffers have only one place allocated    edit 3  if i include any flag  the app crashes even faster 
 laa yes  i reverted back to 2 2 21  and it works fine 
my device is a neffos c5l and the crash happened multiple times within an hour or two before i reported it      sent from my android device with k 9 mail  please excuse my brevity 
it's the same issue as jenkinsci docker plugin#339   it looks like swarm gives a different response when pulling images  even on success  which throws the plugin off and gives  could not pull image  null   the original plugin had an  ignore pull return  workaround   option for this  re adding that is probably needed since it doesn't look like docker java fixed the actual problem yet

like i said  it's hard to reproduce  it tends to happen in groups  but i can't quite figure out exactly what triggers it  when i did get the above error  i had protocollib  debug  true   i didn't have minecraft  debug true   but i'll have to try that and see if i get anything more interesting 
thanks for getting back so quickly  just tried it in  2 0 0 m8    i think mapping to  singlerootfilesource  will work in the scenario where the subdirectory is directly under  src test resources   as is the case with  root  in the  autoconfigurewiremockfilesapplicationwithurlresourcetests     however  when pulling in stubs that come from a  jar  dependency  the resolution from  urlresource  to  file  is causing this exception     which appears to be happening because of the  jar   protocol in the url   https   github com spring projects spring framework blob b2f900e518eeb5aabf57a6deb8f267256af7b22b spring core src main java org springframework util resourceutils java#l216 l220  should the mapping actually be to  classpathfilesource   it looks like that class is doing the proper parsing of the url and extracting the  jar  portion   https   github com tomakehurst wiremock blob d36516bb76b3b7b8fb84fe2254fc2597b3fce11c src main java com github tomakehurst wiremock common classpathfilesource java#l68 l72  i put together an example demonstrating the external  jar  behavior   https   github com reillylm scc591 consumer https   github com reillylm scc591 dependent api stubs   scc591 dependent api stubs  contains the wiremock stubs and  scc591 consumer  contains the test with   autoconfigurewiremock   you'll have to run  publishtomavenlocal  on  scc591 dependent api stubs  first to make the jar available for the consumer project 
so if i set 10000 i'm getting same error  looks like default value is too big 
but the same happens if i query the vehiclehistorygraph db  i have a question  if  i have a query doesn't return any result  why getcolumncount   throws an exception  is it not possible to read the meta data another way   i have this problem by using birt and orientdb via jdbc driver  in birt you can create some filter parameters which are applied as prepared statements on the data set  since this parameters are set dynamically by user birt cannot create a schema at the time of data set definition because of sqlexception  with the sqlite db this use case works without problems 
here you can download the sample application  testapp zip  https   github com spring projects spring boot files 1371062 testapp zip    the test app is a very simple application that exposes the actuator endpoints  if you run the application as it is  the management port is different from the server port and if you perform an head request on the endpoint http   localhost 8889 management refresh you receive an internal server error  500 error code    if you edit the application yml removing the management port and management context path properties and then execute the head request on the endpoint http   localhost 8888 refresh you receive the method not allowed error  405 error code  as expected   this different behaviour represents a problem into the integration with the spring boot admin application   the app has the same behaviour if you don't specify the version 1 5 7 of the actuator library  using the one imported with the dependencies management 
sure  i even managed to make the crash happen when the file was already open this time  this is the output from the bash console after following those instructions 
agreed  such a thing already exists here   https   github com eclipse openj9 blob 02fdf14c71fb83f76deaa4f264b5c6748afc820b jcl src java base share classes java lang string java#l87 l93  although i think i've encountered at least one place in openjdk where they reach into string via reflection and extract the field  it should instead be calling this getter 
i do   i've had a quick look at  adb logcat  while this is happening   i'm not sure if it's relevant  but i see something like the following repeated many times a few seconds before the list finally poplates 
minishift version minishift v1 25 0+90fb23e  maybe i should downgrade   
this is an old issue  i'm not using bungee skellet anymore and i see you updated the plugin so it could be fixed 
well     not sure if this can be repetition of the same mur here is the log from other mobile phone in this phone the us sure a crash every time a group message arrives   device tct one touch 4033x

i don't think it's related to item textures for my router blocks specifically   the bug affects  all  held items  e g  an rftools block    other than chests  which seem to render fine   but i know they have some special rendering     i don't think it's relevant  but my routers do use a custom baked model because they can be camouflaged   but under normal circumstances  that custom baked model just returns the parent model  i e  the router's real baked model    only when camouflaged does it return the model of the camo block being used   no  i'm pretty sure it's down to that   bindtexture     call i make in the particle rendering code   if i comment that  all your rendering is fine  but my particle rendering breaks  of course

i'm getting a mpdconnectionexception   counter question  why do you make the initialization fail if the connection cannot be established at startup   ideally  the app would try to connect to an mpd instance continuously  and register the listeners once a connection is established  repeat after the connection is lost    to my  biased  mind this would be a perfect fit for using akka with play2  but  currently  i'm still withstanding the reflex to re implement the app myself

yes  but i think this has nothing to do with my issue  it's supposed to solve the problem when _children_ views are catching the events  not _parent_ views  ie  drawer layout in my case    i am thinking that if there was a getparent   requestdisallowintercepttouchevent true  somewhere in the ontouchevent code  eg  after we make sure the listview should handle the event   it might work   ps  i just got your reply through ajax while writing this and i see what you mean about usability  i have already implemented list item removal through a popupmenu  the swipe functionality will be a bonus eye candy    
yeah that's what i was looking for    or perhaps maybe the error message could just say that  'use  tardis home to update the "home" destination"   anyway that's not one of the things i''d have tried  i tried all sorts of variations of "set" or "remove" as the command to get around to this  i would not have suspected " tardis home" would have been a command to set the home    but more likely to access a home   and while it may have been on the command page  that page omits so many of the commands i'm usually needing or looking for  it doesn't even occur to me to check it anymore 
i have a feeling it’s because the  ceylon ast  project is so big

hello  emmanuelbernard  in fact  i removed the field from the update    method just to try different things and forgot to put it back  including the field is the way it's supposed to work  but it doesn't  i just updated the source code including it   i added 2 animated gifs to the  readme  https   github com manoelcampos hibernate concurrency  to show the issue   replacing  persist    by  flush    or  persistandflush    doesn't have any effect with the locking  the   version long versao  field is incremented  but the data from the previous user is overwritten   about the transaction  as it's just an example  i made the entire  clienteresource  class transactional  i moved the   transactional  directly to the  update  method and it doesn't help anyway as you said   i made sure to stop and restart quarkus after such changes 
i think so  imo we should involve the "magic" only when "normal" method fails  don't know if others agree  artpej  jponge

i made a slimmed down project that demonstrates the same behavior   link to repo  https   github com bpgray spring cloud consul test   the application context runs on port 8080 and the management context runs on port 8081   both the application and management context are registered with consul on port 8081  rather than their respective ports    the consul service ids for both services contain '8080' in their string  rather than their respective ports    for the application health check  the url contains port 8081  i'd actually like this health check to be on port 8080  but understand this might be a bit atypcial and can address by overriding the healthcheckurl with an application yml entry

thanks for the response  it's a home grown kms client that expects a configuration object  the configuration object is constructed from values that are read in from a  properties file and injected as parameters into the enclosing  bean method  the issue is arising from the fact that one of the injected parameters is somehow null when  enableswagger2 is used  but non null when it's commented out  the code runs and builds fine in the absence of swagger

it doesn't reuse the file  it marks it as read only and then it gets its length so it can compute the starting offset of the next file  if that  older  file's length changes afterwards due to a concurrent write finishing off  then the offsets will not match the sum of lengths before that   there is  however  a way by which the file is indeed used  after a successful open write  fencing   the segment's files are auto compacted  this means that empty files are deleted  except last one  since it was just created   and multiple files are concatenated into the first file  to avoid having an excessive number of smaller files sitting around    we are using the naming scheme we originally agreed upon  but it gets very hairy in some cases  suppose you have this  for segment "a"  this assumes no auto compaction is done  to explain how the very very original proposal would've worked

we have java libraries that dynamically load native c libraries and we use the sandwich api to modify the compile time and run time java classpath in order to exclude unwanted dependencies   for instance  a developer might want to exclude guava version 22 from the classpath of an application when it depends on a collection of libraries that collectively depend on both guava 22 and guava 25   more information is available in my comments here   https   github com bazelbuild bazel issues 5821  i have submitted a pull request to improve handling of native libraries but i don't think anyone has taken a look at it   https   github com bazelbuild bazel pull 7042

i've just implemented it for the level 13 icons and the major differences to the previous version are    does not scan for any borders of the icon   starts investigating pixels at the centre of the assumed icon location   walks in a spiral away from the centre instead of taking a straight line to find matching pixels   does not rely on certain specific 32 bit colors but instead just looks for color ranges like a human would do  nevertheless it is still only 30 lines of code and very fast  i've not yet looked at the level 14 stuff

yeah  why not 🙃  would be great if you can say me some class names where i can find that snipped   additional to that  how do we want to behave with that badge  🤔  i mean the repo can be "anything"   it can be published to bintray  sonartype  gradle plugin portal  own maven repo    i think we should agree on some for a badge  or get rid of the badge  🤔   should we also try to parse the url to find out the repo   i would suggest  because of "easieness"     we have a default string like  published repository   version    while "repository" is a link to the publicationrepository config  or automatic via bintray plugin    we try to parse the url for bintray and the gradle plugin portal     if bintray add the shields io badge  if gradle plugin portal use  published at gradle plugin portal   version   while gradle plugin portal is the link    we provide a  shipkitconfig releasenotes publicationrepositorybadge   but the name is wrong 🤔   which can be a customize string    like  my awesome repo    leads to  my awesome repo   version    wow    sounds not so easy 😄

where a query has a colon in it  solr is detecting it as a field and returning an error  the ratings file entry would look like this      and the error looks like this     error  caught solr exception    error from server at http   solr location 8983 solr  undefined field wonderings   in our case searches with colons are most likely because that's a document title in our data  it's not clear to me that we should necessarily remove punctuation altogether  as we may at some point have to deal with citations  which can have a wide range of punctuation in them   while we can do some work to escape punctuation in our rated queries  i was wondering if it would be appropriate to do this escaping in rre instead  perhaps controlled by a command line flag or a line in the pom file

just an update on this  i know the problem hasnt been properly adressed and its might even be a problem on my side   but  i have upgraded to android oreo again and havent experienced the issue on this version of android 
 luluzhao yes my code is also multi threaded  in my case  i think  but need to do more investigation  that i have     one background thread which finishes some trace segment  if this segment tips the trace over the threshold set in  defaultstreamingstrategy  it starts to stream part of the trace    the main thread  in parallel  returns and finishes the trace at the top level  this then causes the main recorder to send the whole trace back to x ray  if these aren't properly synchronised  it's possible for them to clash giving rise to the "segment already emitted" errors  i could do this synchronisation externally  in my code  but it would make my code a lot simpler if i could rely on the x ray library to do this for me

yes    to fix this  there is two options  1  make sure the type is not created if indexing fails 2  update the mapping on master even if indexing of doc failed  option 1 is rather tricky to implement and i do not see why the type should not be created in the mapping so i'll make a pr for option 2 shortly 
unfortunately i'm not using allure 2 yet  once i'll have a time i'll do it

don't worry  i'll build from source   cheers 
the problem is the deserialization process of the regiondata    ### reason  when restoring the region from monitoringstatus restoremonitoringstatus    the method callback readobject   is not called if the callback class is minified  ### complementary observation  looking more in detail to the code to understand the reason of the bug  there is a strange callback initialization for the regiondata   while in the beaconservice startmonitoringbeaconsinregion  there is a callback object as parameter  it's not transmitted to create the regiondata  in fact  the monitoringstatus class is reacreating a callback     #### actual code      beacon service

the function  gettypesafevalueforfield makes a promise  to get the value for a field in a typesafe way  but it does not keep the promise and  getrequestpayload   and other callers as well  will suffer from it   i like the idea of  gettypesafevalueforfield  a lot  as it makes the caller's code much easier and separates concerns  i very much prefer a solution that fixes  gettypesafevalueforfield  so all callers can benefit from the improvement   does that answer your questions

hi  i observed this crash on a nexus 5 and a motox  i was using version 5 0 of the sdk  it is always reproducable 
 mrniko sure  can you tell me how to configure that 
is the above hrof html file enough  or do you need original hrof file 
there is no way  to my knowledge  as each mod can add their own drops  at their own percentage chance  without telling anyone else about it  enough resources  i think just hardcodes the loot and the chance   it can also use the new json based loot tables  however this is new and not all mods use it   this is the one thing i didn't want to do as i wanted it to work with mods as you added removed them

i have not examined in detail what is happening when the state machine reaches the terminal state   i will do that   having said that  i don't immediately see why there should be a relationship between the state machine being stopped or started and its current state  i had intuitively viewed the different between start and stopped being whether events were being processed  why link state to start stop  even if a state machine is force stopped because it is in a terminal state  surely i should still be able to ask the state machine what state it is in   my use case is that i am modelling human centric workflows as state machine instances  so you can view a state machine instance as represent a ticket  when a ticket is finally completed  e g  approved or rejected or whatever that causes it to reach a terminal state  i need that to be persisted   i am using the state machine context as a way of view tickets in different states  i e  new  in progress  complete   with the current behaviour  when looking at the state machine context in the persistent store it never reaches the terminal state and you cannot distinguish between state machine that are genuinely in a penultimate state from those that are actually in the terminal state

i did not  and after enabling it and rebooting my phone  on demand fixed itself  the  on demand  logs now appear  and that despite the fact i already had rebooted it 3 or 4 times  wiped caches  etc  to make sure that wasn't the problem     anyway  the  no field msleeping  error still pops when i start xprivacy  but the rest seems to have decided to work magically  so i'm fine  sorry for the inconvenience      
certainly  i'll look into it 
i suspect the circular dependencies are somewhere inside that massive load of stuff coming from the imported bom file     not in the build gradle file  itself  i posted it to https   gist github com alexeyongithub c16f619028a2ba2285af2dcde4aaac8b  stripped the company name in it

that's a rstudio crash  as everything works fine outside of rstudio  and the only message i get when rstudio is launched from a terminal is  as mentioned   floating point exception    i tried reinstalling the tidyverse package but that doesn't solve the problem  the only workaround is to load every tidyverse package individually and  then  the tidyverse package itself   i really think it is linked to the message displayed when tidyverse is loaded  more specifically the checkmark symbol   
hello   swankjesse  no only one copy of okhttp3  if you mean this line   testimplementation testdependencies okhttp3  i removed it and tried and still get the error  one is  implementation  while the other is  testimplementation   however  other than those  there isn't any other copy of okhttp  i also removed the  testimplementation  one so there is only one implementation in the build gradle    here's a screenshot of the error i am getting     url  https   user images githubusercontent com 22520376 65778547 774fd300 e189 11e9 9760 ae68412eeba3 png   and here's a screenshot when using   url    instead of   url      sss  https   user images githubusercontent com 22520376 65778830 f7763880 e189 11e9 9704 3001928480db png

no  not yet  and it only happens on my tablet  had planned and thought i had mentioned it  but i guess not   i'd guess it's rendering the list or meta lists at the same time which causes the crash

i wrote the unit test using the latest reactor core master  commit 49b899b57673ad4ea97f79517113010157113b62    thanks for the tip with  flux#parallel   i didn't know this exists  we don't need dynamic subscribers  so this would fit  i also like  that in  flux#parallel  the  prefetch  count is configurable    when looking at the code of  flux#parallel  i noticed  that there is also this logic  that  subscriber requests    is always called after  prefetch   3 4  elements  e g    parallelunorderedrunon java#122  https   github com reactor reactor core blob aefbe5303725ca9c6aec172a86d672e16a430a9b src main java reactor core publisher parallelunorderedrunon java#l122   is there a reason for this  3 4

bad news   i forgot to output to a file and had debug enabled  which overflowed my console  i reran and captured the output and no log line could be found   reran with the original version  no error   i'll try running a full fsck using 2 1 1 just in case there are some others lurking around 
https   youtu be diwscpgbq w  apparently i was wrong about it happening only on other player's clients   when trying to record this video  i could only get it to happen when i opened the door myself  and when my friend opened it for me repeatedly this wouldn't happen  not sure why    this was in the pack "dungeons  dragons  and space shuttles" but i was also experiencing the same problem in the pack "builder's paradise "
i didn't test with  foc 5 yet  but will do so as soon as i got time for it  a soon as i can verify the problem fixed  i could create a test and pr

hi  thanks for this hint  the validator gave the same error  it turns out that the endpoint itself accepts the sparql query as i posted it in the first comment  however  the pagination class as well as the query validator only accepts the "count" in brackets as it is described in the sparql standard  there is an example in section 18 2 4 1 on http   www w3 org tr sparql11 query     so  my query should look like    pre select  count    as  count  where    a  lt http   www w3 org 1999 02 22 rdf syntax ns#type gt   lt http   www openlinksw com schemas virtrdf#quadmapformat gt     pre   thanks again and sorry for opening this issue

hi  thanks for your replies    ignazio1977  i'm quite sure the removed axiom cannot be derived from other axioms  but i'll recheck that  thanks     _i wanted to explain what i was doing exactly and show what went wrong  but unexpectedly the inferred statements are successfully updated in the scenario i'm explaining below  i'll have to check other examples  to see if this issue is fully solved _     you can see the exact configuration and ontology at the end of this post for more details   i'm using apache jena fuseki's  assemblers   https   jena apache org documentation fuseki2 fuseki configuration html  to create a infmodel with the pelletreasonerfactory attached  because i'm not using openllet from java code  i'm unable to see what is happening under the hood  in this configuration i'm loading the   ontology plus data ttl   file  with the below content  into the infmodel and this works as expected    when querying this dataset from fuseki sparql query interface  see query 1 below   it successfully returns the expected inferred statements of the single individual having the inffered data type property value "12"   now i execute an update query  see query 2 below  to remove an axiom and this is successful  note that in fuseki for updates you need to use the  update url and not the  query url     however  the derived axiom  when executing query 1 again  remains   and the inferred statement are removed  which i did not expect    query 1
i tried the dev version v1 8 1 dev_b52d9274 1527369785  the result is the same  i e  got 2 entries each time   the original app has the visceral index  you can see the captured image of my previous issue  #248    btw  visceral is measured as an index  not in kg or   
i woke up to see both of these responses today   d   i'm glad you got it sorted out  can't wait for a release   thanks   that is weird with the mekanism cables though  but yes  i did update that as well about the same time   but like i said  all of the other machines  te4  mek  ic2  on the line were still getting power so i figured the problem wasn't in the cables   i was using mekanism 7 1 0 87 when everything was working before   perhaps he also changed something slightly that made the rounding error you just fixed more noticeable

i will try to get a simple reproducer  however data size is not huge   its generated json couple of hundreds of kb  however there is normalize allocation happening in buffer which rounds to nearest power of 2 or so  it takes many requests to go for next allocation   also is there possibility that it doesnt get decoded if command timed out  i saw await being used
yes  "outofmemory" is also what i assume i ran several tests yesterday on a samsung galaxy s2 and a galaxy tab  both crashed if the imported gpx was "too" large  it seems to be independetnt of the gpx file i used splitting the gpx to smaller files   40mb  works well  yet  when i import a second gpx file  again c geo crashes  if i restart c geo and then import a second or third file  with another restart inbetween  it worked and i could successfully import the whole file of 160mb so  there seem to be two issues     when importing the file  c geo should monitor the system ressources and abort the import gracefully with a error message  without crashing the app  if it otherwise would run out of memory    after finishing the import  it seems that there is no sufficient cleanup of the used ressources  that is why a second immediate import exceeds the system resources and the app crashes
if i pass the whole item it's the same  it's a matter or parsing not of what i'm sending to the bean  why would i want to decompress an item in the bean when i can get the inner key and value from an entry already from the loop  i couldn't get ui repeat to work with the collection i'm working with

well like i said the same thing happens if i close and restart the server as well  so it's not that   also i'd consider not supporting  reload a bug as well  i need to  reload sometimes to update plugin configs for plugins that don't have an individual plugin reloading command  it takes like 5+ minutes for the server to restart  couldn't you detect the reload somehow and do whatever you need to do over again   also i'm using v1 5 3 
i assume that i don't completely understand the code  so correct me if i'm wrong  but after we read all the metadata  which happens in  readotafile    before we enter the loop all fields that we have getters for are already set  then we enter the loop reading remaining bytes and not setting any fields based on that data  also  as i described above  i was able to update the fw of a device successfully with the while loop removed   here is the fw file which cause the  indexoutofboundsexception   but with the while loop completely removed fw update works   902010 28 v48 zip  https   github com zsmartsystems com zsmartsystems zigbee files 3286313 902010 28 v48 zip

hi  slemeur   apologies  this was fixed while i was in the process of submitting the issue   adding a stack as per the documentation does work for me now  the issue i was experiencing was from an unrelated cause   we can close this issue 
of course  i was using dropwizard jdbi to query for rows in an amazon redshift db with timestamps that fell on a particular date  1 1 2015  in utc  redshift timestamps are always in utc   so  i created the datetime objects with utc timezone and binded them to the sql using the sql objects api  the returned rows  however  did all fall on the date i wanted  instead of getting rows between 1 1 2015 00 00 00 000z and 1 2 2015 00 00 00 000z  i got rows between 12 31 2014 18 00 00 000z and 1 1 2015 18 00 00 000z  so  both of the binded dates got shifted back 6 hours  and my jvm's timezone was us central  utc 6   when i passed the jvm argument " duser timezone utc"  i got back the correct rows   to answer your 2nd question  there is no peril in the conversion from datetime to milliseconds  the peril happens after this  either in converting the milliseconds to the timestamp object  in "new timestamp value getmillis  "  or converting the timestamp into a binary value that's sent to the database   i'm not sure which one  but my guess is the latter  either way  the root cause is that timestamp is a thin wrapper around java util date  which is known to use the jvm timezone in some unexpected situations 
yes  it does  but i can no longer resize the client 
how can i check if the sockets use numa   i checked the affinity  task manager    details  and there's a dropdown menu for selecting a processor group  only the cores in one processor are selected  if i select the ones in the other and press ok  the ones in the previous group get unselected   i don't quite understand why this happens   from the documentation i do understand why there's two processor groups  https   docs microsoft com en us windows desktop procthread processor groups  as the total number of logical processors is   64  however  i don't understand why it appears that a single process can only be running on one or the other  not both

what doc said   chunks were loaded 
decouple means that validity for a platform shouldn't be checked on data entry but only before upload  right  if so  either    the upload button should be greyed out and the message in red below or   the message should appear in a popup when pressing "upload"
only thing that comes to mind is a verbosity config as it's just a warning and not an error specifically

it does happen on enabling and disabling  but when it happens seem to be random  sometimes flight mode doesn't change for two or three "loops" of the script  then it works a while again   too bad that it can't be fixed easily  i helped myself now by switching mobile data on and off instead of flight mode  should be a standard android feature in my opinion  because not being online all the time saves lots of battery power   btw  what's the difference between exact and inexact timers  how more exact is the exact timer and is the battery drain much higher 
i just reprod on emulator w  android 7 0   plan a trip from university area transit center to marion transit center at 2 00pm  make sure real time info is shown in the trip times  i e   some times crossed out   and then hit the home button to background the app and wait around 10 15 seconds   key seems to be finding trip with real time info  then hitting home to background app   seems that once you reproduce this once  as well  it keeps crashing   at least that's the behavior on the device i've seen

yes correct the timestamp that is being sent by the device contains the correct timestamp  graylog extracts the timestamp then adds 7 hours to it  the timestamps being sent by my device are set to utc  i live in pdt which is utc  7 so i do not get alerts until 7 hours after the fact  and they do not show up in my dashboard  i can find the message if i set the time to include messages that are at least 7 hours in the future though   the only thing that makes sense to me is that graylog is assuming that the messages are set to pdc timezone  i don't understand why though because the original messages do not contain anything that says pdc or utc 7 or anything that could be misconstrued as pdc or ptc  what confuses me is that if graylog assumes utc if it cannot determine the timezone then why is it extracting as pdc when there is nothing in the original message that can be interpreted as pdc or ptc   my original message shows a very typical example of what comes into graylog and the screenshot has what is extracted  it definitely adds 7 hours to extracted timestamp   here is the exported extractor
no  nothing on the ide logs 
that bug seems to be how they were doing it  the user with no stacking privileges acquired a single item after shift clicking a stack of items that were not normally able to stack  and that single item was an infinite item 
thank you for your answer   wow  that was one of the strangest bug squashings i ever saw  this is going to be frustrating for you too    because the log was full of all the errors i got when installing and setting up the drivers for oracle  i decided to empty the log first and then trigger the error again  that was a bad idea  since i emptied the log  the error does not happen anymore  i checked in the dbeaver folders but obviously dbeaver erases the errors immediately from the disc  which makes sense  sorry  there was maybe a bug  but i can't help you find out where it is  the only thing i can tell you is that i was having a lot of errors because of drivers issues  at first  i thought this bug was part of the drivers issues  but i finally managed to get the right drivers and this error stayed so i thought this was finally a real distinct bug  maybe it wasn't  maybe it was only dbeaver needing one more exit and restart before fixing everything 
yes  all nodes can not display  i  don't know why

i use a lg g3 with 5 1  but also have this on a galaxy nexus with 4 4 x  smile 
sure  i started with a note with this content     i think this may also have to do with timing  i waited a couple seconds  switched to preview  and immediately saw the preview with that new content  but when i closed and reopened the note it didn't include the added content   however  if i added the content and then immediately switched to preview  i had to wait a moment for the preview to update with that new content  it looks like in that case the change is saved when i close and reopen the note 
found a solution by removing 'server tomcat background processor delay'  finally found it in my yaml file  sorry for disturbing 
well  i know the module  data  printer  https   metacpan org pod data  printer   that might can be useful for this purpose  like it is shown in  this article  https   www effectiveperlprogramming com 2011 11 use dataprinter to debug data structures  
the function is our performance  making for almost each http request additional http request that sometimes  not sure is it always or not   make query to database     is unacceptable solution 
see the log here  http   bbqsauce terron com bbqsauce gz  gzip format   interestingly enough  the error has also popped up for the different variations of "fuel" as well
