the preview shows a different color each time it is active  but the home screen is completely unaffected and stays black since  ispreview  is only set once in setup  this implies that the wallpaper selector restarts the sketch each time the preview is shown further inspection with the android studio debugger shows that the number of animation threads of the app increases with each time the wallpaper is selected ## thoughts on a solution  restarting the sketch after the wallpaper is selected will not solve this  because this would reset all variables that where affected in preview mode it may make sense to replace the main animation thread with the one spawned by the wallpaper selector  but i'm not sure about the possibility of this and what nasty side effects it may have

a child springapplication can cause springapplicationadmin mbean to indicate that the application is ready when it's not   sts boot dash uses the lifecycle jmx admin bean  i e by passing vmsometimes the app passes the 'ready' check  yet aparantly the port s  are not yet set this creates a race condition for sts  see https   www pivotaltracker com story show 125728671  because sts waits until the app is 'ready' and then tries to determine the port its running on but because of the slight delay    this means sts sometimes gets 'unknown'  actually 'null'  i've addressed it on our end by adding a wait loop that polls the port after app enters ready state i'm not sure its really a bug  but it seems like one to me because   if so then i would also expect that asking the app what the port is  should already work anyhoo    if you do not think its a real bug or not worth fixing  that is fine but i thought i'd at least report it and let you decide what to do about it  if anything  further useful info  i'm not sure this affects all versions of boot but i only recently found a reliable way to reproduce and debug  and fix in other words i have only really been able to observe the problem with boot 1 4

when playing a smooth streaming presentation where the fragmented mp4 segments contain a timecode  'tfdt' box   the internal timecode computation gets confused anda v synchronization does not work properly  the 'tfdt' timecode gets added to the segment start time  while most smooth streaming media comes without 'tfdt' boxes  some media does have it  for example  media that's packaged to target both smooth streaming clients as well as mpeg dash clients  since mpeg dash requires 'tfdt' to be present  the smooth streaming spec from microsoft remains silent on 'tftd' boxes  neither requires it nor forbids it   so it seems that such a stream  supporting both dash and smooth  should be valid  and desirable  the simplest way to support this may be to have a policy that when a 'tfdt' timestamp is found  it should _override_  rather than be added to  the segment start time obtained from the manifest alternatively  'tfdt' timestamps could just be ignored in smooth streaming mode

refreshing access token may remove refresh token from authorizedclient   ### summary  when a webclient  configured with servletoauth2authorizedclientexchangefilterfunction  automatically refresh an access token using an available refresh token  the refresh token may be lost  preventing any further refresh this happen when the authorization server doesn't return the refresh token on the token endpoint responseand with a custom oauth2authorizedclientservice implementation that can persist authorizedclient durably  in a file for me   when a user authorizes the application to access its google resources   an authorizedclient with an access_token and a refresh_token is stored in oauth2authorizedclientservice later  more than 1 hour   another access to its google resources triggers a token refresh   this works but google doesn't send another refresh_token  the old one is still valid    another access to the user's google resources fails because the webclient doesn't have any refresh token anymore to refresh the old access token expected behavior is that when refreshing the access token for the first time  the old refresh_token is saved  if no new refresh_token is provided   so that it is possible to refresh the access_token more than once after   and as long as the refresh_token is still valid    ### version  spring security 5 2 0 m1

it seems that the samsung browser  "com sec android app sbrowser"  on the galaxy note 4 and probably also the galaxy note 3 does not return to the app after the user has clicked the "allow" button in the google login web page instead it just loads "www google com"  which is the fallback if the app cannot be started as far as i know so the app does not get any login information and cannot proceed with the authentication a workaround is to ignore that browser so that google chrome is used instead e g  this code has fixed the issue for me however it would be good if it would work "out of the box"  i e  if the appauth library could handle  blacklist  but it seems that it doesn't blacklist any browsers by itself

as you can see  bazel now thinks  a  is out of date despite us doing nothing but restarting the server i believe the problem is  compactpersistentactioncache specifically  bazel has a heuristic that if the action cache journal is much smaller than the action cache  it keeps the journal instead of applying it to  and rewriting this is fine in principle  but in reality   persistentmap  simply forgets about the journal once it closes it this means that if the journal keeping heuristic is applied twice in a row  the first cache journal will simply be overwritten by the new one  losing data when we build  a   the large action cache causes bazel to write only to the cache journal when we build  b   the same heuristic applies and bazel writes to the action cache journalwhen we restart the server  the action cache and journal from step  3  is read all references to the work done in step 2 are lost because its journal was never applied

parallel test runner hangs when running errored scenario some of our tests do not compile correctly  an errored scenario  but are tagged as ignored which should not affect the test run the test runner now hangs indefinitely i think the behavior shouldn't be to hang but should be to output the errored message that is causing it to hang

when riot client isn't connected but is running  user isn't notified   due to another bugi need to investigate  my riot client is running on my android phone  but fail to establish a connection when i'm on my home wifi that's especially visible with the perpetual loading bar at the top of the interface  or by failing messages on the login view if i disconnect myself of the application the problem is that when that happen  nothing tells to the user he's actually disconnected  no notification  and the bar in the notification tray is still displaying "listening for events"  which lead to the wong belief that application is still running perfectly normally by the way  when speaking about that bar in the notification tray  i would suggest to change the wording while "listening for events" can be understand by someone with network and programming notions  this is probably very hard to understand what does that mean for "normal users"

players' time deleted during startupunfortunately  we had issues that caused us to lose the playtime of many players more recently though  one of our admins created a script that scanned all our old autorank backup files to recover people's total time over all of the past 4 years however  when autorank starts up  it erases basically all of the data it erases thousands of entries each time  leaving only 20 or so out of nearly 18 000 we would love to give all our players their total time stat back and have the plugin store this data so that when older players return  they still have their total time as well we already did the hard work gathering the time data  we just need the plugin to stop erasing it all

the api contract for  vertx canceltimer    appears to indicate that if it returns true  the timer has been successfully canceled however  the timer handler is not properly synchronized with the timer flag  so the handler can see the  cancelled  flag is false and start the handler execution before the cas in the  cancel    method runs currently  we have to do our own synchronization around timers to ensure that when a timer fires indicating a timeout  we are guaranteed the handler does not also execute it would be better if  internaltimerhandler handle    also did a  cancelled compareandset false  true   and only executed the handler when the cas is successful  ensuring that canceled timers are guaranteed not to execute their handlers

the problem occurs when an xslt stylesheet that has been stored in exist db imports an xml document via the  doc    function  and tries to process its nodes this simple stylesheet   style xsl   illustrates the problem this is clearly a bug  and seems to suggest that nodes are processed in wrong order when they have been imported in an xslt stylesheet with the doc   function i have tried to find workarounds for this annoying bug  and discovered that the problem does not happen when    the same   test  xml structure is constructed as an xslt variable and next processed  see style2 xsl    the same   test  variable is imported with the doc   function  but first copied indirectly via an identity transform with  lt xsl apply templates   before further processing   style3 xsl    for convenient testing  i have attached a backup of the test collection containing these documents  including a test xquery  test xq  which executes all 3 versions of the xslt stylesheet and reports errors where they occur while the problem is related to xslt processing with saxon  i think this is an exist issue  the problem only occurs when the xslt stylesheet is executed with transform transform   from within the database when the collection is stored and run from the file system  all goes well also  when run with pure saxon  without exist   no errors occur with the transformation

assertlinesmatch#matches has a bug that will cause a nullpointerexception to be thrown after evaluating a fastforward match if there are more expected lines after the fastforward match then remain in the actual results this only manifests itself if the expected list size is equal to or larger than the actual list size the reason this fails is because after matching the fast forward region  the actual list is now empty but assertlinesmatch doesn't check for that condition and sends the  null  value from the actualdeque peek call to assertlinematch#matches a pull request with this issue number as the branch name will be submitted that contains the change to assertlinematch#matches and a test method added to assertlinematchassertionstest to illustrate the bug is fixed

freefilesync fails to delete files in dokany mounted vault   ### description  freefilesync can't delete files  but it works from explorer cli and yet the problem started appearing with a new cryptomator version  1 4 15  can reproduce the problem though the problem reproduces even with dropbox turned off ffs attempts to remove the lock file  but this does not happen there is also no error message  perhaps because freefilesync just ignores this error if  you now click "synchronize"  i suggest you don't and instead skip step 4 here   then ffs will attempt to lock the directory again but it appears to be locked still  the lock file still exists from the comparing  so ffs will lock on a different file   del sync ffs_lock   to atomatically delete the original lock file after a timeout of about a second  it realizes that the original isn't going to be deleted  so it attempts to remove  del sync ffs_lock  with a recursive call to the same function but removing that isn't possible either  so it creates  del del sync ffs_lock  and so on soon the file names become long enough to make deletion fail  another cryptomator dokany bug   so you'll never get rid of those files again this arguably isn't the smartest behavior of ffs  but it only fails badly because of two combined cryptomator bugs  deletion fails from ffs  and even manual deletion fails for long file names  i digress  the main point is that the  sync ffs_lock  file wasn't deletedif you want to continue using ffs "normally"  you need to help it by deleting the lock file manually from right to left  i e  to delete it in the vault when the sync is done  ffs will neither have deleted its lock file  like above  nor the file you created in step  1   this time  you will additionally see it fail to move the temp database file to main database file because it failed to delete the latter previously whatever kinds of files ffs tries to deletethe deletion just silently failsthe files are deleted just like they were with cryptomator  1 4 11  no matter if dropbox is running or not  no matter the freefilesync version  on both my laptop and my desktop machine besides the widespread error swallowing  this looks like quite a normal way to delete a file and yet  rm  or  unlink  executed under mingw cannot reproduce the problem  and also  del  from the windows command line or windows explorer succeed in deleting files if their names are reasonably short

issue with socketchanneludt blocking non blocking sync with backing socketudti think i have found an issue with synchronization of the blocking state between the socketchanneludt and the underlying socketudt state by default a selectablechannel is configured to be in the blocking state from the docs it states  'newly created selectable channels are always in blocking mode non blocking mode is most useful in conjunction with selector based multiplexing a channel must be placed into non blocking mode before being registered with a selector  and may not be returned to blocking mode until it has been deregistered 'so when the socketchanneludt is constructed  it makes a call to isblocking and stores a volatile copy of the result this also means you cannot change the blocking mode to true without first switching to false since the abstractselectablechannel's default behavior is not to even call implconfigureblocking if it thinks the channel state is the same as what is being requested if so  i think it should be a simple matter of switching the socketudt inside the socketchanneludt to blocking initially so that they are in sync  then configureblocking on the channel to true will work as normal

atlasdb clients cannot communicate via load balancersthis would be useful when setting up atlasdb product in a cloud environment with custom certificates  as it makes the management of those certificates easier here is one example of where this breaks   1 when another node wants a timestamp  it continues to ask the load balancer for the old leader  since this is cached in our remote proxy 3 the node asking for the timestamp doesn't consider this a retriable exception  and propogates the error up to the user  instead of trying another onewe can resolve the above case by making 503 a retriable exception  but we also need to take care to ensure that we don't introduce performance issues

while trying to use  s3browser  https   s3browser com   with the mock as a server i encountered a problem with uploading files  which translates to calling the  filestorecontroller#putobject  endpoint  the code does not distinguish between the 2 calls and thus overwrites the original file data with the acl xml content a quick analysis of the requests shows that there are some differences between the requests in the headers   which do not seem definitive enough to provide a distinction  however  there is one significant difference that seems to be most indicative that the call with the acl contains an  acl  parameter  i e    put  some path to bucket acl   for the time being i "patched" my code locally by checking if there is an  acl  parameter  and if so ignore the payload and return the  s3object  that was generated when the file data was uploaded i do believe though that it should be handled somehow  perhaps the acl is required somewhere else  i just did not encounter such a need  as a side note   i looked for some documentation on this rest call but could not find any i did not look very deep though due to lack of time    
for this i'm using ffmpegframerecorder recordsamples   function and it is working fine when i'm connecting through a normal rtmp connection but when i'm using rtmps  it also works fine for the initial 2 3 seconds  and i can playback this little part on the server  but after that the native part just crashes with a not very verbose message   e audit  type 1701when debugging i found that this happens a few seconds after initiating the connection precisely when returning from the recordsamples   function  initially i thought that the last line was crashingbut i modified itand it still crashed when it returned from this function  since the crash message is not very verbose and the said function is over a 100 lines with quite a few native calls  i don't really know how to debug this issue

shall we say less than explicit about what is to blame for the exception that was thrown which has had me running around for the last two days pulling mods until it finally stopped happening  which lead me to matter overdrive this particular crash occurred with a frequency between ten and thirty minutes after a player would log in  subsequent attempts to log in would either yield the error again or repeat the pattern  a short time of gameplay and then the crash again   more frustrating still  it's a client side crash  taking them out to the launcher but leaving the server running  and it does not seem to effect all players equally some players wouldn't crash more than once or twice  others nearly constantly  after removing the matter overdrive mod the crashes stopped  and things ran smoothly for a test period of two hours  after which the mod was added back in and allowed to gen a new config file  just in case of a corrupted one  now  this is obviously not conclusive proof  but it is i feel suggestive  and unfortunately the biggest  and in fact only  lead we have  so i thought i'd post it here  and let you see if it rings any bells  i'm going to go turn  i'll let you know if that fixes anything

from the documentation    softwareserial would break with relatively low complexity i2c communication using arduino's wire library  it proved impossible to use with the ad5933 library for similar reasons altsoftserial works very well in this regard  but as we begin to write multiple sampling rates and frequency sweeps that request timer interrupts and reset commands to the ad5933  more frequently  the time window for interrupts to be handled shrink considerably however that has to measure and send impedance values  breaks at sampling rates over 80 hz and completely garbles serial communication with altsoftserial library  you only need to look at arduino's serial monitor to see the gibberish it spouts and functions

_is_ possible that i created a strange case because the class does not have the property explicitly defined when importing via oetl    i e  schemaless at that point  something i never usually do but a result of testing etl import so  it appears that the problem is that something is getting out of sync for when the engine decides to use the index and when it doesn't but it seems like a bug to me regardless 
the solution that closed the above bug was to special case 行く  いい  etc that's not a good solution  because it failed to catch extensions like もっていく and かっこいい

 describe the bug  running a simple consumer on windows using the  pulsarclient   i notice that there is considerable cpu usage when the consumer is just idling     a simple test with similar values show that a running hashedwheeltimer can consume cpu equal to 100  of one hyperthread my understanding of the  hashedwheeltimer  is that it is indented to be used for a large number of approximated timeouts and not for millisecond precision scheduling  but i may be mistaken for example  when running 8 consumers on a i7 8700  4 cores 2 threads per core   taskmanager reported 100  cpu usage   when there was no traffic  no messages on the topics an alternative is to use a plain old  scheduledexecutorservice  for batch dispatching reception  tests suggest it will also be lighter on the cpu when millisecond precision is required and the number of task is not too high when scheduling 10k tasks every millisecond  the thread was working 100   but scheduling 10k tasksso if a client is used to create a huge number of producers consumers  it might be better to lax the batch timeoutnote that when using  scheduledexecutorservice  each task might not get exactly the same number of executions  for example when scheduling 1000 tasks run execute every millisecond for 30 seconds

in my opinion  this "feature" should be removed entirely from newpipe  following the data protection principle of "datensparsamkeit"  a k a  "data economy"  i e   reduce the amount of data collected to the absolute minimum  if there are good reasons to continue to collect this information  however  the implementation needs to be improved to ensure users' privacy  otherwise  one of our usps  "privacy"  doesn't apply    implement multiple providers  i'd say at least 5  and choose a random one every time  round robin like      ask user whether they want to share this information  maybe with a checkbox they can uncheck  and request service only when the user confirms they want to send a mail i e   don't auto fetch it when the activity is shown by the way  according to https   major io icanhazip com faq   the software is open source  but the requests are all logged and there is no word about deletion of logs

i previously included this as a comment on a related issue which is now closedfrom  https   github com twilio video quickstart android issues 287 if you start streaming the screen in one orientation then change  the stream dimensions remain the size of the original and you end up with a tiny display on the receiving device so i believe the issue is on the sending side  on android i was wondering if the issue is because i'm running the screencapturer from a foreground service and perhaps rotation events aren't being recognised 
please answer these questions before submitting your issue   why do you submit this issue   but hystrix plugin will make them unable to work because the result of  hystrixplugins#getconcurrencystrategy  is cached in the hystrixconcurrencystrategyinterceptor  although after that other hystrixconcurrencystrategy will reset and register itself we have several ways to fix this problem   1 if we don't trust the delegate pattern and must make the swhystrixconcurrencystrategy exists in the delegate chain  it will be difficult  not only to intercept get reset register  but also there is no good way to confirm if a class is already on a delegate chain

high cpu bug correlation with failed cloud messaging eventyou mentioned this bug to me on irc a month or so ago before i switched back from unifiednlp to gmscore  sowhen it first happened i just figured i'd disable the checkin feature as i needed battery life to be reliable at the time i recently re enabled it along with cloud messaging after seeing a commit that stated checkin had been fixed  but i hadn't been able to tell if it was working or not as i only have one app that utilizes itso i unfortunately wasn't able to collect a logcat  but i can say that i had no occurrences of the high cpu bug for a day or so until a few minutes ago when i received the first email notification i've gotten from slack since re enabling checkin cloud messaging  via imap idle  so i get it right away   which failed to notify me through the app via cloud messaging at this point my cpu immediately spiked  and it remained high until i rebooted  after checking top to see that the culprit was indeed gmscore i'll try enabling checkin and cloud messaging again when i have a reliable power source nearby next week  but i hope this helps narrow the potential causes of the bug down for now

if you're maintaining a linked files directory  and you run "rename attachments"  then immediately run "rename attachments" again  zotfile will add a "2"  or a "3"  etc  to the end of the filename  because it detects a collision between the file's _current_ name and its "new" name it'd be great if zotfile saw that this wasn't really a rename and left things alone without adding extra 2s and 3s to all your filenames  you might  for example  want to do a "select all"    "rename attachments" if you changed the zotfile naming pattern if that resulted in _any_ file collisions  though  then you'd get unnecessary numbers on some of your filenames

ignore encryption data in mdathowever  in the intervening period  we have found at least one player that is unable to read the encryption data from  mdat  and requires  senc  to be present the idea being that if the player does not understand  senc  it will just read the data out of the  mdat  as instructed by  saio  and if it does require  sencfrom the log  i see that it tries to read the start of the  mdat  as samples  presumably because it encountered  senc  and thus does not know that there is going to be more encryption data in  mdat  at least this is my current theory   have not actually attached a debugger but from reading the log  it seems straightforward enough i would thus request a change to exoplayer to make it ignore this encryption data inside  mdat  even if it is already parsed from  senc   detected by checking whether  saio  points into  mdat

antlrworks does not recompile parser or lexer for debugging   an issue that i think is present also in versions before 1 5 is   usually if you made any changes to the grammar or if the lexer parser classes or __test___input file are missing  antlrworks would regenerate and recompile them when asked to debug   e g  if you delete classes  it still will assume they are there and run into timeout when trying to debug also the test input seems to be stored by antlrworks internally because it suggests the previous test input even if you delete the __test___input file once you run into this behaviour you have to shut down antlrworks and restart it

i had two parts of speech listed on this file  and decided to delete one of them in order to replace it with several new  better ones when i deleted it  which should've left only pronouns in the list  i was given the error pictured below   the data remained as it should've for pronouns  but the name was erased  and  as expected  became red to demand i fill in the field it continues to happen even when several parts of speech are added and then removed  as well as after restarting the programme once i delete all but one  the error appears   another issue  although less significant  is that when i first open the part of speech submenu upon loading up the programme that is to say  my monitor's resolution is 1366x768  and the window will fit that 1366 width  even though it is not aligned with the edges of the screen the height remains as it should when i switch to any other submenu and then switch back to parts of speech  the automatic resizing happens as expected  rather than stretching out to ridiculous lengths

currently we have an unplayable amount of lag   everything stutters  blocks broken reappear instantly and take a moment to realize they've been broken  and the server sends out a ton of "can't keep up" messages i don't know if the lag is due to uncontrolled spawning  or if the dino code itself needs a bit more optimizing

segment merges should try to avoid exhausting all free disk space   when a lucene segment merge runs  it needs sizable free temporary disk space to do its work if it runs out of disk spacepart way through  the os rejects the  write  call  and we'll hit a "tragic" exception that will fail that shard this behavior is particularly evil because on filling up the disk  the merge will then go and remove all temp files  thus freeing up  sizable  disk space and provoking issues like #15420 where "at first it failed and now it succeeded" leads to corruption i think we need some simple "reservation" api where the merge can claim how much space it expects to use  and fail at that point if there isn't enough space this wrapper should then throw the "disk full"lucene's default  tieredmergepolicy  already estimates the size of the merged segment to enforce its  maxmergedsegmentmb

indexoutofboundsexception after update from 6 2 to 6 4   hi   i asked the following question at your discussion forum and it turned out that this might be an issue  so i was advised to open an issue here recently i updated the elasticsearch version from 6 2 to 6 4 and when this query is executed using the official php package  i am getting an error message in my log file which it looks like this    full_stack_trace txt  https   github com elastic elasticsearch files 2487606 full_stack_trace txt i have 4 queries in my multi search query  from which only 2 of them are failingthe error is logged every time when the "option group"   "option" top hits aggregation need to be done it is important to mention that this is not the case when i try to execute this query via kibana when executed through kibana i receive correct results if i remove them  i receive correct results i had 1 node and 2 shards on my local machine when the problem actually appeared when i increased the number of shards to 3 or 5  the problem disappeared i have a workaround for this problem with increasing the number of shards but it's strange to allocate 5 shards because of two indexes with 28 and 112 documents stored in them in order to make those aggregations working

sql  failure while resolving a set of indices that have fields that are not found in other indices
we are seeing an issue where the number of documents successfully created indexed in es is different   more  very odd  or less  from the number of documents which we are giving es to index the difference in documents only seems to occur if there is a large number of documents being inserted  specifically we tested with 929 660  and too few shards  specifically 1  the fact that this only happens when large numbers of documents are created indexed and that it seems to alleviate when more shards are added to balance the load points it to a load issue i believe this to be an issue with es core  but i was interested in seeing if anyone else here had seen this due to es hadoop being able to create a load issue more easily than the normal api i can provide more details as needed  but as there is nothing in the logs  there are not many other observables that i can detail it is very similar to  http   elasticsearch users 115913 n3 nabble com missing documents after bulk indexing td4056100 html  however i  am not seeing any exceptions please let me know if anyone has seen this issue or has any resolution

request canceling if non ioexception occurred in interceptor   based on this  issue  https   github com gildor kotlin coroutines retrofit issues 34  if we're throwing exceptions inside interceptor  they should inherit ioexception to be properly handled without crashing the app but there's some situations in which you don't want to inherit ioexception one of this cases  we are handling errors of api api returns some templated entities with status code which can be checked to detect some errors like invalid parameters that was passed and one of error handling solutions is to create interceptor that checks all of requests' responses and throwing domain exceptions if status code indicates error builder that will allow us to disable canceling requests if some non ioexception was thrown inside interceptor

i understand the comments made on  this issue  https   github com tlaukkan vaadin lazyquerycontainer issues 12   but the lazyqueryview has so much good debugging and caching functionality  that it seems a waste to have to either copy and paste the code to make your own changes  or to have to loose all those features the simplest solution seems to be to remove the final modifier  but in light of the aforementioned issue's comment  at the least it seems there could be an abstractqueryview that lazyqueryview can extend  and thus make the caching and debugging functionality available to anyone who wants to implement their own queryview

spring boot dedicated management context causes tooglz warning during startup   with togglz 2 5 0 final and spring boot  if we setup the actuator endpoints in a dedicated context  by using the property  management server port  to specify a separate port   spring will emit two  contextrefreshedevent  events  one for the main context and another for the management context this results in the following warning by tooglz in the log    2018 06 29 13 52 41 414  warn 29069                 main however  i cannot be certain that the order of these events is always the observed one  and i don't think spring boot makes no such guarantees  which means that even if the order is correct now  it may not be in some future version i think that togglz should not rely on the order of these events  and i propose that  contextrefreshedevent  events originating from the management context should instead be ignored if you agree with this idea  i can work on a pr to implement it

due to the  introduction  https   github com libgdx libgdx commit da8fb9e108abdf593f02258f0b3f52093124c937  of  checkstatics  https   github com libgdx libgdx blob 1 3 1 gdx src com badlogic gdx utils timer java#l262   if any timer is created within libgdx  it runs the risk of wiping out user created timers specifically  if one is created after a pause event  and before a resume event  the timer constructor will call checkstatics and will clear existing timer instances since gesturedetector creates a new timer instance every time the touchdown event occurs  it could do this if it happens to run before resume the following code demonstrates the issue by manually calling touchdown on the pause event simply run it  then switch to another window to pause it  then switch back and the timer will not resume   that occurred on mobile where the game's create event is called when the game is resumed  preventing old timers from running again perhaps a better solution would be to call checkstatics when this event occurs  rather than every time a timer is initialized

newpipe doesn't properly shut down audio streams when playback is finished interrupted      x  x  i checked if the issue feature exists in the latest version       i did use the  incredible bugreport to markdown converter  https   teamnewpipe github io crashreporttomarkdown   to paste bug reports newpipe ends up leaving open the streams when it's done using them on low ram devices  this can cause problems if the user starts playing multiple videos   if nothing is currently playing  and the user starts a new video  newpipe will open a new stream this includes having a video audio stream currently open  but stopped paused if there's currently something playing and another of the same type is enqueued  newpipe will use the existing stream when the new one starts if there's currently something playing and the user replaces it with another of the same type  a new stream is started   if audio is playing and the user starts up a video  newpipe starts a new stream same goes for if video is playing and the user starts an audio stream   at no point does newpipe actually close a given stream   this includes when the user manually closes a stream  regardless of whether the stream is still playing or not the equalizer app can't actually close the streams itself  as they are owned by newpipe and the system's equalizer abilities only allow for a passthrough adjustment for apps like this  not a complete change of ownership using the "x" button in the active streams window only tells the equalizer to stop filtering this will kill all streams  including currently playing ones  so if newpipe is currently playing something and the terminal command is used  the audio will cut out and newpipe will never be the wiser however  it will be silent until newpipe starts a new stream via one of the methods outlined above the recommended solution is to have newpipe close out each stream when it's done playing  as well ashave it recycle streams when shutting down currently playing items in favor of new ones

looks like the image file gets locked and git cannot manage it properly in another scenario merging from a branch that contains another version of the same   gif  file causes merge conflicts   in rendered view would be better than having a locked file   not a critical issue and it happens to deal with big   gif  too often  but figuring the issue out took a plenty of time there is a workaround  just close an   md  file that refers to a   gif  before any git operation  but should one neglect the rule extra efforts will be required to put things back in order

compiler does not create needed  srcif you have two modules where one depends on the other and you compile them separatelythe compiler will complain on the second module that it can't find the  src archive for the first module you can work around this by compiling the first module with the java backend compiler  but that shouldn't be necessary of course  the js compiler should be able to make its own  src archives  which should be 100  the same as the ones generated by the jvm compiler of course

this map uses reference equality in place of the object equality that was used in prior versions  when the class used  hashmap  for context  we have some tests internally that are failing in 1 8 as they were written with object equality in mind for example  the following fails in 1 8 but passes in prior versions  which upon immediate inspection wasn't intuitive  as  inetsocketaddress#equals  returns  true  when comparing the two different objects     i'm interested in the motivation for the change in semantics  talking with  lukaszx0 in person  he recalls some talk about this previously  or  perhaps this wasn't the original intention and it would be possible to revert to using a  hashmap   although the benchmarks seem to indicate this would be slightly slower than the current impl

this game would freeze whenever selecting something like "continue" or "new game" i figured out how to run the game on the other emulator a while back and was halfway through the game when i ran into a issue with the other emulator that stalled my game progress in comparison  ppsspp runs the game with less graphical glitches in general  but it does have a specific problem that makes the game stall at a certain part of the game map  when a conversation is triggered i've made my reports in ppsspp's issues forum as well  but here i'm just going to focus on the issues present in jpcsp if anyone is interested in the other thread  for reference they can check it out here when using opengl and the shaders setting is enabled in the video options of jpcsp  the game would sometimes freeze after choosing any option like "new game" or "continue" in the main game menu i say "sometimes" because 1 out of 10 times  it actually works and the game will not freeze when you choose to "continue" to load a save however  more likely than not  the game will freeze instead when shaders are enabled as far as i can tell  clearing the texture and vertex cache and restarting jpcsp will sometimes fix the issue but i cannot consistently start the game when the shaders are enabled as a comparison  i've tested things with the external software renderer and the game appears to reasonably consistently start without freezing i've also tested with the shaders enabled but with the "color mask" video option disabled the results remain fairly similar it's always the same green glitch  with additional abnormal flashing during the animations when the external software renderer is enabled    i've done my best to try to capture all of the log during the process  but jpcsp lags horribly whenever the logger is turn on and the game cannot proceed  so i've had to resort to turning the logger on and off during the process   trigger something in the game first  turn the logger on  let it record for a while  turn it back off  let the game move on until i reach the next cruicial step  turn the logger back on again i hope this has captured useful information  but i can't guarantee it these screenshots show which settings i used when capturing the logs  with the main difference between the two logs being whether or not the shader setting was enabled

the same happens if you go to page 2 of the filtered thread  and so on   because the rest of the thread's post entries are still in the database  when the thread view comes to display a filtered page  it requests the posts in that page's range   if those posts weren't all overwritten with the filtered ones  the rest will be the original posts for that page  probably by other people  you can test all this by taking a large thread  preferably with an unread count visible   filtering on a user's posts  and then looking back at the thread list   the page and unread counts will have changed  and the last page will probably have other people's posts at the end you have to view the 'full' thread again to fix it   and if you don't do the 'hit the back button' thing  the unread count will be messed up i'm trying to change the way the read unread counts are calculated  but the rest is too strongly tied into the database structure

buysubscription does not resolve when changing subscriptions in ios   ### version of react native iap 2 2 2 ### platforms you faced the error  ios or android or both  ios ### expected behavior buysubscription should resolve when changing from monthly to yearly subscription  rather than reject and return an error  forcing the catch clause ### actual behavior if currently subscribed to one plan  changing to another causes buysubscription to catch and return the following error    real device  iphone 6 ### steps to reproduce the behavior this occurs when the modify subscription dialog boxes pop up in app  asking if you'd like to change from your present subscription to the newly selected one upon tapping through this dialog the error is thrown instead of the expected resolved promise this is breaking for me right now because there's then no way to confirm that they actually purchased or validate receipts for these cases please let me know if you know of a workaround or fix  or if there's anything i can do to help  though i have no obj c experience  the only possible workaround i can think of for now is if buysubscriptions returns an error  checking this error and if it matches this error then confirming the purchase but this is very dangerous as it renders receipt validation impossible and some other error  like inability to connect to server or something  could produce the same error code  giving the user the subscription without actually having to pay for it    this may be an obvious consequence of what i've already described  but after attempting to modify your subscription  this purchase is not added to your purchase history but i'm not yet sure how to reproduce  will report back if i find a way when it works the first dialog box requests my password then proceeds normally as if i don't already have another subscription  as opposed to when the first dialog box is "confirm purchase" and it asks if i want to modify my subscription  which is what appears when it's not working when it works  the purchased subscription gets added to my purchase history as expected they use a different method and the differences could help explain why this is happening  though i haven't used that library and so can't confirm it wouldn't happen there

postgres copy from stdin fails on data containing string delimitersimmediately following this statement  flyway appears to skip reading  8500 lines and continue processing the file surprisingly  since the sections where flyway stops and restarts reading the file end on valid statements  no errors get thrown the issue was initially caught by developers when they found expected data was missing from a handful of tables since no errors were thrown from flyway  it has been difficult to ascertain what the precise issue is suspect it has something to do with flyway parsing statements and getting hung up on some of the additional markup language which may contain reserved sql words and symbolsreading and executing all statements in file just as if it was imported via postgres command line

there are no problem with the videos themselves  as trying a playback again will not produce any error the only thing i can think of  and i’m only guessing  is that maybe there is some type of os lock when the system is in the process of releasing the mediacodec used for encoding  making exoplayer to fail although  besides the fact that i don’t know how long does the os take to release the codec resources  i don’t see why exoplayer would need a video codec which was used only for encoding  and not decoding

bootstrap has  dropdown menu left   dropdown menu right to overcome this issue  
true"   symptom   if you have a binary field 'blob' with "store" "false"  then you must qualify the field name as "_source blob" in order to retrieve it when starting 'from scratch'  i e  indexing data for the first time   internally es has binaryfieldmapper element for "blob"  where "store" is "no"  which is correct however   when shutting down and re starting es  the binaryfieldmapper entry that gets created has "store" set to "yes" and  since there is no "blob" field other than in _source  it fails to retrieve the "blob" value   the but appears to be that the "store" "false" is not being preserved properly when you just shut down es and then start it up again 
if i'm not mistaken  right now the overlay alpha is interpreted as a binary all or nothing  where any overlay pixel with alpha   0 is discarded and anything with alpha   0for most vanilla style ores this is perfectly fine  but there are a few mod or texture pack ore textures for which an overlay texture could imo greatly benefit from alpha blending for visually smoother integration onto the original texture

hashmap hashcode throws npe after deserializationmethod throws npe  the field  hash  is null  the reason i'm opening this issue is to keep track of this issue on the latest release  and to be able to prioritize the upcoming release accordingly while investigating  i realised that the reason behind this problem is that the lazy   hash   https   github com javaslang javaslang blob v2 0 x javaslang src main java javaslang collection hashmap java#l35  field is marked as  transient  while it makes complete sense to throw away evaluated hash value while serialization  as the contents' hash values might change   still  there should be some additional serialization logic  e g   readobject  and  writeobject  methods  that should reassign the lazy  hash  field into its unevaluated state lazy   https   github com javaslang javaslang blob v2 0 x javaslang src main java javaslang lazy java  could clear its calculated value upon serialization while serializing its _supplier_ pr fixes this issue by removing the lazy  hash  field altogether it might worth mentioning that we stumbled upon this problem after we started using javaslang's persistent collections with  apache spark  http   spark apache org    a distributed computing system that heavily relies on serialization of data

however  in about 20  of the cases  the bootsfaces components do not render i can solve this problem in one of the following ways   undeploy and redeploy the application   undeploy  shut down payara  remove the osgi cache  restart payara  redeploy     undeploy  shut down payara  remove the osgi cache  reboot the machine in 100  of the cases  one of these steps will fix the problem if the same ear can be made to work by restarting the container  etc   it does not seem all that likely that the problem is in the way the ear is built there do not seem to be any exceptions thrown in these methods i also tried breakpoints in various other renderers  such as b panel  etc   but none are ever called it seems that faces is skipping rendering the bootsfaces components entirely in the render response phase but in  roughly  20  of the cases  something seems to go wrong in deployment  and from that point on  faces does not seem to call any of the bootsfaces renderers during render response phase i'm more than willing to continue to debug the situation if you can offer any suggestions as to where to look i've noticed a few other posts alluding to the same problem  so i don't think this is an isolated instance  though it might not be very common  we think bootsfaces is terrific and would like to continue using it  but this issue makes each deployment a bit of a guessing game there are no other complicated libraries included  e g   my project does not use shiro  etc   i could probably create a simple demo application if needed  but then in   80  of the cases it will work perfectly  so i'm not sure how helpful that would be

 bug  operator rolling update is triggered when resource is not modified describe the bugit seems that if the operator thinks that the kafka resource has been changed it triggers a rolling update of the resource this enables you to plan when to apply changes to a kafka resource to minimize the impact on kafka client applications " the problem i am having is that even if the resource does not change  the rolling update is triggered if i am using kustomize and have my "kind  kafka" in the same kustomize "build" as another resource if the other resource is updated  then the strimizi operator thinks it needs to perform a rolling update of kafka  even if kafka is not modified rolling update only happens if i specifically edit kafka    or at least give me the ability to turn off the rolling update functionality

dear felixjones i find an issue   the specified android sdk build tools version  27 0 3  is ignored  as it is below the minimum supported version  28 0 3  for android gradle plugin 3 3 0 to suppress this warning  remove "buildtoolsversion '27 0 3'" from your build gradle file  as each version of the android gradle plugin now has a default version of the build tools according to  the java library plugin   gradle user guide version 3 5  https   docs gradle org current userguide java_library_plugin html   the compile configuration still exists but should not be used as it will not offer the guarantees that the api and implementation configurations provide

for example  the video has a duration of 100 seconds but the last subtitle should only display starting from position 70 seconds and ending at position 80 seconds i noticed a problem in that i was never getting the oncues   callback to clear the last subtitle at position 80 seconds  so the last subtitle ended up being incorrectly displayed all the way until the end of the video however  before the tracksampletable is created  there is code to edit and or trim down the samples based on an edit list         thus  endindex ends up being the index of the last sample which is supposed to clear the last subtitlehowever  this causes editedsamplecount to be one less than samplecount and thus the last sample gets dropped by the time the tracksampletable is created also the same change probably needs to be applied a few lines down when endindex is calculated again i don't know how this change would impact video or audio tracks  but for me  this change prevented the last sample in the tx3g track from being dropped from the tracksampletable   callback at position 80 seconds to clear the last subtitle

 start stop in onresume onpause   fragmenttabhost in that activity with 5 fragments using spicemanager to fetch data   every of the 5 fragments has a call to spicemanager dontnotifyanyrequestlisteners   in onpause   so they won't receive any callback when they cannot update their ui   fragments implement requestlistener and onrequestsuccessmy retry policy is set to 0 retries   if request fails  just don't retry anymoreso when i am on fragment#1  switch to fragment#2 and then go back to fragment#1this results in a fact that when i pass in 'this'  which is the fragment itself  as a callback into spicemanager asynchronous execute request method then swapping between tabs won't invalidate those callback listeners what i do to crash it is that i switch the device to offline mode and try to jump between tabs and watch for the results if i switch between the tabs with some reasonable speed  then everything works fine problems start when i speed up i get a callback to onrequestfailure which tries to update ui that is not yet created resulting in a crashi think the problem might be with the fact that dontnotifyanyrequestlisteners is asynchronous as described in the docs source code and that is why responses are able to get received nevertheless same thing would be for onrequestsuccess as it also did happen when being online  offline is just easier to reproduce the issue as responses come back quickly  however is the fact that response reaches the fragment even though fragment is in a wrong state and its lifecycle is not considered in terms of response delivery

   remote_cache   optional  for a separate cas and action cache service  if not hosted at    remote_executor   currently  if both    remote_executor  and    remote_cache  are set  it seems like bazel is only querying  servercapabilities  at the    remote_executor  end point and determines compatibility using both  executioncapabilities  and  cachecapabilities  from that message this is a bit surprising  and  even if the reapi specification does not mention anything regarding this  expected logic in that situation  i believe  would have been to query capabilities from the two end point services and use  executioncapabilities  from    remote_executor  and  cachecapabilities  from    remote_cache  i'll fill a bug against the reapi for better documentation about the expected behaviour once that behaviour is determined and agreed

sometimes when i log back into our server at least one of my id networks have stopped working the indication is at least one of the writers showing the status "network corrupted"  although in one or two cases i've seen that status although it still seems to work so far i've been able to fix it by either pulling out the data card in the writer and re inserting it  rarely  or breaking a couple of cables around the writer and replacing them  usually  my suspicion is that it either happens when the server restarts or is related to the chunk loading issues we have on the server  our version of ftbu seems to be rather random about actually keeping the chunks loaded i set it to  one other thing i noticed  which i'm just going to mention  not sure if that is id's fault   if i "repair" a network after such an incident  my fps in that region often go to hell although the regulation shouldn't have set anything off that causes it
