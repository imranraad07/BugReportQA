i mean once you have configured the start bat sh to have jetty running on a different port   if you try any port other than 80  the proxy works  on 80 it does not  all the rest of the openhab system are working fine   e g  greent ui   atmosphere  just the images videos are missing  i assume somewhere in the code the number 80 is removed as it is the default port  but the proxy expects a number  and returns " 1"   it worked on 1 4 0 about a month ago which was my last merge

checking screen state is useful to exclude other logs that look like gameplay logs  by only logging during a game we don't get confusing messages displayed    for example  immediately before a casual or ranked match you'll get logs like this     these look the same as logs that occur during the game  so in my first version these messages were displayed as if each player had played their hero power when the game started    which wasn't true  the messages just indicate hearthstone setting up the game  i stopped those misleading messages by checking the game state  when  loadingscreen  identifies that the mode is tournament the messages are ignored  once the mode changes to gameplay the logging starts  is that going to be a problem when using rxscala 
when we run che with a limit for a workspace ram consumption set to 3gb anybody can create and run a workspace with a sidecar with 30gb of ram  we don't check how much memory sidecars consume  so this feature of che doesn't work in that case   on osio we also have limits on the os side  so it wouldn't be possible to misuse service  but in case che starts workspaces on a cluster that doesn't control ram consumption by workspace  so only che is responsible for ram limits  users can use as many ram as they want   if the explanation is not clear enough or you still think that we don't need to fix that  please  elaborate 
i haven't tested it in ios   i haven't got a reproducible repository  but it is straightforward to test  1  share a local image   url        with  share open  2  use the  save image  option in the modal window  3  don't allow access to the permission when requested  instead of raising an error  so the   catch  callback   the library behaves as if the share was successful  with the   then  callback

hi  sanketmarkan  thank you for your interest in this aspect    my recommendation is to start from the worldrenderer interface and in particular the worldrendererimpl class  that's the entry point of the rendering system    if you look into worldrendererimpl initrendergraph   you'll see a long list of nodes being added  the existing debug system plugs into the finalpostprocessingnode but i assume it will be eventually removed from there    please notice that the rendering system will undergo some further refactoring during the gsoc  consequently the new visual debug system will suffer from a moving goalpost syndrome  that been said  the node base architecture will remain and you will be able to rely on that    some logistics    are you already running from source    feel free to use this issue to discuss things further  you can also use the forum or we can set up an appointment via irc should you require it     keep in mind i'm in the gmt+1 timezone

if my opinion can be useful  i'd say that  taking a look at the aim of spring boot  a default configuration for resource filtering is a good thing to have  but it must be the proper configuration  not something that clashes with other pieces of the spring framework  hence my proposal   the parent project   spring boot starter parent    as per doc  should provide "sensible resource filtering"   so i think that it's good to enable filtering  if somebody doesn't want any filtering in order to do everything manually  he can just remove the dependency on the parent project and include the pieces he wants to   at our company we've got some parent poms which we use in a very similar fashion of   spring boot starter parent     and we like such project because we could just drop them and use spring produced ones  which are good and well maintained  in our parent poms we employed filtering just like the configuration i proposed  and i must say it is   extremely hard   for filtering to be triggered inadvertently   if you need to filter anything  you'll have to do something like    which is unlinkely to clash with anything else  and using it to match the version  the build number  like  dsyer suggested   along with the changeset  is precisely what we do  with great joy    don't fear the filtering

images at http   imgur com a hjdbm the problem occurs if the mouse goes over the red diamond  that widget does not have a text filled in so tostring tries to use a null pointer  one image is before i fill things in  2nd image is after adding materials   the machine processes one cycle and then stops   25mb of water is used and 25mb of liquid growth medium is produced and piped out     i guess that's a bug too since it has a valid recipe but isn't processing it     crash 2017 08 23_10 21 48 client txt  https   github com forestrymc binnie files 1247945 crash 2017 08 23_10 21 48 client txt   edit   figured out some more info   it wasn't just one cycle    the machine ran until water got down to 475mb and then it stopped   i want to let the water run dry and reuse the same machine to process a different recipe  and it refuses to continue until i give it more water   so imo it is indeed two bugs but i'll leave just this one report for now     
how about we close the other one as this one provides more information   i'll bring in some detail from the other one

the cache code is gc4a5z1 and user name of person in question is janko132  but this issue was found on another phone  so i can not send screenshot  on my phone it works as expected  but i remember i have seen this issue on my phone also  just don't know when  cache  user  situation  
this issue happened with rv2 stable 9 i downgraded to rv2 stable 8 and it works  edit  i just tested this with only applied energistics and it does this on its own so i am sure its on the mods side and not some conflict

i suggest we relocate the logic of "complementing" the mapped software units to validate  this allows both validate and graphics you function normally without being to spent time on creating new code  since it is already built  we just need to relocate it

the cached values were not empty  but iirc the lists were  i evaluated the functions that compute the cached values manually with a debugger and got the results mentioned in my first post   i did not modify glide's registry and neither did i register any custom components   unfortunately i wasn't able to reproduce this problem yet  since after a restart of the app it disappeared

  i originally configured the alert as follows    field content value condition trigger alert when a message arrives that has  the field "eventid" set to "4725" and then wait at least "1" minute until triggering a new alert  when sending an alert  include the last "1" messages of the stream evaluated for this alert condition     but then i changed the alert configuration to the following    trigger alert when there are "more" than "1" message in the last "1" minute and then wait at least "1" minute until triggering a new alert  when sending an alert  include the last "1" messages of the stream evaluated for this alert condition   in both cases  i get the alert once and then all alerts stop  and if i restart the graylog services i can receive the one alert again  i'm not sure what else to look at   thanks for any suggestions or help you can provide 
yes  i'll try it   tomorrow   _as soon as there will be a nightly downloadable_ and report back here

 tdurieux   i have added the library  which provides the the class  com lmax disruptor dsl disrupter  to the classpath    actually  i have resolved this issue by providing the source code of library  com lmax disruptor dsl disrupter  instead of the jar file   although i do not know what's the differences  it resolves this issue for now      thanks very much 
no  indentation in the project was set to 4 spaces  that’s what i meant by rstudio ignoring the project settings  i should add that when i saw it was 4 in the project settings  i erased the value  put it on 4 again and saved the project  but that did not fix the bug  only changing it to a different number  saving it  and then changing it back to 4 fixed it    i do also have _auto detect code indentation_ turned off  but my understanding is that it shouldn’t have mattered anyway  its tooltip said that this should only apply to files that are not part of any project  in any case  having it on or off did not change anything about this bug 
on my phone atm  let me do some testing first  i will come back and post my results  like most problems with fundamental features  they need to work with the live server  our live server runs  75 plugins  but the feature only recently broke  and essx wasnt updated  my best guess is a conflict with tokenenchant     i will post the results with interactions with diff plugins  and hopefully fix the problem that way 
yes  i'm using proguard  thanks for the quick reply 
that seems fine to me  i can't think of another case that would include a comma currently 
you are right  quick fix  alt space  suggests changing the signature in the interface  which is not under my control  so either close this issue  or suggest quick fix like in non inherited methods  "add return type hint" 
using forge 13 20 0 2285  littletiles version 1 4 8  this is on 1 11 2 of minecraft  basically use the hammer to make blocks into the little tiles blocks  i did 16x16x16 in the hammer  place those blocks down and then break those blocks with a vanilla pickaxe and you get 2 blocks when you break the block

hi   i tested the logs today  it may be that the problem is in geocaching com end  since even the logging done on geocaching com site using a browser gets saved for the same date  i logged today three caches before 10am  two with c geo visit log http   www geocaching com seek log aspx luid 7f0fc54a ed4f 4ceb a63f 23d088ac3711  and visit log http   www geocaching com seek log aspx luid 3ab3b8a1 66bb 4950 adf2 ddab3b208def with date "today"  i tried to make another with changing the date explicitly to 27 8   but c geo didn't allow me to store this  and in the end the date will show as "today"  too  and one with a web browser in my mobile visit log http   www geocaching com seek log aspx luid 53880e6b 02b4 4879 9271 58eed1439e7e  i also attach here a screen capture from my geocaching com account details  where you can see the date setting   i'll edit these logs manually at geocaching com for the correct date  i'm in a middle of a challenge streak  and need those logs for today        br marautti

hi martino  facchinm  i re downloaded the archive from the site  untarred again and it appears that this archive had more files in it  weird  i don't recall seeing errors related to a premature end of the tar archive  now the library is there  and it works 
i failed to mention  the files are images and contain the graph png  as i've said before  a new copy is created _every_ time  graph png is requested  basically  just browsing the server and refreshing creates them  so  yes  i guess they are temporary files that just don't get removed   have you not seen those  in intellij  they are shown as unversioned files  which is why i became aware of them in the first place

tl dr   same effect   i've copied the json into a separate file  test json  and changed my request line as suggested and have a breakpoint on the call to nashorn eval exp  in script  evalinnashorn yaddah     where exp is "read 'test json' "  the object that's returned by nashorn is a jsoncontext containing a linkedhashmap 'json' in which the linkedhashmap entry that contains the value 'söze' containing the ö is a char 4  array  83    246    122  101  so the decoding looks to be happening either when the file is read or when nashorn is evaluating the json

sure   1  built and deployed app module on my device 2  open the app while connected via wifi  3  pull down notification area and switch off wifi 4  close notification area 5  result is as in screenshot  i'm afraid that's all i have  i just now noticed when there is a small delay between losing wifi and connecting to the mobile network it seems to recover  of course there is a short time where it's disconnected and then correctly reconnects  so this might only occur if the switch is instantaneously  maybe some kind of race condition 
because this behavior looks very ugly and leads to mistakes and misunderstanding especially in case with multiple projects  any suggestions

" usb island remove kissi" returned "that player doesn't have an island" 
issue resolved  apologies  i should have specified that i am also using the wonderful stomp client on top of the okhttp3client websockets  https   github com naiksoftware stompprotocolandroid by nickolay savchenko  nickolay savchenko naiksoftware   this library does an exceptional job of implementing the stomp protocol integrated with okhttp3 websockets   this is where i fell short by using the wrong stompclient over method to provide my url  which will create a default websocket instance that has a default socket read timeout  30 seconds     the  solution for me was to use the alternative stompclient over method  allowing for a reference to an application instance of the okhttp3client  this allows the application set it's desired timeouts beyond any defaults   thank you to all of you who did try to assist me

confirmed  can we change that so that we can sort by any of the rank files available   use case  a geneset is significant in one dataset and not significant in another but very close   might want to compare the ranked list of the two datasets to see how they differ 
yes  it kicks then within seconds

 dhavalshewale i am using 2 1 6 version for sba  could you please share me the exact location where the new label gets positioned 
why i propose to have 2 types of comments  annotated and not annotated   because i want to have comments that both look nice in the  k source code and produce nice latex  whenever possible  if i want to use a latex special character in comments  i don't want to escape it like     it don't look nice anymore  i don't want to see in k comments statements like "performace increased by 5   " moreover it is easy to forget to annotate such characters  now if latex backend would know to annotate such characters automatically  then we would have the same text in latex as in comments   however  this approach is not applicable in all cases  sometimes we want to add specific latex formatting in our comments  like  begin itemize   item  end itemize   in this cases we need a different latex comment marker  to instruct latex not to annotate special characters   why i spent one hour  well just try the example i wrote on the beginning of the topic  looks like latex backend put   on the same line with the code generated for endmodule  and broken the latex document 
i tried it on a fresh new neon  unpacked from a zip

what i mean is  i type in the username and password and click on "use ptc auth" and then nothing happens  i never get the option to save the password or see the ui  nor do i get the login has failed message  the javaw exe remains listed in the task manager and if i get several failures in a row  i get several jvms doing nothing 
unclear to me too since this is the top crash which happens a lot of times with slightly different stack traces so i can't tell      cc  mario
 robbwatershed i using latest version 
yes it's a different ip address  and to be precise it's was not a "real" migration  i just installed subsonic on a new server and set the same parameters  as it's just a few podcasts and one music folder it was easier this way

the above logs are from glassfish server open source edition 4 0 with java 7u141   this is currently from our testing environment  seems to be happening somewhat regularly  i'm seeing endtransaction 00000000000000000000000000000000 with 0 3  of requests   seems to also happen on another server with payara 4 1 1 161 and java 8u162 but not as often  only 0 02  of requests    i don't think there's anything special in settings 
that seems to have fixed it  that also explains the lack of errors in my program output window   thanks  now to recreate my workspace and projects

thanks for your reply  divadsn  i tried so far    turn the notifications off on   i have the google dialer set as a default phone app   turn on the priority notifications for the dialer  unfortunately  still no luck 
thank you for the quick reply    please find attached some sample  fastq files   these are not the most interesting samples due to the low read counts but these result in the mentioned error     van  "stanislav poslavsky"  notifications github com   aan  "milaboratory mixcr"  mixcr noreply github com   cc  "marijke van moerbeke"  mvanmoerbeke openanalytics eu   "author"  author noreply github com   verzonden  woensdag 27 maart 2019 11 55 36  onderwerp  re   milaboratory mixcr  java exception breaks mixcr in assemble step  #501      thanks for reporting  looks like a bug  could you share a sample  fastq files  so that we can reproduce the error    —  you are receiving this because you authored the thread   reply to this email directly    https   github com milaboratory mixcr issues 501#issuecomment 477095537   view it on github     or   https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth astqzw86otwm1aewsso5hltaapwlezggks5va04ogajpzm4cner4   mute the thread    
tried it  still happens 
a save and cancel button would be nice  and it would be more obvious i think   at first i thought it was focus issue  since the popup seemed to lose focus when i alt tabed  and the popup has no window controls when you right click on it   this is on fedora 20 with kde  btw 
it would appear as though after opening the ring of wealth's boss log  then attempting the command again seems to have fixed the issue  extremely odd why it suddenly stopped working and now works again after using the row 
made some tests today  probably it's my fault how to reproduce it 1 in creative gamemode create a new portal far away from the first and go in 2 hold "w" to run forward while loading as you are in creative mode you will immediately tp  so after appiring in overworld  befor all chunks normaly loaded  you will tp back to betweenlands continue holding "w"  after tp back to overworld this happening   2017 12 19_15 58 08  https   user images githubusercontent com 34198111 34160479 cd974ab6 e4d5 11e7 8b81 f6a174df3727 png    2017 12 19_16 09 37  https   user images githubusercontent com 34198111 34161222 9cacd5c6 e4d8 11e7 877d c62459d294f1 png   maybe need to make a bit more tests  but you should turn on delay between tp in creative mode  ps few time after tp to overworld  i appeared without "portal tree" once in ocean and second in forest probably because"the space is not large enough" 
i used the version from google play  which version should i have used instead 
for now i just try in my modpack  with only 256 mods #feelsbadman  but i can try with less mods for see 
sounds reasonable if you could do it today 
 ianchilds it isn't worked and i coundn't found any exception in logcat 
 heiko braun i was not sure if they are related or not  that's why i posted the sencond issue just as comment and that led to creation of #4848  anyway  tried to reproduce this issue  #4791  with todays install of syndesis and the exception is no longer there  edit  the server pod is exception free  but when i tried to edit the integration and edit the odata connection in it  it just loads the connector forever and the whole syndesis is broken from that point

 sleshchenko  i get this error message when i run 
same thinking  i just opened a normal issue to discuss that 
done   https   github com nerzhul ocsms issues 55
it is a company private  jar from remote repository  this jar is not in central repository  
i also cant olace torches on the trunks or any block for that matter on anywhere on the tree
it adds "mounted gun" signs that allow a player to right click the sign and change into a sort of turret mode  where they can then right click with a button and fire arrows   it is very effective at balancing ships vs god armored players  as it can 2 3 shot them if configured correctly  
adding quarkus vertx works around the problem  yes   i see there's a problem with the issue templates  the description gets so long that it's not easy to read all of it   
it's may be brittle indeed  but the entire construct is already a bit brittle in the spec itself    the question is what the guarantees are when the sam does  request#getuserprincipal  without having invoked the handler yet  the sam developer knows this is not a "normal" user principal  i e  the sam can't use the normal logic  userprincipal    nulll    not authenticated  userprincipal    null    authenticated   the    null means here "there is an object available that can be used as signal for the container to restore the previous saved identity"  note that at this point  request#isuserinrole  is not expected to work either  since the sam hasn't actually authenticated yet   you _could_ perhaps speculate that the sam has to treat   request#getuserprincipal  as an opaque object only used to signal the container and not as an actual principal   i admit  i don't know if this is correct  but that was the original reasoning behind the suggestion     i quickly looked at the current fix     would that make sense 
the device is samsung galaxy s3 4 0 4  an official rom   i noticed another thing   i didn't manage to reproduce it on a nexus 4 4 4 2  i'll try other devices soon  i'll remove all my disposes see if this helps 
so basically it won't be possible on kiss 
thanks for your feedback  im' running nextcloud 14 0 3 on an odroid hc 2 with up to date nextcloudpi   ah  and btw  with the german translation of the android app  the message is too small to read the text on a vertical screen  i needed to switch to horizontal view to read the message in total and get its meaning 
i just get a toast msg with the content from the subject  and im redirected to the homescreen

this happens with    forcename  as well  in the sample app  jar name is without version suffix  and therefore module name matches default name of the app 
how can we change to older opencv version   edit  i switch to javacv ver 0 8 and it still crashes

hmmm  i shall attempt some tests after work  most of the players on the server have said chickens and none have gone awol except those on the ship    that ofcourse does not mean advanced rocketry is to blame  it could be a chunk error and that can be in any world  time to set test chickens in each chunk of my ship lol  just this is thefirsttimeits been noted
a scroll would work  but there are two things which should happen if possible with a scroll   1  the window should indicate there is more to the left or right somehow   2  the current setting should be visible unless the user has scrolled away from it on purpose 
found it  simple cause  if the map difficulty name is empty string  then it didn't create a new list because the if condition checked against an empty string  so whenever you select a map with no difficulty name  it would throw a null pointer  i made some maps to test the slider things i did  and didn't bother giving it names so i had such maps in the list   i didn't realise version meant difficulty  
using cauldron with latest forge version on server  big reactors 0 4 0rc3 sp is using just latest forge   and server side it can be replicated 100  of the time i created over a dozen turbines with the same result even after restarting the server itself  have not run into it in single player at all yet

minecraft version  1 12 2 as version  1 7 forge version  1 12 2 14 23 0 2512  i assumed that losing infusion was intentional due to the last line in the "infused crystal tools" chapter in the book  in constellation  line reads "however  that also comes with the possibility that the liquid might be drained at some point   "   i've noted twice now that occasionally  when using the sword rapidly  i e  against  10 mobs   it will convert from "infused crystal sword" to "crystal sword " retaining all of its enchantments  size  purity  and current cutting  advanced tooltips also show that the item is converted from astralsorcery itemchargedcrystalsword to astralsorcery itemcrystalsword   i did just update as to 1 7 2 yesterday  and have yet to have this happen again  but i haven't really used the sword much since then  i will see if i can replicate the issue

log excerpt with extra debug output 
 eivantsov do you mean like http vs  https   i did figure out what the problem was with websockets as well as a related problem with keycloak not recognizing https  it turns out that elb layer 7 cannot do websockets  however  if you start using elb layer 4  then nginx ingress cannot send all the needed http headers to keycloak  specifically x forwarded proto  which makes keycloak mix http https  so either path with elb will break eclipse che keycloak  so i switched out elb with alb  https   github com kubernetes sigs aws alb ingress controller   and it seems much better so far  the alb goes directly to keycloak and che  but also on path   server   to the nginx ingress controller so che can keep adding in ingress rules   wss is still a little bit flakey  but i am able to connect now   so keycloak seems rock solid now  and the eclipse che ui seems great as well  but i am still not able to create containers  actually  i did not even get to the stage of the command being issued to kubernetes  it seems to get stuck on not being able to create ingress rules now  from the eclipse che catalina out

yes  i have to use textureview for renderer where using complex shader to draw final frames  i can't use a surfaceview for my renderer because a layout contains complex hierarchy of different elements and textureview elements among them with overlay views  a surfaceview doesn't allow to implement that   there is example how i use the yuvconverter

hello benas   yes your modifications is working till some point  sadly all of the other annotations and the methods for checking the annotations should be modified if we want easy rules work behind a proxy like cglib  however i started to think that it is a very specific request and i suspect that it may not be that common  anyways less talk and more code   i have prepared an integration test just for checking if easy rules can work behind a proxy  you can checkout my branch from here   https   github com cgonul easyrules tree integration_test_for_proxying  my new branch is up to date with your latest changes   here is the codes for integration tests   dffdf6b3d68d578d9d35b11530c6b71dcaadc6bc  in here all of my beans is served behind a proxy with the help of aspectconfiguration  when this happens the classes annotated with  springrule becomes the child class of the non proxied original classes  you can comment out the  configuration annotation in aspectconfiguration class to disable the proxy   you will see that the integration test is not succeeded  it fails with the following argument exception    which is triggered from ruledefinitionvalidator since easy rules can not find the condition annotation on the dummyrule class  since the dummyrule is created as a child class of the original dummyrule by the cglib proxy      how ever she can find the  rule annotation since it is inherited thanks for your last modifications checkruleclass method is succeded     this weekend i will work with this integration test and make easy rules works behind a proxy  the challenge for me is that you do not like annotionutils from spring core dependency  i will try to localize it   thanks

hey  sarxos  thanks for the quick reply   i'm not using any logging framework aside from my own embedded logging interface  i played around with including a logback configuration file in my working directory and got some output from the logger that your api is using  should there be any particular configuration settings i should be including in the logback xml file   thanks again 
i just ran the rebuild  now i do get back that parent when i query the main snomed vet endpoint  but it is very slow to return  like 6 7 seconds   before it was pretty much instantaneous  i also see this log message output when i call that endpoint now   that seems surprising for just a single concept parent query

i think they got disconnected out of some reason not related to banmanager  this might be an issue with protocollib  but banmanager seems to have issues with that happening   the first two lines are what happened before the actual stacktrace https   pastebin com zj8g8n8a  so complete log would be player connect  player immediate disconnect  banmanager throws this error once and protocollib spams it's stack trace a couple of time 
it always checks the code 
i just did a bit of testing and renaming of profiles isn't a problem  sorry for claiming this above   but renaming of used scenarios makes easer crash every time  here a simple step by step example   0  install easer 0 6 from f droid  grant permissions and make it run  1  create a scenario named foo  time 6 00  2  create a script named bar that uses foo as a scenario and leave everything else blank  3  change the name of the scenario foo to test   after hitting save easer crashes with the message "unfortunately  easer has stopped " and then crashes every time i try to start it with that same message 
sorting alphabetically seems fine  is that how the autocomplete service currently works from ontoquest

 youfacepalm is doing so a known issue   it's also worth nothing that we only saw this crash on api 23 devices  not 24 or 25 devices 
no  i tried it with keys instead  still nothing 
fixed with #262
this is a plain bnd project   not a maven one  i am not using any   runpath  the bndrun comprises the exact configuration as aforementioned 
we dont use any https url  not intentionally  my brower is opera   for this test case i replaced http with https and got this error    16 13 50   qtp1916156132 550 warn   webapi   illegal character 0x16 in state start for buffer heapbytebuffer 79989b32 p 1 l 165 c 8192 r 164    x16    x03 x01 x00 xa0 x01 x00 x00 x9c x03 x03 x95 j# xaf xfd xb6    x0e x00 x0c x02h2 x08http 1 1    headers  origin     x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00 x00   
basically  red plug in is working fine  it just throws the syntax exception 
thanks for the response  hm  seems the bug is on my side then  i'll try running with only ic2 and gt  also will try updating forge
after some more investigation  the comparison is actually against the  ref  field of the push object  the value of that will usually be a git ref  like  refs heads master  for pushes to branches  i think the proper solution is not to match anything  but testing for equality with  targetbranch  prepended by  refs heads     refs heads   is the only prefix that makes sense  because we do not care about tags that are pushed or other refs   i will give the fix a try and test it out on our server 
updated op for more findings
hello   this issue is no longer replicated   thanks
absolutely sure  i am able to insert the textual single word clipboard content into k9 and into google input field in firefox  but in kontalk only the blue indicator showing the input position  the blue 'drop' in your screenshot  appears but not the 'paste' button above  independently of the input method  swype or aosp  
oh  yeah  i forgot to write it  tried  nothing has changed 
this bug also occurs in v3 6 0  i can confirm it works in v3 5 5 
i have not been able to reproduce this issue since reporting it  at the time of reporting it the bug occurred multiple times each session  i will open another issue if i find a more solid way to reproduce it

no  i would keep this as a manual task  is it in our wiki   as sometimes i do something stupid while building release    
sorry forgot to mention  archmage orb completely full so plenty of lp 
i followed pimotte's suggestion and tried to debug the issue  but once i built everything from master branch the issue was gone  eventually i traced it to some jars in c  program files  x86  syncany lib left from the previous syncany's installation  clean install solved the problem completely 
i can confirm that shirt type and size labels are not visible anymore  i am however still unable to see social media info   is that on purpose or is that defect 
probably error with struct appears due to incorrect mapping  table 'test'  anyway  any attempt of import results with error  tr_log log  https   github com dbeaver dbeaver files 4031073 tr_log log 
ok  so i started fixing the unicode errors  but after that i started getting more errors about the javadoc  and realized that all the errors i got are javadoc related event the unicode one  so running  gradlew bat setupciworkspace build  x javadoc  will not really fix the issues  but will exclude the javadoc 
nothing seams intreasting in the log but here it is  debug log  https   github com cadiboo nocubes files 3621651 debug log 
i mean gateway received the  closewebsocketframe  of client  but don't send it to the backend 
yes  i'm aware of the whatsapp and gmail limitations with quick reply  but the feature disappears after a reboot in cases were it shouldn't  never in textra and when a single message is showing in whatsapp   everytime i reboot the phone one of those apps will lose the qr functionality from your mod  sometimes is whatsapp and sometimes textra  seems random which one it is   sometimes rebooting again without doing anything restores the functionality in both apps  but most of the times it doesn't  i have to disable xnotification  reboot  re enable it  reboot  and sometimes even that doesn't do the trick  i often find myself rebooting 6+ times in order to get it to work   i haven't found a pattern and it seems to be happening to other folks in the xda forum as well

it works  seems it just cancel the transition at all  if two transition overlaps   but it is a reasonable solution 
i checked the same lang server with eclipse  but the problem is not there  strange  but i will check the idea implementation and update this issue
no  it creates items  too edit  ah  no  paperui does  sorry 
good to know but i haven't tried yet

thanks  nkzawa  that'll be great  will close this once it is released    btw  we are using this lib in production  so i am doing active trouble shooting and trying to clean the issue list  30+ open issue is bit scary  and you are the one with full knowledge to do this  could you please go through them and close the ones not valid anymore

sure  i could fix this by throwing exception but am not 100  sure that doing so would fully address problem   if you look at stack trace  you'll see that i'm not directly calling constructor  i make a seemingly reasonable call to setstylespans int stylespans  with a non empty stylespans object  i probably need to investigate what's wrong with arguments to this call  perhaps i'm adding empty span via stylespansbuilder  should that be prohibited  whatever the case  it's probable that error condition could be detected before paragraph ctor is invoked 
appreciate you taking a look electroblob77  i'll close this issue 
 sanjaypujare oh wow   that worked  thanks very much  i updated  com google protobuf protobuf java util 3 9 2  to   com google protobuf protobuf java util 3 10 0  thanks   
it is living for only a few seconds  what i see from the system explorer   additional 300 mbs  so short term  during the first several modules build  it will consume more memory  but the average memory consumption and the peek one will be definitely less with the fork 
thanks for the test version and sorry for the delay  i had a stress filled week  my wife and me have now tested the multiuserfix apk and with it both phones get all the values  so far  so good      here is how we tested     we uninstalled the regular versions and installed your openscale 1 5 2 multiuserfix apk zip on both phones    then we created two users on both phones and activated the smart assignment function    now we took out and reset the scales batteries    the first sync  on both phones  didn't load any values    the second sync  on both phones  loaded all stored values to the selected user a    then we manually deleted all wrong assigned values on both phones  very time consuming by the way    the third sync  again on both phones  loaded the beforehand deleted values to user b   after that both phones were constantly able to receive new measurements for both users  so yeah  it works  please put your changes into the official version  thanks for that   i also detected some minor glitches in my tests and i have some ideas for improvements but i'll open new issues for that 
i mean  provided the following two statements    a  there exists a polygon's vertex which is inside the view frustum   b  the polygon is visible  then the following holds  a    b while the reverse _is not _ true  b    a   this is a _false_ implication   or in other words  a polygon can still be visible _even if no vertex is inside the frustum_  because the frustum cuts one or more faces of the polygon  while at the same time not containing a vertex of it 
nice  quick find  yea  we should do a quick release for this one  thanks 
i'm using the 16 20 teradata driver  but will check for a newer version   i had no issues like this with 6 1 3   i should note i have been using homebrew to install and update dbeaver   should i switch to download and install 
the error occured when executing the even at 18 00  i'am using the davical caldav server 
hey  i made a repository with a sample app with which i have managed to reproduce the issue 100  of times provided i follow these   exact steps     https   github com andreiharasemiuc android job rescheduling issue sample  1  launch the app 2  app will wait 10 seconds  handler postdelayed  and schedule an exact job with a delay of 20 seconds  3  at the moment you see in the logs that the job has been scheduled  close off the app from recent tasks  4  in 20 seconds the job will run  the job will do 2 things  show a notification   schedule another job with a delay of 1 minute  5  when the job runs and the notification is displayed  immediately click the notification  clicking the notification will take you to an empty activity  as soon as that activity opens  background the app   result  the second job that you just scheduled  with a delay of 1 minute  will run with a delay of 0 seconds soon after you background the app   please note that the sample app does not use _1 2 0 alpha3_ because i had some weird errors and couldn't buld the project and didn't have time to see what they were about  so i used _1 1 11_   however    i succesfully added _1 2 0 alpha3_ in my main project and i could still reproduce the issue just like before 
hi  i'm having some troubles running my code with the snapshot build  the front end doesn't want to connect to the server   perhaps i am doing something wrong   but by looking at the commit   why don't you use  threadlocal remove  https   docs oracle com javase 7 docs api java lang threadlocal html#remove 28 29  instead of  set null   
will try  yes  but note that i've experienced this issue consistently over months  should have reported it   and only with that field  for example i've never had the same problem with pasting values into the deposit fee address text field 
after looking through the code i believe this delay is caused by the things in gcparser getextraonlineinfo  friends log  gcvote  elevation   at least gcvote and the elevation could be done in parallel  without the activity waiting for their results  
thanks for the fix   yes i'm a big kotlin fan  and i'm very pleased to see that you're working on improving this library for kotlin devs   thanks to you for your work on this library

yes  but apparently we missed an important detail in https   github com eclipse xtext extras commit f621cb5ed6a27320f619c4dc0185fadcaa3dc00c#diff d03af8b70bcedad15e6b5b70e578de47   i assume the super call should have gone into the dovalidatelambdacontents 
the documentation itself is tied to the version the respective site has deployed  so on opencaching de okapi you can see  ver  1133  54ad2cf   in the upper left and the cache field list names the short_description  on opencaching org uk okapi you see  rev  515  and no mentioning of the short_description field  so in essence you have to check all sites you want to call wrt their apisupport level  in our code we currently have only two levels  current and oldapi  as luckily most of the sites nowadays update regularly with only oc uk staying behind

the first workaround is fine  i just wanted to make sure you knew it was a breaking change  it'll probably affect a lot of people  so maybe the first release should make the new behavior opt in 
i'm actually waiting for sponge to fix issues on their end before i am going to do more testing  as far as i know though there was no errors or anything out of the ordinary in the log files when i tested this originally   edit  i tested with forge 1902 and the latest plethora compiled from source at the time  spongeforge  and griefprevention   on that note  there's an issue with spongeforge's fakeplayer uuid exclusion system which you can see here  https   github com spongepowered spongeforge issues 804 as well as this issue  https   github com minecraftportcentral griefprevention issues 123 both of which are not issues with plethora directly  but maybe you will find those issues useful

when you right click a block you select the creature in the gui and it disappears  i assume this is a latency issue    for clarification

no    che sh is ran from ubuntu  with oracle jdk  docker installed  on virtualbox and the decompressed che tarball is inside a mounted virtualbox shared folder  hence the vboxsf group  current user is added to vboxsf  and docker group    tried with a 600000  but nothing changed 
it feels like a bazel error  the exception is   according to the intertubes  this could happen when using policy files from a different version of the jdk  maybe it's related to the recent jdk upgrade

 midhun07 sorry i wasn't clearer  generally  forms post to the server url that is in the settings  the xml of that form looks like this     so in the case of a form submission where there is a form specific url and credentials are required  it'd be good if the error message referred to that form specific hostname    to test  set your device's server to https   opendatakit appspot com  confirm this is working by getting blank form  you should see forms like biggest n of set  birds  cascading select    now  rename this form   custom url xml txt  https   github com opendatakit collect files 848378 custom url xml txt   to custom url xml and  manually push it to your device  https   github com opendatakit collect #testing a form locally   note that the form xml has https   nafundi test appspot com submission as the submission url   with your computer's browser  log into the https   nafundi test appspot com with admin admin  go into site admin  then preferences  and uncheck all permissions for anonymoususer  save changes   now fill out the custom url form on your device and try to send it in  it should show an alert that says you should enter the username and password for opendatakit appspot com  but that isn't correct  the server should be nafundi test appspot com because that's what is in the form   and to be extra sure things work when you are making your changes  try creating another user on the server with data collector privileges and make sure those credentials work   when you are done testing  re enable permissions for anonymoususer

let me pull out a simplified dataset and code example that reproduces the issue     the key hashing is consistent and immutable and the transaction is disabled  the value isn't immutable   but i can make it be   i will also give it a try with the cachedisabled
it does clarify the issue   fwiw  i read what comments are present  and still this did not occur to me   i doubt updating comments are high priority  but noting somewhere in the class that it's meant to mimic line2d would have given me somewhere else to look to understand it's behavior   thanks for the library  it's been very useful to me 
sure  it was late yesterday   here is a minimal example   this snippet works  but when the cube monkey is loaded first the program crashes  due to looking for the animations in the previously loaded model's data  when i encountered it yesterday it even successfully loaded the data and produced wrong animations   with debugging it can be observed starting  here  https   github com jmonkeyengine jmonkeyengine blob master jme3 plugins src gltf java com jme3 scene plugins gltf gltfloader java#l785    here are the models   resources zip  https   github com jmonkeyengine jmonkeyengine files 2740333 resources zip  the cube is just a cube  the monkey is suzanne with 2 times subdivision applied  and the sway animation is a 2 bone armature affecting a cube  the models animations were created in the latest blender 2 80 beta version   also the error is on the current master branch  i don't know about v3 2 x

yes v1 1 3  plugman say it 
that's a good question  fixed 
same exception
the way i noticed this was due to an error i made while working on the async source downloading and accidentally truncated the container state files  but yes  it can also happen if the user deletes moves these state files  or due to us making a mistake and change the name of the plugin  which results in a different folder to be used to the files  or making some changes to the deserialization process that leads to error when reading older state files  i won't consider this issue critical due to hopefully small chance of it happening  but if it happens  fixing it is rather tedious 
hi  natario1  i have testing across many devices  ur library works fine on most device except htc and huawei  end up i use another library that implement camera 2 api 
the latest log there and the crash right above it   yes removing mouse tweaks stops the crash   i think you will find updating to  22 will stop the issue   1 14 has been problematic with crashes with forge because it never shows you the stacktrace for the actual mod causing the issue when they are not updated  so you have to get a stable base and add a mod and if it casues some other mod to crash you know that is the one with the problem the one you added    try with my latest release of my pack and add your mod and load it 
no  his comment after the proposed solution is  "but i decided not include these changes into library " which i don't understand  as it's a valid issue  perhaps most users of his app don't return the text that the mythtv services api does  or  most people don't search the protocol for rsts

yes we did  in the iswc paper we  i  defined the notion of matching triples for a given triple pattern and  ii  formalized triple pattern selectors in terms of this notion  by these definitions  a triple  ex bob foaf knows ex alice  is _not_ a matching triple for the triple pattern   x foaf knows  x  and  thus  this triple must not be included in the data of the tpf of that triple pattern   btw  what we did not capture formally is the possibility of omitting elements of a triple pattern in a request    rubenverborgh

it was a unique self inflicted issue that had nothing in fact to do with nextcloud
1  i have an hp spectre x360 13t running windows 10 1903  though this issue has always occurred  even before 1903  specs are as here     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 21211494 61143022 bf1e6280 a496 11e9 90dc 4c9b79da11fa png  i think i heard hp makes their own display drivers or something like that  instead of using the windows ones  so that could very well be part of the problem too   2  switching to software rendering didn't change anything  nor did switching to opengl

yes you are right it tries to read from this file   sys class hwmon hwmon2 temp temp1_input    this file is present but the weird part is that it is actually throwing  an invalid argument exception  when it reads the file  i tried to access it via cmd with  cat temp1_input  and it is also giving me an invalid argument error  the file is present but it is not being read in any way  below is a screenshot of that file in file explorer   notice the 'unknown type'     screenshot_2018 10 10_20 55 10  https   user images githubusercontent com 10103992 46749418 18225580 cccf 11e8 87ed b1b6b74bba89 png 
you are right  the event is not lost  it remains in the queue ✔ unfortunately owntracks   does not   retry the transmission  as soon as the wifi receives the internet connection  wlan symbol changes from ❗ to ok   a retry is done when it changes back from wlan to cellular  this means that the exit event is delayed for the duration of the car drive 😒  thanks  michael

i retried and it did not crash  now i'm wondering what may have caused that 
the  doublecomparator  returns false  i think the problem lies in  normalizedkeysorter  because the support is checked in the constructor but in  write t record       is called anyway  would it be ok to simply remove the thrown  unsupportedexception  in  putnormalizedkey  of the comparator 
yes it does

i puzzled out the likely reason for the log submitting fail  he carries currently 43 trackables and sets them to visit  for such log c geo runs into timeout for him while logging  while the log has ben successfully posted by c geo  as soon as he leaves them on ""no action" the log process in c geo runs smoothly  i asked for html capture of the logging page  will sent via cgeo dev mailing list   what else could be helpful

1  i tried to copy data inside the same region  from a bucket in us standard to us  standard   and i reached very good speed   440 mbyte sec  3520 mbit sec   so actually aws dependency does not slow down the speed  2  when i placed the ec2 machine in frankfurt  i reached almost twice better speed than when the machine was located in n  virginia while copying data from us standard to frankfurt   38 mbyte sec  304 mbit sec   i'm not sure that there is a real problem here  transferring data via wan network always works much slower then via lan due to latency and bandwidth 3  regarding  e     endpoint option  my source bucket is located in us standard and target bucket in frankfurt  so i don't understand how this should work  if i define a frankfurt's endpoint  the application will try to access both buckets using only frankfurt's endpoint  or there is a possibility to define separate endpoints for source and target buckets 
 philwebb  managementwebsecurityautoconfiguration  behaves as expected  this issue arises with a reactive configuration  however  i looked a bit deeper into this and it appears  reactivemanagementwebsecurityautoconfiguration  is not the issue   i believe the main issue is with  reactiveoauth2clientautoconfiguration  as it   does not   register a default   bean  of  securitywebfilterchain    if you look at  oauth2clientautoconfiguration  on the servlet side of things  you will see that it  indirectly  registers the default security configuration via  oauth2websecurityconfiguration oauth2websecurityconfigureradapter   which makes  managementwebsecurityautoconfiguration  back off   i believe the only fix required here is to add the following code to  reactiveoauth2clientautoconfiguration       what are your thoughts

 mattjacunski firstly  thanks a lot for you library   yes  i downloaded 3 1 5 version and tried it  on my nexus 5 i couldn't reproduce this issue on your sampleapp  but i reproduced in my application  on nexus 4 android 4 4 2 i reproduced on your sampleapp and in my application  i made only one change   add    scanintent putextra cardioactivity extra_language_or_locale  "ru"   and then put date in expiration field  when i tried to replace date i could delete only 3 symbols except first 
none of them work for me  just keeps trying to load price and fails  top bar is changing colors while it tries to load   on may 4  2017 6 39 am  "aefeinstein"  notifications github com  wrote 
ok
 macdonst i implemented locally in xcode changes for all 4 files from  this request  https   github com phonegap phonegap plugin push pull 2363 files   relaunch app on my device and it not helped  notifications worked but without sound  maybe i missed something   ##### additional info   1  without my fixes  original plugin version and version with  2266  https   github com phonegap phonegap plugin push pull 2363 files  fixes  using received token from plugin  i can send notification with  production voip services certificate 
i'm not actually sure  i don't quite have them memorized but it's this one  https   imgur com a wrnf9ey in the db the size is set as "bigger"
yes    i have already installed  net framework 4
ty it worked
config catalog is very much like spycarbasic and has been verified with the load tool and getbaseplans   call  calls made were createtenant  createaccount  createsubscription  getaccount   what is supposedly 'wrong'  maybe nothing  i was under the impression that the balance is supposed to reflect the customer's outstanding liability is that incorrect    after looking into this a bit more  i think your client getaccount "externalkey"  has a bug  maybe you are using a    instead of  equals ""   
i think it makes sense to do so 
 ywelsch thanks for looking at this    these are not master eligible nodes  there are 3 other master elegible nodes in the cluster  which don't store any data   while doing a rolling upgrade  the script processes all the master eligible nodes first and then moves to data nodes   all data nodes  the kind which show failure  have similar config to one given below    the master elgible nodes are  10 44 0 43 44 45  which don't show any failure     closed indices are mostly created on 7 x  for the latest issue  the indices mentioned in the logs above were created using 7 x
it works   but if you manually set the id and try to save  then an exception is thrown   in version 0 4 it all worked    test     public void saveusertest   throws ioexception           mongocollection coll   jongo getcollection "users"           user user   new user            user setid "myid"           user setname "alex"           coll save user           system out println "save user with id " + user getid              caused by  org jongo marshall marshallingexception  unable to marshall user 16a05ff into bson     at org jongo marshall jackson jacksonengine marshall jacksonengine java 55      at org jongo insert asbsondocument insert java 111          34 more caused by  com fasterxml jackson databind jsonmappingexception  invalid objectid  myid  through reference chain  user "_id"       at com fasterxml jackson databind jsonmappingexception wrapwithpath jsonmappingexception java 232      at com fasterxml jackson databind jsonmappingexception wrapwithpath jsonmappingexception java 197      at com fasterxml jackson databind ser std stdserializer wrapandthrow stdserializer java 186      at com fasterxml jackson databind ser std beanserializerbase serializefields beanserializerbase java 640      at com fasterxml jackson databind ser beanserializer serialize beanserializer java 152      at com fasterxml jackson databind ser defaultserializerprovider serializevalue defaultserializerprovider java 114      at com fasterxml jackson databind objectwriter _configandwritevalue objectwriter java 809      at com fasterxml jackson databind objectwriter writevalue objectwriter java 650      at org jongo marshall jackson jacksonengine marshall jacksonengine java 53          35 more caused by  java lang illegalargumentexception  invalid objectid  myid      at org bson types objectid  init  objectid java 128      at org bson types objectid  init  objectid java 122      at org jongo marshall jackson oid objectidserializer serialize objectidserializer java 30      at org jongo marshall jackson oid objectidserializer serialize objectidserializer java 26      at com fasterxml jackson databind ser beanpropertywriter serializeasfield beanpropertywriter java 541      at com fasterxml jackson databind ser std beanserializerbase serializefields beanserializerbase java 632          40 more

ok     thanks for help  after command   java  jar mep_1 35 jar   was automatically created a directory mep at   documents matlab with the following content     according your suggestions on wiki  but after all that  when i start matlab i always get open editor  see attached screenshot     screenshot_2018 12 03_11 02 11  https   user images githubusercontent com 2698803 49366975 036ca780 f6eb 11e8 8be2 79d2547562a6 png    is that normal behavior  is possible to suppress opening editor window with   mep  sorry    text      will be possible to create automatically the javaclasspath txt file in a case when it does not exist at default matlab directory  home kva documents matlab and add some generic content to startup m file at the same directory  + in a case of no startup m file    it would be really very useful  if the installer solve all installation steps fully interactively and automatically 
unfortunately there no easy example  i think it's related to the annotation being in the library with an older version 
our application is acting as proxy  the side accepting client requests extends simplechannelinboundhandler and has following pipeline
i'm using what's on atc currently   resourcefulcrops 1 12 2 1 0 61 jar cyclic 1 12 1 7 12 jar forge 1 12 1 14 22 0 2464 universal
in this issue i'm discussing only   non static   fields  this problem does not occur with static fields    i was using a final field with a pertxbox to implement an optimization in the bplustree when i stumbled upon this situation  i've already found a way to work around the problem by removing final and using different initialization code      its value can depend not only on constructor parameters  but also on any changes made to the object  just imagine a tail with a number of hairs  the cat can chew on its tail and lose hair  perhaps i should have used a dog instead   it's true that the number of hairs is not persisted  when a cat is fetched from the database  the number of hairs is reset  worse   if the transaction is restarted the number of hairs is not reset    but the cat should   always   have a tail  because of the final semantics    what if the programmer knows all this  that the field is not persistent and not transactional  but still wants to use it for other ends  i e  keeping a temporary value of an intermediate calculation   or is the use of non dml fields an invalid use case for the framework  and thus not an issue

hi  i will update the library and return with results of test 
yes  it is possible in both 
removing the file worked  thank you 
ahhhhhh yeah  i had "screen sharing" turned on   after disabling the screen sharing  the server starts fine and arquillian integration tests with payara embedded all work fine as well   thanks   i imagine this would be a hazelcast port colliding with the vnc server port then   i wonder what the best way to resolve this would be within the embedded server 
yes  removing the tool if it fails  and resetting the command in order to do it again with a new name 

yes  at http    domainname  owncloud index php apps news api v1 2 folders i get a json response    "folders"   "id" 1 "name" "news"   "id" 2 "name" "techie"   "id" 3 "name" "listen subscriptions"   "id" 4 "name" "linux"   "id" 5 "name" "somelocation"   "id" 6 "name" "others"   "id" 7 "name" "entertainment"   
yes that is enabled and nextcloud is not on the exception list at the moment

 mdehghanim tried running with two separate files  "add file s " option   which generated the same error message  but when i ran it using one folder  "add folder" option  containing two files  same files as the ones i used when running with two separate files   the clustering successfully ran 
yes  the issue is gone in the latest version

thank you  i sent it to you  but my email often is in spam  so if it is gone  i will send it again with a different email  and thank you  i wish you a good easter holiday 
hey there   i am on rebornstorage 1 12 2 3 0 3 36  i dunno if it's related something you can fix  but it also takes several seconds to load a single page of recipes from a crafter on the client side   i'll test that out when i get a moment  i already moved all of the patterns to a crafter and it's gonna be tedious to move everything back  haha  do crafters and the multiblock accept piped items 
that reading was from 30 minutes later  i didn't spawn at my bed and lost everything so i had to get home   no it was definitely seconds  roughly 5  guarantee it was less than 10  i entered the room  was poisoned  was dead before i heard five "attacks" and was wearing diamond armor with either medium or heavy shielding  happened twice   unfortunately i took the reactor down because i needed to run it so testing it again won't be as easy    here are steps i believe i took before this happened to me twice     use compact machines with 1 12   make a large compact machine   build a 3x3 reactor for tbu oxide  i can try to send the build somehow    run 3 pellets while back in the overworld  leave the depleted fuel in the fission controller overnight    come back
should be fixed by https   github com gama platform gama commit 9dc3ecdac294595cb7c475e745672a12ac0b0768
try this demo https   github com alexbyte gs crud with vaadin
no  but i will try 
sorry i wasn't exactly clear  i was not able to get ffmpeg working correctly  but i was able to use the java only  bat from 0 2 1 alpha without issues 
reload helps and so far  it happened at least once or twice

leaving this ticket open because i think we should eventually merge the broker into the backend  it's way simpler 
hi  neither worked  but i follow them and found that when the f class static initializer runs  when it gets to  computerthreads no_threads   config jas_no_threads   this causes an exception and aborts the try  including the runnable that would do the f count_down_latch countdown      so you are right  it is not called when f class is initialized   note that the app does not freeze at this point  there's only a logcat output from the catch  the app will only freezes when evaluate   is called with an operation later on   the logcat shows   07 14 03 02 29 792 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err  java lang exceptionininitializererror 07 14 03 02 29 793 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org matheclipse core expression f  clinit  f java 3312          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine  init  evalengine java 192          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine  init  evalengine java 308          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine 1 initialvalue evalengine java 72  07 14 03 02 29 794 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org matheclipse core eval evalengine 1 initialvalue evalengine java 64          at java lang threadlocal setinitialvalue threadlocal java 180          at java lang threadlocal get threadlocal java 170          at org matheclipse core eval evalengine get evalengine java 82          at br eng it jsvcalc stackitem  clinit  stackitem java 24  07 14 03 02 29 795 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at br eng it jsvcalc stackitem setprefs stackitem java 219          at br eng it jsvcalc mainactivity oncreate mainactivity java 124          at android app activity performcreate activity java 6984          at android app instrumentation callactivityoncreate instrumentation java 1235  07 14 03 02 29 796 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at android app activitythread performlaunchactivity activitythread java 2783          at android app activitythread handlelaunchactivity activitythread java 2909          at android app activitythread  wrap11 unknown source 0          at android app activitythread h handlemessage activitythread java 1606          at android os handler dispatchmessage handler java 105          at android os looper loop looper java 164  07 14 03 02 29 797 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at android app activitythread main activitythread java 6592          at java lang reflect method invoke native method          at com android internal os zygote methodandargscaller run zygote java 240          at com android internal os zygoteinit main zygoteinit java 769  07 14 03 02 29 799 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err  caused by  java lang nullpointerexception  attempt to get length of null array         at org apache logging log4j util reflectionutil privatesecuritymanager getcallerclass reflectionutil java 308          at org apache logging log4j util reflectionutil getcallerclass reflectionutil java 218  07 14 03 02 29 800 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org apache logging log4j util reflectionutil getcallerclass reflectionutil java 197          at org apache logging log4j core selector classloadercontextselector getcontext classloadercontextselector java 72          at org apache logging log4j core selector classloadercontextselector getcontext classloadercontextselector java 57          at org apache logging log4j core impl log4jcontextfactory getcontext log4jcontextfactory java 140          at org apache logging log4j core impl log4jcontextfactory getcontext log4jcontextfactory java 41  07 14 03 02 29 801 17630 17630 br eng it jsvcalc w system err      at org apache logging log4j logmanager getcontext logmanager java 267          at org apache log4j logger privatemanager getcontext logger java 59          at org apache log4j logger getlogger logger java 41          at edu jas kern computerthreads  clinit  computerthreads java 30    with the older version that works  this exception does not occur

 rnveach  yes  i'm preparing a pr for  xmllogger   there is a problem with  filestarted  and  filefinished  methods    defaultlogger  works fine  according to my tests  seems like the  printwriter  synchronizes write operations  however  i haven't found a documentation for this behavior  i'll also prepare a pr for  defaultlogger   this seems to be an easy fix
fixed  thanks  after you release  i will change to 1 1 1  now i am still using my proguard
starting app syncthing   were you doing scroll down in app   30sec nothing  app crashing    but if i use adb on pc linux  and log de data  what should be the command on command line  in order to get useful data   fault still present 
it brings up the file explorer and says no files available  doesn't give me the option to look in google photos or drive
hey     i haven't tried the fix yet    i'll give it a shot soon     i'm adding items with  additem  function without calling  notifyiteminserted  after it 
it does

yep  errors appear to be gone  woot

how about the modded blocks i was trying to move 
yeah  that true  i see it quite often and doesn't cause any problems under a certain treshold   but after adding an extra imageview the shuttering began showing more  here a movie to illustrate the issue  https   www youtube com watch v j_rogajefzg  as you can see  it looks like if the animation hasn't finished completely before the cards get refreshed which result in the stutter   below is the layout xml  it's just one relativelayout  the hierarchy can't get any flatter

 raphw windows 10   version 10 0 16299 19   about jre  it should work fine on jre i think  in jre 8 you could run byte buddy agent with manually provided tools jar and added attach dll to command line or via reflections directly to class loader   ofc you need to choose valid lib tools for each system etc  but it works fine  so something like this should be possible in jre 9 too  by somehow loading  jdk attach jmod   i think this is the only one missing from jre   and that  attach  library  but not sure how to do that yet   like i said  it works perfectly fine in jre 8  you just need to add that libraries to your  jar or download them on startup 
here is the configuration 
 levelx2 version 1 4 4v12
the test cachekeytest shouldtestcachekeyswithbinaryarrays is green so i'm pretty sure fix should be fine  however i'll double check on a sample application  will let you know

well  no  i will not post on public or to unknown persons full headers of real e mails or real e mail addresses of persons i have no permission to publish their e mail  you should know that this no good idea  sorry      i know of my own experience it is hard for a programmer to believe  check it out with the information i gave in the description  i tried and tested those parameters  check it yourself  create an e mail address of those length  send test mails to yourself and you should see the result      if you have other questions i try to help as far i can   best regards  stefan
the test you wrote matches my scenario correctly  i was using beta 4  i think  i guess this was resolved in a newer version  sorry for the trouble then lol
thank you  that worked

i wish we could add curly braces to solve this  the script is a client's auto proxy discovery for their large network  we're a small app running on their system  so we didn't want to make their it change their script    i'll try some regex foo and see if i can provide a solution for this case 
ah  i guess we did that to be consistent with landscape mode  landscape mode on small tablets has a fab  but it's the "add task" button and the "complete task" option is in the details toolbar  so in order to be consistent we kept the complete option on the toolbar in portrait mode  however  i think we should show a fab in that case now

i had no expectations at all   however  is it possible to do it in a way that is similar to what you are already doing  and the way that jax rs does it in general   i e   by allowing the user to define a   provider  that implements an interface that is _specifically_ for initialization  e g   something like jax rs's  contextresolver  interface

i used the same content for the logback dev xml as in the default logback xml  just wanted to reproduce it on an empty project  but it looks like it doesn't have to do with the logback xml file  rather than the jetty maven plugin  when i bump the jetty maven plugin to the latest stable version  9 1 3 v20140225   i get debug messages from netty  shouldn't the logback config set this to info 
yes i'm in the latest version  it wasn't showing additional effects in the description text  it was still working as a half health weapon though 
some more observations     i figured out that the whole thing works in chrome  it doesn't work in firefox only  we have firefox 52 4 0  32bit  here   i pasted the urls in the browser       when using the hostname  i get immediately redirected to some other page  judging the sourcecode  ide html  and a dialog pops up "can not get workspaces  the reason  workspace with name "" in namespace 'api' doesn't exist "     when using the ip  i see the json proper    i logged in on the machine and used curl      http   ourhost 8081 api    returns the api description just as it should     http   ourip 8081 api  returns the same stuff     http   ourhost_or_ip 8081 api   no trailing slash  redirects to the dashboard   to me it looks  a little bit like firefox is somehow loosing the trailing slash and gets the redirected page instead of the json during the api call 
not yet  other than it does seem to be specific to the makeup of the procedures in the failing script  trying to recreate the problem with anonymous code 
nope   
you are right it seems to be only a problem with rule34 paheal net  my guess would be that a wrong status code is more likely than a wrong content type  but checking the returned body content is probably the only way to be sure    nice app by the way   
i can reproduce it on my pixel 2 with rocket 3502
you cannot add an empty file  but you also can't add any other files you select at the same time  using multi select  either  this is problematic because then you have to go hunt down the one null file and delete it before uploading the rest of the files  can you make it so it just doesn't upload a null file  but uploads the rest of the files  and gives them a popup warning that says "x files were not uploaded because they were empty" but still lets the other files that aren't empty load in 
this was tested in single player originally so it doesn't seem to be a desync issue  just ran a test on our server  which is running the 1 11 2 version  and confirmed the behavior in that environment also

oh  sorry wrong issue number  comment edited  after debugging of testconcurrentconsistencyenforcement  i can say  this is same problem 
don't know if it would be compatible with our boot version and other third parties    basically  i believe  making read transactional may be enough  but as for me the idea with while true loop is not obvious  don't see when it could be helpful to execute same flow till it returns 0 executed actions     i may extract my postgresql cluster config and try it on minikube with very basic demo app for latest release to check  but can't say when i'll have enough free time to do that  may take a few days

yup  i did some tcpdump and saw some references to segment numbers that should be sealed   the current segment number is around  2400 and i saw some segment metrics reported for 641  for segment_write_bytes      screen shot 2017 08 31 at 2 07 32 pm  https   user images githubusercontent com 9335655 29935839 971bd7de 8e56 11e7 9c1a c2aa53218638 png   my understanding with the dropwizard metrics  it just sends whatever it has in memory as a gauge to the configured statsd endpoint   i'm assuming if pravega isn't actively removing those metrics  then they will continue to be sent on the interval   also note that the 65k points per second includes our downsampling points  writing data to lower precision   so its not all pravega traffic 
now i not get any npe  meanwhile i have a problem  in elastic search i got a very large dynamic data  so i can't create type mapping   can i read the elasticsearch result as raw json   the es mapping type is wrong sometime  example it's got "" where it's need a number  try to put the double value to long etc

i can confirm that the busy bar is correctly rendered in the latest snapshot   to be honest  it would be nice to be able to modify speed and movement direction through widget properties  but it's such a niche actor that it's not really necessary 
yes  i can confirm that this fixed the problem with the oregon rain sensor  thanks

oh yes  that's a much more plausible theory indeed   did you push out a new version to the play store recently  i don't know how i can tell whether an update has happened recently   there's a notification about 5 updates having been installed but all different ones   i have a 1 2mb backlog of adb logs  sadly first mention of k9 there is the exact crash above   i'm trying to remember whether this was the first time i tried to use k9 today but don't know  my mailserver doesn't seem to log logins so i can't find out there either

you should be able to use the sha1 hash of the filename quite safely   keep in mind git uses sha1 hashes for every object inside every commit and doesn't have an issue with collisions   http   www quora com what is the probability that two two commits of different git repositories have exact same sha hash
i don't have any extra information since i don't use this mod myself or actually play much mc at all atm  i've only seen it several times in nps files sent to me for analysis  the issues mentioned appear to be not just minor oversights but more in depth implementation issues  thus it's unlikely to be fixed  i quickly verified that issue part 1 is still there by looking at the source code   from experience a good guess for the cause of the redstone conduit problems would be having much less than vanilla's 1 loss block  which is required to reach a steady state from omnidirectional propagation quickly if the propagation algorithm works similar to vanilla's  low or no loss requires significant extra care  which is easy to get wrong as soon as there's a connection back to some vanilla redstone for example   this report may be the first of its kind due to the various issues being very difficult to track down to enderio although those performance problems are likely quite widespread  the spike heavy nature of the slowdowns combined with heavy inlining by the jvm makes it practically impossible to see in opis and difficult to spot in sampler while sampling normally  the lag spikes can usually be observed with sampler's spike trigger  assuming there's a problematic setup in the world  which i don't know the conditions for  it may be required to disable the jvm's inlining or even run in interpreter only mode to see more  which of course has significant influence on the unit under test

i mark the songs in 1 of 2 ways  1  from within ultrasonic main menu  i click on albums recently added  2  from within ultrasonic main menu  i click on songs starred   the syncing begins without a problem   everything will be alright  but every once in awhile  sometimes after exiting the app  sometimes out of the blue   i'll continue playing the songs in the playlist and then the music stops   i look at the playlist and see the playlist is still full  but the down arrow showing each file that was synced is no longer there     i verify the files are there by using root explorer and browsing to the file storage location 
ok i will try to write the test case today

after having some more time to test this  it does appear to be a number of boolean operators issue  not a number of queries issue  it was getting hung at a query  example  for about an hour  then it would hit a longer query that ksql could never get past    apurvam    there are no error messages  as i stated  i'm defining 'loading' as the "building ast" message  and ksql just stops printing anything  i never see the more common messages about rebalancing  etc as it executes the queries   i've created a minimal queries file that seems to exhibit this behavior

it seems to be there   maybe the issue is related to the whitespace in the path which somehow is incompatible with the way how bytebuddy looks up the java binary  another thing i noticed is that all these files are owned by admin  which makes sense since it is within   applications   maybe this is causing issues when running an app within intellij  permissions are not correctly escalated  thus bytebuddy is unable to find the binary     update    i did some experiment   i've copied the jdk in  tmp and changed the permissions to        admin pointed the project there and it works  then i  cp  a  the jdk with a space  pointed to it and get the error again  it seems to be related to the whitespace indeed

hey scott   yeah i guess a fix was the wrong word to use   i can't provide the exception until i get to work tomorrow   but what i can say is that getthreadlocalinstance   is never called   i noticed that method was there  but i wasn't sure if we were supposed to call that directly or not   as all we do is repeatedly call writeimage when we are writing out our billboards   i'll provide the stack trace tomorrow    jon  on mon  jun 24  2013 at 5 15 pm  scott hunter notifications github comwrote

 sapessi i can confirm that the workaround above works for me  you might want to use   in practice  the file name passed in to the method is not the path of an actual file  but the path of an http request  for static files this is unlikely to be the correct path of the file on disk  and for dynamic requests the file may not even exist  and the type detected may be used to route to the correct handler   this method is essentially saying  "given a hypothetical file xyz html  what would the mime type be based on the file extension "   requiring that we mark all paths in the application working directory as valid seems unnecessary and potentially a risk if the same security check is used in other places   my preference would be to keep the security check in place  but to isolate the file system  probecontenttype  to a known  non existent  path to allow the content type detection to work without custom security exceptions being needed   that's just my view of the problem  i am happy to leave it as is if you disagree

restarting the phone didn't help  i assume this would close all old syncthing instances   any idea  what the error code 11 is about  i would check the syncthing source  but i don't know what to look for  i never worked with go 
i like that idea      deprecate  artofillusion procedural module  this will provide a shortstop for any code that tries to use the fqpn  pushing us to use the new name    commit to a version where we _will_ remove the old code   4 0  which would give us some time to work out the implications    i might consider  artofillusion procedural pmodule  or  artofillusion procedural procmodule  if we wanted to continue to use the word  module   otherwise  i might go with  artofillusion procedural block  for both "block of functionality" and "building block" from the visual editor standpoint   i don't think it will be too hard  my test build only fussed about 20ish uses in the core code  though  i don't doubt there are probably a few more 
no swords involved on my side  neither on crafting any block nor equipped  will post crash log to woot  too

i was using wasync 1 0 0 beta which did not contain test cases master branch contains test cases however it seems the test cases make use of embedded nettosphere which is not my case i am using atmosphere runtime 1 0 7 on j2ee container jboss as 7 1 1  check org atmosphere cprasynchronousprocessor supportwebsocket   i am quite confident this is the root of the problem  i checked in detail with a debugger  it seems nobody has so far used atmosphere 1 0 7 runtime with websockets    
yes  sure  forgot that one
could anybody solve the issue

i haven't worked on open source projects and since the issue is not that difficult to fix  i'd prefer the existing team to fix it  regarding the spec  it is "jsr 311  jax rs  the javatm api for restful web services"  http   jcp org en jsr detail id 311   particularly sections  "3 2 fields and bean properties" and "3 3 2 parameters"  the constructor tried first  as it is now  seems to be the right approach  as this case is listed above the static methods in the section 3 2  1  primitive types  2  types that have a constructor that accepts a single string argument  3  types that have a static method named valueof or fromstring with a single string argument    that return an instance of the type  if both methods are present then valueof must be used unless    the type is an enum in which case fromstring must be used  4  list t   set t   or sortedset t   where t satisfies 2 or 3 above   the sections also specify the way exceptions thrown by the "factory methods" should be handled  probably  corretness of implementation of this aspect should be verified as well

 marco jacob can you explain once again    i guess you deleted a cache which already had a note  then you added it again and the note is still there  that sound perfectly fine as long as you either had a local note and saved the cache again while it is still held in cachecache or you had a note on gc com and downloaded it again 
yes  the enchant effect works  i probably should have removed that for this issue  i just had it on my test skript 
i saw that forum post right after my post  wweich  my phone is a lg g5  which has a 64 bit processor  so i guess the change in how the app is compiled is the reason why i'm having problem 
i know okhttp 4 has been rewritten in kotlin  so not sure what to suggest here   personally  i would like okhttp classes that are apis  such as  headers   to explicitly not have kotlin classes in method signatures  class inheritance  type parameters  etc  that would ensure maximum usability from java 11 + jpms  as the only dependencies an application would need to require in  module info java  would be java only ones   i don't think it's a kotlin issue as they need to remain java 6 compatible and such  so for kotlin jpms modules are far far away   however  removing  implements iterable kotlin pair   may be an incompatible change  so i raised this issue just as a heads up  as there is an easy workaround to iterate over  headers    trying to iterate over  headers  using  iterable  would not even compile with java 11 + jpms  so it's a hard error  but as i said easily workaroundable with a small code change  i only found this example in my usage of okhttp  but it may be possible that there are other cases where there is no work around

no problem  it's not a critical issue for me   just wanted to make you aware of it   i have a lg g3 d855 with cm 13 nightly 2016 02 05  strangely it didn't happen the last 2 3 days  so it looks like even i can't reproduce it reliably any more  afaik doze mode shouldn't even activate when the device is plugged in  so maybe this is an android cm device bug   i'll experiment the next few days with  testing your app with doze  http   developer android com training monitoring device state doze standby html#testing_doze   maybe something comes up  i just tried it for a few minutes   the alarm was ignored when idle  as expected    but logging resumed once the device came out of idle   let me know if i can help you in any other way 
i confirm this is fixed in rc3 
you can do the same thing in your interceptor by calling  system nanotime

 solohsu this is the log which i was success bootup after reflash ed xposed and riru  should the implementation be more inefficiency to detect old and new version  apk  while checking modules enabled from module list 
the headless flag was intended to allow the plugin to run without issue on headless jvms for docker   but a user might have some plugin that requires to have headless false even in non gui mode   so i think previous behavior should be restored   thanks
i am fine with anything that does not require infrastructure changes  if you think it can work  go for it 
ideally we want devs to use stuff only from php openapi jar  but it's quite incomplete yet  moving stuff to public api  adding docs  publishing sources is what i do atm  on tue  15 nov 2016  12 11 vladimir reznichenko  notifications github com wrote 
i just tested a little bit and i think i found out what exactly is causing the problem  i think  it's combining  linedatasets  with at least one  linedataset  that does not have any entries    as soon as i add a  linedataset  that does not have any entry  the graph throws an exception     please tell me if this info let's you recreate the problem  otherwise i will offer a complete example   
i was working with marklogic 9 and i think datahub v4 0 3  though now i use mlcp and ml gradle directly without datahub  for database configurations that require a database restart timeout you can try to deploy ml config root task servers taskserver json with  "threads"  "32"   for token replacement you can use a token in a module  e g  if mlcontentdatabasename eds nosql rdl property is in gradle properties then use "  mlcontentdatabasename  " in a modules xqy module  deploy it  and observe that the token isn't replaced  for mlloadmodules mlreloadmodules only works properly with deployments from scratch  just deploy from scratch  i e  with a blank marklogic data folder   then change a module  remove a different module  and add a new module  and rename an existing module  then run mlloadmodules mlreloadmodules and observe the results  ml gradle by itself behaves properly in all these cases  datahub does not 
thank you for quick response  i will try your workaround suggestions 
 kasper piskorski you should wrap transactions in an auto closable  try     block so that when the test fails  it remembers to close the transaction  this doesn't solve the root cause of this issue  but it helps to not cause other tests to fail due to transaction clashes   i've made this change in my fork  in case this change hasn't got into master by the time you work on this  you can see  and pull it  here  https   github com haikalpribadi grakn blob refactor test integration test graql reasoner atomic query atomicqueryunificationit java
i did not see this every time the activity was destroyed  i do believe it is a race condition   unfortunately  i am pressed for time and just reverted to the old version of glide i was using 
just tested this issue and it is  in fact  not reproducible 
 sbordet  by using a fileinputstream which requires a file  you lose one of the primary features of the path api    that of filesystem encapsulation  if you have all of your content on the default filesystem  where the file version of a file and the path version of the file happen to be equivalent in terms of the actual file content to be read  it may not manifest as a bug  once you try to use a path on anything besides the default filesystem  the benefit of using a pathresource goes away   my interpretation for pathresource was that it was originally intended to provide a _path_ version of the same type of resource as a fileresource  while staying in the safe zone of the path abstraction   paths all know what filesystem they belong to  and path and filesystem implementations are intended to be provide a simple and uniform way of navigating relatively or absolutely within a filesystem  thus all buffers  channels  etc are delegated in some way to the filesystem which a path is part of  the older file abstraction has no such capability  which is part of the reason that the path system was derived in the first place   before the bugfix  the getinputstream method delegated to the underlying filesystem for the path in the pathresource  after the bugfix  it allowed a jailbreak by converting the path name to a string and then wrapping it in a file object  which has no concept of what filesystem the original path came from

i solved it on my side by filtering away any "remote php webdav" from the server url  however  my point with this bug report is that the library should not crash with a null pointer exception if such a case happens   i made the following change in  createfolderremoteoperation                 if   result issuccess      mcreatefullpath                         remoteoperationresult resultcode conflict    result getcode                       result   createparentfolder fileutils getparentpath mremotepath   client                    if  result issuccess                           result   createfolder client         second  and last  try     +     +            if   mremotepath equals " "         +                result   createparentfolder fileutils getparentpath mremotepath   client       +                if  result issuccess          +                    result   createfolder client         second  and last  try     +                                                     i e  avoid trying to get the parent of the root folder and return an error message instead  i can send you a pr for this  but since it's only one line to insert  you may want to simply do this yourself  or you may want to handle it in another way  whatever  just make sure there is no hard crash with wrong user input    
 kumy i just try it  uncheck gkm  and try to reload related cache  i always got an empty inventory   
yeah this is fixed
ok  since noone can replicate this  i'll close it with unverified  i'll reopen if i can reproduce it 
it does indeed   i was just about to submit a pull request recommending subprocess call   
opened https   javafx jira kenai com browse rt 40639 but it was resolved since it utilized non public interfaces in the simplified repro code  it does link to two other issues which are both marked fixed but look very similar in nature to this stack trace 
i still seem to get this issue occasionally  and i believe this is more due to us using multiple repositories   in the instance i had this morning  a code review i was looking at had a parent commit that was not in my local repository  so the object references didn't exist   if i manually did a fetch from gerrit then the plugin worked   when the gerrit intellij plugin does a fetch from gerrit as you click thru reviews  is that fetching directly into my local repository or just fetching in memory  i suspect something like the later

i posted pr #1810 for review on my solution to this   i did the work in the symlink action  and added tests to that effect   additionally specifying the includepath domain to the action  cleaning up anything that was not in the manifest to be symlinked 
it is under my fork of teclaaccess under the sep branch  the error occurs in the check for whether sep is running in teclaprefs java  line 765   770   here's the link to the repo  https   github com k22mak teclaaccess tree sep
yes i did   but i am missing deeper knowlledge on what a autoreconfig does  i need help if the default build instructions from libpostal do not work within the preset setup  i see forgot to push my latest state to the branch yesterday

what i don’t understand in this is that it runs perfectly well in boot 1 0 2 release  it also runs on boot 1 1 1 release but only if i manually override the version of the spring boot maven plugin to 1 0 2 release   when i compare the two jar files  i only notice a difference in the loader classes  org springframework boot loader   the rest of the jars is identical

yes  add one more field please to mock    that should trigger it   as far as i understand   annotationinjectfieldsearcher findfield  will return a field only if the target class has only one field with that specific annotation   it's a bit weird that it +only+ looks for the annotation anyway  it should probably use the mock type too  or  actually  just the mock type  as we already know that the mock metadata comes from a scanner that just scanned the target class and extracted that metadata from it 
thank you for your quick response  pete  today morning i tried to provoke this error with different classifiers  the error occured with 'random trees'  'artificial neural network' and 'logistic regression'  i think the more settings i change  the more likely the error will occur   but i couldn't figure out if a single setting is the reason   with my usual approach i train the pixel classifier on a project training image  if i could successfully save the classifier and load it for another image in the project  i get the following error messages for ann and knn   ann classifier    err_ann  https   user images githubusercontent com 59967282 73450688 34d01a00 4366 11ea 9c8f 7e08251c6261 png   knn classifier    err_knn  https   user images githubusercontent com 59967282 73450694 37cb0a80 4366 11ea 98f8 17df5cefcf52 png

best way to reproduce is to upload an image with the app  then move it on commons  and then view it in the app after the move is complete 
well i thought i already did both  but when i press ok to submit the support information the box disappears without any further notice  so i don't really know what happens then 
actually my video card is a amd radeon® hd 6370  512mb ddr3 vram     as for dumps  in the game folder after the problem there are files like this http   pastebin com 6yu4v70f  what happens is that during the creation of the world  the loading bars stop loading  the whole computer freezes and after about 20 seconds the terasology window closes and it shows up a message  i think  from the jvm that says it cannot send a report  to its developers   because there's not enough memory to do it   if there's some kind of test i can do  or if it's possible to debug the program  i'm glad to help
i tested it too  the problem still exists 
reg dejavu  we had to do 0 5 1 just for osx  it was 0 5 0 with 1  maybe 2  cherry picks   if yosemite will be dropped in 3 months  we can also ignore 3  of homebrew users  unclear how many if any are using bazel  and publish homebrew recipe only for el capitan and further  https   github com homebrew homebrew core pull 15003#issuecomment 311401027

urlconnection works for local uris as well as http urls  some institutional apis return a pdf file instead of a link to a pdf  generalising mimetypedetector eases writing custom fetchers a bit 
we are using 4 1 0 rc10  together with oxalis 4 0 4   we may try the released 4 1 0 of the plugin if you think that will make a difference   we have so far not noticed anything in the log  apart from the aforementioned log statements from dummyimpl and assertionbuilderregistryimpl  what we suspect  though  is that it might be necessary to have had traffic on both as2 and as4 for the problem to appear 
i tried it with yesterday  and also  jvasileff   but let me try again right now
 olegz i updated the sample to add a field bean but the application still fails to start up    if you comment out the scs dependencies in the sample and run the app  it will start up   https   github com walliee implicit function binder issue blob 222baa4f9656197d5d41670ace147e377e4a5131 pom xml#l24 l32  i think the issue is that  contextfunctioncatalogautoconfiguration   during  functioncatalog  construction   tries to initialize all function supplier consumer bean definitions it can possibly find and the  simpleinstantiationstrategy  tries to do so using a no args constructor 
hi david   ok  several hundred mb definitely sounds big  i don't have an upload server to post files to  but other users have used http   www dropbox com to provide me with larger files  http   www fileconvoy com index php would be an alternative without the need to install anything  can you use one of those two possibilities   regards  jörg
this message comes from the owncloud client app  its in german "ein unbekannter fehler ist aufgetreten " directly after i've entered the url    nothing is beeing logged    when i enter the url with http instead of https  it works

unfortunatly  i can't remember ever using a mod that caused similar problems  i played around with ruins and placemod but if i remember correctly  ruins doesn't add stuff to villages and placemod only spawned its own villages using its own logic    but thanks for looking into it 
no  however that's a good thing  the new behavior is the correct behavior  it was actually wrong in 2 5 0  i mainly created this issue to track the change in case someone else comes across this behavior   that commit does however fix https   github com springfox springfox issues 1525

actually i already tried it on both 1 5 1 and 1 5 0    it works on 1 4 4 tho  not sure if it will be of any help  but i'm picking pretty big  jpg photos over 3 5mb  and it didn't work for any of this photos 
nope  it seems to be related to magnet bauble  i use thaumcraft which relies on bauble too if i remember correctly  i don't know if that's the cause 
it seems that the option "deleted" still isn't working  but "moved to app folder" is  also the moved files are shown in gallery now 
gnome  and the de is gala  elementaryos 
it refers to an issue where the content provider returned by google photos was not working correctly    misaochan might know about it 
when i use    report unsupported elements at runtime  with    language js  i get the exact same output as shown above  without using    language js  the result is also the same  the image is created without warnings  but the js script engine is not found at runtime 
thanks for the reply  and adding the jvm label  i really wasn't sure where to put this     i now changed my default java configuration to  java 8 openjdk amd64  but the issue still persists  exactly as before 
i'm using 1 2 1335 1  unfortunately i am not the sys admin so i can't update the version myself    if all that is required is a version bump  i'll wait till the preview is released and then request the upgrade  i guess we can close the issue if its fixed in the preview version 
it still exists on one of my local machine  but the program can run fine with this error  i will close this for now 
this happend after dbeaver restart  im not opening hude number of gui resources  this is latest eclipse ptd  with few plugins  also i have try to add more memory in eclipse ini    2gb   if i go to one table  got error  then go to another table   then error not appears  when clicking on er diagram  just light gray background displayed in tab   when installing dbeaver  i miss installing gef and draw2k  then add update site for gef and installed both  latest versions  i guess it was possible without adding update site  just unable to find them in list of all packages and categories for oxygen 2
hi  manoelcampos  you are right  by decreasing the length of the cloudlet or increasing the scheduling interval the problem disappears  i have been using the scheduling interval of 300 seconds in order to match planet lab utilization traces  but i guess my cloudlet's length was way too large   i will probably change the utilizationmodelplanetlab to get a random trace from the resources folder whenever this exception is raised   thank you

yes  i am running a configuration with multiple "workhorses"  "coordinators" and "load balancers"  the error message above is seen in the "workhorse" log  then i also see this error message in the "coordinator"    2013 11 23 05 38 50 052  warn   cluster action shard        coordinator 1   indexname  10  received shard failed for  indexname  10   node 1 ipub6 tt czl9umnwqla   relocating  gk2uzwmospoybypfjoqwiq    r   s relocating   indexuuid  pbchvdiwqaky eysrmgxrw   reason  failed to perform  deletebyquery shard  on replica  message  remotetransportexception  thunderbolt  inet  192 168 1 1 9300   deletebyquery shard replica    nested  nullpointerexception      it also appears that it crashes the workhorse node  but i'm still trying to reproduce this

i'm sorry but i dont know which android method to start debug with  could you tell me the code related to this function so i could use android studio to see the values come out 
ok my bad  but the 2 issues are unrelated  yes test mail is not getting sent and it is an issue and so is this error showing up in logs but the action of sending test mail does not result in these errors showing up in the logs  sorry for the confusion 
yes  it could be a development build  i unfortunately only have the jar file named v2 0 0 with no further info  but it contains the uritemplateresolver class which could be used for reverse matching templates  there seems to have been a cleanup in the newer versions but i can't seem to find how to do the reverse matching in the new version 
i guess it's running in the background  but the icon never appears in the taskbar like it's supposed to 
it is a new installation of buildcraft addition and eureka  so after i installed the latest versions  i also tried in a new world and it did the same 
this is on the grid view  and only on 'text' and 'longtext' data type columns 
hi  sorry again for the late response  it is possible that the problem was indeed the opml  file     i'm attaching it here  with a few modifications in the titles and urls of the feeds      backup opml zip  https   github com crazyhitty munch files 190730 backup opml zip 
hi  roytmana  thanks a lot for your feedback    what you called "scrambled highlighting" has been solved     i wonder if you are seeing a regression or a problem that's always been there  sounds weird that you say the difference is dramatic but you can't reproduce it  it might depend either on your queries or your analysis chain  would be great if you can open another issue with some examples of what doesn't work 
many of the calls to  increasestoredenergyunits  that i can see will all check the eu capacity  and only increase by the amount it can hold  the other ones are for things like the magic energy absorber  which is probably fine because it eats an enchantment or something and produces a ton of energy all at once

there is no way to find out the console url programmatically  we really tried hard  and there is none  for minishift and other similar installations you can try to guess  but it completely fails on oso and other larger cluster installation  we could start to probe certain known patterns  but it will never be perfect as long as openshift doesn't offer the console url via api  i opened an  issue  https   github com openshift origin issues 20447  for this  but i doubt this will ever happen soon   we had this issue also for 7 0 and we decided  that from the two options we had  to make the console url the only mandatory argument for the user to provide or just don't render the link when the url is not given  we prefer the "don't render the link" as it's a minor feature which would be not available then  and which btw doesn't work all the time anyway  even when the console url is given   so we didn't want to go from "parameterless installation" to "force the user to find out the console url before he can install syndesis"   as said  this was the decision for 7 0 and as i haven't heard that we changed our mind since then  i consider it a bug that the link is rendered when the console url is not provided  so an empty string in the configmap 
sorry  this was fixed in official 0 7 
purging dhcpcd5 helps with this issue  what i also noticed outside of test net eth0 006 scope is that search domain is neither added to   etc resolv conf  nor stored in kura configuration   and while we are at it  configuration   there are a few configuration parameters values of which are not trimmed  namely  net interface eth0 driver  net interface wlan0 firmware version  net interface wlan0 wifi capabilities  net interface wlan0 driver  net interface wlan0 driver version

good point  although could there be a feature to unbind a key from a car  while keeping the owner of the car saved   so that you could rebind it  and so that when you unbind it  nobody can run up to the car and claim it as their own 
i find the reason now  it's quite weird  my hive version is hive 0 13 1 cdh5 3 0 follow the steps can generate the wrong result   1  create an orc table in presto        create table employees_orc as select    from employees   2  insert overwrite this orc table in hive       insert overwrite table employees_orc select    from employees   3  query in presto       select    from employees_orc where hire_date   date '2000 01 28'   if i omit step  2   then the result is correct  it seems to be caused by hive orc write   the value that are getting set into the tuple domains is 10984  marker type class java lang long  value 10984  bound exactly 
internal storage and it also happens if no nc is installed  so definitiv a bug of lineageos camera app 
yes i was using the official 5 5 2 version  same i couldn't get a round to start properly

the behaviour with a saddle is different   the horse is now mush faster on the client than on the server   we see ourselves outstrip the particles and move very fast 
it does happen every time  you did change the behavior of the "next" button  though  so that might have fixed it  i'll test again with the next beta  so leave the issue open for now — i'll close it if it's gone

 foghina  the device crashed is asus t00j  since the api of the fresco are different between 1 3 0 and 1 5  and our project originally use 1 3 0  i do not try to upgrade to latest version   i tried to rebuild the 1 3 0 by adding the flags ' mstackrealign  mincoming stack boundary 4'  but the output library libstatic webp so has nothing different in the size and the function entry  and the app still crashed when using that library  i guess that may be not the esp disalignment leaded to crash

i'd like to make it so that only x mob can spawn in y biome  this would require players to travel around and gather specific materials versus just staying in one static location   the "bug" is that no mobs spawn at all  except the ender dragon and bats   here's a small "mod pack" that has all the required  https   www dropbox com s 8fi5ddbzm42yc1n mobtest tar gz dl 0

that's a solid idea  definitely worth pursuing  wouldn't solve the issue i'm facing specifically  but it's a very fringe case and not likely to be an issue for anyone else  hence the super low priority   the duplicate calls in my scenario are technically across multiple systems  rather than just multiple sites    i could add all of the conventional channels into the same system in the config  but i'm not sure how it would behave since the individual sites know nothing of each other    e g  if you had two calls start simultaneously on different channels sites that weren't actually patched  but both had a tgid of '0001'   it's a tough problem to solve  and i wouldn't want you to get bogged down solving a problem that likely only affects me  so i'd say absolutely go with the more logical solution to duplicate calls  would be a quicker win and would improve the app for a lot more people 
yes i did  exactly what the guide says  but still getting these errors 
 ennosigaeon we have to release a new version of the platform asap  so we decided to move the current development into the   tmp develop   https   github com hobbit project platform tree   branch  fix the most important bugs and release the next version    moving on in this branch shouldn't make it more complicated for you to delete the faulty commits in develop  right

i have windows 10  no  i don't use remote terminal  it's locally  before open properties tab  you must resize dbeaver to small window and then open properties with columns to see bug 
so making a loosely coupled design  not perfect though  hard wired again so that it integrates better in the old fashioned design  i am a bit hesitant about that    actually we are talking about wps   4 0   right  don't know about resources available for discussing current and future architecture and how to wire components and  probably more important  for implementing whole stuff   do we have a refactor strategy available  at least listing all core components which will have to be refactored  is  iceland  https   github com 52north iceland  the only next step  seems to be a bit fuzzy  at least for me  what consequences this will have too 
it should change the brightness  just like on off should turn the light on and off 
it's very simple to reproduce  and in doing so  i find that the problem becomes even more fantastic  in the demo project  there are two sections of keystore configuration in bootstrap properties  as follows   #encrypt key store alias config server #encrypt key store password test123 #encrypt key store secret test123   encrypt key store alias mytestkey encrypt key store password letmein encrypt key store secret changeme  pointing to two keystore files  server jks from the generated command given on the document  as follows    when started with this configuration  the exception did not appear and it appears to have been loaded   so i made minor modifications to the generated command above  and generated config server keystore  the command is as follows    when you start using the config server keystore configuration  an exception appears above   i don't know the difference  maybe the name   zip file of demo project   demo zip  https   github com spring cloud spring cloud config files 2555818 demo zip

the problem still exists in 2 2 10  also it seems that in 2 2 x the cluster strategy is generally set to "round robin"  shouldn't a distributed setup always use "local" 
jsse assumes that there is only one privatekeyentry in the keystore that is used to initialize the  x509extendedkeymanager   or that we are only interested in the first entry   see https   github com frohoff jdk8u jdk blob da0da73ab82ed714dc5be94acd2f0d00fbdfe2e9 src share classes sun security ssl sunx509keymanagerimpl java#l50   if we were to support keystores that contain multiple privatekeyentry and the possibility to select the appropriate alias to use via configuration  ie  xpack ssl keystore key_alias    then we'd have to implement our own keymanager extending  x509extendedkeymanager  and implement the  chooseserveralias    method accordingly  unfortunately we cannot do that as  as  we figured out during the fips effort  https   github com elastic elasticsearch pull 30509    we cannot use keymanagers that extend the sunjsse ones  http   hg openjdk java net jdk8 jdk8 jdk file 687fd7c7986d src share classes sun security ssl sslcontextimpl java#l152   since we can only use one pkcs#11  keystore per provider with and the keystore can only contain one entry  we can effectively use only one key throughout our configuration    an alternative to the above is to support multiple security providers  configured in the java security properties and use a different one for each   keymanager keystore key   that needs to be used in a configuration  this will require the introduction of an optional configuration setting that can be used wherever a certificate key or a keystore can be configured in order to denote the provider id to use for the  keymanagerfactory   we should probably limit this to be allowed only when  pkcs#11  keystores tokens are in use and also verify that a provider id is valid when we parse the newly introduced setting's value

thanks     i made the change to annotations locally   but it didn't help  i took your pr and built  but the same issue   my environment is     macos    master  up to date as of now     java 11    i launch 3 platforms   ui as per coco pharma environment    i run through server configuration   server start notebooks  then asset management  this creates some assets and puts a variety of servers into a cohort     the error here occurs after login to the ui   note that without the fix i made for #2432  now merged to master  in queue for release 1 3  asset catalog omas was not working at all   and hence nor would asset search in the ui  with that fix at least the ui works  and searches are successful  so it's just a warning error at login time   i will attach the error  but my simpler test case was just using httpie  or use curl

thanks for the clarification   you can click change the state when it becomes "disabled" or "temporarily disabled"  but not "permanently disabled"  the state is disabled  and not clickable  see below screenshot     img width "807" alt "dump_2018 12 30_23 11 07" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 359918 50551999 80f3eb00 0c8a 11e9 91cf 515217568c43 png"    img width "557" alt "dump_2018 12 30_23 27 13" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 359918 50552001 86513580 0c8a 11e9 9037 27dbd42d581c png"   i'm no bootstrap expert  but the button seems to be disabled via code     happens in both index view list  and when trying to edit a specific indexer 
good call  i just noticed it's universal  you can close this i suppose  must be something with omnirom
unfortunatly this would mean that we enable the workaround in our production environment since we cannot reproduce this issue on our local devices  and i think we should avoid this  see_no_evil    but we could try patching the renderer and add the mentioned devices to try if this reduces this failure

hi  looking in eclipse installation details the spotbugs version seems to be    spotbugs	3 1 2 r201802250230 59118d9	com github spotbugs plugin eclipse feature group	spotbugs project  i configured my workspace to use compiler level 1 8 only across all projects  the problem occurrs even when trying to scan an empty new project  tested with workspace settings and with manual "java 10" level settings     okay  i installed the latest version from https   spotbugs github io eclipse  now and that seems to work  i hadn't realized that 3 1 2 wasn't the most recent version  which i had obtained from the marketplace  so the issue should rather be  update the marketplace version

i've tried  but i can't even compile the code  it said there is missing some dependencies   
sorry  i may not have made myself clear  i mean i have a springcloud project  and  i remove the jersey dependencies  and i want to change the status of my project in eureka from  up  to  out_of_service   so i sent a post request to change it  like this   curl  x post  h "content type  application json"  d 'out_of_service' 'http   127 0 0 1 9999 service registry instance status'  in other project  it work  but in this project that removed the jersey dependencies  it doesn't work  the status is still  up  in eureka  so i analyzing code try to find the answer  and i find the rest api actually invoke other rest api by eureka server provided  instanceresource class in eureka core jar   so i want to reconfirm that is it a bug or i am using it the wrong way？  thanks

to yoh there canze  yesterday   yes  pulling into fesch  no  i haven't dared doing that to be honest 
hrm  i thought there were more  but it looks like it's just the closure compiler that doesn't really need reflection   all of the other tools  routes  twirl and play run  have two or more versions they support and rely on reflection   it would be ugly  but one way to deal with this would be to split out the version specific tool code into a separate subproject and have compileonly dependencies on specific versions   so you'd have a routes 2 3 and a routes 2 4 subproject that contains the version specific implementations of routescompileradapterv23x and routescompileradapterv24x   you'd avoid the reflection that way

actually application is 10 lines long  however our core library which includes operating system api produces much of the code because of a task container created for each application before running it  api is huge 100s of classes  system requires a single application file  so we embed teavm runtime also to the code   here is a figure for 10 lines of application   not 3  almost 4 times larger  gwt    220k teavm    850k  without minify 2 3m   i have a teapot demo for gwt which is a pretty good size application  gwt produces 330k for it  this includes images in the code  around 20k   i haven't compiled it with teavm yet  one thing may be the string concatenation that produces quite a lot of code    unfortunately  library is huge  and i cant release it to public at the moment  lets get the bugs settled and make things running on our end first  i will work with you on the reasons of the huge file size  you may also supply a maven configuration property for also compressing the output  the generated files would be myapp js and myapp js gz  that would help a lot

had the same idea as stalep  but not only gradle itself is a problem  when importing a gradle project into intellij or eclipse  the output paths of gradle and the ide are not shared  because gradle wants no shared paths  because that destroys correct up to date recognition   so  if you want to start the test from your ide  it still will not work  eclipse and intellij  have default output paths  but can be reconfigured to other paths  so i would suggest   on the one hand the ability to recognize the default intellij   projectroot out production classes  and  projectroot out test classes   and eclipse  only one output path  projectroot bin   output paths should be added  and on the other hand some kind of additional output path configuration for non default output paths may be useful

yes  roughly  however this issue while related i think more focuses on the lack of support for android app bundle in either fresco or soloader and splitting binaries that way   i could be mistaken  but this issue is reproducible on every device i've tested  not just select brands   and as per fresco shipping guides  there is no note of the use case of shipping via android app bundles  and we can't use the  splits  key as when you use  bundle  the  splits  key is ignored   on tue  11 dec 2018  06 40 kimichiu   notifications github com  wrote

yes  i already made the change yesterday from a test artifact to a build artifact that that resolved the issue  however  there is no out of memory issue on the logs 
there is now log when connect to db  still no stacktrace   yes  i run it in console  plocal 
 justinedelson looks like this is the culprit  including the pre minified  angular min js  in the client lib seems to resolve the compilation issue  but there are still some other issues going on  qe works but fiddle still doesn't  also  it looks like html library minification breaks ace editor just like version clientlibs does  can't remember if you noticed it on the versioning or both  
sorry  i forgot the most important thing and confused dd with dw yesterday  this is the example i wanted to show you     miau in  push miau  should be replaced by a 32 bit address  right  but jasmin complains that the operand is too short  "error  operand must be at least two bytes large"    if i insert a dword before miau  like  push dword miau   it works  shouldn't it also work without the dword thing

yes teleport anywhere  then move about 10 16 steps away from your current location using whatever randomly generated seed the world gave you  the crash isn't 100  guaranteed to happen  but when it does  you'll usually crash 1 3 more times upon logging back in and trying to move forward new crash log with only tfc installed  https   pastebin com kdmxjb2i 2nd crash log upon logging back in and attempting to move forward 1 block  https   pastebin com hycla6ef
my use case is actually using bitcoinj to create a transaction and broadcast it through a blockexplorer api like blockchain info  i saw that the api returned an error and i tried to send it through bitcoin core and i found that it was bitcoin core that was rejecting the transaction  i'm on bitcoinj version 0 14 3  and bitcoin core version 0 12 1   as for the dummy key   i just put "key1" and "key2" as a dummy key because the real keys actually hold real bitcoins so i don't want to include it in my post  in my actual code i do create the transaction with the real base58 private key

so adding that mutex does make the problem more rare but i could still get it to happen by the about 30th run when i had 3 requests happen at the same millisecond   i'll do some more poking   edit  could not repeat this anymore despite how long i ran the test  might have been some fluke thing related to how i created the mutex at that time  the attached pr 884 seems to fix this completely 
they are  javax naming  classes  adding    so it looks like the issues are slightly different  but similar 
it's still the same in 1 2 alpha  but i doubt it's primitive mobs fault cause when i tried the imprisonment tool from industrial forgoing  it was working just fine

 yegor256 thanks for explanation about new ticket  it's a bit more clear now  to the exclusion question  3rd option is good choice  except one thing   transforming regexp from filepath to full classname is very unstable  example 1  input     src main java com qulice maven checkmojo  output    com qulice maven checkmojo  simple enough but how to cut prefix   src main java     example 2  input         messages java  output         messages  and so on      don't think we need such a complexity in our code  to reduce it we may decide to specify exclusions for findbugs as they are for findbugs   per class patterns  http   findbugs sourceforge net manual filter html   tan it would be simple to create native findbugs config file using than exclusions  have i missed something 
oh really  i didn't dig any further  so i wasn't aware of this  someone else in discord was mentioning that they didn't want tickets overwriting their train properties  so i thought this wasn't a thing yet 
 2016 11 13 13 16 41 zip  https   github com simracingapps simracingapps files 587953 2016 11 13 13 16 41 zip  i tried both the one from the broadcaster spotter camera app and the individual carselector camera widget  each time  the console did register the command to change car  but the sim did not respond to it   i also tried moving the logging up to finest  but there were no additional messages printed at the time   edit  actually  i have a correction to this now  it isn't that the widget isn't working at all  it's that it isn't working correctly  i did additional testing and did a screen capture of what i was seeing   uploading 2016 11 13 13 16 41 zip…     based on the log messages and what the screen recording is showing  it appears the code is confusing car number  the number on the car and on the app  with the car's actual sim based id  from the attached video  for example  i click to change to car number 13  but it instead switches me to car number 26  it does this for a few other examples as well  which are included in the video  there are also several cases where attempting to switch to a higher numbered car simply does not do anything   my guess is that the code has essentially transposed carxid with car number in the camera code  the reference car updates correctly when using broadcaster spotter camera  for example

i don't know  happens in ftb beyond 1 8 1  mc 1 10 2

i'm also thinking it is most likely a threading issue  i've just mentioned those phone models because those the phones i'm currently working with  this issue happened on other models too  one lg for sure   so  no  i think there's no reason to believe that this issue happens only on mentioned phones  i will continue to look to find a solution now when i know that  null  is not on purpose  by the way  the library is great

you were right  this is a duplicate of #1650  session is not working properly  sometimes it works other times not and i think i found the reason   start a fresh spigot 1 8 8 server with only the authme plugin  https   i gyazo com e432cf56645ccd3cb66730b7e00f6939 png https   i gyazo com 3cc11a79246df7be3087f3ad877ec691 png  spigot version  git spigot 21fe707 e1ebe52  mc  1 8 8   implementing api version 1 8 8 r0 1 snapshot  authme version  authmereloaded v5 5 0 snapshot  build  2153  server is in offline mode   only i change 3 settings in config yml     for testing   enter with nick  md_5 and sessions work fine  enter with nick  xephi and sessions don't work   md_5 it has lowercase only  xephi has a capital letter  session only seems to work well with nicks that are written in lowercase  authme saves the nicknames in lowercase only  that is why the session never corresponds 
i do have a retina display   scale was set to 1 1 
no  they are totally different  beside that they both are subclasses of component of course     it might be related to the usage of "hasparameter"  but not sure  didn't had time to check that

 jgrandja would be happy to provide the pr   do you think it is of any value  if i also provide a pr with an optional facility that allows to limit the amount of  oauth2authorizationrequest s for a single session  this could be an additional session attribute backed by a size limited  linkedhashmap  containing the  state  values as keys and an empty object as value  this would have the benefit that existing sessions can be de serialized    something like

 abdurahmanadilovic  thanks for pointing the article  i've heard about such issue previously  but it looks like it's not the case because the issue happens on armv7 and armv8 devices too  for example here are some from top  samsung sm j200g  arm v7  samsung sm j210f   arm v7  samsung sm g610f  arm v8  micromax q402+  arm v7  micromax q409 xiaomi mi max xiaomi redmi note 4  and other phones from these manufacturers  motorola  lenovo     here is an updated screenshot with manufacturers  https   ibb co ngwk9f   greenrobot team  i've checked the release build  it contains all 4 variants that you've mentioned  we use android app bundles to ship the build  i'll recheck the config too    however  not all the users on that phones have this problem  we have much more of them who don't crash  if the problem would be in the way how we configure a build  all of them should start crashing  shouldn't they    and we have some test devices that are in the list of models experiencing crashes but we don't have that issue  as i remember  we got such logs from our tester only once  but reinstallation helped in that case  so we couldn't check what actually happened 
i'm not sure  i hadn't touched any of them in forever  and they just started doing that  i have a lot of mods running so i thought maybe somehow my auto crucibles was messing it up  but idk  stone barrels seem to work fine still  but if i try placing milk in any of them to make slime  instant crash 
maithem  there is no single test case  it's all random chance in a race  as far as i can tell  it's easy to generate the needed load  using qc   qc is currently using all  10+  i forget the count  api functions in the smrmap  i could try to reduce the api range if there is a smaller fraction of the ops that can still trigger it  and also using some printf   to see how many concurrent updates to the map are necessary    scott

attached is a simple test   it includes source code and jar in target subdir   how to perform the test  1  switch simple mode to off in paper ui 2  install binding and create a thing for it in the paper ui       during initialization  thing will create one channel type  called static channel type  spawn a thread and return from initialization         every 10 seconds the thread will create a static channel with random name id  using the type id created during intialization  before that  it will remove the previous static channel  if exists        additionally  the thread will also create a new channel type id called dynamic channel and a dynamic channel  using the just created id  and random name id for channel type and channel   before that  it will remove previous dynamic channel type and channel  if exist        after first creation of the two channels  it will set thing state to online 3  go to thing in the ui and unfold channels  there will be two channels updated every 10 seconds  ui reflects the updates in the channels very well  4  just after the channels are updated  click on the icon to unfold items and click on the plus sign to add a new item to the channel       it will work for static channel  since its channel type was created once during thing initialization       it will not work for dynamic channel  since its channel type was created 10 seconds ago  when ui was already open  it will throw js exception in the browser where it can't find the type in scope   of course  such exact situation will not happen in the reality  but similar one happens   when user works on his her setup and changes remote device configuration  at the same time having browser with paper ui open  the conditions needed to happen here is having browser open when channel type changes  in case of my real binding  this happens  when changing configuration of the remote device  it causes reconfiguration of the thing  if i keep browser open at the same time  i will need to refresh it in order to be able to add items   since channel changes are perfectly dynamically reflected in the ui  i thought it should also work for channel types    org openhab binding test1 tar gz  https   github com eclipse smarthome files 1068876 org openhab binding test1 tar gz   thanks pawel

the solution to problem  when the vertex types of an edge are detected to be different  then validate that directed    true  else throws error    this will ensure consistent representation without flipping around different types   ### update  this was not the solution

please ignore my comment regarding  onapplicationready    i checked it again and it works well   regarding   postconstruct   i disagree that this is consistent behaviour  developers expect that once a bean is initialized  all its dependent beans are initialized  flyway is not a piece of application code   it is an infrastructure tool that helps initialize the database   i don't see a use case where you want to use the _old_ schema version in a   postconstruct  and then have flyway run and change your schema

yes please include in maintenance  thanks   on fri  may 16  2014 at 11 27 am  jrrmzz notifications github com wrote 
the idea sounds good  but what if the bore head is indicator for the size of the hole   so there are 5x5 and 3x3 bore heads  but the actual problem that you can't go at the side of the tunnel bore with a 3x3 head would be the same  also that you can't see what's ahead  so i think we need an redesign of the model  a little more curves at the head  i know it's not vanilla design style 
that is exactly what i mean  but it looks like the stargate ring is there  too  below it  seems like both at the same time  so to say  because one or two ring   chevron blocks are usually missing and you can see the ring there 
that's the tricky question     any suggestions 
as suggested for retrofit 2 i am working with an interceptor to change the url at runtime  there was something wrong with the interceptor and it dropped it's scheme   in case any1 is interested in the interceptor

 kalessil i used   user  as return type just for example  in my current project i have some methods  that incapsulate some db queries and return some ar records  yii2   in some cases method called few times  first time in validator  that know how to deal with  null  result  and another time in some action method  that running after validation and can be called only after validation passed  in this case  method unable to return  null    also  it's a bit weird to see inspection detecting every nullable variable usage  but not first time access  because after first call it will be npe or valid object of expected type

i can't update buildcraft for now  will do soon  probably tonight or tomorrow   but i did investigate a little more on this issue   using tickprofiler and laggoggles i was able to understand a little bit more tickprofiler  so i think the "70 000" number  isn't the number of pipes but the usage in µs tick   i didn't reboot the server since yesterday and i came to this results        details   it seems that _tilepipeholder_ is using up to 58  of the total consumption    note that i may be wrong  of all these interpretations  this is the first time i handle a server    so i'm still learning  '

normal seek has no problem    i assume exoplayer reports onstatechanged exoplayer state_ended  only when the transition to ended state completes  do you mean it's possible that there is an issue in exoplayer that this event is reported incorrectly   as for the decoder  the following logs should indicate that it's eos state  the event onstatechanged exoplayer state_ended  was reported after this

ok  i've looked a lil bit closer  if you use https for admin  then link will point to proper https orientdb address  the strange thing is that this address still is somehow "autoredirected" to http version  so  link shows https  but browser  ff  chrome  on both windows and linux opens http version  and i still have to change address manually    even stranger  when i "copy link address"  and paste it it goes to wrong url  but when i change url manually  and copy it again  then pasting it causes it to go to correct url   but this is probably browser fault  and probably can't be fixed from here  in fact i'm gonna ask stackoverflow of this peculiar behavior   second scenario  when orientdb is using https  while dropwizard is using http  link explicitly shows http version  but that's really uncommon configuration and i understand that it is not worth supporting   feel free to close

 duncdrum i know its difficult  but isn't it possible by looking into the code to at least find out  why  this particular warning is generated and what it means  it must be generated somewhere and someone once thought there was a good reason for it    maybe you can have a look in the code  search on parts of the error message text    i'll try to isolate the damned thing     the variables mentioned in the message can be located  sure  they're in the code  liud and clear  but i can't find anything wrong in their usage  let alone something exist should be warning me about    no i haven't fiddled with the logger level yet   timing  it happens when some query runs   we don't use html templating  anyway  if we can't resolve or clear up anything  its ok  it all runs without glitches    however emitting incomprehensible warning messages  filling up the log with nonsense  eating system resources in doing this  confusing users that access the log  sounds like a bug te me  although not a fatal one

i have updated master to use guava 20 0 and made sure it was compatible   i have also made sure it was compatible back to guava 15 0  with most functionality  no ipv6  working with 14 0   guava 21 0 is only java8 compatible  so i opened up a new ticket #211 for adding java 8 functionality  but figure that is a little out of scope for a 2 0 0 release which is long overdue

i tried this   and  ignore   set up as an alias   still results in "unknown command"   you are correct about  eignore   i wasn't aware this was automatic  from the documentation it seemed to suggest that i must set up an alias if another plugin had a command of the same name for that to work   specifically    # if you have two plugin with the same command and you wish to force essentials to take over  you need an alias    anyway i got the idea that putting ignore on the override list would also be necessary if i didn't want to use  eignore but wanted  ignore to utilize the essentials ignore function   also  correct me if i'm wrong  but shouldn't the alias be essentials ignore   1

 mrniko sure  it's a singleton injected into the redissonclientfactory 
yes  to the contrary  it prints out a ton of stuff  in beta 4   example see below  what it prints out is all the successful and failing rule matches when you parse an input  this allows me to see which rules are attempted and in which order  and it tells me which rules match and which do not  this way i can see the grammar in action as it is being executed and that gives me the only real debugging functionality that works as i can see where my grammar goes the wrong way where i did not anticipate that   i suggest you revert your changes to re instantiate this functionality 
 tsmaeder i see this in both che 5 10 0 and che 5 14 0

sorry for getting back late  thanks for the 1 5 5 update  the issue has been resolved  partially   on pressing the finish button  in the last fragment   a blank screen appears before starting the next activity  the blank screen with white background doesn't belong to the activity that holds the custom fragments   i tried changing the background color of the activity to match the background color of the last custom fragment  the blank screen with white background doesn't seem to go away  hence this issue seem to have been resolved only partially  thanks again

ah yes  saw the javadocs now  but only 1 method appears in the hawtio console  so perhaps they are getting mixed together somewhere   we are using camel 2 13 2  sorry for not mentioning earlier  i'll try upgrading to see if it makes a difference

i just writing over the binary protocol  version of orientdb is 2 2 22 
this is an embedded ha database running a single instance  yeah  i know  kind of silly    and no  the database can't be possibly shutting down since this is just a 1 per roughly 10 100k calls to the service that fails  and there are other succeeding calls to that very service after this exception   by the way  can you address another question i have  basically  if i obtained an iterator from  db findnodes    and closed the transaction  but then i open another one and try to iterate through that iterator  it fails  i suppose that's a normal behavior  what's the motivation behind it  if i'm not asking too much   
yesterday it seemed to be happening when i cancelled at any point  right now it's only happening consistently if i cancel between observation and photo upload  i e  when it says "1 new  0 updated " i do have to wait 10 20 seconds for the unexpected sync to kick in  and it seems to complete really quickly  this is an observation with a photo but not project observations  no fields  not even a location 
hey  i will look into the apks  but next week  i am also on  mini  holiday     do you have any recommendations on how to debug the apks'  dex code  i plan to decompile the code to smali and maybe step the smali code with debugger using apktool 
 malinskiy i've now tried to reproduce the issues  i didn't succeed  however  it was quite a long time ago that i've tried  so maybe i'm not doing it well

thanks for the reply   i modified the pom of the sample application as per the comment you referred to  and updated the application to directly create the  commonsxsdschemacollection      without throwing an exception  i would've expected it to throw an exception 
i have a large zip file that will not attach here  can i send it to you directly 
i needed to zip the file due to github file extension policy  second thing i noticed  when i create a category automatically  it stays empty  the file size of the generated file is zero and stays empty if i click "view"   category zip  https   github com ctron package drone files 78818 category zip 
windows 10  not 10 1   and i have the latest updates intellij community 2017 3  it _runs_ just fine both in the command line and intellij  but intellij's debugger throws that error 
the full query would be something like select top 10   'smth' + dp_id + 'smthelse' as thumbnail            'this' + access_url+ 'that' as download from ivoa obscore  where dp_id is a varchar  a custom column not part of the obscore standard    and access_url is a clob 
ah  found the actual cause  marking a task as done marks the subtask as done as well  hiding it  but i had marked it as done then tried to remove the subtask  making it look like the task was deleted because of the subtask removal  the ui desync bug made this harder to see 
yeah  sorry i wasn't clear enough  the bug report is for version 3 0 8   with traces  just updated this morning   what i meant was  the behavior looked the same   straight crash when scanning but i didn't get the traces with logcat   yesterday with 3 0 7  thanks
no  there was a large plate pattern in the part builder 
testing on wildfly 11 and wildfly camel 5 1 0
 inflightmessage  has nothing to do with this  this class is part of another library we use  this is a comm  stack   basically what happens is that  thread 33  tries to close spring application context  while on the other hand the jvm  sigterm handler  thread is running the shutdown hook to exist the jvm   there is no issue in thread thread 33  the issue is on lock  0x00000005cc3bde18  caused by the  synchronized  blocks   the  close    method in  abstractapplicationcontext  could be called at the same time the jvm shutdown hook is triggered

yes  i assume issue #26 in your gradle plugin has the same root cause as issue #16 in your maven plugin since they are both caused by a javax naming noinitialcontextexception with the same exception reason  i may be wrong though  in any case issue #16 is still relevant for your maven plugin

i shoud mention that this only started happening once we upgraded to android studio 8   gradle 0 12  we were using java8_home explicitly in the retro lambda config section until the 2 1 0 release of gradle retrolambda  we don't seem to need it anymore  and this issue occurs with or without the retro lambda config section    we do still use java8_home for our ci server   the issue has been intermittent  if i do a clean and run assembledebug again it usually works for a little while   i'll see if i can set up a small example that replicates this tomorrow   our project is open source though  you could try replicating it yourself if you'd like  https   github com opentreemap opentreemap android

ok  i suppose that you're right  i was just a bit tired of working with translations     for me your proposal of string is good  in spanish i think that i will write "origen o destino están fuera del área cubierta por la red de transportes" but i suppose that your approach is better when writing in english   i think that if we do it is better to do it right and also change in all the translations and ask  rjfv and  mentaer to translate or just review one more string once again  maybe is easier to simply tell them the line  in this occasion  to allow them to see what they had written before and don't change their files  for the other languages  including english  i can make the changes

yes it is set with the server running  why would a server reset the config back to the previous state after a restart though  also what would be the point of having the ability to change a setting live in the game with a command if it reverts or the ability to reload the config after changing the setting via the config file 
i will try some more tests to determine  i noticed it on the one i posted  so i mentioned it  i will follow up with some simpler test projects to demonstrate this

a chat id has 9 digits in telegram and this is what i used  but   for  some reason   it was converted to that 1 xxe8 value   i did not enter it like that in paperui 
it seems that it works properly  👍  i'll tell you if i see any bugs
thanks  laa   would check on this   update this thread shortly 
current version from the play store  i know the log is normal  i just gave it for context so that you'd know where the http handler craps out   there's no locale or user mismatch that i can tell  both are running utf 8 and i've got nothing fancy in my username or password  lest an angle bracket     proves to be an issue 
switching to row mode did not seem to address the issue  i will work on getting a repro setup 
i'm afraid not  i was actually just speculating that that might fix it  i've never used jscover before and i didn't know about looping with labels either before i looked into this  if i have time tomorrow and no one else has suggestions i might try to fork the project and fix it there 
i´ve switched to one request per layer now  at least for the geowebcache layers   had to extend the openlayers wmsgetfeatureinfo control for this a bit cause by default it only allows to either request only one layer or request multiple layers via drilldown  while the latter case leads to grouping of layers with the same url    are there any plans for geowebcache to be able to handle getfeatureinfo requests for multiple layers in the future  i understand that this is not trivial when the layers are from different sources  this would mean that geowebcache would have to trigger separate requests instead of just cascading the request to a single source  in addition the responses from the separate sources would have to be combined into one response by geowebcache to send it back to the client

dbeaver version  5 1 0  sometime even reload doesn't helps   maybe problem in os  i don't know

i don't have the code on me  but there is nothing to fancy to explain   the project consists of a form in which you can upload two files  two separate file fields   and a submit button  which send a post request to an endpoint which has one parameter   the 'form'   in the controller i try and retrieve the files from the form  but it returns nothing  the size is 0   however  what i can do is retrieve the file names by iterating through the map of values  although that is not very useful

last year it was connected via powerlan  unstable   but a month ago i connected it via cable  since then it appears stable to me   what confuses me is  that oh seems to be able to find the wallbox   if i run it as root user  maybe this indicates missing access rights  another difference might be  that i have a p30x  which is able to run as a master and therefore runs a different firmware  maybe it reacts in a different way to those requests compared to a p30c

the test for my previous logs was gold ore  i believe   i was trying to set up ore processing when i initially discovered this   and for the client logs i'll be including here  i did plain smooth stone just as a test  i also tried a few modded items when i submitted my initial report  so  it's possible the original logs i provided are one of those   to see if it was something specific  but i can't remember what ones i tested then    this is the latest log from my client   https   www dropbox com s c7sllafc5o429m1 latest log dl 0  right at the bottom of the log  you'll see i gave myself a logic programmer  i admit it  i was too lazy to run across my base for a quick test   the very next thing i did was try it and get disconnected  then exited the game to grab the log

 eivantsov i'm running docker version 18 03 1 ce  build 9ee9f40   part of the issue is that this machine is attached to a corporate network  and it has linked  home to be part of an ldap configuration  based off of ongoing discussions  it's possible we will not be given permissions to  home    i had figured that the reason docker was throwing that error was because it's trying to use the on disk   home user eclipse che  as a volume  which i was trying to configure to be elsewhere  perhaps   usr local home user eclipse che  
 davidecaroselli i think this is the issue     there is a broken carriage return that is interpreted in a different way from the tokenizer and cleaner   can we filter those so it does not crash

i am getting this issue inside agent  why agent needs es nodes info 
as of writting  nextcloud android app 3 0 3 isn't available in f droid  i'll gladly test when it's available 
i try to change the resolution  mean i type in "1024x768" but the canvas doesnt changed their size  it happens most the time  it only works 1 time  
r3 and the 1 7 release happened on a few of the last dev builds too 
sure  just create a match query to es for the field that does not exist in your document   on mon  mar 6  2017 at 2 07 pm  julien roy  notifications github com  wrote

for example  i want to watch a part of video that is 8 minutes long  the problem is i don't want to watch the full video  but i would like to start watching from 5 minutes in  in 1080 mode i am able to scroll through the video and start watching 5 minutes into it  with 4k mode  i am unable to do that  it only allows me to watch the video from the location  time  that i am currently at which means i am forced to watch the full 8 minutes of that video 
i just tried  and i would say that it happens all the time  but only when i have a search  it doesn't happen when recently viewed is displayed
yes it appears to happen with or without the split and it seems a regression but i haven't used the component for a while

i tried to imply that i had it with my follow up questions  sorry  ftb utilities is indeed in the pack    i've searched through the files and i'm pretty certain fake players are enabled  i'm not having an issue with the builder not being able to break blocks  i'm having an issue with the builder not being able to designate an area beyond the defaults  i posted this on reddit a while ago and posted these with it  if they help  https   i imgur com vo5ap4h jpg https   gfycat com niceshamelessaddax
that sounds like a great suggestion  wasn't aware of that hook in the statement builder  one thing i'm not sure about is dbmigrate appears to always wrap beforemigrate in a transactiontemplate  unless that were changed to follow the same transaction detection  likely wouldn't fix this particular case   somewhat related  the transaction treatment of beforemigrate vs e g  beforeeachmigrate is different  this is understandable based on their scope  but initially unexpected   i think your suggestion would work as is for beforeeachmigrate because it is called within the domigrategroup   method 
this query is created using alias      within the generated offerdaoimpl java    your hint helped solving it  it works if you change the line  query where alias   offer getdrinkid    eq drinkid     to  query where alias   offer getdrink   getid    eq drinkid     in the generated code  is this something that can be fixed in the generator template

hi  laa  yes   i recover my data with  insert into from select         command now   thanks for help   i have no any more log data but if you want to reproduce this event i recommend you run a stress test with the following steps    1  set test environment to    linux   4 core cpu   8gb ram   2  create two class with 1000 record per class   3  call update on first class with 2kb data with 100 itreation or more per second    4   during the call update a client send insert command to second class    5   after some hours the database must be hang and cpu goes to 100  usage    6  terminate the orientdb process with kill  9 signal  7  run the odb and check the record count     thanks  saeed tabrizi

thanks  manfredkarrer   i saw the 2 minute timeout constant in the source code  however this doesn't match my practical observations  where the timeout message occurs after 60 seconds only  12 16 38    12 17 38 in my log   it might be a different timeout condition    agreed that a socket timeout of 2 minutes makes perfect sense  on the other hand  a  data transfer completion  timeout  which is what seems to be happening here  makes more sense to be a function of the data size    i use release v0 9 5 in my tests

hi luca  thanks for the response  i just tried the snapshot version  on my machine it works just like the beta   i haven't been able to reproduce the stack trace from the opening post in my development environment  it seems that the error only occurs after prolonged use   lifetime of the process  which causes problems for us in production  unfortunately i don't think that i can convince my team to deploy a snapshot version of a library on a production server    the stack trace is all i can offer for now  sadly  sorry about that   we are reverting to 2 1 9 for the time being

thats my first impression  yes  looking at the decompiled sdk makes that seem very unlikely  admittedly      we have a wide range of devices this is affecting according to fabric they are all running 4 4 4 and below  that may be incorrect  though      note 2   galaxy s5   tab pro 10 1   s4   droid ultra   the stacktrace may not be as helpful as we use an internal array that takes the first two cameras retrieved from  cameramanager getcameraidlist      this is returning an empty list  causing the index out of bounds exception

sorry  as stated  no i can not provide such a sample as the actual algorithm start with building a random route  so any given data set will work or fail     from experimentation i'd guess a rate of 10 1 but that is highly subjective   while stating this     i did  not  look at the random route generation code itself  it might well be the error is in that routine producing looping random routes and "fixing" it in the optimize is not the right approach

problems with reappearing warps should be fixed in the latest dev build  see #43   if you are using offline mode  i do not think that updating your sqlite driver will change anything  it is more likely that bungecord somehow messed up a players unique id causing the error on insert  did the problem occur again within the last days

what happens is that k9 stops when it's trying to sync inbox i e  the "circle" on upper left corner of the phone goes around and around  no error messages  after a while the "circle" just disappears and new messages stay unsynced 
for some strange reason the new bug zip didn't get made  i thought this one was it   it's indeed an old bug zip  if i have this happen again i'll try to make a new one  it's weird that it didn't actually create it 
yes they're zero byte files  no one other than me is using the file   it happens right after i drag and drop it into the vault   the file is a simple ascii text file   original  testing txt testing txt  conflict 40126106  testing txt  conflict 40126106   conflict 1df578a8  3 more like the previous line but different conflict id's 
i get this result whatever the way i goes on a stream  top streams  features streams  followed streams and so on   i have the static image of the stream but bottom shows "stream is no longer live" message everytime and i can't play it within the app   even more strange  i can use the three dots and ask to play it in an external player  and in that case it works  so it's only stream within the app itself which is broken  and status check resulting in the display of this message    no useful information can be obtained from the  adb logcat  above 
 ctron  please read #586  for the different directories 
dtools set up  dub  dscanner  dfmt  dfix  gdb  dcd is not set up   linux  intellij idea 2018 1   removing the line makes ide freeze as well 
i did    gradlew build  i have openjdk 11 
if the minimum number of clusters is set to kmin 10    we modified a little bit the original algorithm     the algorithm may return a lower number of clusters  this is due to this sorting bug 
i did  since it is also mentioned in the tooltip  "if true  shows the hunger  and saturation if " + show_saturation_overlay_name + " is true  that would be restored by food you are currently holding"

thank you for your quick fix  lbroudoux  i just pulled the latest docker image  and was able to import and test our use case further   for keycloak  i don't seem to have any errors with the functionality  it just jumped out at me as something potentially related to the reported issue  the configuration i'm using is the default docker compose file found in the microcks repository  happy to help troubleshoot further  but this doesn't appear to be impacting me for testing microcks locally 
its the same as main server  p and i did this when i went to bed  appleassult told me before i went so figured i do this before i forget
1  the server is set on 4gb  2  i don't know if i understand what you want  if is server empty  trains allocate memory at a rate of several mb per hour  in 1 day after start server using 1gb more that it was on start  3   i don't have problems with lags

i've made a profile with the following settings but it did not help   title  test dnd ringer mode  do not disturb ringing items in do not disturb mode  all  to test it  i've triggered the operation manually by long tapping it and choosing trigger this profile   this seems to do nothing at all on my device  dnd mode stays active if it already was   i've also tried to do the reverse  to let easer activate dnd mode rather than disable it  however  easer won't enable  or disable  dnd mode on my device at all   i've tried all of the ringer mode settings  dnd all  dnd priority  dnd none  dnd alarms   i'm sorry to say that none of them do anything on my device 
 jasontedor i know that the number is insanely great  and i doubt it can be reached in regular operation  still  the exception clearly indicates a negative value  and assuming that  scrolltimeinmillis  is always positive  i can give no better explanation than a numeric overflow   this is the stacked grafana graph of  scrolltimeinmillis  of our 12 node setup  the overflow happens at 292 years  approx at 9222842861407 ms      grafana metrics es5 scrolltimeinmillis  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 1222566 24157363 77e62342 0e59 11e7 8d90 caf54b915e2c png   the metrics are polled from the first node which is still able to return the negative value  but the inter cluster communication to sync the local stats between the nodes is obviously broken by the exception thrown in  searchstats stats writeto  
i click on the tab buttons at the bottom of the screens  so i didn't write code for that  setroot in bottomtab

 sleshchenko yes  i have verified and created the client_secret key before applying cluster issuer and certificate  do you think any other additional step instruction  that is required is missing in the documentation   i am creating this in a brand new environment and no other dependencies exists 
device  samsung galaxy s3  description of nav start   tap on "live karte" in main screen    map is set to osm and is shown correct  ich can see and tab my saved caches  i can scroll  everythin ok       now i choose a single cache  not importand whitch type     lets say a multi with several saved waypoints  then i tab on "mehr details" whitch opens the cachelisting  here i open the menue and choose "navigieren" and take "karte"  map   after this the screen turns black for a few seconds and switches back to the live map   its the same when i pick a cache from the live map and start the navigation with the small button in the upper right corner in the listing preview window    i selectet navigation per map as default    does this help 
thanks  that info is helpful   i'll see if i can track this down 
docker is on 184  sorry  i've copied the wrong curl line for you  i've edited now  i have changed the real ip to a fake one  but i'm curl'ing the right ip  hehe
i don't have the startup logs from the time of the crash  i do have the log from the time of the crash but that only has stuff from when the server was online till it crashes   here is the latest startup log of the server  http   paste ubuntu com 23609447 
updating the pack and server today  will report back if it is still happening

great  i subscribed to beta releases  thanks 
well  i'm trying to learn how to use the collector  to start i'm analizyng the url http   www cirf org italian home html  if i understood correctly i should me able to get "l'associazione" in collector referrer link text for the source     but seems i'm not able to extract this link   if it can be useful i can copy here the full  xml  thanks for your time 
i don't know   i don't suppose i have a choice    
this is definitely a real increase and it happens with the antennapod ui as well as when using my headphones' play button  this is on lollipop on a samsung s4  no similar issue occurs with other apps 
ho god     i apologize edmundoa   i downloaded it on day before beta 3  i have just install it and evething look's good   thanks  
im doing that atm  here  https   github com zeroeightysix kami pull 146 files   but imho thats not a nice solution to this problem 
 thesnoozer   thank you so much for your quick   detailed reply    well now i'm baffled too  because now it seems to be working   i'm not sure what i did other than i made a few more commits of other stuff i'm working on   after i got your comment  i tried again and voila    i have one more question  if i could beg your patience      where does the  git build    information come from  are you pulling it from maven  although i can see the convenience of including that info in the properties  build  information  building the project has nothing to do with  git   per se   i would think it might make more sense to label them  maven build        perhaps i am way off track here     btw  this is one of the best documented maven plugins i have seen   great job 
will test tomorrow
do you mean of the exception 
your variant is fine as well  however with randomization there might be cases where shards will simply not contain any watches and its fine  i e  10 shards and 10 documents  there is no guaranteee of even distribution by design 
i do not think that it is a memory issue  cpu is not busy at all  we see no gc activity in our logs  and no progress is made until we restart elasticsearch  for  30 minutes

sounds good to me    
i can not use that yet  i'm using maven 0 5 2
yes  it does 
i will try to reproduce this on singleplayer and will provide the info asap 
the cert isn't self signed  the ca is digicert  i'd think that would work 
that didn't work for me  to build the project  i had to create an  ant properties  file with the following contents     i created that file after using the  android  command   using   subprojects made no discernable difference to me   i'm guessing there's a way to set these in  androidmanifest xml  or somewhere else   unfortunately  83cfc156753f73889d2c3545b601d7e844217348 built this way crashes when i click "add account" in the system settings and press the caldav icon  i haven't built it in any other way 
i'd like to increase the number of streams consumed by my app to around 20  but this means i'll have 400 leaserenewer threads  grimacing  this _can't_ be necessary or useful

hi  thank you for answering   already using 2 1 0 and updated all libraries  i tried different versions of getstream  but nothing worked 
i have a stupid question how can i connect direct to the power cell when there are factory flash casting all around is and under the power cell factory importer is  this is my first time i used your mod sorry for the newbie question   edit  oh i can with with one block diference place the other 3 blocks i was thinking that i place the power cell directly to the factory heart  edit 2  no it doesn´t work after the server start the power cell is direct to 0 fe  i have connect the flux point from flux networks
i haven't tested this but i think this bug appears in following code    ife 0  1   set a   sp + 100    in that case emulator is skipping and tick    tick_skip    getinstructionlength   will return wrong instruction length  i suppose it would next try to use 100 as instruction opcode and do something evil

we have ten servers with      intel e5 4 cores  2 4ghz      24 gb ram     2 tb hdd  must i set up a coprocessor in hbase  does the geoserver parameter coprocessorjar need to be set 
i've had this problem in 2 0  2 1  2 2  and now 3 0rc1   simply setting the 'apps' collection's permissions to "crwxrwxr  " prevents unauthenticated access over rest to the entire database 
you can't use   transient  because the property has no backing field  the backing field is provided by the delegate instead 
i am running lp 0 8 3 100 which is a little outdated  but due to having to update a whole lot of other mods  is not really within the realm of possibility with the current setup to update   hope that helps 
something like " missing the permission 'nick command name random' " and " 'nick command skin random' "

locally i run the whole test suite at once  and i see the tests being run sequentially  i don't know exactly what happens on travis ci unfortunately  apart from that it runs them all 
certainly  here's my config file  http   cl ly code 3w1h1r0f0l2m  it contains some configs for the new features  but they will just be ignored in earlier versions  
unfortunately it looks like i can't  for some reason the multiblock won't form  register  in creative and my normale world wont load i keep getting this error "the state engine was in incorrect state server_stopping and forced into state server_stopped  errors may have been discarded " if you have any idea how to resolve this issue it would be welcome but i have no way off knowing if its related   what i was observing though for the initial issue is as the item started arriving the first item would comes passe the stack test and start smelting then an other item would add to the stack but doesn't look like it takes the test  when the stack reaches 16 it keeps smelting  i noticed this because it recipes would never complete when using refined storage and even adding the ressources manually id not get the number of items i'd expect 
all right  i'll let you know if it happens again since i don't know how to reproduce it myself  thank you

running a quick test  not only can i confirm that i'm not calling the global registry to create an npc  i'm  not calling the global registry _in my entire project_  https   i imgur com kfftbar png    the npc is created within an  npccontroller  abstract class which is shared amongst all my npcs  the only difference between the type of npc which is being saved to  saves yml  and the others is that i'm using pathing for this kind     creation in  npccontroller       note that guardconfig is entirely separate from npcs  all i'm pulling from it is the predefined path for the npcs to follow  perhaps not the most elegant solution  but certainly nothing  that i can think of  which should be making any saves to the global configuration   edit  to clarify again  guardconfig is something stored elsewhere in the project  it's not something to do with npcs that i've merely renamed 
thank you for your work  with '3 1 snapshot' it works with gradle 6 0 
i am using buildcraft   odd thing happened   i can reproduce this all day long in a production test world   i made a new world just for grins and i cannot reproduce this issue   i'm able to get buckets out of gasoline drums all day long   any thoughts on this 
 pron nop  still nothing reported by  verifyinstrumentation   i will try to make a simpler example 
i agree that this helps fix application errors by forcing this during development  but when an error like this would occur in a production app  in theory  the app could continue working  if the exception was caught  in which case the app design should have been better  agreed    i think this is a balance between forcing better flow design and robustness in case of failure  now that we know runtime errors can be thrown when registering for example  we can check for this  and remove the catch all from otto _shame_

okay so we've rolled out the updated version onto the server  and all the things i _was_ losing   are now found   trouble is now other things are being lost periodically   at present i will occasionally search for "copper" and see 3 types of copper ingots  as in    from 3 different mods  in my system despite the fact that i know i only have 1 type in my system  so i pull out the 2nd and 3rd ones with smaller amounts and once on my cursor they magically transform into say   copper wiring  or copper plates   if i put these items back into the system   they transform back into copper ingots from other mods again  really strange   please let me know if you need anymore testing  i would love to give you a map download so you could test it but unfortunately i don't have access to do that  i can do testing however 
macos 10 14 2 and chrome 72   i have yet to re test this by building from source  i was using the release  if you are unable to replicate the service unavailable response  i can look into it further

hi  for me normal spaces are not working  here is a little sample where the problem occurs 
it is ok now  thanks for quick response
this behaviour is a bit strange  i don't understand the logic behind it  can you please elaborate 
ok  that was the first time make a pull request       maybe the operate will wrong  please don't mind that 
yes  it is a query where i don't care too much about the performance  but i thought you guys might want to investigate a bit further since the performance does not make sense to me  so my personal guess is that this is an error problem   i know that regexes are pretty expensive  but i don't see the reason why the query planner yield such highly different results  in the end a "has attr  and attr     regex" should not be much different from "attr      regex"  since both should not evaluate the regex if has or   evaluate to false  or do i miss something again here   cached results are      8 9s  the result was always 1 node  that has 2 two short attributes  so networking was not an issue  results are varying due to other programs running  there are still plenty of cores unused   i cannot produce any "real measurement" for the next days

thanks for the fast response  turning off the word wrap indeed seems to mitigate the issue a lot  auto format was already off   goes from hangs forever to hangs for  10s  this still seems quite long to me  but i can live with that  does this behaviour seem normal to you   i can't really concieve how accessing data already fetched could consume 10s of full cpu  or how computing a few thousands linebreaks would takes half an hour    smells like something off in the value tab formating    i'm sorry i'm not allowed to disclose the actual content of the json  it is a list of  600 json objects  each of depth 2  for a total just over 80k chars  let me now if i can provide more data on the issue  else i'll just make do with the short freezes

i think you're right   jgfidelis   i just checked and sharing directly from spotify to stories  spotify has a direct ig share feature  has a similar issue  it brings me to a login screen  and i never end up being able to share the song even after logging in  no "unable to share  must be logged in" message in this case though    you can bet that if it's breaking spotify's sharing that it's a bug 
i think updating the user guide to say replace step 1 from https   sourceware org gdb wiki buildingondarwin with 'brew install gdb' and following the rest of the steps  then going into keychain to ensure the self signed cert is always trusted should be a sufficient update  i could try my hand at writing a post explaining it all later on if that would help

i think that including a low res icon to be used on older phones sounds like an easy solution   the problem is  how to have a single apk that uses raster on old api and vector on new api   i need to do research to see how to do it or if it's possible   using vectordrawablecompat would also require research  because my earlier conclusion was that it might not work the same for _launch_ icons  as opposed to icons within the application    so  yeah  digging is required

no  any chest at all   the one in particular was not connected to the me   it was just a standard chest     and yueh  the server owners have a system that allow you to actually purchase points to buy kits that will basically just creative in items for you   that is how i got my me drives     i did some further testing and just can't figure out what is causing it   i have the exact same set up on an sp world and have not seen such an issue   got another guy on the server that has an me set up  no issues   i have used ae since unleashed and never seen anything like this before     restarting the server is like an on off switch for it   after the items dupe  they remain duped until the server restarts  at that point when it comes back online the items literally undupe unless i have pulled them from the me and placed them in my inventory   i am at a loss 
yes  this fixed it  thank you

hi  i've created a pull request #523 for this change  please take a look  in order to minimize changes  i've done my change to clock usertimeclock class  let me know what you think    ps  this is the first time i'm doing a contribution on github  so i might have made many and various mistakes in my forking  committing  commenting  requesting  etc  apologies in advance  
i doubt because i have several frames in my sitemap and only two of them which are similar are failing to load  i can tell you that this frame is attached to a group item and this group has 30 items including a player item  i have another frame with more items that can be displayed  and i have another frame with a player but less items that can be displayed too 
 gsmet i will do it later today  but i searched a bit deeper into the issue and i would like to show you my findings   i found that the  mongoclient  and the  reactivemongoclient  have a difference as to when they are instantiated and called for the first time   this piece of code in the  mongoclientproducer  is called only once     however  in the case of the  reactivemongoclient   the  configuretheclient    is called  after  the initial call to the  axle    method  the  axle    method returns a null object  this object is cached because of the   produces  annotation  and but the  reactivemongoclient  is initialized after the initial call   this is not the case with the plain mongoclient  and this is the reason for the failure i believe

there's no proxy in this example  the example shows that bazel does not try to connect to the proxy at all  it should never attempt to connect to the remote cache at port 4444  only to the proxy at port 4445   it's trying to connect to the wrong server  the example replicates if the proxy is on a different machine  i used this example because if the server is on another machine  a "minimal test case" involves tcp logs showing there is no attempt to connect to the proxy

the fix works fine  the proxy is returned by the proxyselector object   however there is another problem  might be worth to open another issue   the socks proxy is registered for the protocol scheme  socks   the protocol scheme in the selector reflects the protocol of the proxied connection  not the connection to the proxy server  that means if i want to get a proxy for an http connection  i have to request a http https uri which can never return the socks proxy  because the selector expects a socks    uri  i suppose a socks proxy should be returned regardless of the uri used  because it is applicable to all tcp and udp based connections   maybe the solution is to set the socks proxy using the  setfallbackselector  function in the  protocoldispatchselector   this time i attached the  patch  https   github com markusbernhardt proxy vole files 603466 socks fallback_patch txt  directly   details on the intended meaning of the java proxy variables can be found on the following link  https   docs oracle com javase 7 docs technotes guides net proxies html

 jiazhai pulsar is running in a cluster when this occurs with the "pulsar timer  " threads on the client side  as mentioned in the "to reproduce" section  i am not sure what triggers the problem  i simply see the problem after a period of time and network instability has sometimes been observed during the interval where the problem occurs   if i find a way to cause the issue  i will add it to the "to reproduce" section 
about the lost item  i noticed  hence my question     well   fromcallable is marked beta and wasn't in the core when i wrote that code  20 months ago  i'll check if it works for me as the above example has a very simplified stripped down version of what's going on in the process method   i would suggest to change the doc line on doonsubscribe into _is subscribing_ instead of _is subscribed_ as it might be misleading  it was for me   also  the solution i came up with isn't _that_ weird  is it  there is one general result stream  subscribe to it with a filter for your id  take 1 and the subscription will get unsubscribed after receiving it because of oncompleted  but too bad one can not postpone putting items on the subject until a subscribe happened   thanks for the fast reply

unfortunately i'm not in a position to check right now  but i think i was still getting woodcutting  noises   even if there wasn't any visible animation going on  it's possible that the animation may still be playing  to some degree  since that's one source of sound effect playback  it's also possible that the server's just sending "yo  there's a sound" messages to the client  in which case  soy's suggestion is probably the best we can do  barring wierd heuristic magicks

 nicolas raoul i removed the "search this area" button if connection is lost  currently if connection gets lost it shows a snackbar with the message but "search this area button" is still there  clicking it makes the nearby stuck at it even if the connection is re established   imo removing "search this area" button whenever connection gets lost would be a nice option

sorry for the late answer  i did some tests first i reset the scale only and it seems to work  but only once actually    after that the same behavior happened   so i did reset both the scale and the app  but since then  that's even worse since the scale doesn't recognize me anymore and there's still no data saved into the app
yeah  give me a minute to launch the game  also  as another note  the auto gui setting is actually bigger than large in my case 
the problem is when you have a string that contains an underscore  i e  "a12_t6"  that is not recognised as a string

min_access_level has precedence over all_available  as i see  the min_access_level   30 and the all_available   false means the some for admins  but i've not tested all possible combinations 
as i said about the plugins  it does not matter what for plugins are on the server  with an fresh config where   only   the force login is turned off it workes fine  but after i also change other things to false the plugin decide to be annoying    servert version  spigot 1 12 2  but sure  if you still wnna know the plugin list  https   pastebin com imfpuy6r  and so i tested it now  even if you only have authme and protocolib  you have still the same issue 
yes we can do that by using some code which determines os

oh  sorry   i ended up working around this by adjusting the url path on the nextcloud server to better match the one on the proxy server   then  nextcloud mydomain com redirecting to nextcloud local machine nextcloud now   nextcloud mydomain com redirecting to nextcloud local machine  this made the overwritehost and overwritewebroot directives on the server unnecessary  and the android app was much happier 
in other word  if i click superlike button some times eg：12 times  quickly and in a short time  the cardstackview would swipe to top direction  this is not the bug   but when i raise up my finger  the cardstackview cannot stop immediately and still swipe to top some time more this is the bug i find     this is only in ver 2 1 0  not find in ver 2 0 0  
i've not seen this issue now  so i'm going to close it   if it crops up again then i'll re open

the game needs more and more memory  i don't know fixing this issue will completely fix it or if it is just contributing to it  i found the issue through a memory snapshot however  so it's not something minor   view distance moderate   potentially  13 13 13  chunks   about 2000   chunks  50 frames per second would give 100000 entries per second  each entry say 4 bytes would give 400 kbytes per second   24 mbytes per minute   about 1 4 gb hour  of coures maybe not all chunks may have reflection but still  
 dsyer it's supposed to populate the field  environment  on the main eureka landing page  top left section   just like  eureka datacenter  populates  datacenter  field  which works    the default behaviour without any of these props set is it shows the value  test  but when i set it as above as  eureka environmenr  it replaces that with empty string   if it's not used anywhere by spring cloud  then why does it clear out the default value   the  eurekaserverbootstrap  https   github com spring cloud spring cloud netflix blob d23a57d13bf3d60668a1deb8ec94bfe212e5051f spring cloud netflix eureka server src main java org springframework cloud netflix eureka server eurekaserverbootstrap java  supposed to do it from what i can tell  no

i did run into a problem  i am not sure if what i am doing is purely incorrect and can be done in a better way  but here is what i have as a sample  1  class a extends  thymeleafviewresolver  2  class a also has  thymeleafviewresolver  autowired in as field  via boot   3  when resolving a view  if certain conditions are not met  delegate to the super  4  when resolving a view  if certain conditions are  met  handle directly   so  what in order to correctly initialize a as a resolver  i added a postconstruct method to a to set fields  based on the autowired  thymeleafviewresolver   this allows me to set the template engine and locale and a bunch of other settings on a  that were autowired from the actual thymeleafviewresolver instance    this presented the problem bug  where views seemed always cached by the resolver because thymeleafviewresolver iscached   always returned true  and the thymeleafviewresolver  getcachelimit   was always   0

it adds a section to the config  then removes it at the end  which should be the same thing  i've tested it  and the added fetch section gets removed 
technically nothing  the benefit is having a lot of states of one project that can be examined at one time   during one  longer  execution  also  if we knew that the project is "buggy" which means that the master branch fails quite often  then we could verify the fail time and fail coverage

my language does not transfer the values from the arguments array to the frame  no   writing to the frame slot has no measurable benefit  and only drawbacks for interpreter speed  arguments can't be changed  so  there is no real benefit from specializing on their type   see for interpreter speed overhead  http   stefan marr de papers oopsla marr ducasse meta tracing vs partial evaluation #x1 270024  see for peak performance speed  http   stefan marr de papers oopsla marr ducasse meta tracing vs partial evaluation #x1 300016  it is labeled 'typed args' in both cases  even for peak performance  there are few benchmarks that benefit  overall it causes even a slight slowdown

thanks for the fast answer  the files are copied correctly into the temp folder  but looking into the copied ditamap of the sidedocument which includes the references  we have seen something strange   the relative paths inside the copied ditamaps are partially changed  as a result the  dita files of the maindocument cannot be found here is an example  the first block is correct  while the second one has changed paths  pre  code   lt topichead class "+ map topicref mapgroup d topichead " navtitle "01_subchapter" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content sidedocuments sidedocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter _subchapter side ditamap" xtrc "topichead 2 7 39" gt       lt topichead class "+ map topicref mapgroup d topichead " navtitle "01_subsubchapter" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content sidedocuments sidedocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter _subchapter side ditamap" xtrc "topichead 3 8 43" gt           lt topicref href "            maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description 01_subdescription _01_subdescription main dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description _01_description ditamap" xtrc "topicref 1 5 93" gt               lt topicref href "            maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description 01_subdescription 01 dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description 01_subdescription _01_subdescription ditamap" xtrc "topicref 1 5 56"  gt           lt  topicref gt           lt topicref href "            maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description 02_subdescription _02_subdescription main dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description _01_description ditamap" xtrc "topicref 2 8 93" gt               lt topicref href "            maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description 02_subdescription 02 dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter 01_subworkflows 01_subsubsubchapter 01_description 02_subdescription _02_subdescription ditamap" xtrc "topicref 1 5 56"  gt           lt  topicref gt       lt  topichead gt   lt  topichead gt  		  lt topichead class "+ map topicref mapgroup d topichead " navtitle "02_subchapter" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content sidedocuments sidedocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter _subchapter side ditamap" xtrc "topichead 4 13 39" gt       lt topichead class "+ map topicref mapgroup d topichead " navtitle "02_subsubchapter" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content sidedocuments sidedocument_1 01_chapter 01_subchapter _subchapter side ditamap" xtrc "topichead 5 14 43" gt           lt topicref href "            maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 02_subchapter 02_subworkflows 04_subsubsubchapter 04_description 07_subdescription _07_subdescription main dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 02_subchapter 02_subworkflows 04_subsubsubchapter 04_description _04_description ditamap" xtrc "topicref 1 5 93" gt               lt topicref href "07_subdescription 07 dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 02_subchapter 02_subworkflows 04_subsubsubchapter 04_description 07_subdescription _07_subdescription ditamap" xtrc "topicref 1 5 56"  gt           lt  topicref gt           lt topicref href "            maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 02_subchapter 02_subworkflows 04_subsubsubchapter 04_description 08_subdescription _08_subdescription main dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 02_subchapter 02_subworkflows 04_subsubsubchapter 04_description _04_description ditamap" xtrc "topicref 2 8 93" gt               lt topicref href "08_subdescription 08 dita" class "  map topicref " type "topic" format "dita" xtrf "file  c  dev repo testdoc content maindocuments maindocument_1 01_chapter 02_subchapter 02_subworkflows 04_subsubsubchapter 04_description 08_subdescription _08_subdescription ditamap" xtrc "topicref 1 5 56"  gt           lt  topicref gt       lt  topichead gt   lt  topichead gt    pre   code 
actually i merge code manually in android studio  no direct pull request  also i don't want to make any change on existing code for better code merging  in future  so can you provide any solution accordingly 
thanks  keith    sorry  was too busy making sure i filled all the fields in and starting  git bisect  to    fill all the fields in 
firstly i tried to update it  but as described at commons  it didnt worked well  so i have realised  it will be faster to delete former version and replace it by a new version  so i download it  i am using windows vista 
saxon has different implementations to evaluate different types of query   so    class_def     method_def  and    class_def     class_def  method_def  are considered to be two different types of query and they are being evaluated differently   first type is the simple binary query  second one is more complex and uses  vennexpression  class   inside  vennexpression  implementation there is call to  globalordercomparer compare  https   www saxonica com html documentation javadoc net sf saxon expr sort globalordercomparer html#compare net sf saxon om item net sf saxon om item   method  from documentation    here is implementation of the method  as you see saxon assumes that it is possible nodes to be from different trees and to verify it saxon retrieves  treeinfo  object from nodes  nodes from one tree should have same  treeinfo

well  when i set the probe retract distance to 20mm i expect it to hit the touch plate and retract 20mm   i thought the probe distance was the length of probe travel before it stopped the action and produced and error message assuming there was a problem   i maybe wrong but i thought these were two separate functions   is there a reason for them to be tied together 
hi  jeanrev i'm on 0 3 3  docker cloud plugin cloud agent plugin for docker containers 0 3 3  build 27fa717e5e02a9bbc9dc43bb154a2d2b9378e412    from your previous issue link looks like it was fixed in 0 2 3   i downloaded the plugin directly from here  https   plugins jetbrains com plugin 9306 docker cloud   should i build from the repo instead
seems to be working fine now  thanks 
yes  this crash also happens when i create a new folder named "test" in " " and switch to grid view  the app also crashes when i restart it  delete the folder and recreate it  it then crashes immediately  i don't even have to switch to grid view   when i clear the  currentlog txt  file and then immediately create the folder "test"  the app crashing in the process  no log file is created at all   immediately before the exception is thrown  there is this entry in logcat 
hi  sorry i'm not sure i'll be much help on this  is there a logging flag i'll need  it's for a client so i fixed and moved on very quickly 
ok  i tried to simplify my example as much as possible  https   github com hsestupin quasar galaxy issue  so i've initialized flightrecorder and we can see what happens  you can run example the same way     the code in   example1   class do the following    create   myactor   and spawns it   register actor in   galaxyglobalactorregistry     get global ref by   co paralleluniverse actors actorregistry#getactor java lang string      send local ref of actor to the his global ref  actually i don't think the use case described above is somehow undesirable for quasar actor system  doesn't it  it seems like its pretty ok to pass actor refs to each other

hello   thanks for your attention   this was a simple test where i posted an xml to the gridfs collection called raw files and passed in some optional metadata  properties  "source" "statstest"  "sourcepath" " sourcein data example" "filename" "testfilename"   when you first get api the document like below http   localhost 8080 sportsdatahub raw files 562e45edfb111501ceb5de79 the above properties are retrieved correctly   now i update the source value above to "statsteschanged" as an example  i did this via a robomongo  when i now query it still returns back the previous properties  not the changed   i did not see this in any other collection but only the gridfs collection  example   raw files   thanks  ashish gidh  on mon  oct 26  2015 at 12 26 pm  maurizio turatti  notifications github com

i have no idea which one is the best choice  i remember having the same type of problem when changing the world shape with the target projection   maybe  if it possible  we could just for the moment add an error if someone wants to change the shape of the world in the init section 
looks like architecturecraft blocks stored in the dank null are causing this  couldn't try to update to latest version as this was on a server that i don't own or manage so i had to try to replicate the bug  what i've found is that holding any type of dank null and scrolling to architecturecraft modified blocks that come from the sawbench  as seen here https   www cosc canterbury ac nz greg ewing minecraft mods architecturecraft doc usermanual html  will crash the game  then just having the dank null in your inventory will continue to crash whenever you log in  rendering the dank null in any way will continue to crash the game  in a chest  on the ground  still crashes    i have updated  dank null and your library and the same crash still happens  here is the crash log on the latest version  hope this helps  for now i'll make sure to not store any architecturecraft blocks in a dank null  https   pastebin com vfzkfzq2
no  with just rs it works fine   i've narrowed it down  it seems to be an incompatibility between rs and gamestages  any recipe that isn't gated with gs works fine  any recipe that is gated  even after it's been unlocked  fails to craft   if i remove the staging on an item it can craft as normal  so it seems that rs isn't reading recipes after they've been unlocked   again  rs shows the working recipe when items are placed into the crafting grid  and plays the crafting event sound effect  but the completed item can't be taken out of the grid  it just vanishes  if i attempt to craft the item before it's unlocked  the completed recipe doesn't show  which is intended

i have removed 20 of the mods i used to load  no change  currently have to fob around "in the dark" for lack of a better term if i want to craft armour   i dread the prospect of heuristically checking each mod to see what the cause is  is there a way i could check for a rendering issue 
updated pex to 1 23 4  tested with latest release builds  behavior is same   i could just be wrong about how sudo works in the first place  is  sudo simply not intended to work on the person executing the command   i could've sworn that sudo worked on oneself in past versions of esx  maybe i'm wrong  though 
where can i get 3 0 2  latest on f droid is 3 0 1

 ewpatton  in reply of your second post  i check user admin panel usually every day  my friend that modified a project yesterday  but it says he last visited on december 5  which is really weird  isn't it 
the  libudunits2 so 0  lib is located in   usr local lib    i have no idea if this the standard location for this lib  was the folder suggested by the  udunits2  manual   actually for some reasons  address not found by curl apparently   i was not able to install  udunits2  using my regular package manager   concerning my   ld_library_path   here the list   i did not know that rstudio would use another   ld_library_path  than the one of my global env  where should could i modify that  many thanks in advance

 quintesse i've tries lots of variations on 
our use case is mapping from a dto payload   a    b    c   to our jpa db entities   aprime    cprime     when a payload comes in to update an entity  we first find the existing jpa entities   aprime    cprime     we need to pass these jpa entities in as a   mappingtarget  so that an update happens on the existing objects     if we don't pass   mappingtarget    this would create a new cprime jpa entity  and generate a new id   instead of using the existing entity   we would also lose any existing fields that were set in cprime  if this was a partial update

ah  got it  yep  it sounds like my  target classpath txt  got out of sync  not sure what happened  but i moved over to  es4x cli  and after doing  yarn install  i see that  es4x postinstall  ran automatically and  target classpath txt  has the latest great jars listed  i'll close this out as not reproducible  thanks 
it was unrelated  thermal dynamics and dimensional pockets 
hmm  well i'm not sure why you're not having the issue but basically i was sent this and wanted to put it into an email  i long press on the message and hit copy and it says "copied"  attempting to paste it anywhere does nothing  i press "paste" and the button just does it's little animation but doesn't disappear and nothing is pasted  rebooting and restarting do nothing and even now it's still uncopiable in qksms    perhaps there is some character that the default messanger is ignoring or not copying  i'm not sure 
no it does not work  the phone number works though 
yeah  i had a look through the directionallight class before posting here and saw the way it should be getting the dimensions from the camera but that doesn't appear to be what's happening   the key box2dlights and directionallight code sections are here 
the call completes successfully  the issue is in the  waiting logic  https   github com killbill killbill blob ff858dd492b3376e2b7374174b9c2a1fe68abc3f jaxrs src main java org killbill billing jaxrs resources subscriptionresource java#l569 l594   we currently expects a subscription  invoice and payment event  if  autopaymentoff  is set  we shouldn't wait on the payment event   does that make sense

unfortunately  at least on my device  nexus 6 running android nougat   i don't have that information  here are some details  screenshots  and suggestions   the ap list shows the primary channel and frequency  however  you're right that it shows 80 mhz next to the primary channel in the ap list  that being said  it would be more clear if it did state "ch 155 5775mhz" along with the primary channel  the width indicates the same thing  but unless you already know that an 80 mhz network using a primary channel between 149 161 is always centered on channel 155  then you'd be confused as to why the channel rating page shows all those channels as occupied   with 40 mhz networks  it also shows the primary channels 5 and 11  center is 3 and 9  respectively   in this case  even if it did show the center channel  you don't have enough information to know what frequencies are occupied  for example  if it stated "ch 3 2422mhz  40 mhz   you don't know if your primary channel is 1 or 5  since 2422 mhz is the center either way   as i stated above  showing primary and center or primary and auxiliary is more useful  "ch 5 3 " would make the most sense  showing auxiliary channels is probably unnecessary  you could have "ch 5+1" although with 5 ghz channels you'd have some monstrosity like "ch 149+153+157+161" for an ap with primary channel 149  "ch 149 155 " shows you the primary and center  which is enough to deduce the rest and it looks cleaner  you could also include a frequency range like "5735 mhz   5815 mhz" or the center frequency "5775 mhz" along with the width  these are just some possibilities   it is important to know your primary channel because you can reduce interference if your primary channels are farther apart and the auxiliary channels are overlapping  compared to the opposite situation  1 3  and 11 9    5 3  and 7 9    there are many 20 mhz clients that will not utilize the auxiliary channel  most smartphones will only utilize 20 mhz on a 2 4 ghz network   for them  it's better that aps appear to be on channels 1 and 11 rather than channels 5 and 7     screenshot_20160926 220810  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18857909 c15db250 8435 11e6 8270 da07ea36e5df png    screenshot_20160926 223315  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18858348 6965f04a 8439 11e6 90b9 b5740e6b0a3a png   the channel rating page should show the same number of aps on all 4 channels  channel 149 should be equivalent to channel 161 because the nearby channel 161 ap is blasting across channel 149 as well  i don't know why channel 165 has a low rating since no ap is interfering with that channel   the channel ratings for 40 mhz should show the most interference on channels 5 7 because the 5 3  ap blocks channels 1 7 and the 11 9  ap blocks channels 5 13  channels 5 7 should be derated slightly relative to channels 1 4 because of the additive interference from the distant ap and channels 8 and 9 should be rated equally to 10 and 11 since the distant ap interferes equally on those channels      screenshot_20160926 222427  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18858187 1bb2015a 8438 11e6 9e69 e5e62c726f29 png    screenshot_20160926 223352  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18858347 6964c864 8439 11e6 98ce ce1936731090 png   on the channel graph  all 5 ghz networks should completely overlap because they are all 80 mhz wide with the only difference being whether they're on channel 149 155  or channel 161 155   ie  they all occupy the exact same frequencies so the bars should all be going across 149 161    with 40 mhz networks  the graph appears to be more accurate  however  the bars should be centered over channels 3 and 9 in this case  because those are the center channels      screenshot_20160926 220355  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18857849 3c31c2e2 8435 11e6 8334 5858f4874237 png    screenshot_20160926 223403  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18858346 696389fe 8439 11e6 9d98 fe9281472e90 png   i'm basing some of my expectations on wavemon  wavemon has a lot of information  but obviously it is a cli program intended for pcs  maybe tapping on an ap or ssid in the ap list could provide increased details similar to wavemon output  there could also be some advanced display options in the settings menu     screenshot_20160926_231230  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7505951 18859062 c5b39ae6 843e 11e6 8898 fa9699502fb5 png   hopefully  my suggestions are helpful  i know that some of the non foss wifi utilities are also lacking in regards to ht vht networks  thanks for taking the time and looking into this

if i can do something for ffurther details  give me a hint 
okey  i see we should've avoided the cycle in the first place   are there any preferable way of deferring the registration  as a first draft i'm doing a "lazy lookup" from the applicationcontext on the first call on foorepository from foomapstore  but it feels a bit awkward    
sure  waiting for update 
hi  mavlarn    just having controller started itself without any agent running is causing 100  cpu usage  i have agents on physically different machines   i am not sure if this is just some kind of ngrinder startup process where it can make too much load however it is 100  even after long time since controller was started

hii there   thanks for replying   i think my issue is not same as #77  in my case openiab is working for android but not properly   issue 1   if you press on purchase button in my game  then google's popup for iap is coming properly  even you can purchase product successfully but after purchasing openiab's onpurchasesuccessful callback is not executing  so i am calling queryinventry   in a loop to check if user purchased any product or not   so it is my first issue that onpurchasesuccessful callback never called   issue 2   after launching game  if you press purchase button very first time in my game  then google's popup for iap is coming properly but this time don't buy anything just press back button to cancel iap popup  now you get back to game  now again press purchase button  this time google's popup for iap will not come  why it is not coming second time    but in code  openiab is calling onpurchasefailed callback  so this was my 2nd issue   just to see this issue  please download my game from given google play link  if you have free time   it will be nice if you guys provide latest openiab unity package for unity 4 3 as i don't know how to build unity package from source master

thanks for response   i am using android ndk r14b   i don't think this is include path related   even the clang tool which is used seems to be wrong when going through android_library  using external local_config_cc wrapped_clang rather than external android_ndk ndk toolchains llvm prebuilt darwin x86_64 bin clang    note in bazelrc i am using   android_crosstool_top  android_ndk   toolchain libcpp rather than blanket   crosstool_top   external android crosstool   if i build through android_binary rather than android_library things work well   also need to explicitly add lib path   linkopt  lexternal android_ndk ndk sources cxx stl llvm libc++ libs armeabi v7a to build   this is on top of include file workaround mentioned in #3923

sorry my code is on an internal network and i cannot post it  all i can say is i followed the instructions posted here for swagger springmvc 0 8 4  i am completely xml based with no custom config files  too much out of scope work to migrate to java config based so i'm kinda stuck  from the readme md  my config now includes     mvc annotation driven        mvc message converters            bean class "my messageconverter"           mvc message converters       mvc annotation driven       bean class "com mangofactory swagger configuration springswaggerconfig"      mvc resources mappings "  html" location " "      mvc default servlet handler     so it seems to me that i'm confined to using your provided config class and annotations  i think my troubles are confined to the  api annotation on my controller  it seems the description is ignored and  from a reply from ron on swagger swaggersocket googlegroups com  so is the basepath  my annotation is set to    api value "roles"  description "operations on roles"  basepath "mycontextroot"    displayed in swagger ui is     roles   roles             try it out     so the second "roles" above should be the description and the "try it out" request url used is missing the context root   from ron  "as for the context root  that sounds like your basepath is misconfigured and does not include the context root of your application "  any help appreciated

i think the design of  addhttpheader  is pretty good because i don't have to implement a  webviewclient  callback to add custom headers   my point is  i used it at first  but it seem not to work so i went the custom  webviewclient  way   calling  addhttpheader  is pretty more convenient but it seem not to be working 
how do i update to 0 10 0 snapshot  just change the build gradle and reload project 
 hazeliao yeah sure  i appreciate the help  if more information is required let me know 
no it isn't  this is the simple second hard disk in the system  i'll try to configure docker manually  but it seems  that this won't help

yes  it could be a feature propose   it could be usefull for users who want to whitelist certain apps and have xposed modules who use  arbitrary packages  like the one i'm building   you can look here for an example   https   github com firefds firefdskit blob pie app src main java sb firefds pie firefdskit xsecsettingspackage java which is called by https   github com firefds firefdskit blob pie app src main java sb firefds pie firefdskit xposed java  the hooks inside  xsecsettingspackage  use  com samsung android settings   and the class is loaded only when the applicationid is  com android settings 
confirmed that this issue has been resolved  thank you

i am using the dev setup with the provided files from here
 subjunk according to the report  it doesn't show video media when browsing  only empty folders  
thank you for the response    i've narrowed this to a more reasonable reprex  the issue still persist in v1 2 1522  what i find curious however is that the issue does  not  occur when interacting directly with r  nor  with rstudio 1 2 1335  it only occurs with version  after  the current rstudio stable release  below is some console output  you might be right that this   000  that comes from a failed installation is from devtools  whatever the case though this only fix i've found is to uninstall r and then manually delete that file then re install  i think the central issue is that  r cmd install  is not running correctly with rstudion v1 2 1522 as the package builds fine  🤷‍♂    details   summary  strong call with rstudio 1 2 1522  strong   summary      details 
nothing in that area was altered  i reinstalled the v2 2 released on spigot and the issue seems to be gone  not sure whether it was a restart or jar change that fixed it 
i receive the error when the query is selected before run     default  https   user images githubusercontent com 16996529 33166655 bfdf3d06 d086 11e7 9f2d b34080c76f1f png     default  https   user images githubusercontent com 16996529 33166674 d69313d8 d086 11e7 8e9b 7facddf56608 png 
i wish i could   however it is an   intermittent   problem   so much so that re running the command   without any changes   usually succeeds  which indicates some non deterministic order      furthermore  it happens relative rarely  especially since we added   djava util array legacysort true   so i could try it 100 times and   maybe   have it fail once  and even if it does not fail  it does not mean that bug is fixed   it may just be harder to time it correctly     i have not had enough time to really dwell into the comparison logic  but it seems quite complex  perhaps one should first brainstorm from scratch  as if writing it for the 1st time   decide on the   exact   list of the comparison "tie breakers" and then implement them   e g      ranked comes before after un ranked   if both ranked  then rank decides order   versioned before non versioned   if both versioned then version decides order   repeatable before after whatever other  etc    state x comes before state y  if state is an _enum_ than   exact   order of   all   states    finally  if both of same type then description decides order

never mind it's just some albums that i downloaded recently and that put a   between each artist name   but the issue is real  i rebuild my entire library and it's the same on the nightly    yes it work perfectly  it's only on the other views 
 clintongormley sure thing  i am using 1 6 0 locally just haven't needed to upgrade prod yet   loading my full dataset   5 5mln documents  into 1 7 2 and running the same query shows 4 5 shards failing   response error 
sent you a new crash report  my os is brand new and nope have no second device
yes  i can confirm it does the same on build 1330 but i haven't tried it with builds older than that one 
yes liteloader  is not detected  because authme send player on hub fast
ahh  hmm   you are correct  those tests are in fact marked local  whoops  this can probably be closed non actionable then   though as an interesting side note  nothing that _isn't_ local ends up in java log  which i think is what mislead me  are other execution strategies supposed to generate log lines as well 
its a map mod

after further testing i've found it happens when legacy mode is enabled 
 efraespada  thankyou for your help  but i still cannot test 0 8 version  i get gradle sync error   "could not find com stringcare plugin 0 8" version 0 6 or 0 7 have no gradle sync error  only v0 8 show me error log   about fingerprint  i understand difference between app and library  if i use same signature for app   lib  then fingerprint also same  right  i will manage that carefully 
i were using the latest mod  which was flagged as "release"     image  https   user images githubusercontent com 49346764 57695283 24e49e80 764e 11e9 850a 4fe44c57f5e8 png    there is my list of my all mods    image  https   user images githubusercontent com 49346764 57695049 8f490f00 764d 11e9 9dc4 f72bd8c17169 png   and no  i have downloaded those mods separately 
it sets in the config and   lp info  reports it properly  not sure what you mean by static contexts here 
 fromage just the modules that the typechecker already knows about  of course that list is very incomplete 
it did indeed fix the issue  we are currently looking if there are still issues on some devices  so far it looks like the workaround is doing it's job  https   github com qabel qabel android commit 1cecf3f7037ebd970f35bf06811b82fddafa032b
working as expected  thank you

 mahikaw sure  just one thing to point out if the problem was in the data itself it would always give me a nullpointerexception right  but i don't face the exception now  its weird  i guess it is mostly a network related problem  do check it out

 a93h thanks for the response  sorry it's taken me a while to reply  but it's hard to really get answers for you  it's not often i actually play music on my phone  so it's hard to know what's changed between instances  however i can say that one time i played a full album which was successfully scrobbled  and then a minute or two later i played a song by a different artist and it didn't scrobble  definitely no reboots or anything in between 
yes the directory also exists and writable for anybody
no  it says script loaded successfully 
browser  does this mean that the browser does not open the app  but redirects to another page  it indeed happens in the browser  not in the app  it looks like the browser does not open the oauth page but instead forwards the user to the create config page on the user portal    with my very limited knowlegde on this  when the token is being sent back to the user  oauth wants to make sure that the user approves  it does this by showing a screen where the user can approve or reject       screenshot_20161103 135828  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 12334213 19966900 275eb6a2 a1ce 11e6 9289 329c5b2cb3fe png   the new config screen i am talking about is this screen  https   labrat eduvpn nl portal new

i don't think so unless you have changed anything  it was java language  clean sonar without additional plugins  docker version with h2 database migrated into container 
hi david  thank you for the correction  i'm not sure what the master branch is  i tried using these function for a groovy script instead of the imagej ones  since i mostly write script that i distribute to my imaging facility users  i'll prefer to test the modification once the ijpb update site is updated  rémy
my specific use case was i was creating my own welcome page plugin for the che theia editor  but the default che welcome page was still showing up   so i asked in https   github com eclipse che theia issues 95 if there was some way to disable hide exclude the default welcome plugin  and one of the suggestion was i could set some env variable   hence i wanted to see how i can pass the variable to the editor  i asked the question more generally for editor and plugins because i'm thinking there may be similar use cases 
i have prepared example app  https   github com pawelj pl spring security csrf error how to reproduce error   1  build and run app  because of spring session  it requires redis listening on localhost  i've used redis docker image  2  in web browser go to endpoint   do something    get  request  3  you will be redirected to login page  enter username   user  and password printed in console 4  you will be redirected to page with content  qwerty   copy session cookie 5  using curl  or similar tool  send  post  request to endpoint   do something   and use cookie from previous step  6  you will see stacktrace in response  because csrf token has not been provided

no  i need to delete this folder by hand regularly once or twice a year so that my phone don't stop working because of full storage  the folder gets so large every time again and contains much data of caches i deleted long time before  last time i did this was at the 17 8 2016   i know that the folder is not empty with much caches in database but it should be with an empty database  for people who plan a lot of tours outside their homezone its getting bigger and bigger in the moment 
i think i might have a solution using docker    build args  feature  i'll maybe have a pr later today

hi markus  i did a clean install of the 0 10 x64 binary from cryptomator org on a different machine   the problem reproduces on the new machine   here is the script i used   dd if  dev zero of xxx dat bs 1024k count 500 rm  f z  yyy dat cp xxx dat z  yyy dat rm  f z  zzz dat cp xxx dat z  zzz dat   sleep 15 # wait for encryption to get started cp z  yyy dat   cmp xxx dat yyy dat  the key to reproducing seems to be making sure that the encryption and decryption are happening at the same time   on the first machine  i reproduced it in windows explorer  pausing the decryption until the encryption showed up in throughput graph  then resume the decryption so they ran concurrently

 thboileau is this a restlet bug  or could be something else    komasoftware yes hibernate validator is there  also bean validation works just right in client side  so my idea is this is a serialization bug of restlet    as the clientproxy works just fine if i remove the annotations 
hi fabio   sorry  the mq broker cluster environment is absolutely independent from payara domain configuration  you dont need to start appserver for reproducing  practically remote type  but we still use parallel inprocess embedded configuartion in payara to achieve the "usesharedsubscriptioninclusteredcontainer" feature for topic subscriptions and lookup from code to the not configured remote instances  so the embedded instances not in use  but this is a long story  it is not related to this case    imqbroker start command  modified with loglevel parameter as workaround  on 2 server nodes    bin imqbrokerd exe  silent  force  name instance_x  vmargs "some_mem_args"  loglevel warning    mq etc imqenv conf  original +java home    imq_default_javahome c  program files java jdk1 8 0_131    mq instances instance_x props config properties  with many cluster  port and mssql server jdbc persistence parameters  and with the ineffective log level option    imq log level warning

hey   the latest version of syncthing has fixed this issue for me  it's got an uptime of 19 hours now  which is way more than it ever got before   just thought you should know  though  that the update completely wiped my syncthing configuration  i'll be making backups from now on

 serge rider you're right  i upgraded to v5 0 2 and it works  thanks 
i will give it another try  i have already spent a few minutes looking into the bug   
thanks  mikecroft   however need a clarification  we updated from glassfish3 to payara some time back for glassfish3 we used to disable chunking on the http listener and not admin listener  is there any specific reason for change in functionality  
i am using version  14 1 1 rc 3   as for security i meant my own security issues without encrypyion as information that would be passed is sensitive i do apologize for the confusion   as a simple request  would it be possible to add an optional password to the encryption so if you don't have the password you cannot read the encrypted data  i just want as much informational security as possible 
i am using jdk 1 8 0_60   it appears the problem is triggered by the following configuration element that one of my developers added to the pom    pre           lt finalname gt   artifactid  lt  finalname gt    pre   when i change this to the following  the problem goes away    pre           lt finalname gt   project artifactid  lt  finalname gt    pre

my controller   if "test2" method will be removed  data model for for "test1" is absent 
since i have default navigation set by me to map instead of the installation default   compass  it quite frequently happen that i open a cache from the map  then perform an action that takes me to the map  though not via the back path 
that bug only happened in the past  when i didn't have imported a testnet adress yet  just after i did that  i was able to change the password  and i didn't do any reinstalling process until now 
well i've changed my image loading library for that part of the project  i tried to reproduce it in a sample project and found out a similar problem  i created two activites  first one has a button to start the second one  in the second activity i've the image view with the circular reveal animation  when i start the second activity for the first time  it works fine  but when i press back and start the activity again the image view stays invisible until the animation ends  and just flashes and became visible  here is the sample code 
well this sounds more complex indeed and in the end is not error prone due to concurrency issues     i suppose locks would prevents database corruption and just throws errors in stetho   maybe for applications that needs to keep database opens add a callback in the instance builder to ask the application for the sqliteconnection or whatever stetho needs on target database

odb community edition 2 1 15 the server does not start  error message is "the orientdb_home environment variable is not defined correctly"   i found that this is a resulting error of java not being part of path environment variable  after adding the java exe containing folder to the path variable it worked 
i just tested the apk you did here  https   github com beemdevelopment aegis issues 114#issuecomment 498031034  the app doesn't crashes and i'm able to end the wizard  looks good   you need more logs  else  when do you think it'll be available in f droid 
no  i increased the rarity on a few  but all are enabled 
so i had an idea as a workaround  but i haven't been able to get it to work  i've had two different results  so in one test  i created another videoview  used the videocapturer class with the create local video track method to get the camera  the videoview was hard coded at 640x480  i created another localvideotrack using viewcapturer to get the view from the videoview and put that in the primaryvideoview  in that test  it was black  i'm not sure if it's an issue with creating multiple localvideotracks  or if it's an issue trying to capture a dynamic child in an element  the other test was using the same videoview and same localvideotrack  i built the first localvideotrack and captured the camera on the primaryvideoview  then i created another localvideotrack over the old videotrack without stopping it and added the renderer to the primaryvideoview  this caused the view to flash strobe  when connecting to a room with another participant  it would flash strobe between your camera and the participants camera without instantiating the thumbnail view  do you think that somewhere in the viewcapturer method is a possibility of sharing the camera with the constraints  and maybe i'm just not doing something right 
ok i will do 
hi serge   figured out the gotcha  requires an active sql editor window open before the query builder becomes active   is not a bug  just an obscured command

hi  yes this is from the chrome browser if i don't mangle createofeer sdp at all  i also were thinking about that  and did few more tests  even if i mangle all unused stuff from sdp and leaving only vp8 feedback and rtx  still issue apeers to be the same  https   pastebin com vh4byb7h  only after i remove  payload type xmlns "urn xmpp jingle apps rtp 1" name "rtx" at all  then it start to pass thru 
i don't recall the cursor flashing but then the actual dialog hadn't finished rendering when alt tabbing away so no property field was active   note that being full screen isn't required for this to happen though i'm fairly sure the op was running full screen   was only able to reproduce this with a large number of token properties and the edit token dialog took several seconds before it finished rendering the properties tab 
i have no idea  but it's a good question  the only thing i know is that http   r2d2 devnet vaadin com viewtype html buildtypeid flow_flowreleasedemos job is responsible for that 
sorry for the misuderstanding  snicoll  spring cloud contract needs a configuration to switch to junit 5 but i think that since spring boot 2 2 x use junit 5 by default we can consider adding this configuration properly    wdyt 
these are the main issues  1  the error message is ambiguous so the user does not know what the problem is   the app or the server  2  there is an empty folder made when this happens which is undesirable  3  the app has the "try again" feature but is not offered in this case   returning a specific error message would be too much work considering the possible pururin errors   how bout a general "server error" message and then offering to try again similar to download errors  and a folder should only be made if the links are parsed successfully and an image is ready to be downloaded   the above suggestions should fix the main issues but please do not consider them to be the best solutions  if there's any way you can fix the above issues with less work then that's great  good luck

not every time  its a one time thing for this upcoming update  i've written most of the code and will probably be making the change within the next day or two  so people me included  will have to click the clear _clear database_ button  and rescan their libraries    i just did some thinking about this  and you're right  but i still need a way to uniquely link an uploader's computer to the songs they've chosen to share though    i think i'm going to go with the uploader's mac address  that'd uniquely identify the uploader  without compromising their network location    that's not an issue here  the original uploader is the person who creates the  torrent file  no one else can  because song's are unique  when another person clicks play  they're just grabbing the torrent file that the original uploader made

there weren't any machines or anything attached to it  nor any close enough to have done it anyway   for inventory management however  forestry backpacks  shift+right click on block with the backpack to dump  and quark are present on the server  so there's that possibility  i will test with both of these later when i get the chance

i took a look at the logs in the mail server  hmailserver   and there is a clear difference between the dummy message and the alert message  i'm not an expert in mail servers or the process by which they manage messages  but it looks like the following is happening    graylog2 requests to send mail   the mail server creates a session   graylog2 sends ehlo and authenticates   the mail server checks the from and to   graylog2 communicates parts of the message back and forth with the mail server   the mail server logs "sent  221 goodbye" then ends the session   the message is then written to disk and a session with the smtp deliverer is started relaying the message via gmail   after being sent  the message is deleted from the disk  when a real message  non dummyalert  is sent  the session between the mail server and graylog2 gets interrupted  the "sent  xxx goodbye" message is never logged  below is the logging although it isn't very revealing     i have been able to line up the last  sent  354 ok  send   message with the java exception  there are no errors in the hmailserver log at all

hi  unfortunately no because i am using gumtree v2 1 3 which includes treedelete and treeinsert  there are not yet implemented in the current version of gumtree spoon    or do you want me to try to see if the behavior is the same  
 gashcrumb that's right the sample should use a google sheets connector or an api provider where the finish connection is able to use some collection shape
no  the old map is overwritten    because the user selected "new map"  not "edit map" 
corrupted library is unlikely to be the cause  as i got the same result from the app built on 3 different computers  i’ll wipe gradle cache and retest  just to double check   did you run your app with   duser language tr   
i've added hyperlinks to the resources  you can run into this issue when creating updating apps through the rest api  importer or data explorer

that's true   thought it was stored but it was my browser   sounds to me though this is a bigger issue and requires a notification to an email or something to say hey login again  will have a think 
the delay before the sound is switched back is roughly a second as far as i can measure it   the issue doesn't occur with three pin mini jack connectors apparently   however  some of the problem depends on the application  as it doesn't happen with e g  vlc

if you mean the option "autosave local libraries" in options   file  then no  this was not checked   however  i just noticed that there is a setting that may have made this a bit less frustrating  under "library properties" there is the option "refuse to save the library before external changes have been reviewed" which appears to have been set by default  unsetting this will at least let me simply save the library even when jabref incorrectly thinks for some reason it has been modified on the disk 
so  the end result is that i had to copy the entire assets dir to the parent directory of the jar  and then reference it through libgdx normally  since gradle exports everything inside of the  assets  directory to the classpath of the jar  i had to put everything inside of a subdirectory called  resources     when launching the jar  the assets directory will be extracted to the   working directory    this means that if your working directory parameter in intellij is blank  it will attempt to copy the files to the root of the project _i think_  below is an example of a working jar configuration    screenshot from 2015 10 21 20 51 25  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 7645647 10646802 87a249b6 7835 11e5 8b97 8afcc289c35d png

hi  rwinch  i am using the 8 5 4 version of tomcat  i went back to 4 1 1 and everything works fine again  is there anything about my wildcard urls that could cause this w v4 1 2 
i switched again to sr and it seems to work again  must have been a weired coincidence that caused this bug    believe me  i installed and reinstalled snorlax and sr and several times and every time  i started with sr  i had this bug   
when i open the world  it may have something to do with other mods  but i'm not sure what it could be  as  those were the mods that seems to change textures when they were added or removed  i can give a full mod list if needed

hi  i added 3 tests  2 failing  1 succeeding  that show the bug and created a pull request for it   best regards jan
there's no magic so far  here the menu button in the header     checked the code of materialsidenav but i don't understand it yet  i don't see where i could hook in the debugger in chrome to see why it invokes the close anyhow   i tried to set the property as well on initialisation phase in code   rightsidenav setcloseonclick false    but debugging this showed that it doesn't have an effect at all  the property within the materialsidenav isn't used anymore  it is only used on initialization  so manipulating this doesn't have any effect later on  this might as well be a small issue but isn't this one here as i have the property set as well in the markup 
 eivantsov you're right  now it works fine 
i haven't been able to pin it to a specific query   i do have one query which usually takes several hours  4+  to run    if it ever returns at all   whenever i run it i start singing 'charlie and the mta' to myself with "the man who never returns" replaced with "the query who never returns"  wish i could feed it as sandwich as it went by     it is the one i would suspect the most      match  n   r      where not has r some_property  return count r 
alright  if you place a inactivated division signal in a crafting bench normal it would give you some iron  if you add the recipe to the autocrafter to transfer it into iron  it will make the iron and retain the signal  allowing you to keep putting it in the crafter and duplicate iron 
i think it was checking unchecking a checkbox in the 'impling' settings page  i reproduced the bug  game freeze  when unchecking it  a min ago   but did not get any message in error log   after restarting game i can check uncheck it again without any bugs  so might only happen after playing for some time  same is true for other  similar  bugs

okay this is very odd  i downloaded the source via the releases  and downloaded the latest over there  once i extract said zip  i get a lot more classes than there are in this repository   edit  i just figured out that the releases is about the whole repo  not branch dependant  whoops    i guess it is a fail on my end  im sorry for my derpyness  ill just the get the api directly from this repository since this is supposed to be stable  p   however  i found out this is happening in the nextgen branch  i definitely derped earlier   since that is the latest release  here is a list of the api's which import from inner classes    buildcraft api blueprints     mappingregistry     schematic     schematicblock     schematicentity     schematicmask     schematictile   buildcraft api core      position   buildcraft api filler     ifillerpattern  i kinda hope im right about those  otherwise it is really embarrassing for me   anyway  i hope i kinda helped and now i can develop my mod     and off topic  this really is an  awesome mod

it looks like the right side only does that on larger screen sizes  if i shrink my window size  jei moves back to the correct position   favorites side of jei does seem to be working   as to why the curios button isn't there  i'm not sure why  it's in the top right corner  but invisible  i can still click on it too 
custom functions that have behaviour similar to 'if'  for example if expr1 value1 expr2 value2      defaultvalue  where the first exprn to evaluate to true returns valuen else defaultvalue  early evaluation causes all args to be evaluated which could cause the whole evaluation to fail even though those args may never be relevant  an extreme example would be alwaysreturntrue argthatisignored  where argthatisignored is something like 'foo' + 1  i think that should cause an error   the spec says says that args are evaluated early unless otherwise stated but this is in reference to the definitions of the builtin functions  'if' being one of the stated exceptions

this no longer affects downstream directly as we've removed the che icons from crw's plugin view   https   issues redhat com browse crw 561  so    if everyone is cool with the ugliness in the light theme as it stands today in che  then we can close this in favour of #14510    i don't see a pr linked from that issue  am i blind 

i am fine with providing it to you personally to investigate  but do not want to publish it publicly  i'll see if i can provide a sanitized stripped down simple example

hi  mrioan sorry for not providing more details for reproducing this issue  though i did refer to the spring security event  authenticationsuccessevent  rather than the stormpath specific event  successfulauthenticationrequestevent     previous to the 1 x release of the stormpath sdk you used to be able to detect a successful login in a non stormpath specific way using just the standard documented spring securty approach  i e  just create a service that implements  applicationlistener authenticationsuccessevent    e g  something like this     this no longer works  for the reasons outlined above   i've switched over to the stormpath specific approach as outlined in the  events section  https   docs stormpath com java spring boot web events html  of stormpath's spring boot docs  i e  using  requesteventlisteneradapter  as you mention   this works fine   so i will stick with this   but the original bug still stands  i e  that the standard spring security approach that used to work in the rc releases no longer works in the 1 x releases   but i'd rate this low priority now that you've pointed me at an alternative solution

66 for sure   both because it matches the io menu and because  everything  isn't another level down   it does make the 74xx  basic collection strange in the component tree because it breaks them into 3 levels   maybe build separate organizational constructs for each to take advantage of their differences   even when the menu is too tall i can still get to the items via the tree in 0 18release   is there a way to remove the icons from the menu items   maybe only show the last 3 or 5 selected parts in a menu so it has less of a growth factor   then there could be more items before a sub menu is needed

thank you for your reply  sorry  my english is not very good     let me clarify it again。  i use the tomcat plug in as the container of  eruka dependence spring boot2 ，run with intellijidea。   "server content path" is no longer recommended      this line  is still used    outdated  “server content path”   on this line of the class   he will lead to the healthcheckurl is not my actual address  that's what i mean   
kind of tight for time  though i do appreciate the scaffolding for unit testing that you provided   i do think though that my description of the problem is complete enough such that you should be able to take one of your unit tests and reproduce this

i think there can be used  code getresourceasstream    code  of classloader after adding of embedded jar by way described in http   stackoverflow com questions 5602367 how to load a resource from an embedded jar file but it doesn't seem good idea  i don't know how it should work  it's very strange that  code getresourceasstream  code  doesn't work in windows if path starts with backslash  it looks like a bug of java  for example  code resolvename    code  method of java lang class uses " " instead of file separator inside  i think  code  replaceall "  "  " "   code  may be used as workaround in this case 
it looks like there is a different problem  i was trying to put together a pr to fix the line length and i realized what  svilenvul mentioned   line length is not one of the checks in the rules xml   so digging into this some more  i found that the rules xml is not being used at all  instead  checkstyle is executing sun_checks xml  appears to be the default   it looks like the settings from the plugin are not executing  but the the goals are   it runs checkstyle  findbugs  and pmd    because the properties are not being used  it is dropping the checkstyle result xml in target  rather than target code analysis  so the merge fails and report html is zero bytes  if i manually copy the checkstyle result xml to the code analysis folder and run again without 'clean' it will generate the report  but it is of course using the default rules   originally i was executing as
i use mssql we also wondered why query passes without exceptions even if script is incorrect  the problem occured when we tried to create foreign key with wrong data type  flyway ran patch  foreign key was not added to the table  but patch was marked as executed in schema_version table  then i tried to use execute batch  because according to the spec  it throws batchupdateexception  a subclass of sqlexception  if one of the commands sent to the database fails to execute properly or attempts to return a result set  further research showed that execute does not throw exception if first query in the patch ran successfully  as far as i see it happens if foreign key  problem occurs  did you try to reproduce this bug adding new patch to flyway samle project

fails in the same way as above  tumor or other "above" thresholded cells are not classified  the warning isn't important  but it did let me figure out why i thought the command wasn't working overall when loaded   it does create "above" objects and classify them when initially creating the classifier   and in case anyone else comes across this  you can work around the current problem with scripting  create the below threshold objects  assuming an either or situation  and then invert the annotation and delete the first set

 mrniko what do you mean by "utf 8 for sources"   is it default encoding for jvm process  if yes  then it isn't a good solution   i don't want my software to depend on server locale     actually  converting my string to iso_8859_1 damages it  so client cannot restore it further

i would if i could  but i have no video recording software  i can describe a scenario using some photos  however   on my mini isla nublar i've been building  part of the tour road goes past the aviary and up a gentle incline to a cliff road  like this   2018 07 25_00 11 37  https   user images githubusercontent com 41495834 43180753 661b92aa 8f9f 11e8 9fa8 a9383a8b89ae png   the reason the tour track is like this is because the explorer completely failed to travel up the slope with the original  straighter tour path  i initially thought that was because the slope was too sudden and the car wasn't allowed to correct itself before going up another slope  so i fiddled with the track to make the parts where the explorer is level again longer  at first  it worked  but i tried doing a test run of the whole tour again today and the explorer went about halfway up the slope before turning around and traveling back down  so  i went to the spot where it had turned around and i meddled with the placement of the track a bit  touching none of the other bits of track  and tried again from the very bottom and 20 blocks away  this time  the explorer didn't even climb one slope before turning around again  despite the track having not been altered at the bottom in any way  here is the same screenshot with the spots where the car failed to climb the hill pointed out  as well as the starting point    failure  https   user images githubusercontent com 41495834 43180949 7c5aa6ea 8fa0 11e8 8b20 a327e4262d50 png  if possible  i'll try to find some recording software and record the bug in action  as well as any attempts to work around it  to demonstrate how bizarre it is 

changing the toolbox to not extend tlc causes it to marker a symmetric set of model values as broken  this is because it requires the "permutations s " operator from the tlc standard module  a fix is to insert a local definition of "permutations s " into the mc tla file generated by the toolbox similar to what is done in commit 640df81 and 5249fa5 
sorry for the belated reply  we are having problems with updating at this point  will do our best to fix them asap and get back to you  or try to create a quickstart of some kind to test  and demonstrate if the problem still exists  with the latest version 
hello   thank you for your response    "why are you attempting to log within the dofilter method itself "   a couple of reasons   use cases  1  loggingfilter   the sole reason it exists is to log the path  request path   time of request  user who made the request etc 2  somexauthorizationfilter   which does some authorization checks and logs basic information including "user u attempting to perform an action a with and some request parameters"  we are currently using micronaut filters for both these reasons   one of the workarounds we have thought of is to replace filters with interceptors because we found that logging inside filter method is not instrumented for tracing   hope that helps  your inputs on this will be valuable

it's a good thought  but my gut is to leave it as is   here's a couple reasons     if a misformed mat file happens to have the  global  flag set in a non root array  what would you do   ignore it   throw an error    looking at the  matfile  interface  the only way to get the  isglobal    value is through the  iterable namedarray  getentries      that's okay  but it's a little awkward for people who care about the  isglobal    but want to access via map or index  it's not crazy to change it  but it does seem like a bit of an impedance mismatch with the file format   it's too bad that there's a mismatch between the underlying format and the semantic meaning  but there's too many mat files out there to change it now    
looks good to me

exactly  i was referring to that  from what i saw  currently the algorithm that bootsfaces uses is just to concatenate  alert   plus   user provided string    that allows the user to easily customize  but it should be documented i think   i can do a pr for that 
as per the pervious link i believe this is a sam docker issue wrt storage where the class path ends up being broken due to failed mounting or scp  awslabs aws sam cli#1092
hello jurgen  i will close this issue because it was related for sure to the size of the image we wanted to save but the size was incredibly big and unrealistic due to our miscalculation 
hi  syvasoft we use it functionality for call a custom form in a window  then when you press the button  the form is launched instead the process  the next step for it is make form dynamically for the "create from" like "create from" in purchase order or statement account   we are change it in https   github com adempiere adempiere issues 114
i always read the data then explicitly close the cursor asap  this is possibly a problem in sqlite android binding  but i have no time to get a minimal test case now    
 rohanmars that approach sounds right to me  but want to look at the prototype to have deeper understand   w r t complex  i think we currently stick to not use complex as a final field type  for ui complex field is a container of fields  not a mappable field  ui never creates a mapping using complex field type  so having complex as a field type of converter fieldaction is a bug  i e  dateconverter has bugs  in the initial code drop  date time related classes were mapped to complex  and mapping them into atlas primitives like date  date_time_tz was a todo  now we've done that  so dateconverter also needs to be changed to use that atlas primitive field types  changing this complex as a container policy causes huge impact through ui  and i don't think we have enough feedback gathered to decide if we should do that or not  i think this was the conclusion in our discussion  mattrpav

apologies for the delay   will use the reproducer to try and make it happen 
would we have to bump the grpc version in google cloud cpp 
if a project is stored in tfs source control  files are ready only unless checked out for edit   and just in general  files can be marked read only to prevent modification    strange i have to state that explicitly 
there are the logs of 2 machines  currently i don't have access to the 3rd one but that computer should have slept at that time   https   dl dropboxusercontent com u 15830762 logs_0 zip https   dl dropboxusercontent com u 15830762 logs_1 zip  i can not remember anything special that occurred at that time  i did some back and force while trying to get the daemon to get to work in launchctl  see https   github com syncany syncany issues 488

 tylerjewell right now all failed containers are not cleaned and swarm reserves ram for them 
might take a bit because 4 3 broadcasts are not very common these days  but i'll try to catch one  i just set up adb for my shield tv  will i get the relevant information by running "adb logcat" while using live channels 
where would it be located  i can't find any other one 
1 7 2 is already released

no  not really a problem  just wanted to have this registered in case it was still an issue in 2 0  so i guess you can close this one

i would be willing to try to test it on my server when there is downtime  however i am not set up to build java projects   i don't suppose there is a place i could get a build   in any case my spawn  with the use    protection  _is_ at 0 0 and goes down to the bottom of the map  so i'm fairly certain this was precisely my issue 
i don't think this is a bigquery client issue   the bigquery client simply tripped over the underlying issue that stringenumvalue isn't safe

 davidjgonzalez  i see that resourceresolver map   is expected to do encoding   i don't know how it is implemented and what kind of encoding it supports  but i have no encoded values in transformed values  i wrote some tests  where it can be seen that ' ' char is not changed after the mapping see https   github com sblano4ka aem_tests blob master src test java com sblano4ka resourceresolvermaptest java  resourceresolvermaptransformerfactory can still decode value but maybe query parameters should be ignored in this case
yeah sure  i still use this database on 2 6 5 every day and never encountered a problem with it  you can find it  here  http   build mcmiddleearth com content mywarp sql 
i have an actual leak     the leak is actually  toposholder  that register itself to the  onpredrawlistener   but is never removed from    clear     is never call for   toposholder    only   fromposholder     so the global layout tree  onpredrawlistener  list keep a reference to   toposholder   indefinitely

i will give it a shot  sadly i don't have a good way to reproduce yet  the fix looks good and makes sense  the allocation release is now symmetrical  other invalid bytes i had were 'l'  'o'  'u'  'c'  this might be related to the way we wrap the connection in ssl 
in the same way as advertised in the docs  'opengrok_verbose true opengrok_instance_base  tank opengrok   opengrok index  tank source' the output won't list any of the files found in the base dir like readme or changelog   
my android system version is 5 1 1 i've tested it and yes it works fine 
lag happens on both mp when the server is not on the mac and sp   happens whenever i am near a stargate   gets really bad if i look at the gate close up   once im 50+ blocks away its fine

i'm not holding on to the call instances  so i'd need something that i can check in the callback  i'm cancelling calls based on their tags  maybe  request iscanceled     although i guess that's not quite right  what would also work is have a specific subclass of ioexception to catch so that i don't have to do this 
it seems to be working fine  i really love the new worldborder  thank you guys

sure   i tried with hikari on oracle  code fails with oracle's too many values exception  caused by inner sql select for user having too many field which can be fixed by specifying attribute  but connection is not returning to pool and it become exausted in no time      we also had connection leaks on network connection losses  requery is super cool  but with connection leaks like that it is hard to use in production   
this is my neo4j properties     basically i installed it from http   debian neo4j org repo on my ubunutu via apt get  the only thing i changed is that i forced it to use my local vanilla oracle java 8 installation 
so the dynamo is not in the same chunk but is nearby  i can simply move the press if that's the case
 nallar   yes the chunk count appears to be perfectly normal  i was thinking maybe cache or something was related   i'll hopefully be able to do another test run soon  not going to upset my players for the moment  i can't reproduce locally so my server is the only thing i'm able to test on   this particular issue does not bother me  as i've had it set to false since i found this out   but i know it is required for things like quarries to work between restarts so people having this option set to true might be suffering 
hi  it must have been some error introduced during updates of the nextcloud app   i deleted cache   storage in android app settings of nextcloud and now it works  let's consider this for a "closed" issue

because it worked ok in chrome 38  fitbounds in leaflet seems to cause this  in leaflet changelog there is one bugfix for infinite loop when changing map center after setting map center  maybe this is it  fix is changing leaflet from 0 5 1 to current 0 7 3  i'm working on pr and testing if this breaks something else  currently it seems that everything is smoother now

 damianszczepanik  thank you for the fix 
yegor  sounds good  the only issue is that with "fully hardcoded" file name you won't be able to run several builds simultaneously  what is usually done on build servers  so i would name this parameter like socketdirectory  which is equal to "data" parameter by default  and use file names like "mysql 2013 12 25 14 00 48  random  sock"   as another alternative  to simplify things for users   you can add parameter like "usetempasdatadir  true false "  if this option is true   a random directory is created inside temp on every build  if this option is false  data is located according to "data" parameter  disadvantage of this solution is that your plugin will be needed to determine "temp" directory location and this is platform dependent thing  don't know whether java allows to do it automatically or not    another solution would be to introduce option like "dataparentdirectory"  user will point you to parent directory like " tmp" or "c  windows temp" and all you need is to create random subdirectory there by yourself  this is easier  but less elegant

hi  here it is  i reinstalled version 1 2 1  now i delete it again because i need a working version 
i don't think it's completely free   for the support case that caused this issue to be raised _some_   ml  indices had been created   so i imagine they restricted auto create after having previously run ml   the same thing could happen in the future   a user could create their first job  thus causing the   ml config  index to be created  then restrict auto creation of indices leading to subsequent problems with ml   so it would be nice to have some other checks that can report the underlying problem with restricted auto creation 
i am using v4 0 9 version
i am alright  how about yourself   i had around 1 2 gb free at the time of the crash
yep  i print the actual values right below the gauge like seen in the video  also  because i knew you would ask 😄  i added debugging code before setting the values that prints the values to console triggers a debugger breakpoint if they are below zero  if needed  i may record a video for that as well 
don't know exactly how it happened maybe during a parsing or typechecking 
so it's the start of a new day and i can see the button on the pr now    not sure what i did differently   the network connectivity is a good thought   i will investigate and get back to you    i am getting a 403 error code pop up  see below     this implies that the 403 is being sent from pasteb in   or if this plugin is hitting a bitbucket api and bitbucket is returning that      image  https   cloud githubusercontent com assets 723989 23463547 27caddf4 fe4f 11e6 86cb 3fde75f1256c png   i can't find anything of interest in the developer tab within chrome 
i use this  plugin  https   github com telerik verified plugins nfc   but i have the same problem with this  plugin  https   github com chariotsolutions phonegap nfc    there seems to be something that does prevent and does not allow the passage of information in the application   i also tried the  babbellab  https   github com babbellab cordova plugin kiosk  fork  but the problem is the same 
correct  an otp can be reused several times because yubikey table does not get updated despite the update method in cauthrealm returns "1" which means success  but actual commit is not done  this line   https   github com biobankcloud cauthrealm blob master src main java se kth bbc crealm customauthrealm java#l462   so in summary  when an otp is used once  it should not be possible to reuse it again

 jelovirt well  it seems the client package is built without xep support anyway   there's something wrong here in both cases  either the doc should mention you can't use xep with the default client distribution  and redirect to how to build the dita ot from source for xep  which actually does not exist  or ship a pre bundled fo jar with xep classes within the client distribution   in any case  let me know if i can write something up about that

 leonard84 the original use case was using grails' testing transformations aka   testfor mycontroller    i found that   log  has the same behavior   putting that demo test in a grails app and using   testfor      instead will reproduce the same results    the weird part is that the compilation error only happens when you add an  assert  statement within a closure    the stacktrace that i see when using   testfor  is very similar 
that's odd  i debugged from eclipse and got correctly  java version 1 8 0_152 and running it from gradle  too  java version 1 8 0_152  when i run the snapshot's jabref exe i get the above dialog  when i run it from command line  java  jar in the snapshot folder c  program files jabref   i get no dialog 
if you can recommend a curse modpack with a server package  i can test it

hi tyler    the idea behind this proof of concept is to build a graphic editor completely agnostic about languages it is processing  uml  bpmn  ecore  adl  jackson notation  flow charts        the piece of software implementing the editor would be the same for every possible language  and language specificities will be encapsulated in the specific object palette and in the language server that would process the diagrams  providing similar services to the ones that current language servers provide to text editors through language server protocol  current graphic tools already provide some of those services  but they have similar issues to the ones that made possible the inception of lsp  as a tight coupling between editors   languages    this aim can be achieved in two different ways  1  generating a text representation of the graphic diagram and using lsp as it is to process that text representation  the path chosen for the proof of concept  2  augment lsp to match requirements to process graphical models  maybe to be able to define a diagram as a list of svg objects with specific properties  this idea is in a very early stage   the usage i envision for a tool like this  is inside the "design studio" component that many high level tools  e g  a telecommunications operator management tool  need to allow users to build their processes  with an approach like this  it would be very easy to add new types of "process" to the tool  just adding an object palette and the language server to process that palette  i feel there is plenty of market for an idea like this  and i also think that che is the ideal platform for such a component   the idea of this query was to get some hints about how to use the code available in the provided languageserver editor in che to build the link between the javascript editor and the language server in the simplest and easiest way     thanks  best regards  alberto

that's it  after cleaning the cache it worked as expected  this solution apparently was too easy for me      maybe it would be a good idea to prevent these pages from caching as long as it is in beta state  or at least to set short expiry dates  e g  maximum 1 day 
the configuration is as follows   #### machin a    ip multiple nic       192 168 109 72      192 168 247 1   role      das      server instance instance1   #### machin b    ip      192 168 109 197   role      server instance instance2    note      node type ssh  machine a 192 168 109 72 and machine b 192 168 109 72 are the same network segment   the host of das is 192 168 109 72   because it is setting das bind address  when instance1 is started in this state  nic of 192 168 247 1 is assigned to instance1  the ip address of instance 2 is 192 168 109 197  domain data grid can not be constructed because address 192 168 247 1 and address 192 168 109 197 can not communicate   in the above case  i would like to specify the nic to be used at instance1   even if you set the data grid discovery mode setting to tcpip and list the addresses to use in tcp   ip instances  this matter could not be avoided

sorry for not responding earlier  i needed to investigate more   it seems the mediainfolib is not multilingual  it only handles "raw" and english names  so it does not matter what language you set  you will only get the english names  or the "raw" ones  if you use the library  which is ums case    the translations to other languages are part of the mediainfo executable and not the library  unless i am totally mistaken of course   to answer your question  we can of course set the ums language there  but it does not matter  it will work exactly the same than with the hardcoded "en"

 pongad our application is trying to dump millions of data objects to other system as part of migration  we use pubsub to publish all such data objects   if the application crashes the only thing we can do is to restart the dump   because the data migrated is very important and not even a single record of this data can be missed   considering the amount of data  over 50m   it becomes impossible to read delta from database  as it becomes really slow with where clauses    thus only option is to restart full dump       but good news is meanwhile i tried some new approach to put some brakes to messages being posted to pub sub  and give it some breathing space  basically we maintain a count which is difference of messages posted and messages delivered   success or failure   whenever that count is greater than 800 we sleep all incoming threads for 12 seconds as rpc total timeout is 10 seconds  to allow pub sub to clear its outstanding messages  as of now i have processed around 30m records and it performed well with 0 failures vs earlier  10  of messages failed    can something similar be added to pub sub out of the box which recognizes when pub sub is overloaded and gives it some breathing space until outstanding messages clear

yes  i'm currently working around this limitation by piping the output to a file   i'm consuming the output in a ci cd deployment pipeline where one step generates the output and another consumes it   thus  i need to persist it to a file instead of piping straight through to the next command

hi   "you don't have permission to access  update nightly  on this server "     g 
 saudet   this comment was updated because i was mistaken   original video size is 854  size of the picture from   ffmpeg   program 854 also and it is with out black line   if not using   setimagewidth   in  ffmpegframegrabber   leave video width 854  the picture contains black line if im setting with   1  image is fine and not containing black line     with width   2 picture also fine   so seems like the problem not with odd values    and seems like changing width to any value  fix this problem somehow

i can provide a bit more detail now  i'm storing basedocuments that i can store without any issue using the arangodb java driver 3 1 0   using driver 4 1 0 documents that cotain strings with non ascii characters such as "·ÃÂ " consistently fail  i'm not getting an error message  but the documents don't get stored in the database  the _key i defined in the document does get reserved  so attempting to insertdocument with the same key will fail with error message   another document i'm not able to store consistently  possibly because of the slashes   is as simple as      "article"        "artist"  "pregardien rheinische kantorei das"      "releasedate"  "1970 01 01"      "composer"  "bach"      "format"  "cd"      "vat"  "h"      "carriers"  1      "label"  "capriccio"      "title"  "bach  st matthew passion bwv244"      "barcode"          "4006408600466"            "conductor"  "max  h "        "stock"        "status"  "rmv"      "lastupdate"  "2016 11 01 00 00"        for the time being  i'll stick to driver 3 1 0   please let me know if you need any more information

 rpappalax it's more related to the android version of the device rather than the actual device  as i've mentioned  android 8 and android 9 devices do not seem to be affected by this issue  only managed to reproduce it on devices with android version   8 
after i input the command and clicked enter  there is no output i waited for just 5 minutes  then got the warn message that the nfs was full i had to kill the snapshot process in the es log there is only "no disk free snapshot failed" the log level is info this is our production environment i tested snapshot in our test environment there is no problem  but our production environment and test environment is different  is it possible because of the environment  what circumstances the snapshot did not consider the index name

normally  the game runs at an average of 35  cpu usage  usually it takes a lot of unoptimized tick heavy mods to start incrementing that number to 100   this mod does it single handedly   and i'm not surprised  if the mod works by looping through all blocks on every tick  that's probably the most inefficient way i could imagine a mod like this to work  it would function exactly the same if it only updated every 20 40 whatever ticks  it could even loop every 5000 ticks  and the update lag still wouldn't be visible 99 9  of the time  because usually worlds have static ores that were created on generation  with none being placed moved afterward

as it happens for me on multiple devices and with many different firmwares and android versions  i didn't mention it   fwiw  right now i caused it to happen on a nexus 7 tilapia and a galaxy nexus maguro  both are running paranoidandroid 3+ with android 4 2 2  on the n7  i've got the build dated 2013 02 14 and on the gnex the build from 2013 02 15   this is _not_ a paranoidandroid issue  i also had it with other firmwares  like with cm10 1 or aokp on the n7   as it does not depend on the rom or the device  i don't think it's worthwhile to spend time digging in this direction  am 18 02 2013 06 18 schrieb "a iv" notifications github com

this i am not sure  by definition  a reliability function should be 1 at time 0 and 0 at infinity  so both degenerated function either violate the condition at 1 or at infinity  consider for example the evaluator for the first moment and a constant 1 function  not to mix with constant failure rate   the area below the curve is then infinity  i think we should check what happens to our framework  one may be able to tolerate degenerated functions  giving the user respective strange results  i am just unsure whether all our approximations etc  terminate  should we go ahead and enable degenerated functions  then we should possibly create a branch and check all functions  follow up question would then be  should we create a marker for reliabilityfunctions that decay to a degenerated function  something like "isdegenerated "  this could ease the consideration also for tests  several functions can be easily configured to become degenerated  linear term with empty lhs

block tiles seem to already be loaded in the way cervator was suggesting  getting a list of every asset file of that type  then processing them all in  worldatlasimpl   i'm pretty sure that that should be possible for blocks  too  as all block registered with the  blockmanager  come from either block family assets or auto tiles  blocks with no special properties  specified only by their textures   it should definitely at least be possible to continue using block families in the same way  only explicitly mentioning the family for registration  not the individual blocks  
double seems like a much more logical choice for the default  i only said bigdecimal due to wondering what the expected behavior is when the value is out of range

there's more to the fix than i mentioned  you are right  _state  is serialized  i think  but i work around it   when declaring the topology  _state _state  gets set to  none    now we only attempt to import the c++ module  _streamsx_ec  when one of the methods is called  from a running topology   thus when we check to see if the module is supported  only streams 4 2 and python 3 5 currently  the first time we see  _state  is none so try to import  _streamsx_ec    based upon the success of that we set  _state  to reflect supported or not  and if supported set up the additional state we need

yes  switching to async would certainly solve the issue  though that would require some kind of persistence to avoid dropping messages when the application shuts down  which effectively duplicates directoryresender   i am not sure if this issue is really relevant for most users  the core problem is "sync" resending  which might be an edge case   the way we are currently using the lib requires sync  re  sending  so for the moment we are going forward with the modified messageprocessor   so maybe you don't need to "fix" anything  possibly document the problem w r t  immediateresender  or even deprecate it   i mainly wanted some feedback  feel free to close as wontfix

i cannot pause my phone playing after using librespot java  even if i kill the app as soon as it loads it starts playing again  the only way to fix it is to connect to another spotify connect server  like the web player  when ever i press pause whilst playing on phone  a lot of information scrolls up the console window from librespot  i don't think it matters whether the music is playing or not when you switch back to phone  i built from source today and the problem is the same  i'm using an android phone and running librespot on windows 10

when i found the old issue  i had a setup with a neromantic prime and the chalice with lava was filled by exu2 nodes from a mekanism tank  when i decided i had enough sand i broke the eveshifting fountains support structure  which resulted in an odd value of starlight in the chalice  which i think comes form the fountain extracting random values out of the chunk reservoir  the infinity from #440 is fixed  as the chalices now gets completely drained of their excess fluid although producing an interaction   now to test the fix i explicitly set up xnet to replicate the problematic values in the tanks   which i am sure can also be achieved with every other automation control mod capable of fluid routing in explicit value    if i read your code right  chalice interaction samples an interaction for the general liquid types   then drain the tanks for maxdrain   interaction given drain   ignoring the possibility that there might be less amount of fluid in the tanks as maxdrain  which is the implementation of ifluidhandler dodrain int max  bool simulate     then spawn the lightshow which will trigger the drop when the entities meet   this should also results in the possibility to get a rock crystal drop with only 10mb starlight remaining which should only be sufficient for sand  this is possible with only astral sorcery  highly random  but the chance is   0  rng

 sunix i would distinct two issues here  1  che server token must not be sent to plugin devfile registries  2  add an ability to configure plugin devfile registries as secure  should we use keycloak token for that or another one   it's implementation details   it may seem easy to solve but if we take into account that users may want to use different registries  some maybe not secured by the same keycloak as is used for che server  and che server should be able to access all of them maybe it should be reworked and client should provide everything downloaded  then it does not seem so easy to solve and imho it should be solved separately  if we need it

it's a similar symptom  but most likely a different cause  in 1 10  null item stacks were allowed  so the exact same fix will probably not work  in your case it's getpickblock throwing a npe rather than returning null causing waila hwyla to throw one

hi   i cleaned the project after i imported the 0 8 4 jars  but the error didn't change at all  same as in my initial description 
same result with 1 1 6 release and 1 2 0 build snapshot  
 philjay sorry for not being more specific with the report  the issue is indeed that the first graph pictured does not start at 0  the reason i believe this is a bug is due to the fact that i am passing  0 0  as a value but it is not showing up in the graph that has large negative components  even setting the last value to a positive number does not fix the issue  is there perhaps some other value i need to set that i'm just not aware of 
i am using the tip of the master branch  which is currently at 18f32f3aebfb29b77655c372ebee248bd9fb04c1 
this is the result 
yes it happens on both android and ios  my code is same with the example  in my case it only can be shared if the url value is string  even i tried the base64 format image from docs  like   react_icon   but still the same
yep  that's all  also for uiscoped by te way 
 clintongormley i am sorry but i couldn't reporoduce it anymore and don't have the stack trace 
my android phone is  8 1 0 and i have tested on genymotion android emulator with android 7 0 but got the same exception   update    your fix worked well on android now   
yep  just the button that doesn't show  but the hotkey isn't as intuitive as the button for modpack users 
 karlzeilhofer cvpipeline has a release method which calls release on any saved mats  this frees up the memory used by the images that are stored as each stage processes  in general  it's not important to be called  because calling process   releases the previous data  but as  cri s pointed out  since bottomvision uses a pipeline per part  it's possible this could use up a lot of memory during a job run  we need to change it to release after bottom vision is done  this is a pretty easy change  so i will probably do it right now   
 minborg standard javadoc does not work with kotlin  80  of code would not be documented

i am using spring boot to run a web application with tomcat  using this block of code    i have found the none string property value    property key server port value 11191 value class class java lang integer     this is the port of tomcat  it looks like a spring boot property but i don't know how does spring boot set this property

yup i did press f5  label still shows up in the label picker dialog 
oh there's a quirk here where  foo is after 2018 10 01t00 00 00 000  means that foo is after 2018 10 01t00 00 00 001 will be generated and that comes back as 2018 10 01

i'll see what i can do  i don't think i have adb installed   le 25 06 2018 08 39  tobias kaminsky a écrit        links          1  https   github com nextcloud android issues 2759#issuecomment 399847417  2  https   github com notifications unsubscribe auth amq1wrh8k0hhayyzmj3ulyi2urvtil2kks5uaiwpgajpzm4u1sky
i made the slave account and admin and that helped after a reboot  so it seems to be a permission issue  i will check if giving the necessary permission without making the user an admin is possible and comment the results here  also the functions succeed when run as a normal user locally   shame that the library cannot tell about missing permissions with a checked exception  this also happens with some linux methods where calling getserialnumber methods return empty string when not run with sudo  i don't know if it would be even possible to detect the missing permissions in these cases 
i've never built this project  or used gradle  before and may not find the time to try it this week  if the fix is mostly harmless  it might be faster to send the pull request 
actually we are able to reproduce this in a small test app 
 moskvin i was not able to reproduce the crash that  librelioniv experienced on 2 different devices   however  here is the scenario    install the app   don't wait for the new covers to be loaded  start downloading wind 355 immediately    downloading the pdf does not start immediately  in my case  it started after about 20 s     the reason seems to be that the app cannot start downloading the pdf before all the covers have been downloaded   a copy of the logcat is at https   gist github com libreliodev 5419804
i've just forced jdk 7   https   github com fcduarte deckard gradle commit 41f524fbb19227df22dd419d3e8e1eddffa1e7b4  same error 
ok  there is it  http   www78 zippyshare com v mtmjsdiv file html
it will be broken functionality for anyone upgrading their phones currently  i don't use the feature myself  but the first thing my wife noticed when i handed her a new pixel was that it wasn't working anymore  she's non tech  so that's the kind of person who needs to be considered 
yes  i do mean all adjacent blocks  but why would the sign also protect the block beneath it   shouldnt it just protect the sign and the block that the sign is on only  and you mean that sign posts protect the block that the post is one  right   sorry  will need to get back to you on the version i use 
 sandroferrari sorry  i mean  point_count    i used the code from  earthquakes js  https   github com mapbox react native mapbox gl blob master example src components earthquakes js    as you can see in the screenshot above its only working with  mapboxgl styleurl light    or all the other mapbox styles  but not with my custom style 
 gigabit101 sorry about delay  mystogrigen gave good information on the version but i think i gave enough to reproduce in whatever version you wanted to try

so openjdk jdk8u172 b11 is one of the jvms i have seen this on  also  it happens for me while running the app in ide  intellij 2018 2  and also while running the spring boot executable jar   it's interesting that it consistently fails for you  the behavior i saw was that it would pick the string overloaded setter most of the time and int overloaded only one once in a while 
yeah it doesnt lag anymore
that looks like the expected behavior  but it's different from what i'm seeing on my device  here's a quick gif     20191010_060110  https   user images githubusercontent com 8658164 66556361 f8bf4200 eb47 11e9 912c 5a46f2862da0 gif   as you can see  the editor switches to light theme  and remains in the light theme when i reopen it  but the note list keeps the dark theme   however  this is a fairly edge case scenario — in other tests where i added content to the new note or performed other actions the whole app switched themes as expected — so this could be a very low priority or wontfix issue unless others are running into it 
 sparkoo i've set it to the address the command kubectl get ingres che plugin registry gives me and that is without  v3 at the end  and i don't think i'm using tls  can i see it anywhere if it is used

hi michael    i don't think lucene 4 x would work here  the error message indicates    this version of lucene only supports indexes created with release 5 0 and later    since this would prevail any further lucene updates after lucene 4 x  if you can write a better unit test  i think this is the best way to go  but with the more work for you  s   christophe

i'm sure  i have widely used app  1 000 000+ downloads  targeting api7+  and use this approach all time  actually you may see some reports from dalvik in logcat that it replaced unknown method by nop  or something like this   only doc that confirmed this to me is "android development" from commonsware  which is a paid book   another approach to avoid massive reflection is to make base export class for lowest api adding some fields to report  then extending the export class for subsequent api level that adds new reported fields  which appeared in that android api  at run time  instantiate actual report class by api version and call its reporting function

regarding 1  perhaps i was using and older java compiler so it complained  all of my stuff is in eclipse helios and previous version of java    regarding data  perhaps you can just  hop over to bobst  and get the larger files and put it on a usb stick  i'm guessing that the data you are using is not really good for testing because it may miss several types of data such as ipo messages  trading halts or limit down limit up cases  it would have been much better for nasdaq to provide a dataset that has all the messages combinations  in it for testing purposes  this would in fact be less than 1k    regarding  3  and  4   ok  if it works then it works  but i thought i should ask    in general most of the mistakes i found in your stuff was by gut feel  i e  "nah    that does not seem right"  it also comes from working with the data from another source which was in character format not binary so i could read the raw data into a text editor   see www tradingphysics com or lobsterdata com for data   both of these sources suffer from the fact they are not using itch 5 0 data and leave out important things such as order imbalance messages  tradingphysics data does not have nanoseconds  it has milliseconds   so when one calculates the difference between the time the order entered to when it was deleted  you get 0 instead of say 500 nanoseconds    in regards to  4   i was passing some argument parameters and the compiler complained about mixing integer and long  so that was purely by accident

hi koral   where should i place giftextview setlayertype view layer_type_software  null    i placed above "return ssb" no work  placed here gifdrawable addanimationlistener new animationlistener      override https   github com override public void onanimationcompleted int loopnumber    log i tag "reseting gif   "   giftextview setlayertype view layer_type_software  null   gifdrawable invalidateself           some  item animated some item does not  they have the same emotion  am i doing something wrong  where is the proper place to put the method   thanks
i was trying to combine a diamond on my tinkers pickaxe on a tool forge and then it started to clone whenever i move my mouse onto a slot and when i placed the pickaxe on the center  it also cloned on other slots in the tool forge  i’m sorry i couldn’t describe it correctly 
this is probably because in my serialization code i am using utf_8_short in case the string length is   15   to be precise  the error is inside the method writeutf8 string value   so the workaround is to  not  use utf_8_short if the string is empty  there needs to be special handling for a length of 0 in writeutf8 
i tried 1 5 6 release and 2 0 0 build snapshot   same behavior 
i've tried to duplicate it  but no luck
 the latest one  http   ic2 player to 8080 job ic2_experimental 739  
good question  actually i am not able to debug anything at all now   even without engaging pydev debugger   red gets hung up on discovering libraries and it always seems to hang up on the builtin library     _2019jun04100100  https   user images githubusercontent com 1178569 58890145 b1173e00 86af 11e9 910e 93273cbf873f png   it appears that the robot debug session terminates 
the problem is that pumps don't recognize it as a valid fluid and won't pump the oil geysers  i tried buildcraft and immersive engineering's pumps 
it is set to true  but if you   alone it take a random player  should i disable that  
as far as i know it concerns henshin to emoflon integration as multiple edge types are called "graph" in henshin  deactivating dec check was necessary for  saschaedwinzander to work with ibex viatra  it won't be urgent until henshin integration relies on any kind of dec check
i will upgrade and let you know
sure  seems like ready https   github com bytedeco javacv pull 871
i am running che as a standalone  not as a docker container  so  is there a work around for this issues at the moment  i am unable to import my existing projects as of now 
i just installed the new plugin and unfortunately it didn't fix the problem  how can i help debug this 
so since the 'save' only save locally see #8 and that the actuall way to send it to the database is not working for me #10   the data is not showing up  here  http   world openfoodfacts org contributor kyzh    i think the issue only occurs on first scan 
this problem were in 1 5 0  just updated to 1 8 0 and there are no problems with scrolling thank you for this amazing library  sincerely
i'm good  thanks   
david  so far i didn't see this problem in simple projects  i will examine the project structure of the projects i've seen in detail tomorrow and will try to distill the relevant settings into a small test project   what struck me as strange here is that obviously infinitest manages to actually run the tests and displays the correct result color in the infinitest bar  the trouble only seems to begin when it tries to propagate the test failure information into the marker view      these projects  and their structures  probably have been touched by dozens of developers over the years and i would not be surprised if they only work by accident   o so i'll try to investigate a bit further on that end   oliver
blu r1+ and android version 6 0 
 danesfeder sdk version is 5 3 1 and the navigation is 0 10 0 and also the navigation ui is 0 10 0 what do you think is wrong    
maybe   let me see if i can get it to hang outside of jenkins and i can hit it w   jstack 
the versiin was the latest at the time of the post  and the map xml is the one on maps oc tc 
i ran "gradle eclipse" before importing the project into eclipse 
no   i think any of the other mods come into a conflict with your mod  but i dont know wich other mod apply this bug  thats why i post it here  maybe we can find the issue 
it keep happen for users that use android 7 and above  here is my guess    updatemanager call the checkupdatetask    checkupdatetask is bound the app activity to hockeyweb server    asynctask in hockeysdk got execute    but when the input stream got close the activity or the firebase instance in the acitivity is not alive anymore    crash happen 
 kasparrosin exactly what  hydrox6 said  it has it's own highlight box  idk what you call it   thought it might just be a simple fix so i reported it  it's not a big deal at all really

 violetagg spring cloud gateway is configured to use different static routes and uses discovery locator  it is also configured to generate custom tags  which has caused no problem as of now  i first found out about this issue in browser  while on a page that uses spring cloud gateway to load different resources  all requests are routed to the same route   i've also been able to reproduce it by doing simultaneous requests to the same url over and over again  unfortunately i haven't been able to reproduce the issue at home and i cannot give you the project on which this happens  but i'll be able to give you some more info tomorrow  i also forgot to mention that spring cloud gateway is running as a docker service and the jvm has been configured to use a maximum of 512m of memory 
 lorthirk today i was not able to reproduce this issue as _  login  _ button freezes after first click  which is ok  so i am closing this issue 
ver me relex circleindicator 1 1 8  i know about the updating issue  so i update pageradapter by setting new adapter  like this     mviewpager setadapter new profileadapter getsupportfragmentmanager    data getresult      mcircleindicator setviewpager mviewpager

i'm trying to follow the instructions on the  get started developing wiki page  https   github com zxing zxing wiki getting started developing#javase    basically i'm running the  command      however  when i do the same for 3 2 1 it fails 
the issue happens after i’ve used the observatory  if i reload a world  inventories and things all work fine until after i use it  walking around the observatory before i use it doesn’t seem to be a problem  i don’t know if it would make a difference  but maybe i could try reloading the chunk it’s in after i use it and see what happens

i've only tested with the default config options   stone axe appears to leave two strip behind but its a "phantom" item that goes away if you try to pick it up  same with stone sword  stone shovel only needs 1 strip and works as intended

 shorea   the resetrequestinputstream method is this      so somehow my inputstream is getting past the check of shouldretry rather than just exiting early 
hmm  just gone off on a bit of an adventure by delving into enableautoconfigurationimportselector and you're right that it wouldn't make a difference as it only exludes the classes specifically registered with spring factories and not their inner  configuration classes  this means the auto configuration classes are a bit of an all or nothing but i guess that's not too much of a problem cos they can be just reimplemented by whatever code is using them as a dependency   anyway  the exception is     because abstractdialect no longer has a no args constructor in version 3   so probably not really fixable

hi guys  is there any alternative link for these tutorials  i am looking for something  where on spring rest api calls  i can run any process or task with data  instead of too much conversion of data 
i will try   ftr our build is currently failing with    our nexus is connected to central so we should have it  and locally i got the warning   not sure what's wrong though  since i can see the pom in https   search maven org remotecontent filepath org jodconverter jodconverter local 4 2 3 jodconverter local 4 2 3 pom
 skabashnyuk thanks for your response  still waiting on checking the issue as i needed to upgrade openshift to 3 11 in order to make use of chectl for deployment  nearly there i think  openshift is upgraded but chectl doesn't seem to want to work  not sure if you have seen this issue before  i am getting    when attempting to run  chectl server start   i have opened a bug report for this issue #14712  i will get back to you with a response as soon as i have been able ot install using the operator 
i found the reason in a thread of an erlang mailing list   _yes  the  timeout 1      applies to the whole subset of tests  in this case the setup and all the tests in it  the individual tests still get their default timeout of 5 seconds  if you reduce the timeout for the whole group to 1 second  then that will of course happen first and abort all the tests in the group  while in the first case it's one of the individual tests that times out first  only when applied to a single test does  timeout t      change the timeout of the test itself _  _i'm sorry that this is confusing  there should probably be a separate way of modifying the default timeout for all individual tests _  http   osdir com ml erlang programming bugs 2012 02 msg00006 html   according to this i had to use test generators  there i can set the timeout individual for every test case   is there another way to set the timeout      in summary  it isn't a problem of the idea erlang plugin  it is only a problem of the limited configuration possibilities of eunit  how could the plugin help to avoid this problem 
 misaochan   yes  sorry for not precising   bluesir9   indeed the bug is reproducible in the mapbox demo app  apparently there is a related bug currently https   github com mapbox mapbox gl native issues 10101 so let's wait until they fix things and then update  since it is not a critical bug 
here is my full pom xml purges from private dependencies  i can't post them here

i don't have a generic client for a generic server  but reproducing it with 1 javascript client is fairly easy    have javascript client connect up as polling  ie 11 should do    after connect use javascript tointerval to emit a message every 10ms   i tried 500ms  250ms  100ms  no luck     10ms does it you get piggy backs quite regularly    i have code handling it in the spot i indicate above and am able to see the piggy backed messages with no issue  and  as you'd expect  it varies    ping piggybacked on emit    2 emits are piggy backed sometimes   emit piggybacked on ping  my piggyback code handles as many piggy backs until end of content  but i'm only seeing  2 msgs per content tops 
so thats the trick with double space   d didn't know that     i use ubunut linux 13 04  so the numlock issue must probably be os related

yeah i'm not sure   i use gradle primarily and found the solution through google      i guess set it to 3 3 and see if it still compiles    peter  on fri  jan 1  2016 at 5 39 am  barthelemy dagenais   notifications github com  wrote    ##   "now  now my good man  this is no time for making enemies "    — voltaire  1694 1778   on his deathbed in response to a priest asking that he renounce satan 
it would seem like this could quite probably be the change   since it has significantly changed the way the container is loaded 
1  the exception is in our code  it's caused by the infinite state we keep  2  yes  it's a custom implementation  it's based on your code  but we implement our custom logic   i'll explain in more detail    we'd like to be 100  certain about the vehicle position  unfortunately barefoot doesn't allow that at the moment  yes you can get the best estimate  but it's often wrong  here's an example  https   www darrinward com lat long  id 5a684e31786528 24392522 i hope what i draw makes sence   s   state vector c   candidate  s 0   c1 5   c2 20   c3 74    most probable  but still wrong  c4 11         after n points  s n    s 0    s 0    c2 40     the only one left  now you know for sure this is the correct position     to get this behaviour we implement our oun logic  we have a wrapper around your kstate  that alows us to peek into your private data  we keep the state untill there is only one candidate left in sequence peekfirst   one    at this point we mark the point as correctly matched and we cut off the state  it worked perfectly with version 0 1 1   but with the new version we get   kstate 3  https   user images githubusercontent com 25247356 35325864 a72aed80 00fd 11e8 9595 4d50d0fa6ec5 png     c3 is still wrong  there are no transitions from this one to the next position  but it's still here because it was the best estimate at s 0   so now our custom logic doesn't work  and we are left with an infinite state  i hope what i said makes sence 
when card scanner disable  not completely   than in marshmallow  ask the camera permission and allow the camera permission than give me error and cash the application  if i deny the permission than work perfectly    than how to handle the permission any idea

in the jenkins ui for a multibranch pipelines  i have 2 options for defining the build logic in the "pipeline" section     1  "pipeline script"   2  "pipeline script from scm"  with "custom script" i meant the first option  keeping the build logic in the jenkins job configuration  and not taking it from the scm   in our case notifications to gitlab work when the script is taken from scm  but do not work when the script is kept in jenkins  i assume it has something to do with gitlab properties variables being set up when the jenkinsfile is fetched from scm  whereas those properties variables are not valid when not doing so   but how can i debug that

sorry for taking so long to answer  i was busy with uni this week   i tried removing some mods and as you say  i can see again the ore and all its uses in jei  the mod causing this is unidict 1 12 2 1 7  it was my fault not to notice this mod unifies several ores into one  thats why i couldn't see any uses for the uranium ore either  so ill just whitelist it  sorry for taking ur time for nothing and thanks for the mod

i decided to do a bit more testing with a more minimal setup to try and see if it was a cross mod interaction   i created a new instance which only had  commoncapabilities 1 12 2 2 4 5 cyclopscore 1 12 2 1 6 0 integrateddynamics 1 12 2 1 1 1 integratedtunnels 1 12 2 1 6 10  i then repeated the above setup but instead of the charged light collector i used a flowerpot with a poppy inside  this resulted in the flower pot being duplicated  so it appears to be entirely this mod causing the bug   i was also able to use a more complex setup to duplicate lapis   on a separate network  1  add an inventory reader to the chest from the above setup  chest 1   and store the variable inventory count  2  have another variable set to an integer with the value 90  3  construct a variable using the "  " operator with the above 2 variables 4  attach a variable store to store the first 2 variables  5  attach an item interface to the chest  chest 1   6  place another chest  chest 2  with an item exporter on it  7  set this item exporter to export 1 item and have it use the variable from the comparison set up before  8  place 63 lapis in the first slot of chest 1  then place a single item  not lapis  in every other slot  9  place a lapis ore block in front of the world block importer   the world block importer then places a lapis in chest 1  which triggers the second network to export 1 lapis to chest 2  and then the cycle repeats  with more and more lapis being produced   the same also works with redstone ore   while i haven't tested every possibility  i believe this results from any block which drops more than 1 item when it breaks  and is easiest to do with blocks which drop 2 different items as then the first slot can be entirely empty

you'r right  we fixed this problem  there is something wrong with plugins  the quality of these plugins is uneven   we found there is bug in  springmvc  plugin  here the infos   plugin   apm springmvc annotation commons   package     org apache skywalking apm plugin spring mvc commons interceptor   class   abstractmethodinterceptor  method   aftermethod  line   104     this statement   contextmanager stopspan     may not execute  then this problem will be be triggered    contextmanager stopspan     is very important  we think the plugin‘s author did not understand the meaning of this sentence   we will send  pull request  soon

well  my idea was to wait for the cobol stuff  to merge this e g  into my branch  i e  definitely not directly in the fesch structorizer desktop master   the master should only contain tested and releasable code  then to scrutinize the resulting version thouroughly  both on your and my branch  and then  after it had undergone and passed the tests  induce a pull request on fesch structorizer desktop master as last and final step  so  what i'd like to recommend you is that you either fork from my master branch or pull the content of my master branch into your fork cloned from fesch master  then we would merge it among our versions until is sufficiently stable and create the eventual pull request for the release  if you think the cobol additions will take significantly more time  however  then i might finish release 3 27 still witthout it and we add the cobol stuff  together with other possible fixes and accomplishments  as a follow up version

i am using  jobmanager  but i have encounter strange behaviour in my application where periodic persisted job which was at first scheduled with interval a 2 minutes  and then rescheduled to interval b 10 minutes  was launching with both intervals  in android job database i have found only one job with matching tag and interval matching b  after that i have called  jobscheduler  directly from debugger and found out that there is second job with same tag but old interval a   but this is beside my point which is  you schedule periodic job on api 21+ with interval a which was supplied by your backend  and job id is high lets say 1000   then user clears data of your app and when he launches app he will get new interval b from server which will be again scheduled  because if i query jobmanager for scheduled jobs i will get empty list   now the app will be launched by jobscheduler for both intervals because jobscheduler jobs are persisted despite the fact that all app data were purged   therefore if i would like to save user battery by switching retrieval of data from backend from once per 2 hours to once per 8 i could end up with even worse result which will be solved only by app uninstall

sorry i thought docker didn't store logs to disk  sergiosagu the docker build in log  you mentioned above  will show the certain amount of recent logs according to the parameter   max size  and  max file   you configure  and stores the log to   var lib docker containers  container id     but the old log will be deleted once the log size reach the capacity   according to log rotation  we should move the old log to somewhere else  like the problem people mentioned here https   github com docker docker issues 8911   igorstoyanov i referred to the document  sergiosagu mentioned above https   github com vmware admiral wiki configuration guide#prerequisites  i notice this in ova with vic  this is our command to start admiral container   besides  i think it makes more sense to search for log file that is under   var admiral  rather than under directory of docker  thats why i suggest using mount   var admiral

ah  i thought the removal of all might have been intended  so i used feature  instead of bug  thank you for the fix though    
same code  but  jooby undertow  instead of  jooby netty   it works  thanks  this is a good enough workaround for me right now

on the solar display  you tap a ship lower right corner and list comes up  you tap a ship to move and it highlights  a second or so later  you lose the highlight and it goes to item at the list bottom usually   sometimes just a different ship   if that bottom item is idle and open to moving  you get caught often moving that ship instead of your choice  not sure if the bug is in the order shuffle of moving vs idle ships  or if its in the highlighter code itself  i assume intent is to have list ordered by moving vs idle etc  basically  i'm having to wait to see if the highlighter moves or not before i actually proceed  thank you for fixing the mis spelled despoit on the ally requests pane  typos etc   drive me bats  hold over from my programming days  another fix  if you could  is the outstanding votes not being scrollable  cannot finish votes if the boss is not early to vote  and others vote  pushing it off screen  some alliance tools would be nice for future   sort shortlists of entries by player  or date time etc   tracking loans vs paid back or yet un repaid   ticktock on last sign on to point up players gone inactive  i favor a 2 month deadline to re log or auto flag for kick  i do screen captures but that stores to me  not in game  stuff like this would help in managing and or proving misconduct  assigning ranks would be nice for the wishlist too  ☺    one thing some of us were kicking around  was a change to the depth of a sitrep tap to just galaxy view re center  and not all the way to solar view  sometimes you want to rename a star etc  backing up just kicks you to sitrep  another idea was a re center options flag at game start so that instead of always opening at homestar  you could center on your current workstar  handy for a galaxy view of the neighborhood  what's your take on shortlisting sitrep combats and new colonies  might make data handling better if you can cut entries out of the main sitrep    cull all but what a player wants to deal with            original message          from  dean harding notifications github com date  11 16 2014  15 06   gmt 06 00  to  codeka wwmmo wwmmo noreply github com cc  hexan1 ebaversjo hotmail com subject  re   wwmmo  move select bug  #39   can you expand on that a bit  when i move ships  it keeps the ships i'm moving highlighted        reply to this email directly or view it on github  https   github com codeka wwmmo issues 39#issuecomment 63239267
just for the record  our workaround was to extend the "ref" and the "on" references to generate a unique id to each listener on the js side and manage the callbacks inside our application  the problem was that every callback function had the same id  so we included a generated hash on the prototype of the function  allowing the firestack to know which listener to detach on the "off" call    
with accurate you mean something like a warmroast  unfortunatly i only have had timings with paper  but these don't show exactly where the problem lies and instead just showed playerupdatetask as cause    maybe i can organize a warmroast next week  but i can't promise it  as i never used it before and it seems at least somewhat complicated to make it run     ps  i do understand that the task is just calling some default minecraft code and is not really at fault  but it would be nonetheless nice to be able to disable it if the features needing it aren't even used   
i think this predates  sealed   but the enumerated type also has the advantage that where you can see the internal type  it covers the external one  so you can get from the  decimal  to the  decimalimpl  without trouble 
 ronblum i actually saw this in firefox 69 0  64 bit   i use firefox on both windows and ios systems  i will try to check the latest rstudio preview for the above issue and let you know 
i tried but my pc cant handle it  the fps are lagging more than the skeleton doing weird stuff   
sorry for the delay response  my maven dependencies      in my gwt module xml      inherits name "gwt material design gwtmaterialwithjquery"      thats all 
nothing appears to trigger it  it is what happens when you spawn an npc and try to get it to find you 
 alexkalderimis human intermine org but i also would like it to work with humanmine org  can you help me fix this today or tomorrow   rachellyne needs to be able to use the results tables to test humanmine this week 
sure  here you go   teamcity server log  https   github com petegoo tcslackbuildnotifier files 2026490 teamcity server log 
use the select for update statement to query a record that does not exist  an exception will occur 
thanks for the tips  i will try to see if it works   maybe you could try to use  android imeoptions  http   developer android com reference android widget textview html#attr_android imeoptions  and listen when the user press on that key on the keyboard   maybe  actiondone   or let the developer choose its own  
still collecting   will post you in the internal channel
a haxe project is created first  next when some characters are typed after html file creation  ide freezes certainly  is an error log needed  which log file should be shown 
you're right  it works for maven 3  but fails for maven 2  we should probably enforce maven 3 in the pom xml somehow  but that is a separate problem   thanks  closing 
im not sure    it just does it all the time    in the beginning it had time periods where it randomly did this for like 5 min then it stopped for a while then it started and so on    but now its all the time    im using something called spigot the latest version 1 6 2
thanks for the hint   grid getdataprovider   refreshitem order   works in both cases 
 jgcmarins  i didn't check the example project  this issue happens in my react native project fyi i am using react native navigation v3 for navigator 
hi   vroyer    thank you for reply   i changed  level for  org elassandra indices class  from info to debug in  logback xml

appears to be fixed  i'll leave this here for a few hours more since i just only switched to the new build 
this is the code i am using    pdfparser parser  file file   new file sdcard "ac123002 pdf"   fileinputstream fin   new fileinputstream file   parser   new pdfparser fin    i am getting exception in this pdfparser constructor
now there is spam in console when tab completing in console  but for players it works fine
i might be able to pull one up tomorrow  i'll let you know  are you looking for an example for an integration test  worst case scenario  we can always publish a project with a signed jar but an unsigned pom    
 tristazero hi i thought the 'sequenceoffset' was designed for the sequence offset ，but i can find anyway to set the variable 'sequenceoffset'   so i just run the vibratesequenceoffset method and found the result was alternate 1 0 1 0   i don't konw why don't you set it to 0 directly 
yes  right  ui is not updated  can i provide any other debug info   2013 12 28 kaikreuzer notifications github com
sorry about that  d396a2e7
yeah we're upgrading to 1 6 to see this solves the problem  our upgrade cycle is slow   i'll let you know 
the tipper suggests to remove the empty constructor of bool  doing that cuases compilation errors  since another constructor exists and the empty constructor is used

you can give a lamp object a wire by right clicking it  this won't cause the block to update if the only wire is another lamp with a wire in it  the two won't connect  it works fine if you feed it wire next to an ordinary cable on the ground because the other cable block updates the lamp but if the other cable is a lamp with a phantom wire  neither will connect

i can't seem to replicate it again  it happened about 3 times so far on accident  but when i go and try to do it the way i did it before  it just works normally with me throwing the sticks or items on the floor  i don't have a crash log that i can find  i checked logs and couldn't find anything about it  maybe i did something before dragging sticks and clicking the buttons that it didn't like  but trying to replicate it not working

yes  i did a full server restart  yes  my luck perms is using h2 database 
unfortunately  i'm not the one with access to the server's files  i'll see if i can find them 
for the client i'm running it on windows 7    mod redis 1 1 4   vertx 2 0 2   jdk1 7 0_9  redis i'm running on centos 6 5  although i get the same issue when running the windows redis port    redis 2 8 17  the client side is a development environment  i found the issue in a unit test    production will all be centos 6 5 with openjdk 1 7  so i will try that when i get a moment and report back
 rwillett my bad again  i've updated the post with the exact version  and i don't know why i can't use res   i can use it to set the icon but it does not work for the sound  i checked the logcat and it is unable to find the file  my sound is kept in    platforms android res raw sound mp3  i also have a copy of the sound in the www folder which i can use with file  but i want to use res   i also dont see an example in the docs where they show how to use a custom sound kept in the res  of android 
thankyou for your response  no the app doesnot crash  yet i am facing a problem where the rtsp link works on my home network but always fails when multiple clients are connected in the same network i e the live stream shows up on the player when in home  my device connected alone  and the stream doesnot show in the university   the link works perfectly on vlc media player irrespective of the network it is in 
hi    starting cryptomator in admin mode  same issue with installers or executables needing escalation of privileges  however  i can perfectly run executable not needing admin escalation   starting cryptomator in user mode  exactly same behaviour  user mode apps can start while executables needing escalation of privileges don't have access to the mounted vault  wired because i am mounting the vault while removing the "  options current_session" param and keeping the other default options  apps started in admin mode do properly have access to the encrypted vault this way  but  the executables in admin mode don't    image of the issue with cryptomator started in admin mode  img width "389" alt "capture admin" src "https   user images githubusercontent com 2428217 74511049 56540880 4f05 11ea 89df 1b4f6d142d66 png" 
sure i can  i'll create a pr soon 
probably that’s the problem    when i attach the debugger to the emulator or phone the bug doesn't appear

it was fine in 6 1  and possibly later  
using settings speed up  what do you mean   could you tell me how to do that 
ok  the title has been modified 
thx for the quick reply   i'm using telekom's magentacloud software to sync my encrypted data to the cloud  magentacloud is essentially a webdav client server system   oviously the    dav   folders containing the    dir   and    pag   files are created by the magentacloud software  a little reasearch on the web suggests that these files contain information related to webdav  i'm not sure wether these files can be deleted safely  imho you're quite right  the upgrade routine should ignore all files and directories not associated to the vault 
yes this issue still exist  my app name is fitpolo i test dfu upgrade with different phone and log the   dfuprogresslisteneradapter    after the dfu started i close the phone's  bluetooth the log is

no it was working perfectly on 0 17 4 and below  it can't be my network fault since i never changed anything i can still watch video with subtitle enabled and download video  just only subtitle i can't download  maybe it's caused by this changes  https   github com teamnewpipe newpipe pull 2957
the issue seems to be in our application  i am closing the issue 
here it is 
i did some more experiments and it seems related to hidden tracks  see the attached project   when 'show hidden tracks' is off  you cannot descend into the drums folder  even though there are unhidden tracks in there  when 'show hidden tracks' is on  it seems to work    folder test bwproject zip  https   github com git moss drivenbymoss files 4014216 folder test bwproject zip 
from the nwbib point it's not urgent as i deployed a more robust way of processing the uris yesterday 
hi  marcalwestf   it is a correction  currently the process generates commission for reverted charges  if the charge is reversed it should not generate commission for this charge since it is a zero charge 
no  i didn't feel the need to pack the textures since they don't do anything to illustrate the problem    as it turns out  this was another of my own mistakes  haha  i was able to solve the issue by advancing the near clip of the camera from 0 1  for some reason  i didn't really try this solution even though i'm pretty sure i knew it already    i thought i recalled seeing this problem in another test of mine that moving the near clip didn't solve  but i might be mistaken  anyway  closed for now   edit  the outcome seems to be that this could be an os specific or graphics card specific problem with libgdx over bdx  which means that there might not be much that we can do about it

hi mark  i can't test it within knime as we can only integrate releases of maven libs at the moment  everything else involves manipulating the eclipse cache which i try to avoid   anyway  i had a look at your code and it make sense  as you set the  randomaccess  to the plane position before you iterate over the image  you could have also just set the offset of the  cursor  with a proper  jump  to the plane position  using  intervalindexer  or so to go from  dimension  to index   anyway  if your test passes now  we can fix this later   make it more efficient     as soon as you released a new version of  scifio  i will double check within knime   thanks  hinerm

that's what i'm thinking  if we use possible semantics elsewhere then why does this model not type check without errors   anyways  if you move both operations from  b  to  a  these classes still don't have  op  in common  see below   but now the model tcs without errors

storing in android contacts is unreliable for some devices  so i'll do that just as informative data for the user  but not for actual use in app  also  integrating with something else like openkeychain would be nice  it could confuse some users but other might benefit from it

 michaelzangl i'm sure i could figure it out  but i haven't done it before  is their anyway you can publish a new release for me  i can donate to you for your time if you have paypal  i really need that fix and im not sure how to compile it myself 
network is fine and based on your response i believe this may happen also when there is no file to review   patch contains 0 file  it happens when you send to review patchset that was already submitted to another branch and what you have done was to merge this changes between branches and sent to gerrit  in that case i believe json is empty or similar 
i reverted the whole commit  but i can test the flags if you want  i have just no idea how they are used and the impact   
 ronblum in the case of the variable extraction that appears to be correct  however  in the case of the function extraction it doesn't appear that a valid call to the newly created function is added  moving the function would result in this code 
yeah  i can take a stab at it

it seems the array is defined that way  but for this particular network interface the assignment of  sll_halen  must have been set "incorrectly" as 20  or correctly as 20  but the array was incorrectly defined to be to small for this particular interface    in any case  they should have been compatible     i do see the exception in issue's title with an error message saying    arr length  8  offset  0  len  20  arr   8 bytes as hex    note that   ifconfig  on the computer with the card emits a warning along the similar lines    infiniband hardware address can be incorrect  please read bugs section in ifconfig 8     and when the address is listed below this warning in  ifconfig  output  the last 12 bytes were all zeros   btw  just to be clear  i'm not saying this is a "bug" of pcap4j  it's more like an incompatible setting of values in  sockaddr_ll  struct that's coming from libpcap   so it would make more sense that this is fixed there  or in the os code structures you linked   but in anycase  safeguarding our code here in pcap4j wouldn't hurt  and would result in a much faster resolution i think

this bug caused two failures in the tests that monitor the rest apis   1  because of the  incorrect  aggregation based on the of the duplicate transaction ids   the resultant response of the  transactions api has less than 1000 entries  the pagination logic breaks as well  this caused the test that checks for 1000 entry response to fail   2  there is a test that makes 2 queries   one without any timestamp constraint and the second with a timestamp    timestamp of first entry returned by the first query    and it expects that the responses for these two api calls are offset by 1 transaction    if the test is run between the successful and duplicate transactions  this test will  fail as well   the screenshot attached showed that the transaction id didn't match  problem#2 above    subsequent testing observed that the check for 1000 entries fails as well 
yes  that can be done and need to handled explicitly in the conf  so was just thinking if this could be made as info as this seems to be important metrics to keep an eye on cluster

hi herve    not to worry  we had a work around using csv files    i have downloaded and updated the new version  but i’m at a client site all day behind firewalls  so i will try to have a look at it tomorrow when i’m back in my normal environment at my office    and thank you so much for your contribution to archi  you truly make a difference for myself and my clients   regards  thomas

issue still seems to be present in my case  it's now more noticeable that warping does initially set the correct facing direction initially but then sets the old facing direction immediately after just like you said  i want to say i really appreciate the time you're taking to update your plugin and respond to others  i know this isnt related to the bug lol  but it is very kind

aegis is the only app that crashes 
hello  vietj  i suspect this happens if the host name  of the client  happens to be an internal network name and not exposed to the outside world  that's a guess based on the use case which seems to have triggered this  it's a bit late in the night for me here  so i haven't had a chance to experiment with it and reproduce this in a more isolated fashion  i'll probably find some time tomorrow evening and see if i can provide an isolated reproducer for this

hi  the validate   api throws an ioexception  so we are forced to catch it  or rethrow   but the problem is when a response different than xml is obtained  we get xml parsing exception which is of type org xml sax saxparseexception  so our catch block will fail when this exception occurs  unless we are catching exception which mostly is not the case   ideally  the api should wrap every exception to ioexception itself with proper cause  detail  explanation and reason set so that the api can be used with confidence without having any side effects  the validationresponse may include methods to provide such additional information   also on a side note the main page for jacabi w3c should mention all the dependencies  only minimal set  to run this validation service properly  the minimal set of jars  aspectjrt 1 8 4 jar httpmime 4 3 jar jcabi log 0 15 1 jar jcabi xml 0 13 jar slf4j api 1 7 5 jar hamcrest core 1 3 jar jcabi aspects 0 20 1 jar jcabi manifests 1 1 jar jersey client 1 18 1 jar slf4j log4j12 1 7 7 jar hamcrest library 1 3 jar jcabi http 1 9 2 jar jcabi matchers 1 3 jar jersey core 1 18 1 jar validation api 1 1 0 final jar httpcore 4 3 jar jcabi immutable 1 3 jar jcabi w3c 2 0 snapshot jar log4j 1 2 17 jar

i tried on my test case and found it working with no problem  following similar test cases in _spoon src test java spoon test path pathtest java_  now i guess this issue might come from minor differences between spoon and gumtree spoon ast diff

i think i've accounted for the cold start  but i made only about a 100 requests in sequence  i might have hit it on a particularly 'cold' day  though  will try again  also google's definition of an active store probably has a lot more 0s on the requests second count   i measured by turning on the http logger that's included in the ruby example and looking at the output for sequential runs   definitely not a well thought out benchmark  but enough to show what's going on

 tinwelint thanks for the response   i will provide the details you asked for as soon as i get in the office   a few things though  the bug you're referring to is a later version of this one that i also reported   i figured they were the same issue  and as far as i can remember   dmontag experienced the same behavior described in this report   cache type none just made the truncated result set consistent instead of fixed after second run   also  i gave neotechnology access to the server with this data on it  along with some reproduction queries steps   so you're more than welcome to jump on the box and play around with it   lastly  i don't know what your schedule looks like  but we're supposed to have a conference call at 10 30am est today  june 18  2013  regarding this bug  so if you're interested and able to it might be good to jump on it  mike linetsky organized engineer chris    either way  i'll collect and post the data you requested   thanks again

hi  paoloantinori    i'm afraid your solution will work only for problem 2  where the pod starts but complains about being unauthorized   for problem 1  it won't work  because the deployment is in progress   it is waiting for the pods to be running   and that won't happen because the pod can't find the secret      without scaling to 0   the deployment will timeout after 10 minutes and the deployment will be marked as failed and openshift will automatically roll out older deployment  so it will roll out the original version of the pod    with scaling to 0 first  it times out again  but because of the scaling  openshift will not roll out the original version automatically  however if you scale it up to 1 again  it will roll out the original version and will ignore the failed deployment    and it will be probably necessary to test this with rollback as well  as currently i always end with server and meta pods in version 2 where all other pods are from version 1  i'm using exit 1 as last step in upgrade_50_replace_template

no it does not  if you connect redstone to a repeater  the first redstone is 15  now  connect a conduit to that redstone and you get 14 out the other side  then remove the redstone and replace it with a conduit  it should go up by one  but it does not    redstone sources set the level at the block next to them  redstone only reduces by one when it is connected to other redstone  the first redstone connection to a redstone source mirrors the level of the source  then the second piece of redstone starts the reduction based on distance    as the redstone conduits are now  it is literally impossible to get a level 15 signal out the other end  and this can mess with many redstone contraptions  even dialing devices for enhanced portals   a single piece of redstone connecting a source and destination does not reduce the redstone level to 14  yet a single piece conduit will 
i think it is probably wrong to generate a "mulitpart form data" content type without the boundary parameter  it should default to something even if user does not provide it 
as expected  this works perfectly   the  class and the select results both have  firstname name   this is the workaround i use to import my data  renaming name to lastname in the orientd database afterwards with        alter property member name name lastname      update member remove name    btw  i wonder why i do have to remove the 'name' field  which is still present in data after the alter property    
yes i select "without site skeleton"  in that case  the categories are synchronized even if i don't check the "include taxonomy" option  i will check that again

 mmacfadden maybe  critical differences  however     this issue does not exist if both elements of linkset are created _either_ inside _or_ outside the transaction    the above test runs through with a linkmap  as in #8632   as well as with a linklist   it seems an issue specific to linkset    this issue is exists for plocal as well as memory dbs   so it would rather be an indirect relationship to the same root cause

with the dev build 328  the game doesn't crash when i use scheme 1 anymore  and the scheme 2 works but i had to replace the id 0 interface for three exporters for each machine set to the corresponding channels  also the interface which was used for item inputs scheme 2  middle column  to the network one storage system  from other networks in this case network 2  has to be set to the same channel as the interface attached to the drawer controller  i supposed this was a fix for https   github com cyclopsmc integratedtunnels issues 163   as for providing the environment where the crash happened   i was playing enigmatica 2 expert 1 64d modpack  i don't understand  do you need a backup of my game world   edit  i did more testing with the dev build and in the scheme 2  only interface with id 1 seem to accpet items from its corresponting item importer  others only work if interfaces and importers are set to id 0 or 1   edit2  there's also this unusual output in the log  i don't know what could this be related to   16 18 25   server thread warn   cyclops core   slotless source to destination movement failed due to inconsistent insertion behaviour by destination in simulation and non simulation  org cyclops integrateddynamics core network ingredientchannelindexed 2562173f  lost  1xic2 resource 4  this can be caused by invalid network setups   16 18 41   server thread warn   cyclops core   slotless source to destination movement failed due to inconsistent insertion behaviour by destination in simulation and non simulation  org cyclops integrateddynamics core network ingredientchannelindexed 31133cea  lost  1xic2 resource 4  this can be caused by invalid network setups   16 18 55   server thread warn   cyclops core   slotless source to destination movement failed due to inconsistent insertion behaviour by destination in simulation and non simulation  org cyclops integrateddynamics core network ingredientchannelindexed 38ea87f9  lost  1xic2 resource 4  this can be caused by invalid network setups   16 19 10   server thread warn   cyclops core   slotless source to destination movement failed due to inconsistent insertion behaviour by destination in simulation and non simulation  org cyclops integrateddynamics core network ingredientchannelindexed 3f6f3a6f  lost  1xic2 resource 4  this can be caused by invalid network setups   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   java lang nullpointerexception  16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at org cyclops commoncapabilities ingredient storage ingredientcomponentstoragewrapperhandleritemstack componentstoragewrappercombined iterator ingredientcomponentstoragewrapperhandleritemstack java 269   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at org cyclops integrateddynamics api network ipositionedaddonsnetworkingredients getrawinstances ipositionedaddonsnetworkingredients java 52   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at org cyclops integrateddynamics core network ingredientobserver observe ingredientobserver java 249   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at org cyclops integrateddynamics core network ingredientobserver lambda observe 1 ingredientobserver java 160   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at java util concurrent threadpoolexecutor runworker unknown source   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at java util concurrent threadpoolexecutor worker run unknown source   16 19 19   pool 8 thread 3  registrationcountry fo   stderr    java lang threadgroup uncaughtexception  1   	at java lang thread run unknown source 
hi  mkulesh  thank you for your quick response and for pointing me to the new firmware  actually  i'm not using the latest firmware and i wasn't even aware that it has been released   my current firmware is  2120 3000 0000 0010 latest firmware released in nov  2019  2140 5000 0000 0011  however  there might be some very serious bugs in the new firmware  see   http   www hifi forum de viewthread 272 6905 html  http   www hifi forum de viewthread 272 6905 html     post no  8 states that onkyo has confirmed the issue    post  no  9 indicates that r n855 is probably also affected even if the initial post refers to another onkyo product   i will have an eye on that issue and once they fixed the bugs in their latest release  i will upgrade my receiver  accordingly  after that  i will share my experiences here  in the meantime  i downgrade your app to 1 2 as i really don't want to brake my r n855 and app version 1 2 was already quite good   close to perfect    
confirmed it is 92b8a88

 sungmatt it's not a spawn effect  it's a really random bug that happens sometimes atm i am getting it kinda consistently on my server if you want to come test it
sure  wilkinsona    that worked prior spring boot  1 3   the  messagechannelmetricwriter  was declared in the  metricrepositoryautoconfiguration   plus the  metricschannel  has been declared there as well   that's why my old answer on so is pretty simple  http   stackoverflow com questions 29627061 subscribe to spring metrics channel   not sure that it was a good idea to declare a channel as an out of the box feature with its own  taskexecutor   so  i don't see reason to reinstate it  from one hand we are already far away from  1 2   from other the doc clarifies what to do http   docs spring io spring boot docs current reference html production ready metrics html#production ready metrics message channel integration    i think  metricexportautoconfigurationtests#defaultexporterwhenmessagechannelavailable    should ensure that  messagechannelmetricwriter  is present in the  metricexporters

i can't replicate this error because this error was happen randomly  and was never happen when on development   that screenshot was from google play console crashes report   i have no idea when what users action lead to this error  until now  the app already installed on 100+ devices and this crash only impacted 3 users 
yes
 eivantsov thanks for your try  i'll retry this within next weekend 
hi harald   the first three tabs are empty  the latter three aren't  i have sended you the individual searchgui output files  the database and the parameter file  the cpsx was too large for wetransfer    thanks for checking it  tim
i'm running  0 0 1057 d1fadda   built at https   asd nautilus jenkins isus emc com jenkins job pravega 37 
i checked again and this problem was corrected  schema tool works correctly 
 sourcenode if you want to take a look at this one  feel free  it should be simple to fix 
it is the bool operator for the class  if you look in the header you will see it has not been defined  in creating an example  i also noticed that the example that comes with softwareserial is also  not a good example since it is also using hardwareserial   go look at the softserialexample code that comes with either 1 0 6 or 1 6 0 ide   this bool issue and example issue exists in both  in that softserialexample ino sketch you will see this code in setup     that line boolean check is using the bool operator from hardwareserial  if you change that to myserial to use the local softwareserial object you will see the problem of the missing bool operator  using the boolean operator on a softwareserial object will not compile since the bool operator in softwareserial is not implemented   it seems to be a poor example for softwareserial to use the hardwareserial class  the example should not need to wait on the usb interface to demonstrate the software serial in this sketch since it is only using softwareserial which doesn't need any usb support  for sure  you shouldn't have to use and drag in all the hardwareserial code to use softwareserial   this also brings up a somewhat unrelated item  and this is that there is no way to determine if a hardwareserial or softwareserial object has been properly initialized   the constructor cannot return a status to return whether the constructor used proper parameters  the real problem is that begin   is a void  begin   really needs to return a status  it should return 0 if the begin   worked and the class is initialized and ready to use  or some non zero error status value indicating the error status  as a result  the sketch cannot tell if the begin   failed   the only reason that i said that this other issue is related to the missing bool operator is because the bool operator could look to see if begin   succeed and return 0 if it didn't rather than always returning true the way it does in hardwareserial  doing this would cause code that is waiting for the interface to be ready tol hang which is very non optimal but without correcting begin   to return a status  the only other way for a sketch to detect the begin   failed is that all its serial output is either garbage or dropped on the floor  this is what happens when say an invalid pin # is used in softwareserial or invalid unsupported baud rates were chosen   the real solution is to change begin   to return a non zero status when the begin   fails  however  that discussion is outside the scope of this softwareserial bool issue 
 ntherning not sure if the message was directed at me or  ashleyj there  but i don't really know why the bug is happening  if the problem is that we're trying to add everything on the classpath to the  classes1 jar   and that includes itself  you can take a look at the classpath and include only the files you're seeing right now i guess  or take a look at the files and their sizes  and if any of them changes while creating the jar  bail out   as an example  doing  zip test zip    r  doesn't show that behavior  so there are definitely things that can be done   if the issue is some other thing  then i don't know  smile    as i said  i don't think it's very concerning if this is the only case in which you get that behavior 
i still have the same issue
