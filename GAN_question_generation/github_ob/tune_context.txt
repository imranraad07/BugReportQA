existing bugs or newly introduced bugs affecting the rendered will tend to negatively affect its visual output  from small artifacts to issues affecting the whole picture  i e  a blank screen an important aspect of debugging these issues is to isolate and identify the rendering node that introduces the problem the current system has a number of shortcomings however     it is hardcoded and does not take advantage of the new  node based  extensible architecture of the renderer  a number of nodes may write to the same fbo but the current system visualizes the content of the fbo only at the end of the frame  ideally we'd want to be able to inspect the contribution of each node separately    the contribution of a node might be subtle a facility to highlight a node's contribution  i e  overimposing a semi transparent color on it  would be beneficial   the current system visualizes the color attachments of the various fbos but does not allow inspection of other important attachments  for example depth and stencil buffers    the current system displays the content of an attachment and only that  there is no label allowing the user to uniquely identify the attachment on display nor additional metadata such as attachment type  size in pixels  size in memory and any other useful information

findbugs memory leak when same jvm is usedwe have noticed that the static analysis tool is consuming a lot of memory when executed on a multi module build  as the openhab build    https   github com openhab static code analysis issues 15  if we should disable the fork option  which spawns a separate java process for each execution of the findbugs plugin   but this doesn't seem to be the best option now the memory seems to be consumed by 100 000 classes that are being loaded  the lower left window  i have customized the build and excluding the findbugs maven plugin the problem disappears i have experimented again with a fork set to true and the results are good  non heap memory usage is stable around 200 mb and 20 000 classes are loaded   the separate process consumes around 300 mb before dying      i think the best option will be to use a separate thread for findbugs  but this change could directly affect the openhab build

i have my mouse settings currently set to scroll 3 lines at a time  but changing this setting has no effect on how fast i can scroll in the console zooming in or out on rstudio  from the view dropdown menu  does not change this  but changing the font size does when i lower the font size  it scrolls more lines  and if i increase the font size it scrolls far fewer lines it scrolls 3 4 lines at a time  like i would expect  but this does not change when i change my system settings  so it seems to be some fixed setting there as well the other issue is that when in the view window  viewing a dataframe or table  the horizontal scroll bar is very thin  almost invisible i should also note that when i connect my lower resolution wireless display  1366x768  and drag the rstudio window over to it  the problems are not present while it is on that screen

smeltery output exceeds input when daisy chaining casting tables and basins    when daisy chaining casting tables  a player obtains more material than input into the smelter originally what appears to be happening is when the ingot is pulled out of the casting table by the hopper  it updates the drain  which is powered by the redstone block since the ingot has already been pulled from the table  but the casting begins before the value has been updated  it duplicates the ingot when using an ingot cast in one table  and a nugget cast below  a player will receive an extra nugget i believe the issue should be able to be fixed without affecting the way the drains update  which has been useful for automating the smelter using vanilla mechanics

after migrating from pex to luckperms  all luckperms commands do not work with usernames i know its better to use uuid anyways  but not all plugins have uuid placeholders  such as ezprestige  or other ranking plugins  it is very strange  though  because the plugin seems like it has all the info it needs if i run the command via uuid it even outputs the correct username i  voidangel  have logged on to the server multiple times after migrating  so i should be in the luckperms cache  but it seems i am not somehow 1  restarting the server 2  being online while running the command 3 turning on "use server uuid cache" does work in a sense  but the _luckperms cache still does not update_ d  i'm worried about too many requests to mojang by leaving it on

  we have found a common issue  pravega performs much worse and exhibits higher instability when _clients write as fast as possible  unthrottled   when the client is throttled to 30mbps  the system is stable and the ingest rate of pravega   segment store write throughput   and the writes to tier 2 are balanced however  at the same time  the write rate to tier 2 drops dramatically up to 10mbps one possibility is that  when unthrottled clients write data to the segment store  tier 1 components consume most of the resources  e g   cpu  and make the storage writer to starve  thus reducing the throughput of writes to tier 2  i e   throttling clients may give opportunities to the storage writer to get sufficient resources to keep balance

 paperui  ui does not refresh channel types   my binding creates channel types during runtime  after initialize   finishes  but before thing status goes to online  based on the information it obtains from the remote device  which takes some time  this causes issues with paperui on the first creation of a thing  binding builds channel types and channels in runtime as stated above  and ui shows the channels correctly as they appear  but it does not allow to add new items for the channels when i click + to add an item to a channel  there is a js exception  because it can't find the channel type in  scope i tried to put breakpoints on where channel types are populated and it never gets updated in runtime  only when thing configuration is changed it is also possible to force channel type reading  when i go to a page that needs explicitly this information so  if i just click on "items" menu and then go back to the thing channels  i will be able to create new items for the channels  because  scope will contain correct channel types when i looked into paperui source code  the channel types are updated once in viewthingcontroller

i'm not sure which action did it  but either picking up a sorting chest with a mekanism cardboard box and placing it or placing some witchery items in a sorting chest seems to break all future sorting chests forever restarting server does not fix the issue previously placed chests are not affected  but any sorting chests placed in the future will not sort correctly and will display unpredictable behavior as chest functionality is broken on both my server and client  i am unable to try and ascertain which precise action caused the issue creating a new world does not restore normal function

obfuscator breaks jars without processors  bad asm  bug report i was testing the obfuscator with some jars and it was breaking some of the classes without any processors on whatsoever the jars would not play nice with other obfuscators or decompilers  because they were broke i not only disabled all processors  but i completely removed them from the code  i applied function isobfuscatorenabledforclass node        return false    and everything  and it is still breaking jars i found that kilo best represents this bug  so here is a compiled version for you to test out try to obfuscate on top of jobf with something like radon or another obfuscator and you'll get multiple errors about failing to read write classes  errors that weren't there on the unobf version this only happens when jars are obfed with jobf  and since no processors are applied  i would assume it's a bug in your reading writing part of the obfuscator it told me warning  could not load net minecraft command common commandreplaceitem class

if you configure the   watches  index to have a certain primary replica configuration  the distributed execution of the watches only happens on one shard copy the explanation for this requires to understand how watcher decides if a watch should be executed on a replica or on the primary shard if we now have the same number of copies plus the primary shard than the number of primary shards  we use the same hashing function to find out where a watch should be executed we cannot tell which shard  primary or replica  will be used for execution  as we use the allocation ids to find out the order   but it is only going to be one in this particular case in order to remain bwc we could check if all nodes in the clsuter have surpassed a certain version and only then use the new logic

the "inherit1" partial is not rendering the "inline partial defined by inherit1  called from base" content  which was defined in the partial block  if needed i can commit a change to the test that better describes the expected result  i believe it will fail though  i am assuming that this is because the fix requires to call     partial block   in order to render the inner content of an inherited partial block  but this does not solve my problem since it requires to go over all templates that are being inherited and add     partial block   to them this is not so applicable since not all inheriting templates actually define a partial block when calling the base template  so you get a " template  does not provide a  partial block" exception to my understanding the functionality that i am describing  inline partials remaining in the partial block context  is meant to be supported for without the need to call     partial block    as described in the second example of inline partials here  "each inline partial is available to the current block and all children  including execution of other partials   "  this will be really helpful as my application heavily reuses templates and to workaround this issue i need do define empty inline partials in order to "reset" the ones that were defined by a sibling template

assuming there are two junit test classes and assuming there is a synthetic bean created and used in both  then if the synthetic bean can differ on a test to test basis  the classloader will retain the class information possibly leading to test failures this only happens if you execute all tests at once  separetely  they would pass  and with   reuseforks   set to  true   which is default  however  it always links to a parent cl that stays the same throughout the test suite execution i think we want to consider synthetic beans as application classes  but for that we'd need to also consider all of their possible subclasses and or proxies as app classes i am not quite sure how to do it yet  but i wanted to write it downso we don't forget it

in step mode  the player buttons as well as the call stack button aren't properly handled     the call stack button stays disabled though it should turn active after a step is done   once the call stack button is active  after having started with the play button and then paused via pause button or breakpoint  is not set disabled during subsequent step execution  obvious with noticeable delay    step and play buttons remain active during step execution  this is verifiable with extreme delay  pause button remains inactive  well  this is redundant because the execution will be paused after the step  anayway  and though it might be nice to enable it during step execution in order to avoid user panic on huge delay  this is not recommended due to the toggling effect of the pause button   pressing it during step execution would induce the opposite effect  the step mode would turn into a run mode

the library successfully shows 10am as an hourly option  as it should  so we can get to 10 30am   but selecting 10am as the hour when the preview reads xx 00am fails to go to 10 30am if the preview reads xx 30am  i can select 10am and it will lead to 10 30 basically  if i try to select hour 10  and the minutes is not already at 30  the library selects hour 9 and sets the minutes to 30  instead of selecting hour 10 and minutes 30

datatable unordereddiff is not symmetric and does not take row count into account        naming your issue  please prefix your issue with the name of the sub project       if a section  doesn't seem to fit  just skip it in general  please provide as much information as you can to help us solving your problem      ## summary   datatable unordereddiff  semantics are ill defined and arguable wrong  ## expected behavior  i e  given the current name  i'd expect it to throw if one datatable has 10 equal records and the other datatable has 1 record  also equal to those 10 records     if you're describing a bug  tell us what should happen           if you're suggesting a change improvement  tell us how it should work       then   then if that helps  but please add some plain language context too      ## current behaviorspecifically  for  a unordereddiff b    if b has more equal records than a  it throws  but if a has more records than b  it passes if describing a bug  tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior       if suggesting a change improvement  explain the difference from current behavior            if you have got some output place it in the code block below     not obligatory  but suggest a fix reason for the bug        i may come up with something later  but i think at least someone ought to decide on what the semantics should be  and then the method can be fixed to stick to those semantics i think making it a symmetric multiset difference reduces surprises the most  given the name  but obviously that makes it stricter than the current behavior  so it would be a breaking change
